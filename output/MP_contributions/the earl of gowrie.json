["<cs> my lords it does of course take a cross-bencher with the experience and knowledge of the noble lord lord roberthall to pull a real party political squib out of the bag to hurl at the noble lord

noble lords should express as they have done a great concern at the prospect of shortage of oil supplies both now and in the immediate future <e> <s> i think that many of the remarks of concern and

mind but it seems to me that we have had rather a long debate and i have already been on my feet for minutes <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the ironies of this approach and it is not unique to the noble lord i have read many arguments going down the same road is that it was pressure on the heath government about the levels of unemployment which were then some half of what they are now that caused a set of expansionist policies which many people blame if not for all at least for a considerable part of the inflation we suffer <e> <s> i do not say whether they are right or wrong in laying the blame on the then chancellor for the inflationary consequences of that expansion but the expansion was specifically directed to cure unemployment <e> <s> i think what we are now arguing is that the consensus about demand management of that kind has broken down and that almost all governments they do not have to be violent monetarists are agreed that it is not the way that it can be done <e> <s> it certainly was widely felt by members of <e>", "<cs> my lords i think everyone would be sympathetic with the degree of antipathy which threats involving the health service arouse in the general public <e> <s> i am not sure whether i would go quite so far as the noble baroness in using the word treason <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords assumptions are too wide of the mark to be worth replying to <e>", "<cs> my lords the advisory committee on asbestos has now submitted its final report to the health and safety commission and ministers closely concerned and the text has been sent for printing <e>", "<cs> my lords i will see that the noble lords point is drawn to the attention of the ministers concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no idea of the level of asbestos in the general atmosphere <e> <s> the government intend to continue the work of the factory inspectorate in the short-term and to study this report very carefully for the longer term <e>", "<cs> my lords your

lordships equal pleasure to hear a statement on aircraft safety from a fully qualified air pilot such is my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i am always happy to take lessons from the noble lord

an upward note <e> <s> we enjoyed the last part of it <e> <s> he started on what i would call the politics of competitive moral indignation <e> <s> whatever that does it certainly does not employ very many people <e> <s> the real difference between us is not at the level of caring or anxiety about a number of issues in our economy of which unemployment is very much to the fore <e> <s> the difference between us is that the noble lord feels that doing something about <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his rather controversial expressions of gratitude nevertheless the

would be more appropriate <e> <s> nevertheless i agree with the noble lord that it is obviously true that some of the best and the most profitable sites were exploited first <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not accept the rather bearish expectations of the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords it is exactly for that reason that we are reviewing the whole programme <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards my noble friends first point my information is that the company concerned has not yet submitted an account of its <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but i hardly think that that is the fault of the present government <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend can of course speak for himself but he made no such suggestion as i understood it <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are currently undertaking a complete review of the activities of the british national oil corporation including its advisory role <e> <s> it would be wrong for me to speculate on the outcome of this review <e>", "<cs> my lords we are sharply aware of that contradiction and that is one of the reasons why my right honourable friend is undertaking the review <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will have noticed that there is a motion down in the name of the noble lord lord strabolgi to debate the bnoc among other matters next week and i shall be replying to that point then <e>", "<cs> my lords there are many assumptions in the noble lords supplementary question with which the government do not agree <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a little wide of the original question but it is certainly true that the government have every confidence in the department of energy in acting as an adviser to it on these affairs <e>", "<cs> my lords i am watching the blushing faces of noble lords opposite <e>", "<cs> my lords i never said that i was not going to take expert advice from bnoc <e>", "<cs> my lords during the little clash between the cross <e>", "<cs> my lords the government will take advice from all quarters both expert and inexpert including the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have been taking advice on this subject for the last nine minutes <e>", "<cs> my lords that is another question <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a loaded question <e>", "<cs> my lords at the end of may there were seven mobile rigs engaged in exploration drilling <e> <s> the corresponding figures for may and are nine and respectively <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to my noble friend if i have given him an unsatisfactory answer but in fact strictly speaking the wildcat well is an exploration well in a new area which has not previously been drilled <e> <s> i thought that my noble friend was extending his interpretation of the word a little wildly to exploration wells generally <e>", "<cs> my lords i see no sign of complacency on this bench about this situation <e> <s> pending the outcome of the ultimate review this is exactly why we have already made substantial changes in policy so that exploration may be increased <e>", "<cs> my lords contest the last part of the question <e> <s> it is true that the cherries lowest down on the bough if i may put it that way are the easiest ones to pick and that the most obvious prospects in licensed territory are drilled first <e> <s> the success ratios for the number of areas of the united kingdom continntal shelf are still very high and overall success ratios remain above the worldwide average <e> <s> that is exactly why we wish to encourage more activity of the kind suggested in the supplementary question asked by my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords it should be clear from my answers that we are not satisfied with the policy that we inherited and that is why we are engaged in reviewing it <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have already said everything should be done to encourage increased exploration <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously the government any government have a great interest in the high yield of oil because that gives a high yield in taxation <e>", "<cs> my lords i always follow the guidance of my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware that there have been criticisms of the role and the often contradictory role of bnoc as it was set up but i am not aware that it has in any way abused that role <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are well aware of that <e>", "<cs> my lords we would all wish to pay tribute to the work of the noble lord in helping to set up the wages councils <e> <s> my information about their current levels of activity if that is what he wants to know is that home <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly stand by my earlier remarks <e> <s> i am not quite sure whether the noble lord is trying to elicit information or is trying to make a point on a difference of interpretation in economic strategy <e> <s> i refer him to remarks which i quoted in both my speeches made by the right honourable gentlemen mr joel barnett and mr healey which seemed to be making the exact point that i was myself trying to make <e>", "<cs> my lords i am feeling slightly like the tennis net between my noble friend and the noble lord lord hatch of lusby <e> <s> however i do not think this is quite the proper time to go into the issues of the debate though i would certainly agree with my noble friend that one must look on budget strategy as having a slightly longer-term effect than three weeks <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord but i must of course in all politeness answer the questions that i am asked <e>", "<cs> my lords employment in the public sector will not increase at the rate that it has previously been increasing <e> <s> i quite agree with that <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords empiricism is always a breath of fresh air <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord strabolgi for initiating this debate <e> <s> i must also congratulate him on the brief cogent and trenchant way in which he put <e>", "<cs> my lords i never said anything of the kind <e>", "<cs> my lords no one has said this at all <e>", "<cs> long term <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not say nonsense i said long term <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> before he leaves that point will he not recognise though that a stronger pound which of course has attendant problems for manufacturing industry may lower inflation

collective responsibility just yet <e> <s> i am not a betting man so i cannot say what the prospects are <e> <s> but with the prospects that my noble friend mentioned in mind we are trying to gather data in the northern rockall trough with a view to drilling a research test hole in <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure my noble friend that my right honourable friend has strategic considerations in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i rather agree with my noble friend <e> <s> but the fact is that we have a surplus in gas stocks at the moment so i think it would be quite wrong in those circumstances to take any immediate steps to interfere with the price <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be impossible for the british not to have a presence in the north sea <e> <s> the first part of the noble lords question is a matter that is being reviewed by my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer <e>", "<cs> my lords it would indeed be profligate if that were true but my information is that it is not <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord asking for information or making a political point <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for allowing me to draw attention to my earlier point again that we are in surplus on gas stocks <e> <s> on the point about flaring my right honourable friend the secretary of state for energy announced on th july a new study of a major gas gathering scheme in the northern basin <e> <s> it would further our objectives of maximising hydrocarbon recovery from present and future fields and maximising the quantities of gas available to the united kingdom <e> <s> so that we are in considerable agreement with the noble lord <e> <s> unfortunately what he is suggesting is very expensive <e>", "<cs> really <e>", "<cs> my lords in spite of what the noble lord lord melchett said about the fact that one might have wearied after winding up i think three or four and opening two economic debates within the last few weeks i can disabuse him of any weariness on my part as i have enjoyed them all and this one not least <e> <s> i think perhaps one of the differences between the noble lord lord melchett and myself is that i tend to come to your lordships house prepared to give the governments views and opinions but also to learn and i am not sure whether the noble lord lord melchett really took in the major lesson of the debate which is the limitation of government what they can do apart from creating a climate which people will then take up for themselves <e> <s> this is a definite and clear difference in policy and in attitude and even in ideology between my right honourable and my noble friends and some although not by any means all of the right honourable gentlemen in another place and the noble lords opposite <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has been right in his life and he has been wrong in his life <e> <s> we always listen to him and i will look at that point and see what officials think about it and what my right honourable friend the chancellor thinks about it <e> <s> the noble lord has been quite clear he has a strategy for the economy which would involve probably withdrawing from europe and probably the imposition of import controls <e> <s> as i am one of the few conservatives who have publicly aired the debate about import controls admittedly when in opposition and another was my noble friend lord harlech i may not be on the side of the angels as far as the noble lord is concerned but i have at least an open mind <e>", "<cs> my lords we are doing so <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are aware of this problem and if my noble friend will do me the kindness of consulting my speech in the energy debate of the noble lord lord strabolgi he will see that we are anxious to keep up the momentum <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are certainly aware that oil is an asset which is increasing in value year by year <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the cockle-finders on cardigan bay are aware of the immense amount of consultations and procedures that go on over the sixth round <e>", "<cs> my lords it is to this end that we are looking at energy questions as a whole not neglecting as i pointed out to the house yesterday issues connected with gas and of course the importance of the coal industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree that one needs incentives in order to explore the seabed so as to find out what assets one has <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will give me notice i will try to answer that question <e>", "<cs> my lords the conditional award of blocks was announced by the previous administration on th march <e> <s> none of these awards has yet been confirmed but good progress is being made in the negotiations to settle the joint operating agreement and work programmes <e>", "<cs> my lords the joint operating agreements are being negotiated on the basis of guidelines published by the previous administration but with one significant exception and i think that this answers my noble friends point <e> <s> the stipulation that the bnoc should have the first option on any proposed assignment of interest is now to be omitted from the agreements in accordance with the change in assignment policy announced by my right honourable friend on th june <e>", "<cs> my lords i can neither confirm nor deny that <e>", "<cs> my lords our preliminary estimate is that about million tonnes of north sea oil was exported in may amounting to about per cent <e> <s> of our disposal that is oil sent to refineries as against total production <e> <s> the exact value of these exports is not yet available but the department of energy estimates they were worth about million dollars <e>", "<cs> my lords i am all for flexibility but as i always have to say at the moment these things are a matter for review <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that the second part of the supplementary was a question but certainly as world prices have increased we are getting very good value for our superior grade of north sea oil <e> <s> the differential value between imports and exports is now standing at a little over p a barrel <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a pleasure to agree from this box with my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not agree with the noble lord <e> <s> this country has a very strong interest in the flexibility of the distillation processes and that is why we keep a close eye on them <e>", "<cs> my lords i was undertaking a personal and interior wager as to whether bnoc would come into this question <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that the noble lord was asking for information <e> <s> he was stating a point of view about the british national oil corporation <e>", "<cs> no not at present my lords <e> <s> however the moment that i am in such a position i shall of course honour my obligations to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i have been very concerned not to weary the house with the answer that i always have to give when the bnoc is raised namely that this matter is under review <e> <s> it is under review and the moment that review is completed it will be my job and my honour to let the house know what has been decided <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that there are at present many nations throughout the world who would prefer that oil transactions took place in sterling rather than dollars <e> <s> nevertheless the dollar is as it were the trade currency in the oil business <e>", "<cs> my lords the operators estimate of recoverable reserves from the forties field are given in the report to parliament by the secretary of state for energy commonly known as the brown book <e> <s> i have recently placed a copy in the library of the house <e> <s> taking production from the field to the end of may into account the recoverable reserve remaining is estimated at million tonnes <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly take note of the point which the noble lord has in mind <e> <s> however as my right honourable friend the chancellor said at the time of his budget pronouncement it would of course be for him to make the decision when any sales were made and i am sure that he would be very sensitive as regards the timing of any decision that he made <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that my noble friend is right but i really need notice of the matter and might have to give confirmation after doing some research <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly endorse the sentiments contained in the last part of the noble lords supplementary <e> <s> we are of course conscious that people have bought houses and that any dispersals or views of dispersals must be done with a view to continuity and seeing that people are not disrupted in their work <e> <s> that is why we have engaged in discussions with the staff unions <e> <s> the noble lord asked me for a fairly early answer <e> <s> i am conscious that i have had to give rather stonewall answers in this house recently but there is not much left of the parliamentary session and i say that we are committed to making a decision before the recess <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure if i really agree with that <e> <s> obviously the staged approval system has been of great interest and concern to those who helped to finance the developments but discussions between my right honourable friends department and licensees and the licensees bankers suggest that there is no impact on the availability of funds for offshore developments <e> <s> noble lords familiar with these matters will i think have appreciated that staged approvals extend well beyond the points in time at which the lenders expect to have been repaid <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend but i think in fact we have terms that make it attractive where the staged approvals are concerned <e> <s> certainly i have no evidence and i would welcome any from noble lords if they care to write to me that any proposals to develop oilfields have foundered on this account <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot confirm to the noble lord lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i think there is no evidence that the government are relinquishing any control of this kind whatsoever <e>", "<cs> my lords the latter part of my noble friends supplementary is certainly of great interest <e> <s> it has not of course passed the government by because the government too may have an interest in the accumulation of reserves at a time of rapidly rising prices <e>", "<cs> i think it is balanced by what i said my lords of course the costs of profit and return rise also at the same time <e>", "<cs> my lords if your lordships have a weakness it is that the house is occasionally i think prone to self-congratulation <e> <s> we all tell each other how good the debates have been and how excellent individual speeches have been <e> <s> but if i offer congratulations this evening with that warning i think that i may be allowed to do so because i am one of the very few members of your lordships house who is

noble earl lord halsbury the noble lord lord bowden the noble earl lord lauderdale <e>", "<cs> not this evening my lords <e> <s> the extent to which solar energy may be used cost-effectively in the

therefore the noble lord will be patient his turn will come although whether he will he happy when it does i cannot say <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not in any disagreement with the philosophy as expressed by my noble friend but the government do not consider that the present fiscal package is acting as a disincentive to new explorational development <e> <s> higher oil prices should stimulate exploration for new reserves and the north sea fiscal rgime already contains features to assist the exploration of marginal fields <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord strabolgi is always asking me to confirm matters which are still under review <e> <s> i will confirm them to him the moment i am able to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i see no connection between high levels of profitability and national disadvantage <e>", "<cs> my lords i will take into account what my noble friend says as we make our review <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord is well aware oil is an international affair and we gain considerably by our position internationally <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the ring fence was created in conditions different from those which obtained during the early rounds of explorations <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend i have absolutely no intention of doing so <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not yet moved the orders <e> <s> at this stage i am commending them to the house <e> <s> i shall move them at the end of the debate if the house gives me leave <e>", "<cs> my lords that is not my understanding but i am of course very ready to be corrected by the noble lord lord paget of northampton and by the house at large <e> <s> as i understood it i had leave from your lordships to commend these orders in the form of a general debate on them at the conclusion of which debate i would move them formally and we would take a view on them <e> <s> if i did not have that permission i apologise <e> <s> however i was under the clear impression that your lordships had given me that permission <e>", "<cs> my lords in that case i beg leave to move the first order standing in my name <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord be kind enough to give way

of them <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a fairly considerable debate on these orders and if your lordships will give me leave it is now time for me to make a few short remarks in winding up <e> <s> we may then have to proceed to take a view about these matters <e> <s> i thought as i listened to the eloquence and indeed the passion of the noble lord lord wedderburn of charlton that his lordship did protest too much <e> <s> and looking for motives here i am aware that he is if not the only begetter at least a principal architect in the labour legislation of the last administration <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is much too modest and i am sure that the house will pay attention to what he has said <e> <s> but that is not the opinion of most of those on his own side who were concerned with the legislation <e> <s> they paid tribute i think publicly on many occasions to the work he had done <e> <s> maybe they were wrong in so doing but nevertheless that is all of course that i have to go on <e>", "<cs> my lords i am saying neither <e> <s> we are presented with a large body of labour law <e> <s> as we said in opposition our aim is to try to get industrial legislation out altogether of the argy-bargy of party political debate <e> <s> to do that means that we are looking for modest ways of amending of what we and many other people find to be the greatest enormities in the legislation passed at that time <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i have given way quite enough today and we must now proceed to taking a view <e> <s> i was impressed by the doleful litany that the noble lord lord spens outlined to us of the legislation burdening the smaller businessman the noble baroness lady seear made the same point <e> <s> i would point out to the noble lord lord wedderburn

lords i made it perfectly clear in my opening statement that we are reviewing all the workings of this legislation <e> <s> i now beg to move the first order standing in my name on the order paper

the spokesman for the liberal party if i may <e> <s> i think the noble lord lord strabolgi was a little extreme in making a political point about the manifesto <e> <s> the manifesto only committed the government to submitting bnoc to a very searching review and that we have done <e> <s> we also felt and we still feel and that is the motive behind these actions that it must have a much more limited role than it has had so far <e>", "<cs> my lords if noble lords will look at the fiscal regime in the north sea if they will look at the licensing arrangements if they will look at the present continuing but more limited role of bnoc itself i think they will find that the government have more than enough powers at their disposal to obtain all the information they need <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may answer that if i may say so to the noble lord rather unworthy intervention <e> <s> i think we have to excuse him on the grounds that we have just heard the growls of the tigress protecting her young <e> <s> we know that the noble lord had a very distinguished part in the setting up of the bnoc <e> <s> i think he is much too extreme because the participation option retention is surely the important thing <e> <s> i would refer him back to the answer which i gave to his noble friend lord strabolgi that we believe with great respect that the noble lord is confusing issues of government steps to ensure supply with the revenue take <e> <s> there is no evidence whatsoever that the government have lost any control over our benefits from north sea oil by this step <e> <s> what they have done is to remove a great deal of uncertainty and ambiguity from the exploration and development of the continental shelf <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may respond to those interventions i think noble lords perhaps came prepared for a statement abolishing the british national oil corporation or selling it to exxon or whatever <e> <s> i have never heard such a chorus of anxiety over such a relatively modest adjustment <e> <s> i am delighted to pay tribute to the work of the british national oil corporation and its chairman <e> <s> i am not sure that a parliamentary statement about structure is the right place to formalise a tribute but if noble lords would like tributes i am delighted to pay them <e> <s> the bnoc is <e>", "<cs> my lords as my original answer suggested we anticipate that it is possible that there may be local supply difficulties but i am able to arrange with officials in the department of energy to contact oil companies wherever these shortfalls on delivery occur and we will try to fill the gap as quickly as we can <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a generally regrettable fact that none of us whatever section of the community we come from as the noble lord well knows can escape the consequences of the price rises in energy all over the world <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give that undertaking because i think in fact the government laid an order in the house of commons yesterday to that effect <e>", "<cs> yes my lords and that is why the department of energy has powers to go to the oil companies where it is necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords the introduction of double summer time and the extension of summer time to save energy have frequently been advocated in recent years <e> <s> studies of such proposals indicate that little net saving of energy would result and her majestys government do not consider that this would be sufficient to offset the disadvantages <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend and i are at one on the importance of raising productivity and saving energy <e> <s> nevertheless he might also share with me a feeling that government legislation or imposed changes on peoples habits are not necessarily always the most efficient way of doing things <e> <s> we have calculated that the most that could conceivably be saved on the energy front would be about tons of heavy fuel oil which is relatively speaking insignificant <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to accept the authoritative views of my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments general policy wherever possible is to leave summer to the good lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do adjourn during pleasure for minutes while i try to see what has detained my noble friend lord elton <e>", "<cs> my lords it might be for

certain the usual channels will be able to arrange <e> <s> i would say to both the noble lord on the opposition bench and to the noble baroness on the liberal bench that we must be a little discriminating in talking about cuts when the governments whole strategy is really to try to stabilise public expenditure next year as well as this year <e> <s> that i should have thought would be a laudable and indeed even an adventurous prospect and one which is highly overdue <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble baroness is experiencing a very understandable confusion under-stantable if i may say so because that was the very question that i asked when i was being briefed on this issue <e> <s> the point about the survey prices is that one has to have a price figure in order to calculate

government instituted and which we are continuing comes into play those figures will of course be translated allowing for inflation <e> <s> as was said in the original statement by my right honourable friend the chief secretary which i repeated the figures relating to the local authorities will be published very shortly and other figures will be published before the next budget <e>", "<cs> my lords the very nature of expenditure white papers is such that almost any issue may be raised and that is why some of those points might be better taken up in a later debate <e> <s> as i have said we shall have an opportunity to debate this matter next week <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are of course all the time monitoring what local authorities do <e> <s> that was true of the last government and it is certainly true of this government <e> <s> i think that the point is partly taken up by the answer i gave to the noble baroness lady seear about the operation of the unitary grant system <e> <s> however i can assure the noble lord that the whole thrust of the governments policy in reducing or containing public expenditure is to concentrate aid on where it is most needed and we have absolutely no intention of departing from that principle <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the point of the noble lord lord leatherland it is i think conventional under all governments that information about the rate support grant is available to local authorities in november and we are not changing that position at all <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure my noble friend that no political considerations will come into the provision of safety in the event of a <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will be so kind as to study my last answer he will realise that i have in fact said that the government do have such a task force the blow-out emergency team <e> <s> but i am delighted to add my tribute to the work of mr adair <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord be so kind as to allow me to interrupt him <e> <s> i am most grateful <e> <s> would he not agree though that those who are in the trade union movement and who like the noble lord and myself wish to see improved industrial relations are the same people who are calling and have been calling for reduced taxation <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble viscount would allow me to intervene <e> <s> i am most grateful to him <e> <s> i am not going to go over the ground covered by the heath government but i can say that my department my secretary of state has been prepared to consult and indeed has consulted at every single step of the way but the unions have made their position clear that they are opposed to any legislation of any kind in this field <e> <s> we have made our position clear that we think that some limited legislation is necessary but there must come a point in consultation when it is recognised that there are real differences <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord this might save time later on <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that whatever the rights and wrongs of the way that we are proceeding public expenditure in this country has this year been increased on the expenditure of last year when the government which the noble lord supports were in power <e> <s> we must stop consistently misleading ourselves and others with talk of reductions in public expenditure <e> <s> public expenditure this year many of my noble friends think regrettably has been increased on last year <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to intervene my lords but i did not say there were no cuts <e> <s> i am saying that public expenditure has increased over the last year <e> <s> that is a different matter <e> <s> we can have an argument about where the public expenditure distribution falls and that is quite right but the noble lord was giving the clear impression that public expenditure is falling <e> <s> it is not it is rising <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no doubt that it is essential <e> <s> the question is who pays for it <e> <s> that is what is being discussed <e> <s> no one is arguing that it is not essential <e> <s> we are saying that we think that the public can make a greater contribution in that area in order to preserve the services elsewhere <e> <s> as part of the reduction the government are seeking in local spending generally it is unavoidable of course that there has to be some curtailment of expenditure in the personal social services <e> <s> yet despite this as i said in an intervention when the noble lord lord brooks was speaking social security expenditure will in fact rise by about per cent <e> <s> million in the next financial year and that point was covered by my noble friend lord soames <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say i cast very grave doubts on whether my right honourable friend made any such forward commitment in the context which the noble lord has mentioned <e> <s> the other thing i would point out to the noble lord is that i am here to speak for the government <e> <s> i am not talking about what was said in a totally different context in an election campaign <e> <s> if my right honourable friend made a remark which the noble lord contests or which he thinks was unfair or out of court i suggest he writes to her <e> <s> he will get a very rapid reply <e>", "<cs> perhaps i could intervene and deal with that my lords <e> <s> i know that that is the noble lords view but it is not universally shared by the outgoing administration <e> <s> it has been of very great interest to me that the outgoing administration the opposition now is moving towards becoming a party which wants to give its experience and weight to incomes policies and if i may say so with every deference and humility i think that is a wise and right move for the labour party to take <e> <s> i have always argued that incomes policies are only workable if there is a massive degree of consent for them <e> <s> it is also fair to say that this consent towards incomes policies does not exist in the present economy <e> <s> it is not as my noble friend said on offer to this government and that might be because this government is a conservative government <e> <s> in fact it was not on offer to the last government either <e>", "<cs> my lords without wishing to initiate further statistical surveys i understand that is roughly the position <e>", "<cs> my lords i altogether agree with my noble friend that the proliferation of small businesses is useful not only in employment terms but also as regards services to the public particularly in rural areas <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will be aware of course that the government are fully committed to the concept of employment protection <e> <s> it was after all a conservative government which first brought into law the concepts of for instance remedies for unfair dismissal <e> <s> but i agree that things very rapidly got out of hand and that is why we are seeking to amend the legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is perfectly right in saying that inflation falls harder on the smaller rather than on the larger business <e>", "<cs> my lords i did make some remarks about solar energy so may i refer the noble lord lord noel-baker to the text <e> <s> i agree that there should be an expansion of research and this has continued <e> <s> but our advice is that even if we are luckier than we dare hope we shall still need a nuclear programme <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very anxious that my reply to my noble friend should not be obscure so perhaps i should flesh it out a little <e> <s> in fact the capital liabilities of the british gas corporation have fallen steeply over the last two years from over million in to only million in march and this process and this fall are continuing <e> <s> i recognise the force of his argument that the price of gas and other fuels should not be allowed to get too far out of line <e> <s> matching up supply and demand can become difficult when as now gas is much cheaper than the alternatives <e> <s> therefore the government are taking this aspect and this argument into account in their current review <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord may have misheard me <e> <s> i agree with very much of what he said <e> <s> when i said that the timing of repayment of other debts is a commercial matter for the corporation i meant the cash-flow debt which is very insubstantial <e> <s> the original answer was that the british gas corporation had in fact repaid all their medium- and long-term debts but the other points the government have certainly taken on board and that is why they are urgently reviewing the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no such thing as market forces where you have a monopoly and therefore the government have a direct interest in pricing in a monopoly industry <e> <s> regarding the second part of the noble lords question we feel it has been confusing and that it is dangerous that gas prices have got right out of line with other energy prices at a time of short energy supply and high energy demand <e> <s> we are therefore taking steps to rectify that situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i will certainly take my noble friends point into account <e>", "<cs> my lords we are talking of course of an earlier period when the energy crisis was not upon us in the forms in which it is upon us today so that has to be taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the comments of both the noble lord lord wallace of coslany and the noble lord lord rochester and for the relatively uncontentious way in which these innocent orders have been achieved <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house the building societies special advances order has not yet been moved <e> <s> it was the first two orders on the order paper which were moved <e>", "<cs> my lords this is one of those rather comatose afternoons in which one could get away with moving the most horrendous measures in an uncontentious way <e> <s> i beg to move that the building societies special advances draft order which was laid before this house on th november be approved <e> <s> this order increases from to the limit above which a sum lent to a person by a building society is treated as a special advance <e> <s> under the building societies act special advances which also include all loans to companies are limited to a certain proportion of all loans made in a year <e> <s> this proportion is normally per cent <e> <s> the special advances limit was originally set at in the building societies act and has been increased four times since then <e> <s> the present limit of was set in <e> <s> since then inflation in general and the increase in house prices in particular have made it desirable that the figure should be increased <e> <s> the act prescribes that the limit may be increased by order of the chief registrar of friendly societies with the consent of the treasury <e> <s> an increase to will restore a reasonable freedom of action to building societies <e>", "<cs> my lords we went a little bit wide of the order as i shall try to show but i feel that is legitimate because housing finance policy is a very problematical and controversial area not only problematical and controversial as between the political parties but also in terms of british economic history and counter-inflation and pretty well everything else <e> <s> there was one thing which the noble baroness said with which i entirely agree and which really would be my text for a brief wind-up that the issue here is inflation <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i agree with that but the noble baroness did say in her initial remarks that she was against inflation <e> <s> high rates of interest are inevitably a consequence of inflation <e> <s> you cannot protect the price of credit or the price of money from price rises which are occurring elsewhere <e> <s> that is simple cause and effect in the economy <e> <s> what we are concerned to do is to get government spending down because with high government spending high interest rates are absolutely inevitable <e> <s> but the noble baroness and her friends have never ceased to ask for more government spending or to criticise us in our attempts to stabilise government spending <e> <s> i realise that all counter-inflationary policies as i said in a conciliatory way are fairly contentious and none of us can be protected politically or otherwise from the consequences of counter-inflation policies <e> <s> if you do it through the wage control route it is quite unpopular and if you do it by squeezing inflation through monetary measures you are fairly unpopular <e>", "<cs> well to my mind that is quite consistent with a counter-inflationary policy <e> <s> you must judge cuts in rates of income tax over a much longer period than one financial year <e> <s> the rates of income tax operate over the life of a five-year parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful for that correction <e> <s> my information is that the average price in the glc area is and therefore by raising the special advance limit to we get a bit nearer to the average but we are still aware that only per cent <e> <s> or less of all mortgage loans will be in this special advance region <e> <s> the majority will be spreading the butter thinly over the population as a whole and not particularly in a time of high inflation preferring the richer customer or the more expensive house over the needs of the poorer one <e> <s> i think that is not so much government policy as the friendly or mutual aid <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that that point is indeed rather wide of the building societies special advances order <e> <s> however i agree that at this time of year particularly when one is raising certain limits which were fixed on previous occasions and raising them because of inflation among other issues it is perhaps fair for general counter-inflationary measures to be discussed <e> <s> in my debate with the noble baroness i certainly have not sought to avoid them <e> <s> so i would think that any kind of communications system which gets the lesson across is worth considering and is valuable <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for reminding me of those two questions <e> <s> my understanding is that the building societies will allow borrowers to extend repayment periods wherever possible and that they will also step in to do what they can to help hardship cases <e> <s> the noble baroness also asked me whether i would ask the building societies whether they would lend two times rather than two and a half times the salary <e> <s> that is a matter for the societies themselves <e> <s> it would be most imprudent as well as improper for a government which are trying to face individuals and individual organisations with the realities of economic life to give them much in the way of instruction as regards how they should or should not behave <e> <s> we can all of course point to <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that that is rather wide of the general issue <e> <s> the responsibility for ensuring that trade unions do not use the sort of tactics raised by the noble earls question in our view rests in the first instance with the trade union movement itself <e> <s> the report nevertheless shows that under the law as it stands there is often no protection for someone whose business is threatened by an action such as blacking <e>", "<cs> my lords i should just like to say that we on this side are extremely proud to share these benches with my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords unlike the noble lord i do not interpret inflation in terms of the retail price index <e> <s> perhaps we could take up that difference between us <e>", "<cs> my lords of course any inflation will affect the rise in prices but if you raise prices deliberately by taxation methods or switching one form of tax charge to another area that is not in itself a permanent inflationary action <e> <s> it may bring inflation up or it may bring prices up in a particular given fiscal year but it does not do so in the next fiscal year <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will do me the courtesy of turning in <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said the consequence will be high levels of unemployment <e>", "<cs> they did more my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for giving way <e> <s> the point seems to me so important that i should like to answer it now <e> <s> the fact is that the great threat to the policies on incentives for small firms and the like is the enormous claims on money and on borrowing of the public sector <e> <s> that is why we are trying by making gilts more attractive and by the credit squeeze to get the claims of the public sector down so that then the policies which my noble friend outlined can come into effect <e> <s> they cannot unfortunately come into effect until inflation is got down and the claims of the psbr are got down <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble baroness for allowing me to interrupt her <e> <s> my right honourable friend said that regrettable though it was to have reached that stage somewhere in the region of between per cent <e> <s> and per cent <e> <s> would be acceptable i think that he said this on weekend world but he did not think that fiats from him or his colleagues would necessarily ensure it <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> what i think i was trying to get at was that it was no longer in the power of the successful parts of the british economy to provide the tax base which could simultaneously pay for the large social services and service sector of the economy that they needed a successful manufacturing base but that this manufacturing base was in the steepest kind of decline and i was very gloomy about its prospects for recovery <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord give way <e> <s> i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> since he said he would not be here at the end of the debate may i answer the substantial point that he has made <e> <s> i find myself as so often in considerable agreement with the noble lord <e> <s> the essence of getting out of a moribund industry is to get into other real employment <e> <s> the difficulties that the government are in are that until inflation is reduced and until the claims of the public sector allow inflation to get down we cannot as it were boost the smaller or new sector of the economy including the advanced technologies to take up that employment <e> <s> we have argued that our first task must be to get the inflation down and then there is a chance for some of these new fertile fields to emerge which will take the new employment <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may pick up that point i am going to be a little bit delphic but i should like to say i am personally more confident of the governments resisting formalised pay policies than i am of their ability to resist by fair means or foul some forms of import control <e>", "<cs> hear hear <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord be kind enough to give way <e> <s> is he not aware of the immense sums of public money which under both governments have been put into british leyland and does he think that has been enormously successful in that particular industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i look forward to having tea with the noble lord lord wallace of coslany in the council house of my noble friend lord massereene and ferrard <e> <s> i think the last speech if i may quickly start with that was an extremely eloquent and moving diatribe against the social evils of inflation <e> <s> the central contradiction to it in our contention of course is that we are trying to cure inflation <e> <s> i think too that it is perhaps a little hard of the noble lord lord wallace of coslany whose speech i enjoyed it was a moving speech as i said and who served in a government which increased prices by per cent <e> <s> in their five-year period of office to predict such dire social consequences for the painful attempts to cure inflation by this government which after six months in office have increased them overall by per cent <e> <s> over the rate inherited <e> <s> but obviously we are on trial there is no doubt about that but we really should be having this debate in my contention and i find it an interesting and educative debate probably around the end of <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure what point the noble lord is making but i certainly was not referring to the private sector <e> <s> what they charge for school meals is of course entirely up to them <e> <s> as a serious point and i think the noble lord should attend to it <e>", "<cs> my lords that is not what i said <e> <s> i expressed scepticism <e> <s> i accepted it as a norm because people got used to it <e> <s> i expressed considerable scepticism about the value of the retail price index as an analytical weapon particularly because it happens to include energy costs <e>", "<cs> my lords for one year <e>", "<cs> my lords i absolutely agree with my noble friend that the tendency to leak things and then to bring the leaks forward in evidence is damaging to the whole procedure of sensible planning decisions <e>", "<cs> my lords i would rather take that view but of course we have made a decision only about this in principle <e> <s> the details about costs investment decisions or what liaison with france herself would be involved have not yet been arrived at <e>", "<cs> my lords i think on balance that that is the likelihood <e> <s> of course our policy of nuclear power will have to be announced through parliament and not through the press by methods of leaking <e> <s> we are going to make the statement shortly <e> <s> i know however that all through the consultations which have built up to this statement the secretary of state attached the greatest importance to full public and continuing discussion of the issues and the need to ensure that the appropriate information is publicly available <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware that that is the case <e> <s> i was dealing with the question of nuclear power generation which does not cover windscale <e> <s> but i take the noble lords point <e> <s> the noble viscount lord han-worth raised the issue of home insulation <e> <s> i rather agree with him about this but of course there is a strong incentive to insulate ones home through the pricing mechanism <e> <s> that still seems to us to be the best and it is of course perfectly possible to insulate homes in existing stock <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the general response of noble lords for the official opposition and for the liberal party <e> <s> may i take first the broad issue of public confidence which the noble lord lord strabolgi raised and then the noble lord lord tanlaw followed on <e> <s> obviously public confidence in nuclear power depends on a general sense that safety issues are being treated openly so it is the policy of the government and all concerned with the industry to make available as much information on nuclear safety as is reasonably possible <e> <s> in that connection i have here an excellent brief on nuclear <e>", "<cs> my lords i think there is a general tendency when governments announce a programme in an area which affects every aspect of our daily and economic life to assume that what they are talking about and what they are planning will in some way be at the expense of something else and i would like to correct that impression <e> <s> i hope i have made it clear in some of the supplementary remarks to the statement as well as in some recent unstarred question debates in this house that the government are committed to a mixed economy where energy is concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords to take first the point about coal south wales and steel i do not think with respect to the noble lord lord lee of newton that that is really relevant to the case that we are discussing now about nuclear energy for electricity supply <e> <s> the reason there is trouble in the south wales pits is of course the failure of demand from the steel industry but we do not expect there to be failure of demand generally for coal for electricity or power generation <e> <s> he asked me about the agr versus the pwr <e> <s> as i said at the moment our idea is to operate both we are looking to a mixed economy here <e> <s> there are advantages in both systems but we do not feel that we can remain out on a limb if i may put it that way by restricting ourselves to the agr which is fundamentally a british device when the world energy industry is moving towards pwr and where we would lose out in <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for those comments <e> <s> he pointed out and it is indeed ironic that we have been developing gas-cooled reactors in this country for years starting as he said with the magnox stations <e> <s> i believe that all is not lost because what we are doing under the terms of the statement is effectively to buy the latest recipe if i may put it that way for development of the pwr <e> <s> we would expect that that purchase and the development of that technology allied with our own expertise would mean that increasingly the pwrs that came out of that system would be developed and made here with all the implications for our own research and development and for the employment that that would imply <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that there is a certain continuity of energy policy and that is what we should have <e> <s> however i am not a politician for nothing and i must point out to the noble lord lord wigg that some of these rather tricky decisions were anyhow temporarily postponed by the last ad ministration <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that towards the end of his remarks my noble friend welcomed what we said about the development of the pressurised water reactor <e> <s> but i would reassure him as i tried to reassure the noble lord lord wynne-jones that there is no question of the issue of the fast breeder reactor being shelved <e> <s> no system which depends on uranium is anything other than finite in our view and as i said we shall be coming to conclusions about that and we shall inform the house when we do so which i understand will be early in the new year <e> <s> however while the shortages to which both noble lords have drawn attention may indeed become acute they are not acute at the moment <e> <s> there is certainly a lot of life ahead for the pressure water reactor and in our view there is no reason not to investigate the possibilities of developing it here <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the social security contributions re-rating no <e> <s> order a draft of which was laid before this house on th november be approved <e> <s> this order has effects for both the employment protection and the social security legislation <e> <s> so far as the employment protection legislation is concerned i would start by explaining that the redundancy and maternity pay funds are both in a state of steadily growing surplus <e> <s> the redundancy fund now stands at approximately million and the maternity pay fund is approaching million <e> <s> there are two ways of controlling the level of surplus either by reducing income increasing expenditure or some combination of both <e> <s> it is with the first of these possibilities namely reducing income that we are concerned today <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for those words from the noble lord speaking for the opposition <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank both the noble lord lord wells-pestell and the noble lord lord hale for their reception <e> <s> obviously in this sad area of industrial disability where people have worked hard and made their contribution and suffered accordingly we are looking for the maximum continuity of policy possible <e> <s> if i may give the pure point of information for which the noble lord lord hale asked it is in fact just under two-and-a-half thousand claims which have now been made under the act just under two thousand from sufferers and from dependants of deceased sufferers <e> <s> i have a breakdown of information as to cotton industry slate industry pottery and the like which i can give to the noble lord if he wishes <e>", "<cs> in real terms my lords <e> <s> the noble lord has touched on the exact point <e> <s> it has actually been increased in real terms and that is why we are in such thundering trouble <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble baroness is well aware the educational budget comes out of the local authorities rate support grant <e> <s> the rate support grant has been stabilised in fact it has marginally increased in real terms and not in inflationary terms <e> <s> what has not been built into it is provision for increased wages on anything like the scale which looks like happening <e> <s> that is where the money crunch and the wage crunch will be felt <e> <s> that is an inevitable consequence as i say of any counter-inflationary policy <e> <s> it does not matter whether it was the counter-inflationary policy of the last government or of this government <e>", "<cs> i was in fact answering another point which the noble lord has made my lords <e> <s> i recognise he is concerned about postgraduate training and if i may i will look into that and see what we can do there <e>", "<cs> my lords where some of the points which the two noble lords have put to me overlap it may be convenient that i take them together rather than in turn <e> <s> the main charge of the noble lord lord bruce of donington was that these price increases would be an extra twist in the spiral of inflation <e> <s> he also asked me a specific question about the retail price index which i shall come to <e> <s> that inflationary point overlaps the point made by the noble lord lord tanlaw about how one was going to go about seeing that the value of these assets was felt by the nation as a whole <e> <s> the answer to both points is that the gas industry is very highly profitable because gas is a relatively easily available form of energy <e> <s> because other forms of energy have become very expensive people have been rushing into gas and this is one of the reasons for anxiety about the balance of supply and demand <e> <s> but any profits which the british gas corporation hold in excess of their investment needs which are not considerable will go back into the exchequer and in that way they are reducing the public borrowing requirement and are directly counter-inflationary in their effect <e> <s> in general economic terms the noble lords anxiety is some-what misplaced <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the net effect of that is rather different from what the noble lord lord balogh is suggesting because at present the british gas corporation charge an overall much higher rate to commercial and industrial users than to the domestic users as we domestic users know <e> <s> i have not done any calculation of the relative unit costs there but surely the distinction must be made between the overall costs of commercial and industrial users and those of private consumers <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to answer the point made by my noble friend <e> <s> he has put down an unstarred question <e> <s> that obviously is a more suitable arrangement for a general debate on this issue than a repetition of a statement in the house of commons <e> <s> i suggest that we have that debate although it is not for me to say whether we do or not as that is a matter for my noble friend <e> <s> i shall be delighted to answer all of his points and others at that time should the unstarred question go through <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord roberthall effectively for answering the attack made by the noble lord lord bruce of donington <e> <s> extra receipts in one area have a counter-inflationary effect in another <e> <s> this is the point that i was seeking to make <e> <s> i am grateful that my noble friend made this clear <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise if i misunderstood the noble lord <e> <s> i took it that the noble lord was making a distinction between the commercial and industrial users and domestic consumers <e> <s> the burden of my statement was to say that in so far as these price increases in the costs of gas fall or are burdensome on smaller users or poor consumers with whom i take him to be concerned we are going to work through social policies the additional fuel costs on supplementary benefit scheme and the rest in order to get redress there <e>", "<cs> my lords on the last point it is true that the last <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords example in a pure world would be extremely effective <e> <s> it is not effective in so far as we are dealing with finite sources of supply <e> <s> our anxiety which is underscored by the international situation is that the great imbalance between gas pricing and other forms of energy costs were using up our gas supplies at a rate which is extremely damaging to the overall interest of this economy <e>", "<cs> my lords all that would have been possible if the party which the noble lord supports had not originally engaged in the creation of nationalised industry boards which presumably have to have some financial disciplines under which to operate <e> <s> they were certainly given financial disciplines under which to operate by the last government <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord wynne-jones is putting a case for using up the gas as fast as possible <e> <s> it is a perfectly credible case <e> <s> i have heard it argued by supporters of my own party <e> <s> but the fact is that it is not a view which on balance the last government shared or the present administration shares <e> <s> we are not talking about conserving gas infinitely or not allowing it to be used <e> <s> we are correcting an imbalance which has made consumers go very heavily into gas and at a rate which a broad overall and sensible conservation policy particularly in the light of the international situation does not <e> <s> in our view warrant <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite prepared to concede to my noble friend or to any marxist the monopoly of may <e> <s> may is a time when we should all be able to enjoy ourselves regardless of our political complexion <e>", "<cs> my lords i will take the noble baronesss opinions into account but i would point out to her as a stern european as all members of the liberal party are that almost all european countries observe a public holiday at the beginning of may <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i cannot congratulate the noble lord on his choice of metaphors but as i pointed out there is in fact not a holiday on labour day in this country there is however a bank holiday on the first monday in may <e>", "<cs> i think that is a yellow herring my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords it is exactly because there has been an unfairly differential price between what the british pottery industry pays for gas and what domestic consumers pay for gas and consumers are using up gas at a rate of knots that is probably causing the difficulties to that industry which the noble lord mentioned <e> <s> what we are doing as i said is progressively phasing out artificially low domestic gas price levels and bringing them up to something closer to their true market value in relation to world energy costs from which as i have argued we cannot afford to isolate ourselves <e>", "<cs> my lords i will take advice on that question and give the answer to the noble lord when i come to wind up <e>", "<cs> my lords since it will be a long time before i wind up this debate and the noble lord is making this point perhaps he will allow me to answer it right away <e> <s> all governments interfere with nationalised industries all the time by setting them financial targets <e> <s> this procedure was initiated by the last government we have decided to continue it <e> <s> it is very worthwhile and sensible and it is a form of interference <e> <s> it is the only way in which a monopoly industry can as it were imitate the conditions available in free competition <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble baroness for giving way <e> <s> i do not see what this general issue of public spending has to do with a debate on energy costs <e> <s> that is my first point <e> <s> the second point that i would put to the noble baroness is as follows <e> <s> her party was in government for out of years during which time the poor in this society became progressively poorer and more and more people who could afford to jumped on the wagon of the welfare state which is exactly why we are in the pickle we are in today <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will give way i really hate interrupting him but the whole burden of our argument is that in this society subsidisation affects those who can afford to pay and leaves increasingly less every year for those who cannot afford to pay <e> <s> that argument may not be agreed by the noble lord but he must at least take it on board and must not argue back as though that argument were not there <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord allow me to take up that point while it is fresh in your lordships minds <e> <s> the government are in permanent and enormous intervention in the steel industry intervention to the tune of millions of pounds every year <e> <s> the question which all governments have to ask themselves is when does the intervening have to stop <e>", "<cs> we are my lords <e>", "<cs> millions a day <e>", "<cs> yes my lords of course <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord wells-pestell said at <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry if i missed that point <e> <s> however i have a note of it here <e> <s> the average price to the large industrial consumer as shown in the latest edition of <e>", "<cs> my lords we are very well aware that as strikes progress feelings harden tempers rise and the situation can get out of hand <e> <s> we feel that the present law on secondary picketing is confused and ambiguous and that is why we seek to amend it <e> <s> on my noble friends latter point the police have powers to limit the number of pickets where they believe that too many are likely to lead to breaches of the peace <e> <s> we intend that there should be guidance on the number of pickets in any code of practice which follows on our legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords any offences committed are not a matter for me as the noble lord knows <e> <s> we intend to see that picketing is lawful or subject to immunity only at a persons place of work <e> <s> it will be clear when a person is picketing outside his place of work <e> <s> there is ambiguity about that and many other issues an ambiguity which we are seeking to clear up in order to improve industrial relations in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a little wide of the question <e> <s> nevertheless i would draw my noble friends attention to the fact that the tuc code of practice gives some rather ambiguous guidance but guidance nevertheless on the use of armbands <e> <s> in my view that would be best dealt with by a tightened provision in the code of practice <e>", "<cs> my lords that is exactly what we are doing <e> <s> the code of practice is an extension of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i will certainly try to oblige my noble friend in that regard <e> <s> i agree with him that the self-inflicted damage of poor industrial relations has been very harmful to this country and we are determined therefore to try to improve that <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said that is wide of the original question which dealt with secondary picketing <e> <s> i know perfectly well what the noble lord lord melchett is getting at he is arguing that one gets fewer industrial disputes in a period of pay policy <e> <s> the trouble is that one gets more of them when emerging from a period of pay policy and that is the situation we are now in <e>", "<cs> my lords i am in total agreement with the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i am in very considerable sympathy with what the noble lord says and i think it is particularly regrettable that we are tending to think of wages at the moment only in percentage terms which are not always <e>", "<cs> my lords i will certainly consider that <e> <s> however acas might be in the same difficulty in that they have a vital function as arbitrators and it might be thought that they were coming down with some subjective interpretation of the situation <e> <s> but i have said to the noble lord that his point will be taken most seriously <e> <s> i will see what can be done <e>", "<cs> my lords there is much in what the noble lord has to say <e> <s> i see no reason on the face of it why employers or unions should shrink from publishing or releasing to the press the information themselves <e> <s> my only query is as to whether acas or the government directly should be involved in that process <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have an enormous interest in <e>", "<cs> my lords while the risks of significant damage to nuclear plants from earthquakes in the united kingdom are as i indicated <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may i shall take the points of the noble lord lord kilmarnock in a moment but perhaps i may first answer the substantial points put from the opposition benches <e> <s> the noble lord lord mccarthy gave two cheers at any rate for the statement and for that i am grateful <e> <s> i take this teasing about doves and hawks but i do not think that this is a particularly dissenting or inconsistent aviary because we did not oppose these measures in particular in substance when we were in opposition and therefore there is no need for us to appear inconsistent by not doing so now <e> <s> as i have shown we have in certain instances expanded upon them <e>", "<cs> my lords i share the views of my noble friend about the importance of training and retraining <e> <s> he will appreciate that just as the special employment measures are only part of the work of the department of employment and of the manpower services commission they do not cover all instances of training <e> <s> there is a training element contained in the special measures in the youth opportunities programme which we have expanded and in the special temporary employment programme which has been sharpened if i may put it that way by concentrating them on areas of greatest need <e> <s> both those programmes contain training elements but the thrust of the work of the government on training is not in the special employment measures as such <e>", "<cs> my lords i plead guilty for not answering the noble lords last question <e> <s> though i should in courtesy have mentioned this i do not intend and i do not think that it is useful to get involved in forecasting <e> <s> these measures are carefully designed to operate on a year-on-year basis that being the efficient way to proceed because then one has some indication in any given year of what the requirements are going to be in the following year <e> <s> so i am going to avoid but quite deliberately any argument about forecasting <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the remarks of the noble lord lord kilmarnock <e> <s> one of the difficulties with subsidies is that if you withdraw them the arena which is affected always feels in some way under fire <e> <s> the government are relying enormously on the wealth creation and on the employment generation capacities of small firms and a great many of our fiscal and other policies are directed towards this end <e> <s> the problem with expansion subsidies like the small firms employment subsidy is that they are inevitably paid even when employers would have created extra jobs without payment of the subsidy <e> <s> this is not the best way to fulfil our responsibilities and what we are hoping to achieve from the small firm <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the first part of the noble lords remarks when he praised us <e> <s> but <e>", "<cs> my lords the life and use of these installations is a subject for constant monitoring and that is how it has been found possible to extend the life in this case <e>", "<cs> my lords when dealing with the life of any installation it is of course difficult to be altogether precise but the important point here is that even after an installation has come to the end of its useful life it is still subject to the monitoring process as the deradioactivisation takes place <e>", "<cs> my lords these points are under consideration as a matter of urgency by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for energy <e>", "<cs> my lords i sympathise with my noble friend <e> <s> these are indeed technical issues and an occasional <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords there are some difficulties there and we are trying to improve the situation <e> <s> as my noble friend may be aware the industrial training board managements do find it unsatisfactory that they have to apply to government for permission to raise salaries or whatever <e> <s> this is somewhat anomalous in the present situation and we are looking for ways to improve it <e>", "<cs> my lords i should certainly like to add my tribute to the maiden speech of the noble lord lord scanlon with whom i have had some private discussions about training <e> <s> i will take the noble lords remarks into consideration <e>", "<cs> here we are <e>", "<cs> my lords the late poet wh <e> <s> auden who i had the honour of knowing slightly and admired very much once said that when as a literary man he found himself in a gathering of scientists he felt like a shabby curate who had strayed into a room full of dukes and that is somewhat the position in which i find myself this evening as your lordships house is at its best when men are talking with passion about things they know well <e>", "<cs> my lords wholeheartedly repudiate the criticisms of myself and my advisers in that case <e> <s> if the noble lord wishes to debate this important and worrying subject he has every facility in this house to do so as he is well aware <e> <s> my answer simply replied factually to the point that he put to me <e> <s> with regard to some of his supplementary points following the explosion which was in not in as the noble lord inadvertently said the plant was completely redesigned and was operated without incident <e> <s> nevertheless in the firm ceased production of the chemical that involved production of dioxin as its by-product <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may repeat to the noble lord lord avebury what i said to the noble lord lord hale powers are available to force <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in my original answer we are of course dealing here with estimates and estimates can be wrong <e> <s> it is true that the tendency has been to over-estimate demand recently but in the s and early sixties there was a record of underestimating demand <e> <s> it is the governments view that there would still be a leading role for nuclear power in electricity generation and of course the nature of electricity demand would not be the only factor determining how one generated electricity <e>", "<cs> my lords i still think it is rather difficult to predict the future with any certainty <e> <s> nevertheless the implications of the new load forecast will be looked at most carefully by the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i am altogether in agreement with my noble friend <e> <s> the paradox of large numbers of unfilled vacancies at a time of high unemployment is partly due to people changing jobs and also to the mismatch of employment opportunities regionally and many of our worst unemployment statistics are very much regionally located <e> <s> but we are working with the manpower services commission to try to increase job mobility and opportunities for job mobility to improve the future situation <e>", "<cs> my lords on the second part of the noble lords supplementary question again i am in agreement <e> <s> i think that law and order are best served by the police becoming familiar as individuals in their districts <e> <s> there are problems connected with that and most of the police forces are now motorised in urban areas <e> <s> i am glad to be able to tell the noble lord that since the pay increase some of the recruitment difficulties of the police have eased but we have still a way to go <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i do not have that information off-the-cuff but i will look into it and let my noble friend know the answer <e>", "<cs> not without notice my lords <e> <s> i think the question probably should be directed towards a defence minister but i will look into the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords it is my understanding that the situation in scotland is better than in england and wales generally <e>", "<cs> my lords a friend of mine who is a writer an anarchist <e>", "<cs> yes my lords my understanding is that it would <e>", "<cs> my lords on my noble friends first supplementary question i can reassure him that we have tightened very considerably the criteria for work permits which are issued only if the conditions of the scheme are met <e> <s> among other requirements my department must be satisfied that the vacancy in question is highly skilled or specialised and that there is no suitable resident labour available and that the employer concerned has made attempts to seek to <e>", "<cs> my lords it was in fact myself who was taking steps on the question of the work permits rather than the home office <e> <s> the position is as the noble lord is no doubt aware that the issue of a work permit is not a contract of employment so someone could be allowed into the country for the purposes of a work permit but we do not direct labour in this country and he would be perfectly free to leave and that is why we have had to tighten the restrictions very considerably <e> <s> in fact it is possible to come into the country under the work permit scheme for hotel and catering work but only of course in the higher reaches of skill and in the higher salary brackets <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid the pressure on the flow is still very much into our beleaguered country rather than out of it <e> <s> i am sorry to disappoint the noble lord on that score <e> <s> we do not keep statistics for the outflow but as i have said we monitor very carefully the pressures on inflow <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful for that intervention from my noble friend and i am sure that is indeed the case <e> <s> judging from your lordships house it would appear that it has already started to take effect <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to give weight to the question which has been put down <e> <s> indeed the government have really to some degree anticipated the noble viscounts question by setting up a programme <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is anticipating the government a little <e> <s> the government have accepted the need for conservation and the value of chp schemes as outlined by the marshall report <e> <s> as a result of accepting this issue of principle they are now setting up a programme to look at the feasibility and costing of utilising such schemes <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no plan to have a chp programme as part of a network all over the country <e> <s> in the initial stages it would probably be at most half a dozen sites <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord lord avebury has in fact put down some questions for written answer in respect of the need for the electricity board to reconsider its costings which i am in the process of answering if i have got the timing of that right <e> <s> the broad principle about the use of chp has led the government to set up a programme but what comes out of the programme will of course depend on the economic cost-effectiveness of what we discover <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of what particular boroughs have made representations to the government at this stage because at this stage the government are inviting individual local authorities to put forward their recommendations but when they have done so i should be delighted to let the noble viscount know <e>", "<cs> my lords it would also be right for that point to be drawn to the attention of those working the programme because it would be lamentable if the programme were allowed to get out of date <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly be delighted to inquire into that <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that that effect will be achieved as a result of the programme which my right honourable friend announced on nd april <e>", "<cs> my lords my information is that at the upper end of the scale of energy savings given in the report those from chp and district heating would have an economic value equivalent to million tons of coal per annum and that would be between and per cent <e> <s> of probable united kingdom primary energy demand up to the end of the century <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the general welcome which both the noble lord lord blease and the noble lord lord rochester have given to this order <e> <s> i certainly make no apology for commending the order but it is not inconsistent with my commending it for me to feel that all is not generally well with the system of industrial training in this country and that is why we are reviewing it very seriously <e> <s> it is no secret that if we were able to we would like to see a general debate on the subject possibly with a view to a bill being introduced in the next session <e> <s> but of course that is not directly for me other people are involved <e>", "<cs> my lords i am altogether in agreement with my noble friend it is very regrettable that the tuc have gone as far down this road as they have <e> <s> we are very fortunate in this country in having very many avenues open to us to express our sincerely held political opinions <e> <s> but it is not profitable to this country in its standing in the world if we express them by withdrawing our labour <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is wrong in everything that he said <e> <s> representations have been made to my department and to other departments of state by the tuc <e> <s> they have always been listened to with courtesy and consultation over every issue has been welcomed <e> <s> what is annoying the tuc is that agreement has not been found to be possible <e>", "<cs> my lords a number of us are working very hard to try to restore foreign confidence in this country with all that that means for investment and employment and we have had some encouraging signs that this is picking up <e> <s> but this kind of activity especially in view of there being every kind of political channel open for protest or for the demonstration of views is not exactly likely to help foreign confidence and therefore to help employment <e>", "<cs> my lords governments have an enormous vested interest in people being in work in this country <e> <s> it is a travesty to suggest that the government are promoting unemployment <e>", "<cs> my lords i can think of too many which would take up a very great deal of the time of the house <e> <s> in the case where i have myself been directly involved there have been representations on for instance maternity issues <e>", "<cs> my lords i am a little at a loss as to whether i am answering first question in the name of my noble friend lord gridley or whether this is a comment which is being asked of me on the question in the name of the noble viscount <e> <s> i can say however in respect of the noble viscounts question that my advice is that this is a matter which is <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the governments view that trade union members million of them understand this very well <e> <s> our disagreement is with the views and the methods of expressing them of the trade union leadership <e>", "<cs> my lords i am in agreement with my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i have never heard the word however with more foreboding in my career than just then <e> <s> but of course the noble viscount is quite right <e> <s> he is utterly free to put down his question again at a later stage when perhaps as a result of court action the position will be clearer <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that my right honourable friend the minister of transport will be making a statement later this afternoon <e> <s> there is of course no legal problem about car sharing provided that car owners and drivers do not seek to make a profit from carrying passengers <e>", "<cs> my lords special car parks will be opened and arrangements are being made to keep radial routes open <e> <s> it is not the intention at this stage to lift car parking restrictions but i take my noble friends point and precise arrangements on the day will as always be a matter for police discretion <e>", "<cs> my lords that depends on the precise insurance arrangements which individuals have with their own companies <e> <s> there is no blanket arrangement there because some individuals are insured only for third party <e> <s> so everybody should be most careful to check up as to what their precise insurance arrangements are <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are anxious to see that men are as well treated as women at all times <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have thought that most people working in or anywhere near a fords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am entirely in favour of improved labour relations wherever they should take place <e> <s> i think that there are some encouraging signs in leyland as well <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships will often have heard from ministers of the treasury horror at what could be called hypothecated revenue or earmarked revenue but obviously all funding of our research programmes does come out of public expenditure and public expenditure is in these difficult times aided by north sea oil <e>", "<cs> yes my lords we are well ahead in that regard <e>", "<cs> my lords i have never ceased to marvel at the ingenuity with which on every single coal issue the noble lord succeeds in bringing out that point <e>", "<cs> yes my lordshappily we are still able to extract oil from our own resources but i take my noble friends point <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware that the history of the coal board and these schemes is not unconnected with the noble lords own very distinguished career <e> <s> i perhaps can answer him and amplify an answer that i should have given to my noble friend lord kinnoull about the general level of government support by saying that the agreement signed in february between the department and the coal board provided for government support of up to million for design studies estimated to cost million and <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the noble earls point and note the support it has in the house <e> <s> i would say however that all energy issues are about mixed systemswe are running a mixed economy where energy is concerned and that means obviously that some priorities will have to be taken before others <e>", "<cs> my lords that is the case <e> <s> my advice is that the particular technology utilised in south africa called the sasol technology of gasification synthesis is expected to have a substantial cost and efficiency disadvantage compared with the direct liquefaction processes we are now developing in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords as i hope my answers have made clear

of my answers to give an air of scepticism about this processi am not sceptical about this <e> <s> the fact is that things have to be cost effective and at the moment this would be very expensive to push further <e> <s> as the price of oil goes up however so market forces will enable this process to become more cost effective <e>", "<cs> my lords one can make sensible decisions without commissions <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord davies of leek must distinguish between the withdrawal of immunity from civil proceedings by an employer against a secondary picket and the general issues of demonstrations which are covered by criminal law at the moment where we did of course consult the police and where we shall consult them again in respect of the code of practice <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to interrupt the noble lord except on a point of information <e> <s> i think there has been some misunderstanding about the maternity clause <e> <s> the reinstatement change is

spirit of the speech of the noble lord lord wedderburn of charlton happened earlier in the maiden speech of my noble friend lord keith <e> <s> speaking as a manager he praised the bill for its

cleared in another place i beg to move that the house be resumed to hear the statement <e>", "<cs> the message which i should like to convey to the committee and particularly to the noble lord lord

not meet the eye <e> <s> of course the days are past when classical quotations were bandied around your lordships house but they must have in mind the famous line about being suspicious of greeks when

committee for the relatively popular reception that the new clause has had and to the noble lord lord mccarthey in particular for undertaking not to divide against it <e> <s> as my noble friend has

the whole circumstances including the size and administrative resources of his undertaking he acted reasonably or unreasonably in treating it as a sufficient reason for dismissing the employee <e> <s> accordingly the effect is to neutralise the burden of proof that is how we see it as to establishing the reasonableness of the dismissal and specifically to require the tribunal at least to take into

have done <e>", "<cs> in view of the terms of indignation of the noble baroness lady gaitskell and precisely because things are not good for small businesses she should follow us into the lobby over this kind of corrective amendment <e>", "<cs> the rights of the employee are still there <e>", "<cs> i just make two quick points the first to the noble lord lord underhill and the second to the noble lord lord rochester <e> <s> to the noble lord lord underhill of course we regard employment protection rights as important <e> <s> it was after all a conservative government which introduced such a concept <e> <s> but we felt that the balance should be restored between the need for <e>", "<cs> if i may make a suggestion if it was felt that amendment no <e> <s> could be reasonably taken i would be enthusiastic that it should be taken before we adjourn <e> <s> if the noble lord feels that it is going to be a very substantial debate i suppose that i shall have to yield but i must remind the committee that we are not proceeding at the pace we should be <e>", "<cs> what we are trying to establish is whether we should or should not now adjourn for dinner <e> <s> i am enthusiastic to proceed to take amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> however if the noble lord lord wedderburn feels that is going to be a very substantial debate involving let us say more than a quarter of an hours discussion then perhaps rather reluctantly we must adjourn now <e> <s> but it would be much more satisfactory if we came to the substantive closed shop debate immediately after dinner <e>", "<cs> in that case i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> i had hoped when we debated amendment no <e> <s> to save some of the time of the committee by not trading surveys and statistics with the noble lord lord wedderburn <e> <s> the reason i wanted to do that other than saving time was not because i have anything to fear in these figures or that my very competent department has not supplied me with them but because i agree with the noble viscount lord hanworth that this is to some degree a small matter <e> <s> it is a matter of rectifying a psychological balance <e>", "<cs> it is curious that i rather agreed with the noble lord <e>", "<cs> some of your lordships may feel after listening to this important debate that i am caught between the devil and the deep blue sea with these amendments concerning the closed shop <e> <s> i want to make it quite clear that i prefer the deep blue sea and i listened to my noble friends lord de lisle and lord salisbury with considerable sympathy <e> <s> like them like the noble lord lord harris of high cross and like my noble friend lord caldecote in a forceful and brief speech just now the government dislike and disapprove of the closed shop and very much regret that our history has seen to it that it has become so institutionalised and so deep-rooted in our industrial society <e>", "<cs> noble lords opposite emphasised the industrial relations aspect of closed shops rather than the effects on individual rights <e> <s> in our view that really is not good enough <e> <s> what pressing industrial relations cause was furthered when in british rail sacked some or so of its employees many of whom had years of loyal service <e> <s> if most union agreements provide for conscientious objections why should the law not expect that all agreements make such provision <e> <s> our view is that noble lords opposite seem content to acquiesce in and even applaud deficiencies in the law and therefore in the rights of individuals <e> <s> we refuse to do so and that is why we are proposing the changes in this bill <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord renton said that million unionists were affiliated to the labour party <e> <s> they may be affiliated to it but it is questionable whether they always vote for it <e> <s> on the question of whether that would be in contradiction of the european convention i think not <e> <s> what we are dealing with here is what happens to people who are unreasonably or unfairly excluded and our aim in this bill is to give people redress and protection when their human rights in that way are violated <e> <s> my reading of trade union rule books which i have done though i acknowledge that i am in no sense the expert the noble lord lord mccarthy is in this area is that most of them are prefaced be general statements of intent and general aims very often politically expressed and with which many of their members would either all the time or from time to time in my submission disagree <e> <s> but that would not in my view constitute a violation of their rights unless they were unreasonably excluded or expelled as a result of not subscribing to them <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> as i hope the committee will accept i have considerable sympathy with the concern which lies behind my noble friends amendment <e> <s> it therefore rather grieves me that we nevertheless advise that it should not be pressed or adopted <e> <s> we are aware that some new closed shop agreements have been negotiated since last may and one would guess that in the circumstances these negotiations and agreements may leave something to be desired <e> <s> but the most significant instance was quoted by my noble friend namely the strathclyde agreement <e> <s> as he himself said this was made before the election and therefore would not be covered by the amendment <e> <s> we do not have evidence of there being very significant numbers on the scale of half a million brought into closed shops since the election <e>", "<cs> i was not worrying <e> <s> i simply remarked the night is young <e>", "<cs> these new clauses are directed to the problem of the terms of commercial contracts which require one of the parties to use union labour only on the work covered by the contract <e> <s> it thus imposes on the employees of the contractor a requirement to be a member of or if not to join a union and in this way can spread the effects of the closed shop in what my noble friend lord orr-ewing called a back-door fashion <e> <s> i want to be clear about the governments position on this <e> <s> we dislike this practice <e> <s> it can readily be seen as a way of requiring reluctant contractor employers to impose conditions of union membership on their employees who have no desire whatsoever to join the union <e> <s> i must regretfully say to my noble friend that i see some considerable difficulties in the solution to the problem and we share his view about the problem in the form of his amendments <e>", "<cs> i did refer to this amendment and did i think deal with it in general terms during the discussion on the last amendment <e> <s> may i say to the <e>", "<cs> that is a very clear invitation to which i am delighted to respond <e> <s> we went into the principles of this matter to some degree in the debate on clause and i am aware that sooner or later the noble lord lord mccarthy is as was the noble lord lord wedderburn when we were debating clause determined to flush out of me attitudes to evidence about the disincentive effects on small firms of employment protection legislation <e> <s> the noble lord lord mccarthy earlier made the point it was a perfectly fair debating point that a lot of our evidence was anecdotal <e> <s> of course it was our business in opposition to consider such evidence and i must say it was also very much a concern of the liberal party at that time <e> <s> indeed so much so was this a joint concern of the liberal party and the conservative party that as a result the last government saw fit to appoint mr harold lever now lord lever to take a special interest in small firms <e>", "<cs> to do justice to me the noble lord will know that when we debated this matter on the first orders last summer and then again a few hours ago here i talked about the closed shop and expressed my general scepticism about polls and surveys as a method of eliciting information because so much depends as the noble lord has said on which way you phrase the question <e> <s> you can prompt the question to get the answer that you want and that is why i show a certain scepticism in these directions <e> <s> the noble lord lord mccarthy has teased me for being frank about this but i think that at second reading the noble baroness lady seear shared my view when i said that our feeling was that a lot of small employers did not understand very well employment protection legislation and probably overestimated it that this had had a marked disincentive effect on recruitment and that one cannot survey with any accuracy the disincentive effects on employment on those people who have not obtained employment <e> <s> in other words surveys have to be <e>", "<cs> that is a tax issue <e>", "<cs> i am happy that <e>", "<cs> i must first apologise to the noble lord lord parry because i came into the committee during his third or fourth sentence rather than his first sentence which i should have done and i am therefore not clear whether he was speaking to all the amendments in his name or just the first one <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord anticipated the government have given this and the two subsequent amendments careful consideration and we are sympathetic to the intention behind them <e> <s> the legal advice available to the government suggests that it would not be wise to amend the legislation at the present time since a case awaiting decision in the employment appeal tribunal may bring about the results desired by the noble lord in the following way if the court establishes that the meaning of the expression associated employers in the employment protection consolidation act should be less narrowly interpreted than it has been hitherto teachers in aided schools might well be <e>", "<cs> the government have already amended the bill to ensure that an employer requesting confirmation of intention to return must clearly explain to the woman that if she fails to reply to the request she may forfeit her right to return <e> <s> we do not wish to go to the extreme of insisting on using a particular form <e> <s> businesses especially small businesses have enough forms to deal with in the modern world without us adding another one <e> <s> the government have accepted the main point that the employer in asking the employee to confirm her intention must let her know clearly what her position is <e> <s> as long as <e>", "<cs> i am delighted to he able to agree with the noble lord that generally the scheme and the legislation for maternity protection is working well and i am not in the least surprised that the survey to which he referred of million or even million workers produced that answer <e> <s> the whole emphasis of these very minor changes to the existing legislation is to remove the disincentive effects on employers particularly <e>", "<cs> it is now <e>", "<cs> i am indeed in sympathy with the intentions of the noble lord lord wedderburn of charlton in tabling this amendment <e> <s> there is an injustice here <e> <s> as the noble lord very clearly said where a woman qualifies to receive maternity pay she is entitled to receive from the employer nine-tenths of a weeks pay less the amount of maternity allowance which currently runs at a week a figure on which i corrected the noble lord <e> <s> where the woman qualifies for maternity pay from two employers both of the employers must subtract maternity allowance although she obviously is in receipt of only one maternity allowance not two <e>", "<cs> the amendment seeks to remove the qualifying period for unfair dismissal where the reason for the dismissal was pregnancy <e> <s> i should have thought that the qualifying period of weeks offers quite adequate protection to the woman employee who is expecting a baby <e> <s> employers could be understandably anxious at the prospect of employees with no service being able to bring claims for unfair dismissal and i do not think that this would be in the interests of women because employers would be even more reluctant to take on young married women and it is to correct those disincentives that we are amending the legislation <e> <s> the last government found no reason to distinguish between this sort of dismissal and the generality in terms of qualifying period and we for our part see no reason to disagree with that judgment which is why i would resist the amendment <e>", "<cs> one of the most instructive things that one can do and i recommend this to any noble lords who have any doubts about what we are doing in this respect is to write down on one side of a piece of paper what are the womens rights under the existing legislation and then on the other side of the paper to write down the changes that we are proposing <e> <s> the quantitative changes under clause are very small indeed <e> <s> i should have thought a more pungent way of getting at the government might be to say to them are changes on this scale worth while <e> <s> in clause days before absence begins the employee must inform the employer in writing that she will be leaving the date of expected confinement and when she intends to return <e> <s> under the present legislation the employer can request this to be in writing so it is a relatively minor provision <e>", "<cs> my understanding is i could be wrong but i think not that it is seven calendar weeks <e> <s> therefore it would include the holidays <e> <s> we chose that number because it was a length of time that seemed reasonable to the equal opportunities commission and what was good enough for the commission was certainly good enough for the government <e>", "<cs> turning first to the point made by the noble lord lord rochester i think that probably one of the difficulties is that there has accrued round the word rights a feeling of constitutional liberties of a deep-seated character <e> <s> these of course we would be very sensitive towards but when you look at this thing in practice what i think many people fail to appreciate is that there is not a blanket exemption here this is not an institutionalised two-tier system as the noble lord lord mccarthy suggested <e> <s> the very small <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> they would be covered by the law as it stands <e>", "<cs> on the last and general point womens rights are a highly important but also somewhat emotive subject at this moment in history <e>", "<cs> they are <e> <s> the noble lord lord mccarthy and i use language in very different ways <e>", "<cs> i take that correction <e> <s> i am sorry if i sounded rather tetchy <e> <s> i think it was a personal response <e> <s> i work very hard on womens employment issues and i have always rather resented the fact that this bill is thought to be anything negative in that regard <e>", "<cs> i must say that it gives me great pleasure at the end of a very stimulating interesting and in the main extremely well-tempered day of this committee stage to be able to correct the noble lord lord mccarthy something which i never expected to be able to do <e> <s> my noble friend lord lyell has been most useful to me as a guide in that he was one of the pupils of the noble lord lord mccarthy <e> <s> i should never have expected that either he or i would ever correct the noble lord <e> <s> however when he says that the clause provides a series of excuses for employers to withdraw womens rights that will not do <e> <s> as i explained probably to the boredom of the committee several <e>", "<cs> i should also like with the noble lord lord mccarthy to take the opportunity of clause stand part to pay tribute to the efforts which the tuc in particular have made and are making to assist pregnant women to a safe and healthy pregnancy and childbirth <e> <s> they have not only pressed for legislation on the lines of clause and given a lead on workplace health education projects for pregnant women they have also encouraged affiliated unions to participate in campaigns and to promote projects and co-operated with the health education council and its mother and baby campaign <e> <s> the government are anxious to play their part here and to help along similar lines <e>", "<cs> i am surprised that the noble lord lord houghton has not borne in mind the fact that the government have been under very considerable pressure to go much further in respect of these guarantee pay <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> i do not think that any such suggestion was part of the last governments legislation <e> <s> i do not think that that has ever been mooted <e>", "<cs> i have here quite a substantial winding up speech to what i imagined would be the principal debate on this issue of secondary picketing <e> <s> but it would seem to me and i say this with great earnestness to noble lords opposite that it would be far wiser for them to listen on this occasion to the words which have been said by people with very much more experience of the working of the trade union movement than i myself have speakers such as the noble baroness lady burton of coventry and especially the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby <e> <s> therefore i would beg them to attend to those speeches and to consider what the government are doing and to look at this as a principal platform of our policy not just in terms of the bill but in terms of our policies as a whole that picketing should be limited to ones place of work and that they will take the counsel of lord houghton of sowerby and others rather than mine on this and withdraw their amendment <e>", "<cs> these amendments aim to remove words introduced by government amendment at report stage in another place <e> <s> a number of those who commented on the bill prior to report expressed fears that the clause as originally drafted would have allowed very wide scope for picketing by trade union officials whose members were picketing <e> <s> it would have meant for example that where union members were picketing at their own place of work where we seek to limit picketing it would be perfectly lawful for any official of that trade union including shop stewards from another place of work to join those members on the picket line <e>", "<cs> on this last point if i may take up that part while it <e>", "<cs> i take the noble baronesss point and she is indeed right <e> <s> but i do not think that we should look upon a picket line as a form of club and take the view that we are unreasonably excluding certain people from taking part in it <e> <s> we have made very clear provision for the presence of union officials right up to and including the general secretary and it seems to me that we have got it about right <e> <s> however i will read the debate carefully and go back to officials and look over the points about the convenor which both the noble baroness and the noble lord lord mccarthy have raised <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> subsection of clause extends immunity to those who having lost their job as a result of an industrial dispute picket their former place of work <e> <s> we think that that is a just and necessary provision but the amendment standing in the name of the noble lord would make it lawful for any person whose last employment was terminated in connection with a trade dispute to picket at his or her former place of work in furtherance of that dispute even if he or she had subsequently found alternative work <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord give way <e> <s> i am very grateful <e> <s> at this juncture i would not want him to give the committee the feeling he is a very skilful man and perhaps he is able to do rather better than i can that the situation that obtained in or previous to it was really very relevant today <e> <s> the trade union movement has come a long way since <e> <s> we are concerned overall not to put the clock back as he has often argued we are doing but to redress the balance where legislation which grew up in such a way as to protect weak organisations is now reinforcing the activities of very strong ones <e>", "<cs> the amendment in our view strikes at the heart of the bills provisions on picketing <e> <s> i thought there was an element of bravura performance in the noble lords speech which is why and he was good enough to give way to me i intervened in the middle of it in order to bring out the very point which i am glad to say the noble lord lord rochester made during his rather briefer remarks <e> <s> it is that laws which were designed to protect and encourage weak and nascent bodies are rather different from laws which try to redress balances or wrongs in a totally different period of historical development <e> <s> the concept of the rotating and flying picket was foreign in the industrial atmosphere previous to <e> <s> i think that if the noble lord lord shinwell were in his place we could have another instance of that remarkable moment on tuesday when he reminded us that the committee of the house of lords was considering a bill and he had been a member of a trade union before the legislation of <e>", "<cs> i think that it might be convenient to adjourn for dinner at this stage so i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mccarthy said that the committee would not expect him to let this clause go through without a division <e> <s> having heard the whole debate and having heard especially the substantive contributions of the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby and the noble baroness lady burton of coventry speaking from the side of noble lords opposite i should have thought that the wisest thing they could do would be to let the clause not particular amendments go through without division <e> <s> they are out of touch with the mood of the committee let alone with the mood of the country on this issue <e> <s> flying pickets secondary pickets whatever you call them are inherently intended to frighten <e> <s> in substance those were the words of the noble lord lord houghton <e> <s> they are inherently intended to frighten both the workers concerned and the general public which is why they are so objectionable and why we have outlawed them <e>", "<cs> that is not what i said <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord be so kind as to give way <e> <s> i am not clear <e> <s> my understanding was that we would have a debate on this very important and substantive issue on amendments nos <e> <s> h j and k <e> <s> is the noble lord now moving the debate on amendment no <e> <s> n <e> <s> i had the clear understanding that we would take this debate on amendments nos <e> <s> h j and k <e> <s> it seems to me far more appropriate for the committee to take it at that time <e>", "<cs> the purpose of the amendment is to ensure that there is immunity for industrial action in a worker versus worker or normally an inter-union dispute where no employer is involved <e> <s> such action has no immunity under the clause as drafted <e> <s> the noble lord has pointed out that clause might possibly remove immunity from those who organise primary as well as secondary action in an inter-union dispute <e> <s> it is of course very rare for there to be a worker versus worker dispute where the employers of the workers involved are not also parties to the dispute <e> <s> these were the grounds on which an amendment to remove disputes between worker and worker from the definition of trade dispute was resisted by the previous secretary of state for employment mr albert booth in the debates in another place on what became the act <e> <s> much more usual are disputes such as the current dispute at the isle of grain site where the essence of the dispute is an argument between different trade unions hut where inevitably a number of employers are closely involved <e>", "<cs> if i may i should like to make the point that the kind of immunities the noble lord referred to have been entrenched in law ever since the liberal government of <e>", "<cs> i hope that the committee will extend to me the indulgence that they extended to the noble lord lord wedderburn when he was introducing his principal areas of interest earlier this evening <e> <s> i tore up a -minute speech on secondary picketing because i thought that the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby had done more good work in five minutes than i would be able to do in minutes or even an hour or so <e>", "<cs> i beg your lordships pardon i know that well it was a slip of the tongue <e> <s> the noble lord lord robbins and indeed the noble lord lord robens were he here are both men whom i should very much like to take with me <e> <s> i would say to the noble lord lord robbins that we are not primarily concerned here with secondary picketing <e> <s> we are concerned with blacking and what are called sympathetic strikes <e> <s> secondary picketing is dealt with in clause which effectively makes it unlawful and does so virtually without qualification or exception <e> <s> i absolutely agree with the noble lord lord robbins that the country would think very ill of us if that were not the case <e>", "<cs> in the later amendment in the name of my noble friend lord orr-ewing and he said at the beginning that he was taking them together so i am taking the debate as a whole there is an attempt to modify this cutback to primary action <e> <s> but nevertheless i know from our own consultations from the usual channels and behind the scenes as well as overt discussion that the principal object of this series of amendments is to limit the immunity to primary action <e> <s> we considered doing that and we rejected it and if your lordships will be tolerant i will try to explain why we rejected it <e>", "<cs> i apologise to my noble friend i should have done that earlier <e> <s> the burden of proof in subsection of clause is on the trade union officials organising the action that is to say they have to show that they have satisfied the test of purpose and likely effect <e>", "<cs> one of the passages of my speech that i hastened over in the interests of getting through in fact argued how we were exactly in line with our manifesto commitment <e> <s> we certainly had no manifesto commitment to outlaw the kind of action which i dealt with though we did think of limiting the immunity in the way i said earlier <e>", "<cs> we have had two major debates of great interest on clause first an astonishing and riveting debate largely between my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor and the noble lord lord wedderburn about whether there is a time-bomb ticking in this clause to prevent all forms of primary action a measure which i do not think would receive any support even on this side of the committee <e> <s> it interested me very much that while both the noble lord lord wedderburn and my noble and learned friend agreed with each other that this was not the intention the argument was as to whether it was the effect <e>", "<cs> i should have thought it unlikely that the government would look with any favour at a law passed in their name through parliament which made striking illegal at any time in any place and under any circumstances <e> <s> it really is no good noble lords trying to whip us into a discussion about primary action <e> <s> that is not what this clause is about <e> <s> i have made it clear what the clause is about <e> <s> i suspect that there is an element of guilty conscience in this objection and i think this clause should at least be given a chance to pass into the industrial relations practice of this country where we feel it will work very well <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> as my noble friend lord mottistone correctly noticed clause deals and is designed to deal with secondary action taken at one place to compel workers of another employer at another place to join a particular trade union usually against their will <e> <s> that is the point of what happened in the slade campaign <e> <s> the clause does not and is not intended to tackle a situation where union members at a workplace refuse to work with non-union workers who are coming to that place of work to do a job <e> <s> that is another issue <e> <s> the clause as drafted applies to secondary industrial action whose purpose is to compel people to join a union or one or two or more trade unions <e>", "<cs> blacking <e>", "<cs> i think that i have already moved a certain way in the direction of the noble lord because this amendment tries to deal with another aspect of the problem which arose in connection with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> we indicated in the debate on amendment no <e> <s> that we share the noble lords dislike of some of these practices but we think that it would be difficult to make sweeping changes in this complex area without first having greater public discussion and consultation than we have been able to have so far <e>", "<cs> i take the splendid silence of the noble lord as a tacit method of saying we dont like slade-type practices but we think that the government have got the correction to them wrong <e> <s> i do not think that anything which the noble lord or his noble friend have said has convinced us that we have got it wrong but i hope that he is not saying to us that in not supporting the clause he is supporting the kind of practices which we have seen <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the impending statements i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> let us start with what can be agreed between the noble lord lord mccarthy and the government <e> <s> i agree that multi-unionism is a central perhaps arguably the central problem in the british economy <e> <s> it means that phrases such as the government must get on with the unions or the government should sit down and talk with the unions are very largely meaningless whether there be a labour government or a conservative government in power <e> <s> i say that because the degree of competition and the size scale and quantity of our trade unions mean that there is an inevitable weakness at the top and in the representative bodies that exist for all unions such as the tuc <e> <s> it means that the tripartism which our competitor economies have found so productive and useful though i must say that since opec that tripartism has come under some strain and is likely to come under more is denied to us <e>", "<cs> i rise at this point not to answer the noble lord lord mccarthy but to make a suggestion to the committee <e> <s> there are some amendments down in the names of the noble baroness lady seear and the noble lord lord rochester which take up some of the minimum wage arguments of schedule ii and which the noble lord lord mccarthy has touched on <e> <s> it may be for the convenience of the committee to take the debate as a whole <e> <s> therefore what i should like to suggest if it is convenient is that they should come in now <e> <s> i will listen to the debate and then answer as best i can <e>", "<cs> i get the feeling that the committee stage is drawing peacefully to its close and that this is possibly the last substantive matter we shall debate <e> <s> i must congratulate as well as thank my noble friend lady hornsby-smith because she may have saved the committee time by putting a part of my case very clearly and succinctly <e> <s> she reminded us about the connection between pay issues and productivity issues and general levels of employment about which we are all concerned <e> <s> behind some of our doubts on schedule lies the spectre of rising unemployment and i thought she put that extremely well <e>", "<cs> i am aware of that but i said to the noble baroness that i was coming to the general level of her debate rather than to the point she made <e> <s> part ii and this will make her intervention clearer of the schedule applies to wages council industries and to employees covered by the agricultural wages boards <e> <s> so it enables clauses to be based on collective agreements covering a significant number of establishments which are already within the field of operation of wages councils <e> <s> therefore our abolition of schedule must be seen in the context of our retention of the wages council system <e> <s> that is the point i really want to make to the noble baroness lady seear <e>", "<cs> i have not made myself clear to my noble friend because what i am dealing with at the moment is in fact the big companies and the ability of big companies to be able to let their arrangements filter down and cause wage disruption in that way <e> <s> i said that we were not opposed to the conclusion or the maintenance of national agreements where those concerned regard this as appropriate <e> <s> but i said that in the con <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord lauderdale praised us for bringing forward this bill and the noble lord lord wynne-jones did not blame us for bringing it forward <e> <s> that is i suppose some modified comfort to me as i am quite used in this house to being attacked on energy issues by the noble lord opposite and by my noble friend from behind me <e> <s> but this time both think that we have perhaps got it about right <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg the noble lords pardon <e> <s> it is as i said the member governments that have been a bit lax here <e>", "<cs> my lords they are the government so to speak at present and so that difficulty would not be there <e> <s> but i might give further reassurance to the noble lord lord davies of leek and to the house by saying that ministers are also discussing inter-ministerially if you like about the whole issue of non-tariff barriers which cause such a lot of concern <e>", "<cs> my lords the government cannot themselves create employment but they can create the sound economic growth which will bring about more real jobs <e> <s> i quite agree with what my noble friend says about the human context but the only way in which growth can come is by a reduction in the level of inflation and that will be very painful not least to employment levels <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the saddest and most debilitating myths in this country is that somewhere there is a little pot of policy which can prevent people from living within their means <e> <s> but there are no easy answers until british manufacturing output is greater and more productive unemployment will continue to rise <e>", "<cs> my lords i am in absolute agreement with the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords the highest historical levels of unemployment yet reached in this country were in and <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that the noble lord is one of those persons who has constantly and misleadingly told people that these are issues of policy they are not they are issues of production <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i can confirm that and it enables me to say that part of our difficulties result from the painful transition from old industry to new industry <e> <s> in fact as an employment minister the new industry is constantly berating me for not finding the skilled personnel that this industry needs <e> <s> it is the process of historical <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the noble lord lord irving if i did not hear

that line <e> <s> by these amendments the noble lord is proposing as he has very clearly and trenchantly set out that there should be no discrimination between industrial customers and domestic gas customers he would therefore continue the preference for the pre- customers and by doing so i am not quite going so far as to accuse him of putting forward wrecking amendments he would altogether create the circumstances for the arbitrary rationing that our bill seeks to avoid <e>", "<cs> in a nutshell they will not be able to get away with that much longer because any country which fails to

have told my noble friend her majestys government were not involved here <e>", "<cs> my lords i am stupefied by that supplementary question from the noble lord <e> <s> as the noble lord is well aware being a considerable expert on coal her majestys government are engaged in very heavy financial subsidies to the coal industry in this country and that is probably one of the reasons why we are increasing exports <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may take up my noble friends point as i said to the noble lord lord strabolgi we are pursuing a bold policy but it would be most welcome to the government if boldness in financial terms from our point of view was met as in many significant cases it is being met by increased productivity within the coal industry itself <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly welcome the degree of enthusiasm with which investment is being placed in the coal industry and i agree with noble lords that this country has a great coal potential <e> <s> like most noble lords i should of course wish to see us importing rather less but that will depend upon the coal board modernising and being able to compete successfully with overseas coal producers and that is what we wish to see achieved <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that in general terms that would be suicide <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the coal industry overall the government are not anxious to stop anything

will continue to be made available <e> <s> it was not felt however that this particular exhibition centre was cost effective <e>", "<cs> my lords i join the noble baroness in paying tribute to the work the centre has done <e> <s> nevertheless it is a very expensive business and it is the view of the health and safety executive that they can continue with the dissemination of necessary information without this annual charge which is rather in excess of a year <e>", "<cs> i am aware of that my lords and that is one reason why i paid tribute to the work the centre had done but we must remember that any monies that can be saved by the health and safety executive in this area can be deployed by them in other areas where they themselves judge they may be cost-effective <e>", "<cs> my lords the health and safety executive like all government bodies have had to recognise the public expenditure constraints under which they must operate and within those constraints they have to decide what the most effective provision for their work may be <e> <s> as i said the health and safety executive came to the conclusion that they could deploy resources more effectively than in the horseferry road centre <e>", "<cs> my lords i have arranged for copies of the posters to be placed in the library <e>", "<cs> i do not think there is any difficulty in publicising the work of the

take proceedings against my noble friend the chief whip with the health and safety executive if he feels he can do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i answered the noble lords earlier question perfectly fairly

industry and the position of his noble <e>", "<cs> my lords like all such surveys and all such figures it depends on what you read into them <e> <s> the results show that about two-thirds of the women who say that they intend to come back in fact do not do so and that seems to us totally to justify our provisions in clause governing notice <e>", "<cs> my lords the survey has taken no account

baroness and the noble lord that if you took surveys about the status of the closed shop in this economy you would have to abolish it overnight <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not ignore surveys i take them with a pinch of salt <e> <s> but i take the advice of the noble baroness and will try to see things steadily and in whole <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that <e> <s> i must be careful that we do not stray during question time into a debate on the employment bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am altogether in agreement with that view from my noble friend <e> <s> indeed a group of employers in south wales told me that the normal absenteeism for which they budget on any given day was halved on th may <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot see quite what that has to do with the question on the order paper <e> <s> but i can say to the noble lord and as an old parliamentary hand he knows this very well that the government are quite determined to keep on with their policies

government have been somewhat pre-empted in their work as we also were with secondary picketing during committee by a splendid speech from the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby as well as from my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter who asked the noble lord lord mccarthy to attend to what the noble lord lord houghton had said <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord howie of troon for giving way <e> <s> i think there is a general feeling and understanding that we have reached seven oclock and a sort of climactic moment of the bill and in order that the amendment to be

of the argument of the noble lord lord mccarthy was that this figure of per cent <e> <s> is unreasonably high <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that my noble friend lord mottistone brought the noble lord lord wedderburn down to earth <e> <s> i think that the metaphor that i used to use in childhood is appropriate that the noble lord lord wedderburn was over-egging the pudding in this particular context and my noble friend brought him back to the amendment <e> <s> i would say to the noble lord lord wedderburn that of course there are always good reasons in anything governing collective behaviour for not doing things but i think he must realise that the time has come for unions to re-enter the community as it were and for themselves to start looking critically at practices which are not simply forcing governments into activities but which are alienating most ordinary people from the movement itself <e> <s> i share with the noble lord lord wedderburn a feeling that that would be highly undesirable <e> <s> we <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very glad indeed i am grateful to him that the noble lord lord mccarthy recognised that there is a relatively narrow difference between the

fair in raising the <e>", "<cs> my lords although it is not directly relevant to the amendment i think it would be worth reminding the house that relative to our european community neighbours we treat issues of pregnancy and employment very well <e> <s> we have a generous amount of leave permitted in the united kingdom up to weeks after the birth as against an average in other community countries of six to eight weeks of paid post-natal leave <e> <s> therefore i think that we have nothing to be ashamed of here <e> <s> as the noble lord lord mccarthy fairly said i am indeed proud of the fact that we are adding to this bill a new right giving women leave for ante-natal care and ante-natal tuition <e> <s> i think that this is a good thing to have done <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down and with the leave of the house may i answer one point of fact that he made about my postbag or about the representations which have been made to me <e> <s> we did proceed throughout this bill by means of consultation and i am perfectly happy to admit to the noble lord that when we suggested that this particular exemption apply to firms of employees or fewer we did get substantial representations from womens organisations and indeed from individuals <e> <s> since in sensible response to a problem which we were always trying to target on the very small employer and maybe at we drew the very small employer too widely we changed our minds and altered it down i for one have received nothing at all <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i could answer the point made by the noble lord <e> <s> first i am in no sense trying to blackball the noble lord lord lee for joining pickets but there is serious concern about the numbers involved in picket lines and some limitation has to be derived where union officials are concerned or one could get a proliferation of officials in the undesirable way that i described <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has asked me a question so perhaps with leave i could answer it <e> <s> the concept of attending at or near a place of work has been used in statutes since and we have no evidence that the courts have had any difficulty in construing it <e> <s> at or near does not mean on or in <e> <s> neither past nor present law nor this clause provide any right or immunity for pickets to trespass on private property or commit any other civil wrong or any crime <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall gladly try to clear up this point <e> <s> under the clause as we have drafted it the position is that a convenor may picket at any of the sites for which he is responsible where members of his own union whom he represents are picketing lawfully <e> <s> he may also of course picket at his own place of work whether or not he is accompanying members of his union <e> <s> our view was that that would cover per cent <e> <s> of all the likely cases that would apply <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to trespass on the conventions of report and i have asked for the leave of the house rather often but i can in fact answer the point made by the noble baroness lady seear so perhaps the house would allow me to do so <e> <s> as well as being able to operate through a shop steward on those in our contention very rare events when the convenor would not be allowed to attend the picket line under the bill he could if it were that important of course arrange to attend simply by <e>", "<cs> my lords once again noble lords opposite are attempting to weaken the effect of the clause and open up the scope for secondary picketing which we are trying to outlaw <e> <s> in doing so it is our view that they are going against the feelings and better judgment not only of this house but of the vast majority of people in this country including a very large majority of union members <e>", "<cs> my lords i really beg the noble lord lord mccarthy to attend to the mood of the house on this issue <e> <s> it will be no surprise to the noble lord that i agree with the remarks of his noble friend lady burton of coventry <e> <s> it may be more of a surprise to him to say that i also agree with what the noble lord lord mishcon said <e> <s> if the noble lord lord mishcon follows the noble lord lord mccarthy in voting for this amendment he will be getting rid of clause the effect being to restore the law on picketing to its present state whereas we are seeking to limit lawful picketing to a persons own place of work <e> <s> it is absolutely agreed throughout the country that the trouble and civil violence and the criminal violence which can take place on picket lines is overwhelmingly not conducted by those who are lawfully picketing at their own place of dispute and this seems to me really not to need arguing <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it would be for the convenience of the house if i gave the governments view of the amendments moved by the noble lord lord spens at this point <e>", "<cs> my lords the case which the noble lord mentioned of the mines railways and electricity supply board is not in fact correct <e> <s> it is very doubtful indeed whether the immunity would apply to that kind of action against the central electricity generating board <e>", "<cs> my lords we had a run over this field at the committee stage although in the context of a somewhat different amendment and therefore i hope that i need not detain the house very long in replying to it <e> <s> the noble lord lord wedderburn has explained that his amendment seeks to retain immunity for industrial action regardless in the context of the previous debate of whether this is primary or secondary action where the dispute is between workers rather than being a worker and employer dispute <e> <s> he has argued that where there is a pure worker v worker dispute such action has no immunity under the clause as drafted because of the way in which secondary action is defined in subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords we are indeed in the realms of theology <e> <s> far from having any connection that i can see with wage resistance wage claims wage settlements or wage bargaining the effects of the amendment would be to remove from the bill clause on secondary action <e> <s> as the debate on the amendments in the name of the noble lord lord spens fairly clearly demonstrated the government have been seeking with some difficulty and with a great deal of conviction in spite of the difficulty to restrict the almost infinite almost cosmic immunities which the last government gave to trade unions in pursuance of actions in furtherance of trade disputes <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords since second reading on th may we have debated the bill for four days in committee and for two days on report <e> <s> in addition there has been a days debate on second reading and todays debate <e> <s> nearly amendments were tabled at the committee stage and more than on report and the bulk of these amendments were debated fully <e> <s> the noble lord lord kaldor though he made some kind remarks for which i thank him castigated me for not having altered the bill or not having accepted any alteration to it in any way <e> <s> the noble lord is not quite right there <e> <s> the most substantial government amendment was brought to our attention by the noble lord lord robens of woldingham and we followed his advice and altered the bill accordingly <e> <s> there was a considerable and important amendment on joinder in the name of my noble friend lord de la warr which we also accepted <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say that while i am sorry to have disappointed my noble friend it is precisely because the manpower services commission have had the interests of agriculture in mind that the provision has been made <e> <s> we are anxious about any danger of interference with the normal channels of training and recruitment in an industry which has a declining labour force <e> <s> on the point about whether six months is sufficient for a young person to decide whether or not he wishes to go into agriculture while i agree with my noble friend that it does not cover all four seasons i should have thought that two seasons would have been sufficient experience <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have told the house in other connections the provision for the manpower services commissions youth opportunity programme has been increased from between per cent <e> <s> and per cent <e> <s> i certainly agree with the noble lord that it is demoralising to be out of work <e> <s> i am happy to say that the take-up rate into real employment from the youth opportunities programme is between per cent <e> <s> and per cent <e> <s> which i hope the noble lord will agree is a good record <e> <s> if there is any sign of this record flagging we will take steps to correct it <e>", "<cs> we are aware of the need for that my lords <e> <s> the noble baroness will probably agree with us that one can learn a very great deal by working for six months on a farm let us say <e> <s> one should know enough in that way to know whether it would be the right kind of

glad that the noble lord reminded me of it <e> <s> but the fact remains as i said to the noble lord lord rhodes and previously to the noble lord lord jacques that the price of gas is very intimately related though with some time lag to the price of oil <e> <s> we can no more protect industry including the paper industry from gas price rises in the long term than we can from price rises in respect of oil <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said to the noble lord i do not accept that <e> <s> however i may be able to give him an example <e> <s> let us say that the dutch government had negotiated gas contracts for a fixed price and for a term of years with the german government <e> <s> this is a hypothetical example <e> <s> it would not be until that term of years had come to an end that the dutch government would be able in respect of the german government to raise their tariffs <e> <s> both germany and britain do not operate on fixed tariffs they operate in respect of industry on individually negotiated contracts and that is another significant difference <e>", "<cs> my lords i should be delighted to publish a written answer to any question that the noble lord wishes to put to me <e> <s> as i said one of our difficulties is that many gas contracts in this country as well as in germany do not follow fixed rates as the noble lord appears to suggest but are negotiated between the consumers and the suppliers <e> <s> this of course is not a matter within the remit of the government but is within the remit of the british gas corporation <e> <s> however i should be delighted to publish the figures that we have which show that there is no substantial difference between our own tariffs overall and those on the continental mainland <e>", "<cs> my lords we are continually sensitive of and continually working to reduce any disparities in fair competition between us and our trading partners whether they are in the european community or outside it <e> <s> as to the horticultural industry at large regrettably we cannot insulate it from dear energy costs <e> <s> it will have to make that adaptation itself <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said to the noble lord lord bruce of donington if like the noble lord lord bruce the noble lord cares to put down a question for written answer and i would respectfully suggest that complex issues of tariffs are perhaps better published in the form of a written answer i shall of course answer it <e> <s> with regard to the united states of america and this is my own view it seems to me that americas failure at sufficient speed to adapt to dear energy costs is probably largely behind her inflation and her very withered currency <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think it is true to say that our european competitors are gaining where we are not and certainly our own energy position is considerably more favourable in terms of supply than is theirs <e> <s> however we are all having to adapt painfully to dearer energy costs <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the point which i would wish to make in respect of america i made in respect of the previous supplementary question asked by the noble lord on the other side of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords ultimately the benefit of north sea gas as of north sea oil derives on this economy and this country as a whole <e> <s> it is certainly true that in this aspect of our

good run with it on second reading <e> <s> i must say such is the importance that we attach to the industry and indeed to the bill that no one could resent the fact that it has caused a certain amount

answer the department has of course its own monitoring service and we shall now be able to compare the two <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have been criticised for adding to inflation by putting up energy prices <e>", "<cs> but despite the chorus of hear hear i am afraid i must say that that is an entirely false assumption for the following reasons <e> <s> unless energy prices are related to world market clearing levels effectively a subsidy is being provided for them <e> <s> if a subsidy is being provided for them it will have to be paid for by the taxpayer in one form or another and

country will find itself overall in an adverse competitive position <e>", "<cs> my lords if i am to give a precise figure as to the profits of the gas industry the noble lord lord leatherland will have to put down another question but i can say to him that the distinction between the profits of the gas industry and the national assets of this country really is a false distinction <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord lord kaldor has put the matter as i would expect very clearly <e> <s> what he is saying effectively is that it would be good and desirable for british industry to have a subsidy on energy costs <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a difference of view between us <e>", "<cs> my lords i would have thought that to most people if you sell an article in your possession at below what it will fetch an element of subsidy is involved <e>", "<cs> my lords there is of course a profit but the profit devolves to the nation <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that would be true if my right honourable friend were convinced that british industry is in an adverse competitive position but in fact that is not the view of my right honourable friend <e> <s> i have to relay that that is not his view <e> <s> but i do have to say as i have said in this house in the past and i am well aware <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have come to a policy decision as the noble lord knows but as i said i am aware of the strong feelings about this issue and i understand that the noble lord lord irving has an unstarred question down for debate <e> <s> to my great sorrow i cannot be here myself but my noble friend lord strathcona may be able to give the house rather more satisfaction on that occasion than i have been able to do on this <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> the government are maintaining two propositions which i can put very simply and i have put them before so i will try not to detain the house on them <e> <s> fundamentally the national gas assets as the noble lord lord balogh sitting beside the noble lord is well aware accrue to this nation <e> <s> if they are sold at below their market clearing levels whatever other advantages there may be or the rights or wrongs of that policy an element of subsidy will be given ultimately by the nation towards those assets <e>", "<cs> my lords the reality of the situation is that the wages councils minimum rates are lower by some per cent <e> <s> on average than wage rates in other sectors of the economy <e> <s> nevertheless the government are concerned that particularly in a time of inflation there is often publicity about the percentile increases awarded by wages councils which could have damaging knock-on effects in other areas <e> <s> i have no evidence as the minister directly responsible here that there have been such damaging effects but we are concerned about it and we are watching that closely <e>", "<cs> my lords i think some concern about the role of the independents has been expressed not only as the noble lord lord peart has said in the agricultural wages board sector but also in the wages councils system <e> <s> i have as a result of representations looked very closely at the role of the independents and i am satisfied that they have not shown any consistent bias which could be called inflationary <e> <s> they seem to me to have operated very evenhandedly between the different sectors represented <e> <s> i should perhaps just add <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am a retired bumpkin if i may put it that way <e> <s> my advice is that the agricultural wages boards have the general support of the farming community but i notice that my noble friend the minister of state for agriculture fisheries and food is sitting beside me and i will relay formally what the noble lord lord davies of leek has said <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the house would be surprised if i gave any suggestions that there would be large resources released to any part of the public sector at the moment <e> <s> i have not had complaints about the operation of the wages inspectorate system <e> <s> i have seen wages inspectors and their role is advisory rather than punitive but so far as i can see the system is working reasonalbly well at present <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right <e> <s> the government have no power to intervene in the deliberations of the wages councils but they have enabling powers to abolish wages councils where they are no longer needed because collective bargaining arrangements are coming into force <e> <s> in my own time of office we have abolished a number of such councils <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may work backwards through the noble lords list of supplementaries and take first the issue of the steel industry which is affected by electricity prices i think that the noble lord and the house will find that price comparisons are extremely difficult because they are influenced by what are the main sources of raw material for electricity generation which exist in the different countries <e> <s> it would be extremely difficult to provide absolute standardisation in that way because some countries are more fortunate than others in their raw materials <e> <s> the noble lord and the house will be aware that the cbi are collecting factual data and will be presenting their findings to the government so that they are able to challenge the governments overall view which is that our overall energy costs are comparable with those of our european competitors <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for reminding the house that the situation with regard to energy costs both in this country and in the community is very fluid and that circumstances change <e> <s> there is evidence that british industry did operate under a competitive disadvantage but as higher energy costs work through and contracts are revised in the community industries the noble earl and the house will find that the competitive disadvantage is rapidly narrowing <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to the noble viscount i think he is confusing the issue of being fortunate in terms of supply and of being fortunate in terms of cost <e> <s> this country is fortunate in having a supply of dear-cost energy <e> <s> it cannot afford to undercut the dearness of that cost <e> <s> it is not fortunate in having sources of cheap energy available to it today such as hydro-electric energy <e>", "<cs> my lords neither i nor anybody else in the government have in any way attempted to conceal the fact that british industry operates under a competitive disadvantage over <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a great deal of truth in that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of what the noble lord lord rochester says <e> <s> i should point out to him that industry is also very properly anxious that interest rates should be brought down as fast as possible and that would be difficult to do if there were placed on the exchequer additional costs <e>", "<cs> my lords i am in complete agreement with the noble lord and i think that for many years our general training position in this country again in comparison with our competitors has not been very satisfactory <e> <s> the government are looking at the overall provision <e> <s> however the point i wish to make to the noble lord and to the house is that it is in the overwhelming interests of industry itself that it should engage in training and all our competitor industries do engage in training <e> <s> the government are supplementing it to a considerable degree million a year roughly for apprenticeships alone as well as an additional placing for new electronics and computer training <e> <s> nevertheless the burden must fall primarily on industry <e>", "<cs> my lords it is very much my view that industry cannot afford not to make this essential investment and of course it will not be very long until industry will be needing the skilled trainees in order to take account of the upturn <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear that the noble lord is indulging in a contradiction <e> <s> he is asking for additional public expenditure on the one hand and for reduced rates of interest on the other <e> <s> sadly those two things are incompatible <e>", "<cs> my lords we do not leave it solely to industry <e> <s> i said that the lions share must of course fall upon industry as it always has done <e> <s> but we make very substantial contributions to mitigating bottlenecks and shortages as i said earlier where young people alone are concerned it is to the tune of million a year <e> <s> where overall training is concerned including that of the adult unemployed we spend very much more than that around million a year <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments economic policies are designed to bring down inflation and create an economic climate in which investment and growth will stimulate an expansion of employment for young people and other workers <e> <s> in addition in the six months ending on th september this year over young people were helped by the manpower services commissions youth opportunities programme <e> <s> at least a quarter of a million young people will be helped by easter <e> <s> it is also expected that some young people will be supported in apprenticeship training under the training for skills programme in the youth opportunities programme <e> <s> other special employment measures are currently being reviewed and decisions about their shape and size in will be announced as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for what my noble friend has said <e> <s> the yop has indeed been successful and our records show that up to per cent <e> <s> of young people find work immediately after leaving the schemes <e> <s> we are in receipt of aid from europe to which we have of course substantially contributed <e> <s> perhaps aid is the wrong word but we are in receipt of funds through the european social fund for training and that affects the provisions for young people in the assisted areas <e>", "<cs> my lords the optimism of my answer was related to the success of the youth opportunities programme <e> <s> it was not a comment on the general employment prospects for young people that is another matter altogether <e> <s> the general employment prospects for young people are linked to the general employment prospects for everybody and they can be improved only by bringing down inflation and by restoring this countrys competitive position <e>", "<cs> my lords taking the second part of the noble baronesss supplementary first i should like to pay a tribute to the work of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i have myself on a number of occasions visited the north-east and i shall be going again to look at the problems of youth employment in that area and also at the working of the special programmes to which my noble friend lady elliots question originally referred <e> <s> i am at the moment confident that we will meet our targets and service the needs of young people in the youth opportunities programme <e> <s> if we look like not doing so we shall of course return to it as a matter of first priority <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend as is his wont is steering me down a very knotty path <e> <s> it could be argued that the european social fund money is simply cash limited treasury money in the first place <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate what my noble friend has said <e> <s> a problem that we have with the social fund is that it beams the money towards regions of special difficulty and it defines those regions rather more widely than we do which would mean that in the case of the london borough of brent though i am acutely aware as is my noble friend of the problems there that region would be considered too small or as existing simultaneously with a more prosperous region such as the rest of the south-east to warrant consideration under the social fund <e> <s> that is a problem we have but i have been taking this up within the tripartite standing committee in brussels <e>", "<cs> my lords i would need special notice to give a precise answer as to the average time taken but off the cuff i think it is round about four weeks which when one considers the scale of this programme seems to me to be pretty good going <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad the noble lord lord rochester has raised that because i did not really deal with it when my noble friend lord bethell talked about the longer-term unemployed <e> <s> we are very concerned about this and we are reviewing the provision for the longer-term unemployed <e> <s> i would hope that the longer-term unemployed might be usefully engaged in helping to clear up areas of urban dereliction which make such a depressing atmosphere for investment and growth <e>", "<cs> my lords when i first suggested some things rather along the lines of the noble lords supplementary question that the young unemployed might engage in voluntary work the roof rather fell in around my ears and it was suggested that i was directing labour <e> <s> i am glad to say that it is an idea which is gaining increasing support and i am glad that the noble lord seems to subscribe to it <e>", "<cs> my lords that pertains rather to the question asked earlier by the noble lord lord rochester but the msc helps employers through the iptb system to take on more apprentices than they need and that could be described as a form of training for stock <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree with my noble friends remarks on the importance of editorial independence and the importance of a free press to a democratic system <e> <s> the only place where i part company with my noble friend is in his use of the word imposed <e> <s> the code does not impose anything it simply points to the best general practice <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think there is anything wrong in raising important issues in question time <e> <s> i could not agree with the noble lord lord ardwick about that <e> <s> however the kind of experience the noble lord brings to press questions is respected by us all and it is that kind of experience we have looked for during the consultation period <e> <s> as i said in my original answer we have been pretty pleased with the support we have received <e>", "<cs> my lords paragraph is of course as the noble lord said very important to us and we pay great regard to it <e> <s> i am not aware of any union-management agreements in national papers and i think on the whole that the greatest threat to editorial independence comes not from the sort of issues that we have been raising but from restrictive practices and inability to move with the times in the industry generally <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are coming in for a fair amount of stick from editors but that does not mean to say that we think that they should be disbarred from doing so <e>", "<cs> my lords i am of course naturally glad to say that the present government have succeeded in getting agreement where the previous government failed because this is a matter of great importance to all governments whatever political complexion they may have <e>", "<cs> no my lords i do not think i do <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we are on target <e> <s> as i say the report does consider this to be achieveable <e> <s> the government do of course consider <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not read the reports to which the noble lord lord strabolgi refers as due to the pressure of parliamentary business i have not seen <e>", "<cs> my lords i would have to have notice of the question <e> <s> the government of course do have a great interest as does the entire country in ensuring that production is stepped up in the north sea and that is precisely why we are getting ahead with this gas-gathering project <e>", "<cs> my lords i imagine that it does involve matters of commercial confidentiality as the british gas corporation the british petroleum company and mobil oil are involved in the organising group but i will investigate and i will write to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords design work for the tension leg platform is largely being carried out in the united kingdom and this phase is not expected to be completed before the summer of <e> <s> it is not possible at this stage to assess either the value or percentage of orders which may ultimately be placed with united kingdom industry <e> <s> conoco have however indicated to the department of energy that they expect united kingdom industry to win a substantial level of orders in both the design and construction of the platform <e> <s> we shall be monitoring that position very closely <e>", "<cs> yes my lords of course scottish provision would also be covered by my original answer <e>", "<cs> my lords when is a ship not a ship <e> <s> when it is a tension leg i imagine <e> <s> i would have to be given notice of that question but i will write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords as a minister with employment responsibilities i am of course extremely interested in the point my noble friend makes and i agree with him <e> <s> i am encouraged that this technology is developing here <e> <s> it should have very wide applications in for example the future development of deep waters all round the world <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> it is left to the police <e> <s> this is simply guidance to what would be the normal sensible procedure but it is utterly at the discretion of the police as to what the number should be <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord but while the point he is making is fresh in the mind of the house i think i should point out to him that in section b of the code on picketing it is made quite clear what the employment act says about picketing and also that picketing outside ones own place of work is quite clearly illegal <e> <s> it says it there in section b <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that it could only be in your lordships house that we could debate two codes one of which is about the closed shop and enjoy a notable contribution from a member of the house who claimed to have invented it <e> <s> i do not know whether the noble lord lord shinwell is altogether pleased with the development of his child but he is a realist and he knows that children sometimes grow up responsibly sometimes they lose their manners and sometimes like most of us they exhibit a combination of the two <e>", "<cs> my lords the government as i shall say to the noble lord because i think that i have detailed answers to most of his questions are taking the view of the secretary of state on the existing best practice plus an interpretation of what the law is <e> <s> it seems to me that the noble lord is really asking too much of a code <e> <s> it is perfectly fair for the noble lord lord mccarthy to say that we do not need codes or that this code is of no practical value if that is what he believes but it is not the job of a code to spell out these distinctions as i say it is to give an indication of good practice <e> <s> but i shall return to the point of the closed shop when i answer the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords since may i think that there have been nine public opinion polls of both union members and non-union members supporters of the labour party and opponents of the labour party on issues connected with picketing and on issues connected with the closed shop <e> <s> off-the-cuff the figure i remember is an per cent <e> <s> majority of ordinary union members most of them supporting the labour party registering their opinion in those polls about these provisions <e> <s> i have never been one to give credence to opinion polls which can fluctuate very strongly but there is an amazing pattern of development here <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend lord fraser for reminding us of the limitations of law and <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said earlier six is a general number and is the secretary of states view with the authoritative backing of parliament as to what might be reasonable for the purpose of peacefully persuading but of course it is still left to the discretion of the police who have responsibilities for public order and for ensuring that breaches of the peace do not occur to limit the numbers if they so choose <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have thought that anybody who took a commonsense reading rather than as i said earlier an academic or legalistic reading of that provision would see that they were quite clearly separated <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the draft code of practice laid before the house on th november be approved <e>", "<cs> i do not think i can add to my original answer my lords we are putting our case within a week <e>", "<cs> i agree with my noble friend my lords and that is why the memorial which of course has had to be most carefully prepared is going right away before the court <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for helping me out <e> <s> i should have said that a moment ago in response to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords we have repeatedly made it clear that we have great sympathy for the position of the applicants who suffered under the previous governments legislation which we have as my noble friend is well aware reformed <e> <s> but in view of what he said we are prepared to consider some accommodation to deal with any particular difficulties which the applicants have suffered as a result of the delays due to these careful submissions of the issue <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to make provision for regulating the design <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much share my noble friends concern at the inflationary effects of any overcharging by nationalised industries or monopoly suppliers but while the latest forecast suggests that average fuel prices in may not rise to the level originally estimated at the beginning of the year it is of course still not clear how this coming first part of the winter will turn out <e> <s> i repeat to my noble friend and to the house that of course we will see that the electricity council takes this into account when its new tariffs are made so that inflationary adjustment will take place next april <e>", "<cs> my lords the system obtained for a time whereby consumers enjoyed the fuel cost adjustment which industry now enjoys and which quarterly-payers now enjoy but in fact the consumers association very much objected to this and this was one of the reasons why the system was changed <e> <s> but i would suggest to the noble baroness and to the house that i think the system will even out because any overestimate in a given year will of course be allowed for when the next years tariffs are set <e>", "<cs> my lords i take that point <e> <s> i think ministers are perhaps always in a rather uncomfortable role defending these large industries which are very independent of them but i think it is fair to the electricity industry to say that charges which are related to fuel costs which are themselves related to wage costs in the coal industry to the supply of oil and gas to the situation in the middle east and to the rest are notoriously difficult to forecast and one therefore has to try to even the thing out over probably more than one fiscal year <e>", "<cs> my lords i need separate notice of that but i can tell my noble friend that my advice is that in the year the electricity council got their sums wrong on the other side of things and the consumers benefited accordingly <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend on both counts but he will appreciate that one cannot be transparent in the middle of negotiation <e>", "<cs> my lords if i tangle on definitions with the noble and learned lord i know that i shall lose <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the negotiations are completely finalised yet <e> <s> that is why i must be cautious about what i say in public <e>", "<cs> my lords with hindsight that is indeed possible <e> <s> but since we came into office we have as my noble friend knows tried to accelerate proceedings as we all have a very great interest in the development of these valuable fields <e>", "<cs> my lords several different prospective purchasers for the natural gas liquids have declared themselves and are in discussion with the organising group and the other interested parties <e> <s> the destination of these natural gas liquids is an important element in the timely planning and completion of the projected gas gathering system <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state for energy will announce in another place any decisions the government take in the interests of advancing the project <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his tolerance towards the fact that on neither of his two questions have i been able to say as much as i should like <e> <s> i can flesh out my second answer a little in respect of his supplementary by saying that the competitors for the ethane for petrochemical use are dow and highland hydrocarbons at nigg bay occidental near peterhead shell esso bp and ici at mossmorran grangemouth and tees-side <e> <s> the rest of the natural gas liquids containing propane butane and natural gas are likely to be fractionated at a coastal location and the products shipped <e> <s> but they could also of course provide feedstock for petrochemical or other local development <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree about the urgency and i do not think our colleagues on the continental mainland have any cause at all for disquiet <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the problems which the government have and i am in a sense glad that they have it is that domestic gas is very heavily subsidised <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much welcome this debate in the name of the noble lord lord scanlon and would like to congratulate him most warmly on the way in which he opened it <e> <s> inevitably deepening recession and unemployment rising from levels which are already unprecedentedly high make it difficult for all of us to catch a glimpse of some kindly light amid the encircling gloom <e> <s> inevitably again whichever government are in office during a recession must expect fierce criticism that their choice of policies are making an already bad situation worse and i shall face up to any such criticisms and answer them <e> <s> but the terms of the noble lords motion as well as the way in which he moved it do direct us towards the positive and do so recognise that some of our difficulties stem from poor adaptation to change and inadequate preparation for future needs <e> <s> the government endorse that view and i am most grateful to the noble lord for giving us this opportunity to agree with him and to show our hand on training matters <e> <s> i am also very much looking forward to the maiden speech of an ex senior colleague in a previous conservative government the noble lord lord boardman later this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords since the noble baroness has said that she will not be here later and since she has made a direct appeal to the government i think that i should answer her now <e> <s> we do do this <e> <s> we are taking up this initiative <e> <s> we are trying to detensify it by doing it in the context of the work of the manpower services commission <e> <s> this is where many of our correlated training activities take place <e> <s> it is not enough <e> <s> we want to do more <e> <s> but we are doing it <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been an extremely good and in the main very unpartisan debate <e> <s> i have certainly learnt a great deal from it and i can assure the house that in all our provisions for training we shall take account of what is said <e> <s> there will be a very direct input from my department there <e> <s> i totally acquit the noble lord lord lee of newton in regard to the anxieties that he mentioned because of course we share them very much <e> <s> if he will do me the kindness of reading my opening remarks he will i think see a fairly precise analysis of the present industrial crisis and he apologised to the house for using that word but i used it too without apology since quite clearly that is what we are in <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot resist repeating a remark i was forced to make to the noble lord lord lee of newton yesterday that among the sternest critics of the governments policies at the moment is professor freidman <e> <s> however happily that is not connected with energy issues <e> <s> when i was receiving my briefing for this debate i made a gentlemans small bet with officials that at some point in the debate the energy activities or the energy contents from use of your lordships house in a physical sense of the word would be raised and i was very anxious as to whether under the bill it could be described as a heat generator or a gas appliance <e> <s> of course it is not covered by the bill not being by any stretch of the imagination a new product or appliance which is where the bill is designed to fall <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> however my noble friend will see from the bill that we are also flexible in terms that this may need updating from time to time as technology advances <e> <s> the aim is to give the public and the user a clear signal that this is an energy-efficient appliance <e>", "<cs> my lords i will certainly look into that and notify the noble earl <e>", "<cs> my lords i am clearly grateful to my noble friend for her remarks <e> <s> far from cutting down as the noble baroness may be aware we have very substantially increased our provision for the scheme in this year in a way that effectively amounts to a new deal for the young unemployed <e>", "<cs> my lords without notice i cannot give the noble baroness information about offenders <e> <s> but on the substantive part of her question the vast majority are getting full-time employment in the areas of employment in which they have received their training <e>", "<cs> my lords we have extended the scheme until it covers an undertaking to every young person man and woman in the country <e> <s> further than that really does not exist <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for this blessing of the schemes that we have been extending and preparing <e> <s> on the subject of the grant i recognise that the freezing of the grant at pre-existing levels is a blow to some young people <e> <s> i would only add that we have succeeded so greatly as my earlier answers indicated in extending the scheme that we felt that was a necessary sacrifice which had to be made <e> <s> also our schemes of this kind are directed particularly at and year-olds where it is not such an unreasonable level of provision <e> <s> otherwise i am most grateful to the right reverend prelate for his remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords we undertook such an examination about the transition from school to work in this country at the moment of coming into office and some of the results of that examination will shortly be available <e> <s> we are as the debate in your lordships house last week in the name of the noble lord lord scanlon will indicate also asking the msc to look at the whole range of training provision <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said to the house in that same debate last week providing the money for these schemes is only half the battle <e> <s> one has also to find the sponsors the employers and voluntary organisations ready and prepared to do their bit <e> <s> i cannot break down the exact proportion for my noble friend but i can say that the msc is confident that it will be able to find the sponsorship to meet this very ambitious target and that will of course involve the voluntary organisations very heavily <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously the levels of youth employment will depend very strongly on the overall improvement in the economy <e> <s> what we are doing is to provide a transition period of work experience with a stronger training element for those who on leaving school are particularly caught by the present recession <e> <s> we are covering two years in these provisions and we would hope for a pretty substantive overall improvement in the economic situation by the end of <e>", "<cs> my lords i would refer my noble friend to the statement made in the other place on st november by my right honourable <e>", "<cs> my lords i must be careful i think not to discuss in a parliamentary answer questions of peoples mania <e> <s> i think that people have a reasonable mania to be employed and the government certainly have a very strong interest in people being employed although unlike noble lords opposite we are modest about the contribution that we can make to that end <e> <s> but we do have a very large network of regional subsidies and regional incentives for people to try and spread employment throughout the country and those are continually being monitored by the government <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> we are setting ourselves a per cent <e> <s> target and we shall of course be grieved if it is less than that <e> <s> we shall do our best to maintain such a high target <e> <s> as i said in my pervious answer it is a very ambitious programme but the msc are confident that if we get sufficient national goodwill from local authorities individual employers and the rest they will be able to meet their target <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i have that information but i will see if i can extract it from the department and write to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble and learned lord misinterprets me <e> <s> i indeed think it should be encouraged and for that reason the government are considering a pilot project in this field <e> <s> but the terms of the original question indicate that it is not competitive at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i think my noble friend has a point <e> <s> what the government have to weigh obviously are various plural systems of energy generation and what may be inconceivable or expensive at this moment might rapidly become conceivable and cheap in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most impressed and i am sure the house is by the noble lords expertise <e> <s> i am not throwing it back in his face <e> <s> we are not passing up any studies whatsoever <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding is that the government are in consultation with the national coal board on this issue not with british petroleum <e> <s> if i am wrong i will let my noble friend know <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in my previous answers we are studying the issue very carefully and we will try to let the house know what has resulted from the study as soon as ever we can <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i agree with my noble friend that the government are very conscious of the need to preserve the attractiveness of the continental shelf as an area for new investment <e> <s> but i would point our to my noble friend that oil companies have benefited from substantial oil price rises in the two-year period <e> <s> the proposed measures do in our view reflect the need to strike a fair balance between the interests of the nation and the companies <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to say and i congratulate them upon this that oil companies are not by their nature particularly reticent in their representations <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that that is somewhat wide of the original question <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly as an employment minister i feel a particular frustration at the fact that during a worldwide shortage of rigs and during a period of very great international demand for rigs british industry is not reacting quickly enough <e> <s> it is reacting but we should all like to see it react much more quickly <e> <s> i urge all companies who have a capacity to service these needs to get on with it <e>", "<cs> my lords the manpower services commission has been asked in drawing up plans for the new community enterprise programme to make provision for the private sector to participate to a greater extent than is possible at present under the special temporary employment programme <e> <s> this will be achieved both by doubling the overall number of employment opportunities available and by allowing sponsors of schemes to derive a private gain from sponsorship providing the gain is secondary to the community benefit which all schemes must provide <e>", "<cs> my lords while i thank my my noble friend for her comments about the character of the project i should like to reassure her that consultation is of course involved due to the tripartite nature of the manpower services commission <e> <s> i certainly agree with her that one needs the co-operation of trade unions because the last thing that we want to do is to give the impression that in helping young people we are in some way denying other people their legitimate job <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in an earlier answer this week finding the money for these schemes is only half the battle <e> <s> one needs the most plural widespread approach in terms of sponsorships whether they are private employers district manpower committees local authorities or the rest <e> <s> we urge everybody to try to put their backs into this great national effort <e>", "<cs> my lords in the main the position is as follows the government provide the finance for the administration of these schemes and also the finance for the allowances paid to the young <e>", "<cs> my lords i could not disagree more profoundly with the noble lord and i hope that he will not look upon that as in any way impertinent to use his phrase <e> <s> the fact is that the cutbacks imposed on local authorities are very small in relation to the size of their total budgets <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord with his experience of rural areas for making that point <e> <s> one of the reasons for setting up the community enterprise programme is that it can operate on a national level and that of course will bring the rural areas into its orbit <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that there has been a certain amount of confusion over this issue and i am glad to take the opportunity posed by the noble lords supplementary question to clear it up <e> <s> skill centres are to some degree related to local em <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be very happy to have a look at any skill centre which the noble lord brings to my attention <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the pleasures of this house is that very often the supplementary questions which one expects from ones own side are expressed by the side opposite <e> <s> i should be delighted to try to provide horses for any courses which the noble lord may suggest <e>", "<cs> my lords i am informed by the manpower services commission that training and work experience given in their youth opportunities programme or special temporary employment programme for unemployed young people or adults is related to the needs of both the participants and the local labour market <e> <s> the training content of yop is constantly being improved and the government and msc believe training should play a significant part in the development of the enlarged special employment measures that will provide around opportunities for young people and adults in <e>", "<cs> my lords off-the-job learning is normally available on a day-release basis with a college of further education or other competent provider <e> <s> in areas where no provision can be run my information is that the msc will fund block or residential courses <e> <s> on the second part of my noble friends supplementary question relating to new technology i am glad to say that this will be a major feature of the schemes <e> <s> we are most anxious to break down the myth that the new technologies are open only to people with high degrees of skills <e> <s> the point of a machine is that people with relatively low skills can learn to operate it and the msc is providing courses in computer training for those with low educational attainments <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly would not quarrel with the noble lord when he asserts that the self-esteem of people out of work in the majority of cases through no fault of their own is a very important factor <e> <s> that is why our special employment measures provide real work experience and real jobs sponsored by the government in order that that self-esteem should not be lost <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a large and controversial issue but the noble lord will know very well that it is in the interests of no government even at the most basic economic and political level that people should be out of work <e> <s> the problem with present-day unemployment is that it is the consequence first of a long competitive decline in british industry and secondly of the inability of modern governments of either political complexion to reflate without galloping inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that the noble lord lord davies of leek has raised this point because that is precisely what the government are doing in the new community enterprise programme which is designed to concentrate upon environmental improvement and such projects and which comes into effect in april <e>", "<cs> my lords only the most substantial and rapid improvement in productivity and efficiency can give british shipbuilders the prospect of a viable future <e> <s> the government believe that the necessary determination to do this exists within the corporation <e> <s> overall british shipbuilders orders are likely to be about per cent <e> <s> up on levels <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that my noble friends concern is a very proper one but it is more a matter for the board of british shipbuilders than for <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously the future of the british shipbuilding industry is closely connected with future naval orders <e> <s> the government are fully aware of the industrial implications of decisions on warship procurement or on merchant navy recruitment which we may need to take in the light of recent announcements <e>", "<cs> my lords i can say to my noble friend that my advice is that of the present provision of some million about million represents a sum for redundancy and is therefore a one-off payment <e> <s> i cannot comment on the second part until the government have come to their decision about a corporate plan but i can say that we would expect a significantly smaller figure <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that one of the few things which are not controversial between the parties or indeed in other areas about british steel is that it has been over-manned for a very long time <e>", "<cs> my lords i should need separate notice of that question <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord lord tanlaw for giving way <e> <s> i am entirely in the hands of the committee but the noble lord said that he wanted to take amendments nos <e> <s> and together and since these amendments are effectively about the scope of the bill in relation to particular appliances i wonder whether the noble lord lord strabolgi would also like us to debate his amendments nos <e> <s> and in this block and then we can take the governments amendment which is largely formal separately <e> <s> if we had a general debate on clause i would that be convenient <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to both noble lords for consenting that these amendments on clause except the government amendment should be taken together <e> <s> all these amendments have in common that they are about extending the scope of the bill to cover new categories of appliance <e> <s> the government have given very careful consideration to which appliances should be covered by the bill <e> <s> we are mindful of the fact that the costs of operating a system of type approval of appliances will fall on industry because of course type approval bodies will charge fees <e>", "<cs> may i answer the two general points which have been made by the noble lord lord beaumont of whitley and his noble friend <e> <s> i do get the impression that my original answer was not entirely satisfactory and i think it was not entirely satisfactory <e> <s> the reason why it was not entirely satisfactory was because i did not put it very well <e> <s> another reason why it was not entirely satisfactory was because the phrase market forces is apt to get us into the arena of macro-economic debate <e> <s> whatever our general views about macro-economic issues this is not what i had in mind when i was talking about the bill <e>", "<cs> i certainly have no reluctance to look at the noble lords remarks between now and the next stage of the bill but i would remind him that we have thought of this point <e> <s> the hot water has to get hot before it gets into the radiator in order to disseminate its heat more efficiently and what we are concerned with is the type approval and the energy conserving standards of the appliance which makes that water hot <e> <s> therefore it does not seem to me to achieve the results we want to insist upon standards for the radiator which are rather meaningless when divorced from its boiler <e>", "<cs> although i am not directly employed so to speak in the department of energy i do have rather proprietorial feelings about this bill as it was introduced in your lordships house and therefore i am entirely with the noble lord lord tanlaw in not wishing to see it undermined in any way <e> <s> i think i can set his mind at rest in that the substantive points he has made are covered by the existing wording of the bill <e> <s> of course there is always the fascination when semantics and linguistics tangle with engineering devices which one gets in this kind of legislation <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord lord tanlaw if he was also speaking to his amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for making that clear <e> <s> the noble lord and i are absolutely in agreement that part ii of the bill must deal with issues of enforcement but where i think we differ is that he seems to envisage by the language of his amendment that there will be a body of inspectors whose job it will be to make on-site checks to see that boilers have been tested <e> <s> that is not quite how we envisage it <e> <s> as i explained at second reading it is our intention to use the powers in clauses and to compile records of heat generators supplied and then match them against records of heat generators tested <e> <s> the powers under part ii of the bill will be used to require on-site testing only for the very largest boilers that is to say only about some installations to be tested in a given year <e> <s> in that context our method of enforcement seems both practical and economic <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has now got it right if i may say so <e> <s> we are talking about the inspection of very few appliances all as big as a house as it were <e> <s> there is no reason why the data plate should not be on the installation itself rather than on <e>", "<cs> i think this is rather outside the immediate sphere of the bill but i am quite happy to take it up with the usual channels <e> <s> we must be cost-effective in that way <e> <s> it may he that we have not made sufficient allowance for the delicate state of our heraldic bosses that the presence of the scaffolding and the new false ceiling has raised the temperature and that therefore we could put the thermostat down a little <e> <s> i will certainly pass it on <e>", "<cs> the purpose of the noble lords amendment would be to add a new power to the bill whereby the secretary of state could enable the owner of any type-approved heat generator to make an application for facilities to the relevant electricity generating board or gas board for all energy metering devices and test reports to be sited for inspection or reading outside the premises of installation <e>", "<cs> i take that point but of course we are not dealing with general meters of ones electricity use where i completely understand the relevance of what the noble baroness lady seear is saying under the bill we are dealing with type-approved heat generators probably under part i of the bill rather than part ii where this occurs <e> <s> nevertheless i shall look at the point <e> <s> perhaps if the noble lord wishes to return to it i can see whether i can give him some satisfaction <e> <s> however at first glance it does not seem that the consumers interests which the noble lord and his noble friend lady seear are representing are in fact relevant in this part of the bill <e> <s> however i shall have another look at it <e>", "<cs> i wish to say at the outset how much i miss the support of my noble friend lord strathcona and mount royal on these benches and how right he is in my view to plunge straight into the role of scrutiny and scourge of the governments legislation and i look forward to being flailed by him often particularly if he continues on such a widely supported wicket as this one <e> <s> the government sympathise with much of the general thinking behind the amendment <e> <s> the government believe that small-scale hydro-electric power schemes can make a very worthwhile contribution to our energy supply and that the economics of small-scale hydro look promising enough to justify more evaluation <e> <s> i am glad to say that the department of energy recently announced that it was examining specific schemes to establish the economics of small-scale hydro schemes and their suitability for demonstration of the latest technology in that field <e>", "<cs> the difficulty i am in is that i am in very substantial agreement with what many noble lords have said and of course the government are interested both literally and metaphorically in energy conservation <e> <s> but i am not sure that this particular bill is the appropriate arena for what is being suggested because i believe that this bill will be most effective if it targets in on installations and appliances of the kind which we discussed in the earlier part of the debate <e> <s> i would also argue that the government already have a vigorous policy on domestic insulation and that we do not as it were need to pursue it within the confines of this particular bill other than in the way that we are seeking to add to it through the bill <e> <s> of course we share the concern which underlies the amendment the desire to see a reduction in the current levels of energy consumption in dwellings but in practice the objectives of the amendment are already being tackled through other policies towards energy conservation <e>", "<cs> i take that point <e> <s> speaking for myself i would view preliminary studies on the cost effectiveness of double glazing with some scepticism <e> <s> i think the certain point is the point that i have mentioned earlier that the first thing you should do in any part of the country is to insulate your loft <e> <s> in this country heat escape through the roof is probably the biggest factor <e> <s> if you should happen to live on the north-east coast or in any part of the south of england but in an exposed position you might consider that certain of your rooms would benefit very much from double glazing <e> <s> what i think we are trying to signal to the consumer is that the double glazing industry is a perfectly respectable one but it is very competitive and very pushing if you like and it may occasionally give expectations as to savings which while they may be justified in certain cases would not be justified in others <e> <s> have a look at the loft first and go hit by bit <e>", "<cs> our partners on the continent have a continental climate <e>", "<cs> not all i agree but some do <e> <s> i do not have information as to the relative use of double glazing in this country and on the continent <e> <s> i do not in any way wish to discourage people from installing double glazing <e> <s> many people do so <e> <s> apart from questioning the general point made by this amendment which is not specifically geared to double glazing i question whether that is not another instance where the right price signals and peoples response to them freely are not the most appropriate way by which the same result might be achieved <e>", "<cs> this is another case where the government are in complete accord with both noble lords who have spoken <e> <s> but of course it will be no surprise also that we do not feel that the beauty of this accord needs expression in this bill because there <e>", "<cs> i take the point of both noble lords <e> <s> nevertheless in both parties we have perhaps <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that this is a very large and disproportionate share due to previous nationalisation policies <e> <s> we have as i said made good ground because in receipts totalled just under billion as against a target of billion <e> <s> they were million as against a target of million <e> <s> given the deepening recession i think that that was a good earnest of our intentions <e>", "<cs> my lords on the specific point of british airways the statement of my noble friend lord trefgarne in your lordships house on th october explained that in view of the present difficulties in the international civil aviation market it was clear that it would not be possible to launch a successful flotation in <e> <s> privatisation like nationalisation must take place against a proper background of the right market conditions <e> <s> but on the noble lords general point the vast majority of privatised shares in this arena go into the british capital markets so i do not think that the national question is very widely affected <e>", "<cs> my lords i sympathise with the direction of my noble friends question but i would need notice of it <e> <s> if he cares to put down a question for written answer i will of course answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords i really think it is time that we perhaps broke away from the concepts of nationalisation on the one side and private enterprise on the other <e> <s> our objection is that it is totally grotesque for such a large proportion of british activity including very significant and satisfactory activity to show up on the public borrowing requirements and obligations of central government <e> <s> that is not the way most of our successful competitor economies work <e> <s> we see no reason why it should continue and its record has not been good <e>", "<cs> my lords with all his experience my noble friend has put the matter much more succinctly than i did <e> <s> the difficulty of having <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think the noble lord lord kaldor has ever suggested that the current high rates of interest which we all regret are in any way facetious <e> <s> these current high rates of interest are largely due to the necessity of governments going on to the money markets to borrow not least because of some of their obligations in this field thereby crowding out the capacity of private sector industries to borrow at more reasonable rates <e> <s> it is this kind of imbalance that we wish to redress not for any doctrinaire reason <e> <s> i am certainly one who thinks that there should be close co-operation between central government and the large industries of this country <e> <s> but i see no reason why central government should be as it were the principal banker of such industries <e>", "<cs> my lords the obligations or necessities on central government to see many industries through this recession were dictated well before this government came into office <e> <s> i do not think there is anything novel about that <e> <s> but while i am thoroughly in favour of people in difficulties where possible being nannied through a recession once they are through that is all the more reason to privatise them once more <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i am afraid <e>", "<cs> my lords a bouquet from the noble lord lord shinwell makes my day <e>", "<cs> my lords i contest the noble and learned lords view that i have been conducting an ideological discussion <e> <s> quite apart from the relevance or irrelevance of my own ideology i do not think that question time is the appropriate place for that <e> <s> all of us very much regret that companies are forced into liquidation either as a result of recession or as a result of petro-currency or as a result of the inevitably tight money squeezes which come upon all governments after a long inflationary period <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much welcome the chance that this report gives for us to debate the operation of the european social fund <e> <s> it is as many noble lords have said a relatively little known part of the european communitys activities and other aspects of community policy and expenditure normally attract rather more notice <e> <s> therefore <e> <s> i believe that the committee has done a really useful job in its report by illuminating the funds activities for the benefit of a wider public <e> <s> i know that the noble lord lord wolfenden and his colleagues have gone to a very great deal of trouble to get information and views from those who really know about the operation of the fund <e> <s> and if i may say so the report seems to me to be an excellent example of the kind of study in depth which this house does particularly well <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the way it works is this <e> <s> the noble baroness is right in logic in that things have to be channeled through ourselves <e> <s> it might be however that we would advise a given organisation that they have little chance of success <e> <s> if they really pressed me and i use that pronoun advisedly as the minister responsible and felt that they must chance their luck i certainly would not stand in their way and i would instruct my officials to process it all the same <e> <s> i think that is how it would work out in practice <e>", "<cs> i am most obliged to the noble lord <e> <s> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat a statement being made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for industry on the british leyland corporate plan <e> <s> i am also making available in the library of your lordships house and in the printed paper office a report by bl on its recent performance and details of the corporate plan <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the general welcome which both the noble lord lord bruce of donington and the noble baroness have given to this statement <e> <s> if i may take the points in reverse order obviously i see no reason though it is a matter for the usual channels why we should not debate this very important issue <e> <s> on the issue which both opposition front bench spokesmen raised about the transfer to the secretary of state from the national enterprise board i think both the noble lord and the noble baroness will probably be aware as the house will be that the national enterprise board has made public i might say very public its desire not to look after british leyland <e> <s> the government are accepting this and i think many of my noble friends would agree that an investment of this scale involving such responsibilities and such decisions would be more appropriately taken directly by the government since the government are perforce involved <e> <s> i would also say to the noble baroness that it would seem to me to be adding even more grievously to the burden on public spending and therefore to the resources available to industry if we had to have the enormous duplication of effort of different public bodies monitoring the activities of what we hope will in due course be a vigorous private trading sector industry <e> <s> i am not sure whether that would be the most efficient way to proceed <e>", "<cs> my lords the relation of the main bl board to these four product companies is that of a holding company to subsidiary companies <e> <s> if i may use this analogy the holding company is not in this instance a finance group as it were that is the position in which my right honourable friend and ourselves are in <e> <s> the role of the holding company is managerial and directional in this case <e> <s> it is because we are confident in the present british leyland management and in the internal structural coherence of its plan that we find ourselves able to support it <e> <s> i hope that my noble friends point will be met on that <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord beswick has a great experience of the public trading centre sector in his own right <e> <s> there seem to be two slightly inconsistent points of view expressed in both his questions <e> <s> obviously the government would prefer to be disengaged so far as possible from this kind of financing <e> <s> it will not have escaped your lordships that there is an irony in the fact that the government with all the social and other claims upon the taxpayers limited resources are among other things engaged in funding the production of luxury cars <e> <s> this is something that should not be forgotten <e> <s> therefore whereever possible we should like not to be involved in the trading sector <e> <s> if bl is successful sir michael and the management have made it clear that they will continue to seek private capital coming into the company <e> <s> obviously the more private capital that comes into a successful company the less charge there will be on government funding <e> <s> that i should have thought would be broadly welcome to all of us <e>", "<cs> my lords i gave a rather longer initial reply than is my custom because i wished to indicate to the noble lord exactly how much we have done <e> <s> it seems to me that we have done a very great deal within the context which as i say is so necessary of overall economic pricing <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that it is a question of being dragged along by laws over which we have no sovereignty it is a question of being dragged along by the international prices of energy which this country like all industrial countries cannot altogether escape <e> <s> however as i said in my original answer we are monitoring closely where there may be a direct competitive disadvantage and that seems to be the right way to proceed <e>", "<cs> my lords technically i think that it would be another question but it is always difficult to resist the noble lord lord wells-pestell <e>", "<cs> my lords as my original reply indicated the electricity boards will advise customers how to take advantage of existing and flexible tariffs <e> <s> but on the question of the chlorine industry i should point out that that industry like the pottery industry cannot escape the consequences of increases in energy prices worldwide <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl for a subtle point which i hope the house will study carefully <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is right that the task force should try to cover definite differences of view between industries and between some industries and the government <e> <s> i am advised that it will come to its conclusions by th march so i think that we are getting on with it <e>", "<cs> my lords the going rate of inflation and the prices of energy are not linked as and i say this with respect to him the noble lord very well knows <e>", "<cs> my lords while i certainly agree with the noble lord lord bruce of donington that this is a serious and important matter it takes a certain perverse genius on behalf of the noble lord to look upon it as a snag <e> <s> i can only say some snag <e> <s> he asked for an estimate of what the employment effects might be if as a result of a feasibility study this project were to go ahead <e> <s> it is very hard to quantify and i think that i might mislead the house if i tried <e> <s> but let us say that i would certainly expect it to be in excess of jobs which is a considerable amount in any industry at this time <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much welcome my noble friends robust reception of this and his recognition that this is thoroughly good news the best news for a long time <e> <s> i want to back-pedal a little bit on the figure of <e> <s> it could well be more but it is not direct employment that would be substantially smaller though still on a significant scale for today <e> <s> the figures in the higher thousands if i may put it that way are based on the intention to achieve a very high local content in this new european manufacturer but that of course depends on other things being equal and other things going well upon the state of the components industry the state of industrial relations and so on <e> <s> but as i say we hope this will come off and the government can only wish this project now in its early stages every good fortune <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much share the view of my noble friend <e> <s> these things do represent a two-way traffic and britain is a very substantial investor overseas and we earn much of our living through overseas investment <e> <s> i would hope as i have said on many occasions that now there is a new spirit of realism to use shorthand within british industry we would attract a great deal more inward investment <e> <s> it seems an excellent time to come into this country and i am very glad to see that this is the largest proposed japanese investment ever in europe <e>", "<cs> my lords with great respect to him i do not think the noble lord understands the nature of regional aid in this country <e> <s> it is only ever possible to achieve regional aid if in the governments judgment there should be a benefit accruing and that is the same whichever government arc in office <e> <s> the other point which i do not think he has altogether taken on board is that at the moment we are talking about a feasibility study <e> <s> obviously nissan have to decide whether to go ahead on the basis of feasibility and so have the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the point made by my noble friend with which i partly agree and i am also grateful for the point made from the cross-benches by the noble lord lord roberthall this is a very substantial vote of confidence in the industrial possibilities of this country by a major industrial country <e> <s> also of course it follows other substantive japanese investments in other branches in this country so it is a vote of confidence based i would say on experience <e>", "<cs> my lords i have noted though it is not really a matter for me the great interest in this statement and also in the statement i made earlier during this week on british leyland <e> <s> perhaps it might be better if these issues were taken on in a debate although that of course is not a matter for me <e> <s> if i may just answer my noble friends points very quickly and in outline we would find it perfectly satisfactory for a per cent <e> <s> initial local content with the objective of increasing this to per cent <e> <s> i cannot answer the design point but i will look into it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to hear that from the noble lord lord kaldor as he is i am sure often unfairly sometimes associated with trade wars protectionism and the like <e> <s> of course japanese companies are welcome here <e> <s> they are already here <e> <s> but this proposal of their most substantial investment in europe so far on the same terms as other foreign firms and on the same terms as our own domestic firms is generally for the good of everybody <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that it sounds unreasonable until one considers that because the government in effect are paying the employees wages it would give the employer in question an unfair advantage over employers not benefiting under the scheme <e> <s> i would point out to the noble earl that there is nothing to prevent the worker seeking training under a government training scheme while he is off work <e>", "<cs> of course i will look at <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord give way <e> <s> i am most grateful to him <e> <s> the noble lord mentioned me <e> <s> surely the essential difference between the analogy he gives and the position that the government are in is that the bank manager can see his client in the noble lords example going bankrupt whereas in the public sector that is much more difficult for the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> i am following what he is saying with great interest <e> <s> would he not think that one of the reasons why the city in his argument may have been inimical to industrial investment on the scale that both he and i would like is that the fiscal policies of successive governments have provided strong disincentives to the smaller or individual investors who are most likely to gain from a generalised capital or equity market and therefore strong incentives to the large corporate investors who will go naturally for the longest and safest return <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> the government are not yet in the position of dictating the leaders in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord but he will be aware that it was the previous labour government who introduced rightly i think the cash limits system and we praised them for it at the time <e>", "<cs> my lords to take the latter point very quickly i certainly would not want of course none of us would want people to be alarmed by threatening letters and certainly one should not pay attention to threatening letters sent by computers <e> <s> i was once billed by a computer for for the service of ibm equipment which i did not happen to own <e> <s> i wrote a letter protesting and i received a bill back from the computer for <e> <s> so something can happen <e> <s> i will look at the latter point <e> <s> i do not think it is directly connected with the siting of meters because of course it would be possible for threatening letters or red flag letters to arrive for non-payment whether ones meter was sited inside or outside the premises <e> <s> however i will certainly draw attention to the noble lords remarks about the speed at which letters go out <e> <s> i cannot give the answer to that <e>", "<cs> yes my lords that would obviously be a maximum figure <e> <s> but the noble lords amendment would lay us open to defraying costs of this kind whenever that was demanded <e> <s> as i say the gas and electricity authorities are responsive to their customers requests and where they can do it they will do it <e> <s> i think it would be very dangerous as well as possibly marginally unconstitutional to write a money provision of this kind into a bill which might be <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend lord strathcona for giving the house an opportunity to consider this matter again <e> <s> when we discussed the issue during the committee stage i explained that the government believed that a defensible case can be made for making only a minimal charge for abstraction for hydro-power instead of charging on a volume-related basis <e> <s> so there is absolute common ground between my noble friend and myself on that matter <e> <s> i also went on to explain that in our view the right way to proceed is by way of discussion with the water authorities and that the department of the environment was looking carefully at the possible use of the powers of the secretary of state for the environment under section of the water resources act as i thought that those powers might provide a means of alleviating the charges made to the hydro-power users <e>", "<cs> my lords briefly i should like to answer the point raised by my noble friend lord campbell of croy <e> <s> i did not mention it because as is so often the case in so many matters they order things better in scotland and apparently as my noble friend suggests it is not necessary to provide licensing in this way <e> <s> that is my advice <e> <s> if my noble friend cares to look into it and as long as he is satisfied that scotland would not be affected in this way i think that we could leave it at that <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran has drawn our attention to an enormously important aspect of deep sea mining operations dealt with in the bill <e> <s> safety provisions are included in a number of places in the bill notably in the powers to make regulations and revoke or vary licences <e> <s> the noble lord has now proposed and he is supported by the official opposition that we should include an additional specific reference to safety in the list of possible terms and conditions of licences in clause <e> <s> the power to do that is already covered by the general power to include such terms and conditions as the secretary of state thinks fit <e>", "<cs> i fear i must be rather fiercer towards this series of amendments than i have been not only on this bill but on the previous one we debated <e> <s> i have had a good run for a government minister in the way of concessions it has lasted for about an hour and i suppose all good things must come to an end <e> <s> seriously however these amendments would create considerable financial uncertainty for potential licensees if the percentage levy arrangements were left as flexible as the noble lord lord kennet and others who support him would like <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord like to adjourn while he consults his whips <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble friend lord campbell of croy who pointed out to the committee which i had failed to do though i did so at the earlier stage that this is something of an interim measure to try to get the show off the ground and that of course we would have to come into line with whatever is agreed from the united nations conference on the law of the sea <e>", "<cs> i do not quite accept as the house would not expect me to accept that my reasoning was simply because that is the way things had been done always and anyway no one wants to upset the home office <e> <s> although he is supporting the noble lord lord kennet the answer was made for me by the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran <e> <s> it is that information is a sensitive and complex affair <e> <s> it is not simply a matter of open government or of being a nice extrovert fellow <e> <s> a great deal of commercial and competitive possibilities and success may depend on what information is disclosed or not disclosed or when it is disclosed or not disclosed <e> <s> therefore what i had in mind was that penalties for disclosure of information and the rest in this bill were common to several acts of parliament <e> <s> i am thinking of the companies act and the iron and steel act <e> <s> i think that the noble lord lord kennet was a minister during the passing of the first act <e> <s> i think there has been quite a common tradition here <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will forgive me i was not clear about what amendment he was talking to <e> <s> is it an amendment to the schedule <e> <s> i think it was my mistake but i was not clear what he wanted from me <e>", "<cs> i have the rather rattled look of a servant of the house who did not know what his masters were requiring him to do <e> <s> if it is the case that the noble lord is simply referring us back to some of the points made on the debate in his original amendments then the guarantees that i gave then would hold now <e>", "<cs> i have to cover myself in that i am advised to resist amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i do not know whether the noble lord feels unhappy about that <e>", "<cs> my lords i have considerable sympathy with the frustration of my noble friend as i am well aware of the interest throughout the house in nuclear policy <e> <s> but the house and my noble friend will be aware of the complexity of this issue the very great expense the long lead time and the importance of getting policy absolutely right <e> <s> i must ask him to bear with us a little longer <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord strabolgi and i have debated this subject on many occasions and we have often found ourselves in agreement about it <e>", "<cs> my lords we have no intention of being i think the word is penurious <e> <s> we have every intention of trying to get a policy of this complexity and sophistication right <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that this is not a party issue and i also have always registered that your lordships house takes a longer term view of energy policy as is only right than perhaps other parts of our economy <e> <s> i shall bring what my noble friend has had to say to the attention of my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite clear as to the point that the noble baroness is making <e> <s> if she will look at the other answers to the supplementary questions she will see that it is a grave prospect for nuclear energy if there is a uranium shortage <e> <s> that is one of the reasons why the government are considering fast breeder reactor policy <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that that is one of the very interesting features of the fast breeder reactor <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not accept that interpretation <e> <s> as my original answer made plain we have received advice from the atomic energy authority <e> <s> we have received advice on fast breeders from the nuclear industry and this is precisely the advice that we are considering <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously one cannot avoid flaring if one is to develop an oilfield <e> <s> it is in order that the flaring should not be wasteful that the gas-gathering scheme is being developed <e>", "<cs> not without notice my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the norwegian licensees have recommended that gas from the statfjord field be transported via norway to the continent but their recommendation is subject to strong conditions which may not be met <e> <s> i understand that this recommendation will now be considered by the norwegian government along with other possible solutions and then put to the storting for decision in the spring <e>", "<cs> my lords my advice is that the norwegians have been told that if gas from their side of the median line is committed for transport through the line arrangements will be made for norwegian participation if they so wish but i imagine that that implies that it could be done without such participation <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a third time <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously i should have liked a little less modification of the rapture with which the governments amendment has been received but i suppose that in these difficult days one must be <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not personally aware of the difficulties experienced by the noble lord but the point of these very large sums for investment is to ensure improvement and british telecommunications is engaged in a major replacement and modernisation programme with that money <e> <s> therefore i would have thought that that would give the noble lord a better service in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend and i earnestly implore the post office to abandon this ridiculous scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that it will be to the convenience of your lordships if i now repeat a statement which has been made in another place by my honourable friend the minister of state for industry on the british steel corporations borrowing powers <e> <s> my honourable friends statement reads as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord and the noble baroness for the way in which they have received the statement <e> <s> the point made by the noble baroness with which i am altogether in agreement illustrates and aptly in view of the speeches of the debate which the statements have interrupted how very large and very problematic are these structural shifts in high-employing industries and how the problems that they are causing as well as the solutions to them are not new <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that that is really a matter for mr macgregor and the government have every confidence in the management of <e>", "<cs> my lords with the greatest respect i must repudiate unconditionally what the noble lord has said <e> <s> he is well aware that one of the reasons why steel is in deep trouble all over the western industrialised nations is that it employs a great many people a great many more people than its productivity or the new technology warrants <e> <s> all over the western world we are engaged in a structural alteration of the labour market which will be with us for years and it does no good to sling mud at one side or the other while we are caught in this situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord has been extremely ingenious in linking the closure of a sugar refinery in liverpool which we all regret to london weighting allowances for the civil service <e> <s> they do not seem to me to have an immediate connection <e> <s> on the question of regional assistance policy obviously the government and successive governments have provided every kind of incentive for people to create employment in areas which need such special assistance but unfortunately such policies cannot guarantee that all ventures will be successful in those areas this turned out most regrettably to be the case with tate and lyle <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will look at my original answer tomorrow he will find that tate and lyle had to make decisions which affect employment in the rest of the kingdom and that is of course something that any government whether conservative or labour also have to bear in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords the great difficulty is to distinguish between regional policy designed to help people through difficult transitions and regional policy designed to equalise the balance of opportunity and employment in the country <e> <s> speaking for myself i must say that i think the latter is never liable to be very successful <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> i think it is generally agreed that in a very plural and in the main successful national economy british manufacturing industry is the weakest link in our national economic chain <e> <s> we are strong in energy and agriculture and we are very strong in the provision and export of financial services <e> <s> but we do not make enough things which people can buy or want to buy at prices that they can afford <e> <s> our industry is no longer as competitive as it should be and both north sea oil and counter-inflation policy have dealt even those bits of industry whose competitive position could be very strong a difficult hand to play by ensuring the strength of sterling <e>", "<cs> my lords it might be convenient to your lordships if i now repeat a statement on the coal industry being made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for energy <e> <s> my right honourable friends statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i could answer the two front bench speakers first of all <e> <s> i very much welcome the extremely responsible reception of my right honourable friends statement by the noble lord lord rochester i thought rather more responsible if i may say so than that from the noble lord lord strabolgi who talked about short-term monetary fanaticism <e> <s> an investment of million of public money this year and million of public money planned for the forthcoming year does not seem very fanatical to me and the noble lord is well aware as a member of previous labour governments that between and pits a year were declining or running down and were being closed that in the new energy situation this slowed somewhat but that in an extractive industry the end of pits is always going to be a fact of life <e> <s> the important thing is to recognise that that has always been accepted by both sides of the coal industry and what is important is to get the timing and the terms and conditions of any closures absolutely right <e> <s> that is why my right honourable friend is agreeing to do all he can to ease the present situation and to see that the timing is got right <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may i will just answer the noble lord <e> <s> i am aware of course of there being strong feeling in the coal industry though as my right honourable friends statement which i repeated said the future of this industry is extremely bright <e> <s> that is one of the reasons why the government have been committing large sums of public money to investment in the industry <e> <s> but of course no industry in our country can altogether be isolated from upturns and downturns in economic fortune and at the moment there is as noble lords have made clear surplus capacity in the industry <e> <s> but i am confident that we can get things on to a smoother keel in terms of starts and stops where the industry is concerned and i will take what the noble lord has said most carefully to heart <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot accept charges of dither in this connection at all <e> <s> the fundamental issues are between the national union of mineworkers and the national coal board <e> <s> the government have acted as bankers if you like with very considerable funds for future investment in this important industry <e> <s> when it was clear that both sides wished to see the government the government facilitated a meeting <e> <s> next monday was a convenient time for all but the union decided that they would sooner have a preliminary meeting as well whereupon the government acceded to their request <e> <s> that is not dither <e> <s> it seems to me to be good manners <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with what my noble friend has said in that there has been a steady running down of uneconomic pits and as i think has been said on all sides of the house this is nothing new in an industry with finite physical resources <e> <s> as to the question of the existing closures or existing loss-makers i say to my noble friend that i think it would be wrong for me to anticipate any discussions that might be had as a result of the meeting which i announced in the repeated statement <e>", "<cs> on the issue of the investment in the mining industry i altogether agree with the noble lord <e> <s> certainly in none of my remarks did i so much as mention the word wages <e> <s> i made it quite clear that the government were putting in million this year and million next year as an indicator of their confidence and of the importance of the industry <e> <s> i made it clear that that was principally for investment and development <e> <s> on the issue of imports the government have not been importing <e> <s> the british steel corporation in some areas of its activity did not find that the coal board was offering coal to them at anything like the sums of money that they could afford <e> <s> i do not think that we should quarrel with that comercial judgment <e> <s> i can say to the noble lord that the national coal board has been successful as an exporter as well <e> <s> we anticipate that with this investment and this confidence in the industry it would continue to be successful as an exporting industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord is perfectly free to bring his strong feelings <e>", "<cs> my lords to the degree that the british taxpayer picks up losses incurred in the coal industry as well as sums for investment and the rest we are subsidising if i may put it that way coal to a ton and in the uneconomic pits <e> <s> that is a fact of life that we cannot escape <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the national coal board will take on board the points that the noble lord has made <e> <s> but on the general issue of imports and exports i would repeat my remarks that the national coal board is heavily involved with exports and we welcome this <e> <s> we certainly would not want others to take the view that we should not export to them <e>", "<cs> my lords i really am getting somewhat impatient with the noble lord for attributing really all national economic weather to government policies <e> <s> the only way in which the government can guarantee a weak exchange given the presence of our energy resources is to revert to the kind of galloping inflation which the declared policies of the noble lords party appear to want <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we should be aware that the constitution of the num is somewhat federal <e> <s> it is not quite as centralised an organisation as many other major unions and that must be taken into account in these circumstances <e> <s> i am hoping that common sense will prevail because a meeting has been asked for and a meeting has been granted <e>", "<cs> my lords all british ministers are permanently in mortal combat with the treasury so that rules that out <e> <s> but i will take the other points on board <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful and the government are grateful for the general response we have had to this very miscellaneous but nevertheless very important bill <e> <s> the noble lord lord ponsonby of shulbrede seemed to welcome it though his rapture was pretty modified <e> <s> he said that it was an inadequate bill to deal with the scale of the crisis <e> <s> i think it was the noble lord lord granville of eye speaking from the cross-benches who encouraged me to tot up the sums of public money which this bill potentially disburses <e> <s> leaving out the odd million here and there as i did it in a hurry and without advice i come to million which is interestingly the very figure which is being urged upon the government by the tuc for a programme of reflation <e> <s> so perhaps one is not so far apart as all that <e> <s> these figures are over a five-year period of course <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously the noble lord comes from a much better or more fortunate family than i when we have our periodic carve-ups one usually has to kick in a bit to the others and we do so without any kind of resentment <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a point that i will look at <e> <s> my advice is that such is not the case and it may be that we shall be able to think of more suitable wording at the committee stage <e> <s> i think it is a committee point <e> <s> i have been anxious to put the policy as clearly as i can and i can only repeat that it is not possible to overrule this by the provision of a loan on which the government could foreclose <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said i will take that point on board but this is fundamentally the kind of issue that we might take up at committee stage when we consider the precise and best form of wording for the provision <e> <s> i have tried to make the policy point clear <e> <s> i can only say that i look forward to returning to this at the committee stage and i welcome the broad acceptance of the bill that has been expressed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that the noble lord has taken up that point again because i was rather surprised when he said that we do not always see the documents in this house <e> <s> i thought that ministers usually had to be held down to prevent them from showering your lordships with documents and i will see that this continues if the noble lord so wishes <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> i recognise his experience and the value of his advice on this industry but this afternoon we have had a statement which i repeated to your lordships about the meeting proposed between the government and the coal board and the num tomorrow and we had some debate on that statement <e> <s> it is really stretching our rules of order very far to think that the num issue could come into the industry bill which does not deal with it <e> <s> however i repeat that i am personally aware as are the government of the noble lords experience of this issue and we welcome his advice so long as it is in the proper context <e>", "<cs> my lords we are in touch with the united states and i have had very useful meetings with professor birch of the massachusetts institute of technology who has some interesting facts and even more interesting ideas about small business formation <e> <s> however i am not convinced that to copy the american procedures of administration would be right in this area <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly do not accept the figure given to me by the noble baroness <e> <s> statistics on the small business sector are scarce and notoriously difficult to derive from existing sources and we are trying to improve that <e> <s> as to the question of bankruptcies fierce recession and counter-inflation policies contribute to bankruptcies but not of course on anything like the scale that galloping inflation would <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much welcome my noble friend having come to my aid <e> <s> i have rather churlishly to stick on the fact that statistics in this area are difficult <e> <s> that is not an excuse for not trying to improve them and one of the things we are doing is to try to improve the methods by which we quantify both the birth and death rates of small businesses <e>", "<cs> my lords with the same <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord that lower interest rates would be very desirable and i hope that all noble lords who call for increases in government spending in one area will recognise the effect on interest rates in another <e>", "<cs> my lords i could not ask for comfort from a more authoritative source and i am most grateful to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we would really need a debate for that but i am thinking in terms of up to employees that kind of scale <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very glad that the noble lord tacked the latter part of his supplementary on to the former because obviously it is most important that local authorities in deciding on their expenditure within their rate support grant limits <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to repeat a statement which has been made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for energy on the coal industry <e> <s> my right honourable friends statement was as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord tanlaw said that anything that affects the coal industry affects industry as a whole <e> <s> of course i agree with that <e> <s> that is one of the reasons why inevitably the government have become involved in matters which are preferably dealt with as they traditionally have been dealt with by the national coal board and the unions concerned <e> <s> that is one of the reasons again why we welcome the lead that the national executive council of the national union of mineworkers has given today and why my right honourable friend the secretary of state will be calling a meeting again next wednesday <e>", "<cs> my lords i am profoundly grateful for the remarks made by the noble lord with all his experience of this particular industry and also for reminding the house as i should have done and i apologise to the noble lord lord tanlaw on this that questions of the issue of costs are not yet decided and there is a long way to go <e> <s> that is why the meeting has been convened again for next wednesday <e>", "<cs> my lords there is lateral movement if i may put it that way between exhausted pits and pits which have other capacities and aid exists for the expenses and the like where such lateral movements occasion them <e> <s> of course i would remind my noble friend that one of the reasons why the government have consistently committed very large sums of public money to the development of new capacity in the mining industry is that this industry has a great future not only in the wealth and energy that it can generate for this country but also in the employment it can bring <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome very much what the noble lord has said and his call to the miners in the south wales field which i should like to endorse <e> <s> of course he is quite right in implying to the house that the coal industry like other industries has been affected in its revenue by falling sales both at home and abroad <e> <s> that is one of the reasons why it is important to take another long hard look at the position of the coal industry <e> <s> he also reminded the house that the coal industry is a vigorous exporting industry as well <e> <s> it would certainly wish i imagine to continue in that position but of course world demand is down not only home demand and that is why we must use our best endeavours to get out of this recession so that normal life can be resumed as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i endorse what the noble lord said about mr joe gormley <e> <s> i would remind the house that mr gormley has called for people now to return to work throughout the industry and we all welcome that <e> <s> as my right honourable friends statement said fears and anxiety among the workforce did arise and perhaps precipitately but we must look at human and psychological considerations as well as economic ones and that is why i welcome the proposed additional meeting <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that it is a question of restriction of imports at this stage <e> <s> imports have been falling naturally through surplus capacity and through demand <e> <s> certainly world demand depends on whether the exports from the ncb can be kept up <e> <s> my information is that they are going to be considerably higher this year than last <e> <s> given the state of the industrialised world that is very good going indeed <e>", "<cs> that is exactly what we think we are doing we are treating this situation with great sensitivity <e> <s> as i said we have consistently to use a vulgarism put our money where our mouth is in respect of the coal industry <e> <s> that is true of successive governments <e> <s> the meeting with my right honourable friend the employment secretary was arranged previous to this issue in the coal industry and so that is part of our on-going discussions as to how to get the economy out of recession <e> <s> regarding what viewing financial constraints with an open mind and also with a view to movement means an open mind means just that <e> <s> the view to movement is that we recognise that the external financial limits of the coal industry were drawn up at a time when the expectations of revenue were very different in view of what has happened in terms of demand recession and surplus capacity <e> <s> that is why we are prepared for movement <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the remarks of the noble lord <e> <s> we shall bear them closely in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that this is a question of clumsiness <e> <s> obviously it is possible in any industry for the workforce to be anxious often unreasonably about something which is being suggested and for that anxiety to get blown out of the proportion that it was originally intended to have <e> <s> as the noble lord lord tanlaw said this industry is of very great importance to every part of the economy and it is inevitable that the government would be drawn in <e> <s> the government are now trying to see that a new mood prevails in the industry <e> <s> then the industry can get back together and work its own way without government intervention which is the best way <e>", "<cs> my lords lord ritchie-calders proposed amendment to clause characteristically combines his interest in scientific pursuits and his concern for the wellbeing of the marine environment which of course the government share <e> <s> the bill as at present before the house in our view meets the noble lords first concern his concern that genuine marine scientific research should not be hampered by the need to be licensed <e> <s> clause of the bill prohibits exploration or exploitation without a licence and the definitions of these terms which are set out in clause make it abundantly clear that they relate to the commercial exploration or exploitation of a particular area <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord ritchie-calder for raising this matter of what are referred to as stable reference areas and for describing them so clearly and i should like to consider the matter further <e> <s> on a preliminary look we feel the bill as drafted would enable the secretary of state to honour any internationally agreed reference areas and refuse to issue licences in respect of them but i acknowledge that it makes no special provision for that purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble baroness and with the noble lord lord wallace of coslany and i am grateful in the main for their response to this short bill <e> <s> it is a curious situation in that a government spokesman is winding up a debate on the second reading of this bill having just received advice from his chief whip that the substantive issue <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be for the convenience of the house if at this point i repeat a statement which has been made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for industry on the steel industry <e> <s> my right honourable friends statement reads as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords not for the first time the noble baroness lady seear has made my task easier by delivering a robust answer to some of the points raised by the opposition front bench <e> <s> of course it is true and it remains true when one is discussing the share of private or public capacity in the steel industry that this is an enormous burden on central government financing and that this burden can be shouldered as the government are indeed for the reasons i have given shouldering it but doing so inevitably means that the burden will be suffered somewhere else <e> <s> there are plenty of opportunities in this economy for the expenditure of over billion whether in social programmes reinvestment programmes or restructuring programmes which i think all of us would welcome on whichever side of the house we happen to sit <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for reminding me of the point raised by the noble baroness lady seear <e> <s> one of the difficulties of the opening statements is that they can raise a number of issues and i should have picked up that point <e> <s> i do not think that any such assurances can come from central government <e> <s> again not to put too fine a point on it central government is backing the management of this crucial national industry <e> <s> it is confident in this management and it is going to allow this management the necessary funds for it to try to get the steel industry into operable condition at a very difficult time <e>", "<cs> i have to rest on my answer <e> <s> as noble lords would expect from someone in my department obviously i think it crucial that there should be the closest co-operation and consultation between managers and unions as to how to make their practices viable and how to justify these large expenditures of public money <e> <s> but we rest very firmly recent events in another industry have in no sense altered this on the necessity for allowing the managers and the unions to do this together <e> <s> i do not think it would be very productive for me to repeat assurances that might have taken place between unions and mr macgregor to the house and which in the light of later events i could not justify if they do not come off but i repeat i emphasise this our confidence illustrated by the statement of my right honourable friend that this industry its management and its unions are now in line to have a go and that is really what we are backing them to do <e>", "<cs> my lords i of course recognise the experience and knowledge and if i may say so the very legitimate human concern of the noble and learned lord for the workforce in llanelli <e> <s> it is of great importance and concern to any government when closures take place and people are made redundant <e> <s> not only is it a human and political concern but as the noble and learned lord is well aware a very expensive matter for governments <e> <s> but in a way though i recognise that the noble and learned lord is talking about the private steel industry his comments do illustrate the dilemma in which these large primary producing industries find themselves <e> <s> in order to have a chance of being competitive they have to de-man and the noble and learned lord recognised that this had taken place that is an expensive business for central government if they de-man privately and it is also an expensive business when nationalised industries de-man <e> <s> but it is an essential and necessary business if competitiveness is to take place <e>", "<cs> my lords on the last point which the noble lord raised about the joint ventures between bsc and the private steel sector he will be aware that bsc and guest keen nettlefold announced last friday the formation of allied steel and wire limited a joint public/private venture to rationalise certain of the rod wire and bar interests in scunthorpe and south wales <e> <s> we would hope to see an increase in these kind of arrangements <e> <s> if the noble lord will kindly look at what i said in the statement i repeated about the predictions for the private sector and their participation i think he will find some assurances there <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise and the statement recognises that where for i think sound reasons and reasons that my noble friend with his experience would on the whole share public monies for capital for redundancy and the rest are put into an industry it is absolutely essential that the industry does not use its provision of that kind and on that scale to undercut the private sector <e> <s> yet at the same time we in government ask of course that the managements of these industries behave competitively and <e>", "<cs> my lords on the question of the figures i thought that i had answered the matter but perhaps i did not break it down in sufficient detail <e> <s> of the next years external financing limit the cash limit which is million altogether million is budgeted for redundancies and closure costs and million for capital expenditure <e> <s> i think that that meets the noble lords point <e> <s> i shall return briefly to the subject of the unions <e> <s> the unions were consulted closely on the corporate plan and the majority of the unions have as it were put their names to it <e> <s> i was simply reluctant to give assurances from this dispatch box about how the future would turn out because as i said in my previous answer i remain guardedly optimistic <e>", "<cs> my lords this service does exist <e> <s> the department of industry under my honourable friend the parliamentary under-secretary runs the small firms service which counsels on the formation of small businesses and the staffing of this service is businessmen not officials <e> <s> joint ventures between the msc and this service do take place <e>", "<cs> my lords the provisional information that i have is that the balance is about even but as i say the information is not reliable and i prefer more work to be done on it <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with the right reverend prelate <e> <s> of course the problem is that businesses large and small public or private are short of funds <e> <s> there are many appeals to the government for funds or for help with funds and that inevitably drives up interest rates which of course also damage business <e> <s> so it is very important to get the balance right <e>", "<cs> my lords while not for a moment accepting the sting in the tail of that particular supplementary question because trading conditions and other things are much more influential than economic policies right or wrong i rest on the answer i gave to the noble lord on the front bench opposite which is that the provisional information i have is that the figure is in balance but i am not happy with the method of reaching this figure and i therefore want it looked at again <e>", "<cs> my lords i was aware that there have been complaints on this score and the department of industry have made representations that there should be prompt payment of contracts <e> <s> we have also tried to put our own house in order to see that government pay their contractual bills more rapidly than they have been prone to do which also affects business <e>", "<cs> my lords i think in urban areas the ratio is per cent <e> <s> and i shall check that <e> <s> i shall look at this aspect and i am most grateful to the noble lord for making my bull points for me <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall bring this to the attention of my right honourable friend the secretary of state for trade as it affects the companies act and of course we shall be debating this act this very afternoon in the house <e> <s> i am sure that point can be fed in <e>", "<cs> my lords one cannot set up an organisation large or small at little or no cost <e> <s> one must be careful about going down the road of setting up organisations but i take the point that the <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the privilege amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords i can do no more than thank both noble lords for the way in which they have received the proceedings on this bill <e> <s> it is of course uncharted territory and we are in deep water literally as well as metaphorically here <e> <s> i think it might be worth pointing out to the house that it seems an admirable idea to introduce more bills in this chamber because more amendments find themselves to be acceptable to the government being introduced in sensible and non-doctrinaire ways <e> <s> i hope that we can keep up this good record <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now read a second time <e> <s> this is a very short bill with a very clear purpose <e> <s> it aims to raise the limits set by the employment protection consolidation act on the amount which can be borrowed by the redundancy fund from the national loans fund <e> <s> at present the redundancy fund can borrow up to million and this can be raised to million by order approved by both houses of parliament <e> <s> this bill will enable the fund to borrow up to million and will provide for this limit to be raised to million with parliamentary approval <e>", "<cs> my lords we are going to have an opportunity to debate unemployment and employment generally next wednesday so i hope the house will forgive me if i do not follow all the points that were made this afternoonand i think it is fair to say that some of them were not directly connected with the redundancy fund bill <e> <s> i should like to congratulate the noble lord lord davies of leek on what is to me at any rate his first appearance at the front bench but perhaps i have not been here when he has appeared there before and on as we would expect of him an interesting and entertaining and fiery speech <e> <s> i think it was perhaps a speech that started by being delivered by dr jekyll and there may have been a change of gear to mr hyde but it ended with dr jekyll again and for that of course we must be grateful <e> <s> in this somewhat schizophrenic role the noble lord got into a bit of a tangle between savage monetarism on the one hand and handing out money generously on the other and i think that is a circle that perhaps he will have to square next wednesday <e>", "<cs> my lords there are no suggestions whatsoever of conscription taking that to mean statutorily enforced military service <e> <s> the noble lord will be aware that the ministry of defence has been a sponsor of the youth opportunities programme since when the programme began under the previous government <e> <s> therefore to refine and improve this sponsorship would seem to be a sensible thing to do <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the great virtues of military training is that it does tend to equip one for civilian life <e>", "<cs> my lords the vast bulk of the youth opportunities programme is of course in civilian training <e> <s> that will not change <e> <s> all i was seeking to do was to say that discussions were taking place as to how the armed forces might provide additional sponsorship within these schemes <e>", "<cs> my lords we do not impose any system of maintenance on the royal navy <e> <s> i am sure that they will feel quite free to come to us if we can help in any way through the youth opportunities programme <e>", "<cs> i intervene now while the point is fresh in the mind of the committee <e> <s> the government have repeatedly said that they very much admire and have learned from the german experience in training <e> <s> but the noble lord lord rochester must also make it clear that germany is now exactly twice as rich as this country <e>", "<cs> we have had a very interesting and informed debate and one would expect that any debate which had been contributed to by the noble lord lord hinton of bankside would be particularly informed in this field <e> <s> it was started by the noble lord lord howie of troon who gave us a lucid explanation of the subject <e>", "<cs> my instinct is that if the secretary of state wished to proceed in such a tortuous way to try to establish this control which we have repeatedly disclaimed having any interest in and which we do not feel the legislation allows he would find it much more convenient presumably he would enjoy a parliamentary majority of some kind to come back to parliament and take control directly <e>", "<cs> of course i recognise that but i am not making the point simply about the present secretary of state <e> <s> i was trying to say that it would seem to me that this route to control would be so tortuous as to argue that a subsequent secretary of state assuming he wished to take control would simply take it by legislation <e> <s> but we have tried to draft these provisions very carefully to identify the engineering council and also to define the borrowings which may be guaranteed as those incurred while the secretary of state appoints the members and that provision is the one which should set the noble lords mind at rest <e>", "<cs> my lords the government as my answer implied have made their disapproval and condemnation quite unconditional <e> <s> the remedy which the noble lord postulates is of course available to the people concerned as a result of the governments own legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords those who abuse the law inevitably put pressure on legislators of all political complexions to up the ante and strengthen the law <e> <s> there are of course dangers in this kind of escalation <e> <s> the necessity is that laws be put on the statute book not simply as a result of parliamentary majorities but overall public consent <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think it is strange in view of our history <e> <s> we are an intensely litigious country zealous about civil liberties and we have a very active press <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord will be aware even as i talk a previous closed shop case is being heard in europe <e> <s> therefore i do not think it would be proper for me to make any comment upon it at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the noble and learned lord and his colleagues are under such pressure and doing so badly <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to confess that i do not know the answer to that except to say that the government collectively have made their view perfectly clear <e> <s> furthermore i am not a lawyer myself but i do not know whether it would be proper for the government as it were to bring an action of that kind <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the leader of the official opposition introduced this debate with passion and conviction although he will not be surprised that i found his speech short both on diagnosis and on treatment of the evils of unemploy <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> i simply wanted to remind him of what in fact i said which was that in terms of awareness of the phenomenon and problem we are no longer two nations <e> <s> everybody including those who live in the affluent suburbs of south-east england is having some contact either directly or through their children with unemployment <e> <s> it was in that context that i said the concept of two nations was breaking down <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble baroness for giving way <e> <s> we do in fact have a minister for small businesses <e> <s> he is my honourable friend the parliamentary under-secretary at the department of industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i should not intervene from a sitting position <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that it has been based on rather untight monetary control <e>", "<cs> my lords what is an excessive interest charge <e>", "<cs> my lords did the noble lord try to persuade the previous prime minister of the same point <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a pleasure to start with the easy bit of the evening which is to congratulate the right reverend prelate the bishop of liverpool on his maiden speech <e> <s> i had said that i was looking forward to it and it would be a misstatement to say that any of us were disappointed we were thrilled by the brevity the succinctness the expertise the compassion and concern which he showed <e> <s> i was particularly grateful for the tribute paid by the right reverend prelate to the governments special programmes and particularly to the special programmes staff of the msc <e> <s> i should like to reciprocate by expressing our warm appreciation of all that the right reverend prelate has done in his capacity as chairman of the merseyside special programmes board <e> <s> he and the chairmen and members of all those boards are doing a splendid job in very difficult circumstances <e> <s> i can best illustrate that by saying that at the end of january special employment measures as a whole were keeping people off the registers compared with the year before <e>", "<cs> my lords i disagree with the noble lord because the rearmament of this country did not take place hence the troubles within the conservative party at the time and the isolation of winston churchill until a much later time <e> <s> i am talking about the period up to and before the rearmament took place <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the great many disadvantages of standing at this box is that every year one gets a little further from the o-levels that one did in these subjects <e> <s> i am able to set the mind of the noble lord lord leatherland at rest in that i did in fact refer to petroleum revenue tax and only later truncated it rather unattractively to prt in the interests of getting on with the business <e> <s> petroleum revenue tax was what i had in mind <e> <s> as regards the definition of a therm i would point out that a gigajoule is a metric unit of heat <e> <s> i hope that that at least sheds some light on the issue <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it might be for the convenience of the house if at this point i read out a short statement which has been made in another place by my honourable friend the minister of state for industry on cable and wireless <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the way in which my statement was received by the noble lord lord rochester and i am glad that the liberal benches and ourselves are in broad agreement on the issue of principle <e> <s> obviously i cannot be as grateful for the way in which it was received by the official opposition front bench and there is a substantial divide of opinion between us <e> <s> we have never seen why british companies operating in the private sector in this country should not be able to operate public assets very efficiently <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are remaining a majority shareholder in this company and as a result there will be no change in the arrangements <e> <s> the present chairman of cable and wireless is this afternoon appearing at a press conference with my honourable friend the minister of state for industry endorsing this move <e>", "<cs> my lords i can tell my noble friend that we are determined to carry on in this way whenever conditions enable us to do so and i welcome the support he has given us <e> <s> it is of course a major delusion to think that the great corporate capital institutions of this country are somehow inimical to the interests of this country they are thoroughly engaged in those interests and that is why there is nothing sinister and nothing other than of benefit to be found in their purchasing some of our nationalised assets <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord lord shinwell will direct me to people eager to purchase from us the national coal board or the coal mining industry i shall of course with my colleagues consider the request most carefully <e> <s> i would remind the noble lord that my honourable friend the present parliamentary secretary at the department of education when in opposition floated the idea of selling the coal industry to those who operated it and that would seem to me to be an excellent point of general principle <e> <s> we are of course guided as much by market demand for assets as we are by anything else <e> <s> we are also guided by the criteria of the degree of commercial freedom that is beneficial to companies in order to expand and to do so without making calls on the public purse <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a somewhat political point but it was not the tory party that nationalised all these assets in the first place <e> <s> we fought long and bitterly against their nationalisation and we regret that it ever took place <e>", "<cs> my lords i should be very <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord ponsonby made it clear that he would suspend judgment on the government until he heard my arguments arguments mainly directed obviously at the noble lord lord hinton who has put the substantive case and has made his reservations clear to us both at committee stage and this afternoon <e> <s> the noble lord lord howie of troon puts me and i think the house in a rather difficult position because he has said effectively that he does not altogether agree with the noble lord lord hinton in his argument but that he thinks the amendment should be supported for other reasons <e> <s> the principal reason why the noble lord lord howie of troon wishes to support the noble lord lord hinton is that he is worried because the governments funding or backing of this body is limited to three years <e> <s> my lords it is not limited to three years and therefore the reason for that support from the noble lord lord howie of troon to the noble lord lord hinton of bankside should really not be valid <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord hinton has explained to us that the purpose of his amendment is to remedy what he sees as a potential problem in the drafting of clause <e> <s> he is concerned that it would be open to a future secretary of state and of course he has acquitted the present secretary of state of any malevolent intentions and i am grateful to him for that to manipulate the provisions of the clause in order to enable him to continue to nominate the members of the proposed engineering council beyond the three years that we envisage <e> <s> i think those were the objectionable strings as the noble lord lord hinton put it that were attached in this clause to the concept of the new body <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may address the house by leave for a second time i may need to backtrack on my use of the phrase one way or another it was a rather sloppy phrase and no doubt i should not have used it <e> <s> the point here is that the secretary of state has powers to make guarantees and he is not limited in time when he does so but he is limited in time as to the period in which he may make nominations of the members <e> <s> the point of the charter is that the charter will in fact make the nominations in the future <e> <s> so i do not see that there is any difficulty between these two positions <e>", "<cs> my lords we debated the purpose of clause at some length in committee and of course we have touched on important aspects of the clause in the debate that we have just had on the noble lord lord hinton of banksides amendment <e> <s> i made the point in committee that the clause contains provisions to enable the secretary of state to support other areas of activity in addition to the proposed finniston body <e> <s> if the clause were left out as the amendment of the noble lord lord howie of troon proposes we would have to look very carefully at the future of the industry education activities which successive governments have financed for a number of years and which i believe have the support of all parties in your lordships house and elsewhere <e> <s> i am sure that the house will recognise that it would be a highly questionable procedure to continue to finance this expenditure under the appropriation act when specific statutory cover had been sought by us and denied <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may have the leave of the house to intervene once more i am most grateful to the noble lord for his intervention <e> <s> i wholly acquit him of any misrepresentation on that score <e> <s> the fault was entirely mine and i am glad that on this issue the noble lord whose experience and whose whole career in this field we all so much respect and i are at one <e>", "<cs> my lords i broadly agree with the noble viscount <e> <s> the difficulty is as he says that there is quite a lot of argument about whether a smaller unit can be economic particularly in this country where we have other favourably priced sources of supply <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot tell the noble lord what the future of battersea power station is to be though as one of the most beautiful industrial buildings in the world one hopes that its future is very secure <e> <s> on the general issue of using old power stations refurbished plant may well have a role to play during the construction of the heat network in a major scheme but the costs of maintaining a power station which has already served its design life would probably in most cases be too high for it to have a long term role <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i need notice of that question <e>", "<cs> my lords on many occasions the government have made our commitment to the coal industry and the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am of course very aware of the noble lords experience in this field <e> <s> i am glad to say that normal and orderly relations and negotiations between the coal board and the mine workers have now resumed and that underlines our own commitment to the <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have it immediately available but of course there have been the startling and extensive discoveries in the midlands at belvoir <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think there was even an attempt at the interrogative form during the noble lords statement <e> <s> i do not think the government were twisting anybodys arm least of all the coal industrys <e> <s> it is arguable that the government were subject to a little arm-twisting themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that correction though i did say in a supplementary answer that they were being closed at an average of a year <e> <s> it seems to me somewhat beyond the bounds of an oral answer that one should present the house with so many figures and i truncated my original answer in order to try to make it more easily understood <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that is the issue <e> <s> obviously there are problems in any industry including the coal industry where you get a concentration of employment in one industry in one given area <e> <s> in fact in regard to the closures that have taken place continuously since the war i can confirm that in the majority of cases miners have received employment in alternative mines <e> <s> but that has been more of a difficulty for the south wales community particularly in an area of high unemployment <e>", "<cs> my lords this seems to be an anglo-irish day in the house of lords with the noble earl lord shannon the noble lord lord shackleton and now myself <e> <s> and i see that my noble friend lord bessborough has his name down to speak <e> <s> sometimes i think that this particular little pocket of black feet or <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down could i return her to my speech to which i noticed she was kind enough to pay great attention <e> <s> we are very keen on investment but the problem in this economy is how you finance it <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may have the leave of the house to wind up briefly just on the points that have been put to me and with nothing in the way of an additional speech except of course to congratulate our three maiden speakers who steered a difficult course very well because this has been an interesting debate and as in all interesting debates one is liable to steer into the waters of controversy <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to take correction from the noble lord as long as we encourage entrepreneurs and manufacturers to manufacture things which people want to buy <e> <s> it is clear that we are manufacturing these machines that people at home and abroad want to buy them and we are doing very well on them <e> <s> one of the reasons why the eastern <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord lord beswick will forgive me if i take the questions in reverse order as it were as the noble lord lord avebury asked me so very many <e> <s> i cannot tell the noble lord lord avebury about the applications by the company for research and development assistance outside this contingency rescue fund <e> <s> if i may i will write to him about that or if he cares to put down a question for written answer and the house is interested i will of course answer that <e>", "<cs> my lords the date which the noble lord is seeking is december <e> <s> at that time the company looked very healthy <e> <s> however as the <e>", "<cs> my lords the future is all before this company <e> <s> the noble lord is going too fast for the statement <e> <s> the statement refers to the provision by the government of a limited amount of funds for a limited period of time to ease the company over a severe cash flow problem <e> <s> the government are doing that for this particular company because of two things first as i said to the noble lord lord avebury because of our commitment to high technology industries and secondly because we are substantially involved in this company as a major purchaser and placer of orders in a number of sensitive areas including the revenue and defence areas <e> <s> that is the reason why we have made available this contingency liability <e> <s> what happens now that the acute cash flow difficulties of the company have been eased is a matter for the company though of course the government will take a very close interest in any suggestions which are made to them <e>", "<cs> my lords during the second world war as the noble lord with all his experience is well aware the world was not awash with hot money looking for favourable rates of return <e> <s> if the government increased their borrowing at the present moment in time and in present market conditions they would have to compete in the money markets of the world for that money <e> <s> at the moment the prime rate in america is i think per cent <e> <s> that would be very uncomfortable competition in which to have to engage <e>", "<cs> my lords the government not only are doing this but have been doing it for some considerable time <e> <s> it is because the government are so involved in this company as a purchaser or placer of orders as i said that they have made available this tide-over provision <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i am well aware of that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am always delighted to try to help my noble and extremely experienced friend with his travels <e> <s> the fact remains that crude oil prices have risen by about per cent <e> <s> since and as i have said in real terms this duty increase has only restored petrol duty to the level it had reached before <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the opec countries will be pleased to see that the united kingdom is moving towards economic pricing <e>", "<cs> my lords the figures i gave are the indications of the inflation that has occurred <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure whether the alliances of the united kingdom in international diplomatic terms quite fall within the remit of the question <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to intervene but i cannot let that last comment pass <e> <s> the closeness of the present governments economic policies to those of the previous government has hardly been denied <e>", "<cs> my lords this debate which i welcome very much has to some degree been about law and the interpretation of law <e> <s> but principally it has been about people people who in the words of my noble friend lord brookes use public office and public money to trample on human freedoms <e> <s> the cases of this kind which the noble lord lord harris of greenwich referred to in his brilliant opening speech are intolerable <e> <s> sandwell is the most notorious example but there are others and very worryingly as lord harris pointed out there may be more in the pipeline <e>", "<cs> no my lords i do not <e> <s> i think it is a pretty small commission in relation to the amount of monies that were raised by selling this asset and in relation to the excellent idea of privatising an industry and getting it off the psbr <e>", "<cs> my lords i am fortified as always by support from my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i find the noble lords logic most curious <e> <s> there is not the slightest bit of evidence that there will be any less research done by a great british private sector company than by a company which happens to be in the hands of the state sector <e> <s> in terms of the overall cost the noble lord is leaving out of account the cost of capital borrowing and the rest upon the public sector borrowing requirement which would have accrued had british aerospace remained in the public sector <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords at present there are wages councils on st december there were outdoor inspectors and other staff in post in the wages inspectorate and the estimated cost of financing the wages councils and the inspectorate is million for <e> <s> there will be a substantial reduction in cost in future years as a result of the governments decision last year to reduce the number of posts in the inspectorate <e>", "<cs> my lords when i became minister with responsibility for wages councils representations were made to us as to whether the judgment of independents was impartial <e> <s> we had a look at the record of their judgments over a number of years and we came to the conclusion that indeed they were and that if anything they slightly favoured the employers side <e> <s> as to the number who sit on more than one council i should need prior notice of that question <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise that wages councils cover people who are not otherwise collectively represented <e> <s> as believers in free collective bargaining the government recognise the good work which the wages councils do <e> <s> that said at a time of high unemployment and high inflation there must be worry whenever there is any form of national minimum wage that people immediately below the margin will not find employment <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord is perfectly well aware there is at the moment raging currency inflation around the entire western world <e>", "<cs> my lords in the last months wages councils have made orders changing the statutory minimum rates of pay in their trades <e> <s> of these were issued after their effective date of operation and before their effective date <e> <s> the date of effect of a wages order is a matter for each council to determine but the date must not be earlier than the date on which the council agrees its proposed changes in minimum rates <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not agree that the wages councils awards are likely to be inflationary because they tend more to follow inflation than to create it <e> <s> we are speaking about an economy where <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord is kind enough to read my speech tomorrow he will see that i have answered that question <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has i am afraid indulged in a freudian slip by referring to the document a moment or so ago as a white paper <e> <s> it is of course a green paper <e> <s> it is not the business of a green paper to come forward with proposals it is a discussion document <e> <s> a white paper can frame proposals for legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for giving way and i apologise for interrupting <e> <s> while the point is fresh in our minds does he seriously think that even with the end of the recession industry will be remanning on the scale on which it used to <e>", "<cs> my lords i should just like to correct the noble lord on something if he would be so kind as to give way <e> <s> it is up to him whether he does or not <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord leaves the comparison with poland i thought that was rather unfair because there is nothing whatever in the green paper which suggests that there should be no right to strike <e> <s> the green paper fundamentally is a debate about whether you have the right to strike and whether you have immunity from action in law <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend give way <e> <s> i am interested in the point he is making <e> <s> the point of the governments case on this is that they have practical experience of having legislated the closed shop out of existence but failing to get any co-operation from both sides of industry on it <e> <s> it is no good putting legislation on the books as is easily done with a large majority if no one will observe that legislation <e> <s> the moment we have an indication that legislation may be observed we will of course move to put it on the statute book <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord underhill dealt very fairly with me and i do not want to take up too many points of his admirable winding-up speech <e> <s> however if he will cast his mind back over the contributions that i have made to economic debates in your lordships house he will find that on balance i have been more critical of employers on the whole than of unions <e> <s> it seems to me logical for unions to make the best case that they can for the terms and conditions for their members <e> <s> that is after all a major function of their whole existence perhaps the major function <e> <s> however employers have to pay wages and meet wage claims with regard to productivity and are faced with the need to retain profits for investment and to provide some rate of return to investors <e> <s> it is a prerequisite and many noble lords have said this in this good debate that employers should communicate this fact constantly to their workforces <e> <s> it is no good employers looking to the law to protect them from the consequences of their actions if they grant inflationary wage claims which do not have regard to productivity and the need to reinvest <e>", "<cs> my lords that is not the inference that i was trying to make <e> <s> the noble lord lord wedderburn said and i remember the incident very clearly that it was a curious and eccentric historic circumstance that union rights in this country had grown up on the basis of immunities <e> <s> that is not to say that the noble lord lord wedderburn wished to change it but he recognised it as eccentric <e> <s> therefore in response to that and in response to other representations we thought that there was something to be said for airing this publicly and consulting on it <e> <s> this is what we have done <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to know that my noble friend and i are in line about that after all <e> <s> the noble lord lord mccarthy and he was echoed in a powerful speech by the noble lord lord houghton raised the issue of overturning for economic reasons long-standing pay systems existing in the public sector <e> <s> i see this issue and i have considerable sympathy with the reactions to it <e> <s> it is a feature of all industrial agreements that either party whether employer or employee may seek to renegotiate the machinery for determining pay and conditions and negotiations about the nature of the machinery are sometimes as important as negotiations about the amount of pay itself <e>", "<cs> i take the noble lords point <e> <s> the noble lord lord rochester also raised issues about the voluntary development of legally enforceable procedure agreements <e> <s> the noble lord lord hankey echoed him there <e> <s> as the green paper makes clear we believe that there is scope for expansion here and the green paper recognises the crucial importance of improving the provisions of procedure agreements and making them clearer and more comprehensive <e> <s> that is a pretty big task but the noble lords proposal of a code of practice to encourage this process is very interesting and it is one to which i will give most serious consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords as i say it was not a question of a contract it was a question of a chartering <e> <s> but i can say to my noble friend that i am not satisfied that british industry is taking all the opportunities available to it in offshore technologies regarding these very considerable opportunities at home and abroad and one must hope that british industry will wake up <e>", "<cs> my lords my information is that the corporation approached a number of drilling contractors including british companies and that no british companies were able to meet their requirements either for construction or for charter <e>", "<cs> my lords i altogether share my noble friends views on the desirability of fair competition and of british industry meeting that competition <e> <s> i do not think this was a question of french industry undercutting british industry on speculation <e> <s> as i said in my earlier answer i understand that the needs of the corporation could not be fulfilled here <e> <s> as a result rather than commission a construction abroad they chartered one from norway <e>", "<cs> my lords it is very important for british industry to feel that this technology and this activity is not restricted only to the north sea it is now international and certainly there will be great opportunities both here and in other offshore areas for the rest of this century <e> <s> so i agree with my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> i am bringing before your lordships today a bill which concerns the whole future of the communications industry in this country <e> <s> in a sense we are debating the development of something like the motor-car industry in <e> <s> this is an industry whose efficient and rapid development and growth is seen by virtually everyone as essential for our manufacturing industry for the business community and for employment as well as for the services used by the general public <e> <s> the bill contains proposals designed to stimulate just such efficient and rapid development <e> <s> it allows a more flexible approach to postal and telecommunications services by both the public and private sectors leading it is hoped to the provision of greatly improved services for everyone and increased opportunities for those involved with the industries <e>", "<cs> my lords with great respect to the noble lord he really must not talk as if the government were abolishing all those admirable institutions <e> <s> we are talking about restructuring arrangements introducing some element not an extensive but some element of private competition to add to them <e> <s> the whole thrust of the noble lords rhetoric for the last minutes has been as if the government were somehow divesting themselves of those admirable institutions <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree altogether with my noble friend <e> <s> my brief tells me that the truck acts were passed in victorian times but no doubt my noble friend is right that they were passed in the reign of william iv <e> <s> nevertheless they are certainly out-of-date <e> <s> the difficulty is that there is still a very strong bias in this country towards being paid in cash but i am glad to be able to tell the house that every year there is a slight decline in the number of people who wish to be paid in cash <e>", "<cs> my lords i confess to some personal bias in favour of cashless payment and speaking for myself i think that it would certainly do more for continued female emancipation than any other piece of legislation that we could devise <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the difficulties we have in my department is that it is very hard to predict which sectors of activity generate employment at a given moment <e> <s> for instance we might all applaud some splendid public scheme especially if we could finance it from outside the psbr such as the channel <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord davies of leek mentioned the problems we are having with our roof <e> <s> i do not think we could quite envisage the roof of your lordships house acting as a kind of gigantic job creation programme <e> <s> however i will pass on the noble lords suggestion to the authorities concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i think all of us on the second part of my noble friends supplementary would wish funds to be greater than they are but the types of scheme sponsored by the private sector employers should fall into two broad categories <e> <s> first those in which a public spirited company may sponsor a scheme of community benefit wholly outside its normal commercial activities and which does not seek to involve direct financial gain <e> <s> an example of this might be a company or consortium of companies sponsoring a scheme to clean and create public footpaths along the river banks bordering an industrial estate in which their premises were located <e> <s> secondly those schemes which would allow a limited direct financial gain to the company but where that gain is clearly of secondary importance to the community benefit being provided <e>", "<cs> the two parts of that supplementary are clearly linked my lords <e> <s> the government do not pretend that the community enterprise programme is any solution to the problems of long-term unemployed people which can be achieved only <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a little early to measure that at all scientifically as this particular programme has been going only since st april but of course it is geared primarily at an older age group falling within the description of the long-term unemployed <e> <s> the youth opportunities programme is an open-ended programme which offers any young unemployed person between and a place on the scheme <e>", "<cs> i wholly agree with my noble friend my lords and he will be aware that these schemes are funded by the government and that the government are answerable for them <e> <s> nevertheless they are operated by the manpower services commission which is a tripartite body <e>", "<cs> as i said my lords i am satisfied with the design and general operability of the schemes and the response to them though one will need more time before one can register exactly and in detail what the response has been <e> <s> i am not satisfied that a scheme of this kind could be a solution to the problems of long-term unemployment whether in wales or elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for those comments and i am grateful to her for the contribution she has made in publicising the scheme by raising it in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i share lord lloyds enthusiasm for greater employee participation but also his misgivings about this particular amendment <e> <s> it is well known to most of the committee that the government have frequently made clear their support for participation but they believe that the form that that should take is much better created and is much more workable if it is as a result of full and free discussions between the employer and his employees and that it has not been successful in this country where governments have sought to impose it <e>", "<cs> again the overall argument as against the details of it is rather close to the answer i made on the previous amendment <e> <s> i do not disagree with much that has been said by the noble lord lord ponsonby about the need for the provision of information to employees and indeed to employee organisations such as trade unions <e> <s> of course it is necessary for both parties in any collective bargaining agreement to have such information as is pertinent to any discussion but again i think that the amendment is very far from being precise as to how this might be achieved <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the contribution of my noble friend lord morris <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord lloyd that a reasonable interpretation of safety health and welfare should include peace of mind and the enjoyment of recreational or leisure facilities provided by an enlightened employer <e> <s> i agree with him that that is important in the social context as he put it of the work of the corporation <e> <s> i am not sure that it is important in the primary legislative context of the work of the corporation but i shall bring to their attention the noble lords not too liberal stretching of the word welfare <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for the way in which he has moved this amendment and if i may say so he did it with great clarity and expressed his concern in a way that brought it home to all of us <e> <s> i am also grateful to him for agreeing to take with this amendment his comparable amendments to clauses and <e> <s> i should like to follow suit and deal with all these at the same time if i may <e>", "<cs> i think that my noble friend has tried to deal with the matter but perhaps it would help if i intervened here <e> <s> we are dealing with fairly wide existing powers in respect of the post office which <e>", "<cs> i can only say that i have tried to meet the objection made by the noble lord and that is the advice that we have received from parliamentary counsel <e> <s> i do not think that the noble lord has made out a case that these paragraphs should not be in the bill but if he cares to table an amendment to remove them at a later stage i shall of course look at the matter again <e>", "<cs> i think my noble friend means british telecom not the post office <e>", "<cs> in so far as my noble friend has moved a probing amendment to find out about the position with regard to cross-subsidisation i think <e>", "<cs> my advice is that my noble friend is entirely correct in pointing out that a printing error was corrected when the bill was reprinted for report stage in another place <e> <s> i can assure him that it is standard practice for such errors to be corrected without formal amendment by agreement with the house authorities <e> <s> i am sure he would agree that this avoids the need to waste parliamentary time <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord glenamara for making one of the points that i would have made <e> <s> i also want to use the intervention of the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran to take the opportunity to pay tribute to the research and innovatory work which the post office has performed over the years and to underline the fact that this will of course go on and we would hope be very much added to through the joint ventures and the rest in the work of british telecommunications <e>", "<cs> although i have some misgivings about the nomenclature which my noble friend lord morris uses to describe the act perhaps the committee will think it funny if i suggested that we refer to this bill as the gowrie bill for the purposes of any discussions in committee i think my noble friend has answered lord glenamaras point quite accurately in that in the act expectations were set up which could not conceivably be realised <e> <s> i do not believe anyone in the committee believes that the post office is now in any practical sense under an obligation or duty to meet the countrys needs for data processing services <e> <s> it obviously could not do that in any practical interpretation of the words <e>", "<cs> i should like just to deal with the point made about charges <e> <s> the point i was making in response to the noble lord and i shall of coure read carefully tomorrow what he has said was that he was laying an emphasis which in my view could give rise to <e>", "<cs> that would be entirely a matter for the home secretary <e> <s> the position in this country is that any form of use of public services in that way can be done only by application to the home secretary <e>", "<cs> this has been a lively debate <e> <s> i enjoyed other stages of the committee but it seems to have really woken up in the last few moments <e> <s> i think though that there is some misunderstanding in the committee about what is here if not the prime instrument the prime policy of the government <e> <s> what the government have effectively done is to recognise and i refer the committee back to the debates we had at an earlier stage this afternoon the social service element in the installation of the prime instrument and that we are not in that regard thinking about competition at present <e> <s> i refer your lordships to the considerations of providing on demand to the citizen in all parts of the country including uncommercial areas access to the telecommunications network <e>", "<cs> i followed my noble friends eloquence all the way but i could not help having a sort of pavlovian reaction when he mentioned burglar alarms <e> <s> my life is made intolerable and miserable as one who lives in a commercial rather than a residential area in the centre of london <e> <s> at weekends in particular we have a plurality of burglar alarms all amateurously installed all going off and wrecking my ability to mug up debates for your lordships <e>", "<cs> this new clause moved very clearly by the noble lord lord caccia falls into two parts <e> <s> the first part enjoins bt and its wholly-owned subsidiaries to act as a commercial organisation in those activities not covered by its exclusive privilege <e> <s> i can understand and indeed sympathise with the intention behind the amendment which clearly accepts that bt has a wider responsibility towards the community in its role of provider of the basic services <e> <s> as i said when we discussed the point earlier this afternoon this is recognised in clause of the bill <e> <s> what are underlined there are the social commercial and industrial needs of the country as well as efficiency and economy <e>", "<cs> we seem to have strayed back into the area of the private versus the public sector a debate which has been going on in this economy for a long time and which i often think has misleading elements in it <e> <s> i wonder whether i could clear up some of these simply and expeditiously by quoting some words uttered by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for industry explaining the governments intentions in this area at second reading in another place <e> <s> he said <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether it will be convenient for the committee if we now adjourn <e> <s> it is a matter for the committee to decide but i suggest that we adjourn until to eight oclock <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord glenamara acknowledged this amendment was discussed at some length in another place <e> <s> i can tell him that it has also been raised with the chairman-designate of british telecommunications <e> <s> i have to disappoint the noble lord <e> <s> the governments position has not changed on the issue not because we are obdurate but because we are satisfied that the bill already makes adequate provision in respect of the worry he is caused <e> <s> if one puts clause together with paragraph of schedule it provides that contracts of employment will be transferred intact when staff are transferred to subsidiaries <e> <s> thus immediately after the reorganisation employees in subsidiaries will be employed on exactly the same terms and conditions as they were beforehand <e>", "<cs> it is right that the provision that i mentioned about transfer will take place after the employees have been transferred and will be limited in time <e> <s> but it surely would not be appropriate for terms and conditions of employment to remain the same indefinitely <e> <s> as i understand it the provision is a kind of moving provision <e> <s> as the noble lord said when there is a great re-structuring in an industry there can be uncertainties and anxieties on the part of <e>", "<cs> as i have said i think it is a matter of an argument about the time <e> <s> obviously the terms and conditions of employment are for negotiation between the employer and the employees who are operating within a free collective bargaining framework <e> <s> nevertheless to allay these anxieties the transfer period is covered by certain protections and therefore it seems to me that the interests of employees first to be protected while the transfer takes place and secondly to be able to bargain collectively in the traditional way with their employer is protected on both fronts <e>", "<cs> this is particularly interesting for me because it is of course an arena where my work as a wholly-owned subsidiary of my honourable friend mr kenneth baker so to speak and my own free enterprise activity in the department of employment coincide <e> <s> i have noted the concern expressed that post office and british telecom workers might be in a position such that if they were to take industrial action in furtherance of a trade dispute with their employer they could be held to be committing an offence under one of several provisions contained in the post office act and the telegraph act <e> <s> effectively therefore it is being argued that post office workers do not have the right to strike and indeed my noble friend is exhorting me that i should not surrender this non-right to strike too cheaply <e>", "<cs> i must say at the beginning that some of these charges from members of the labour party are really extraordinary because we are still here dealing with a great public sector corporation <e> <s> if you look at the constitution of public sector corporations you will find that there are relationships with the sponsoring secretary of state who is after all the chap responsible to parliament as well as the executive within a government with particular charge over that business <e> <s> the general intention of the bill is that the relationship between the secretary of state and british telecommunications should be similiar to that between other sponsoring ministers and the nationalised industries for which they are responsible and the clause is similar to section of the act <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord could help me by saying what kind of assets he imagines british telecommunications are liable to own other than perhaps some surplus property <e> <s> the idea that this particular kind of corporation is a large asset-forming corporation seems to me to be inconsistent with its aims or its own intentions let alone what any government are interested in <e>", "<cs> we now turn to the issues of parliamentary accountability <e> <s> i could of course say that when a labour government included powers similar to those in clause <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran in whose name this amendment stands as well as my noble friend have also tabled amendments that would take the exclusive telecommunications privilege away from bt and give it to the secretary of state <e> <s> i am bound to agree with them that if this were done there would be no option but to set up a sizeable regulatory body that would be our counterpart of the federal communications commission in america <e> <s> but your lordships might like to be reminded that the fcc has a staff of over <e> <s> even taking into account the differences of scale the establishment of an authority of that size would make a very substantial increase in bureaucracy which would surely offset the benefits of liberalisation <e> <s> this has been an important consideration in our decision to leave the exclusive privilege with british telecom and to achieve liberalisation by progressively licencing derogations from that privilege <e>", "<cs> i am not suggesting for a moment that it would be the model <e> <s> what i am saying is that there would be a comparable licensing or regulatory authority <e> <s> i am not saying that they would be comparable in scale or would have exactly the <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank the noble lord lord young for his kind personal remarks and reciprocate them in that we all know what a great expert he is in this field and what valuable work he has done in it <e> <s> i am aware of what i hope is a cherished reputation for being as helpful on as many occasions as i can be in this house but i am aware that i have been a bit obdurate this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords figures on cost are necessarily provisional but the estimated cost of the yop in is million at prices <e> <s> that compares with a suggested final cost for the programme of about million <e> <s> about per cent <e> <s> of former trainees were placed in either real jobs or full-time further educational training in <e> <s> we do not know what the rate this year will be but we expect a fall perhaps to about per cent <e> <s> with tegard to my noble friends third point the new rraining initiative document is at present with the government and i would expect it to be published towards the end of the month <e>", "<cs> my lords the last statement certainly was working towards that condition since as i made clear this is a substantial advance in the numbers <e> <s> it is an advance from places to places <e> <s> however i share the noble lords desire that all school-leavers should be offered some form of training and the government are working to achieve that <e>", "<cs> my lords that supplementary question is a little wide of the initial question <e> <s> however i can say to the right reverend prelate that the government have been worried about the fact that in this economy the overall adult rates of pay tend to come into operation rather early and this might have a disincentive effect on the hiring of young people <e> <s> of course there are divergencies in allowances but there are also divergencies in the type of opportunities or training obtained <e>", "<cs> my lords all minorities whether large or small suffer disproportionately during periods of recession and high unemployment <e> <s> equally well minorities benefit proportionately from the provision of these schemes <e> <s> ethnic monitoring is not carried out formally in that the yop is a multiracial programme but since it deals with inner cities the longer-term unemployed and school-leavers with low educational qualifications it inevitably has a high ethnic content <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for what the noble lord said at the beginning of his remarks <e> <s> i would certainly wish to underscore the fact that the next year or two will be an acutely difficult time for all young people including those of relatively high educational qualifications due to the baby bulge of the sixties coming on to the market before the first world war baby bulge comes off <e> <s> with regard to the second part of the noble lords supplementary question i think ones concern for young people also extends to their defence <e>", "<cs> yes my lords the programmes are open to all young unemployed school-leavers of either sex wherever they come from <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord lord rochester means a tax relief or relief relating to national insurance contributions i am not quite sure what relief he has in mind i must of course acknowledge the fact that the majority of young people who leave school and seek work go into work <e> <s> therefore it might not be cost effective to subsidise as it were training for those already in work <e>", "<cs> my lords the ministry of defence under both this government and their predecessor has been a sponsor of the youth opportunities programme for some time <e> <s> we welcome this <e> <s> my right honourable friends the secretary of state for employment and the secretary of state for defence are talking about methods of financing training programmes additional and extraneous to the yop programme for the ministry of defence <e>", "<cs> my lords i would certainly wish to see the colleges of further education increasing the opportunities they can make available for training young unemployed people <e> <s> they are already involved in the programme through day release or weekly release training programmes <e> <s> we should like to increase the number of places available <e>", "<cs> my lords sub-committee g of the european communities committee is rightly very much respected for its careful scrutiny of the environmental aspects of proposals received by the european council of ministers <e> <s> its report on the two draft directives debated tonight and the presentation of it to this house by my noble friend lord cranbrook reflected this close attention <e> <s> if i may i should like to congratulate my noble friend not merely on his presentation but also on his whole conduct of the proceedings of the committee <e> <s> evidence received and heard from organisations and individuals again to whom we give our thanks directly concerned with the manufacture use and potential health risks of exposure to asbestos has now been helpfully supplemented by this debate this evening and by all who have contributed to it <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl was kind enough to explain that he had not been able to give me notice of that question <e> <s> if i may i shall write to him or if he cares to put it down for written answer i shall return to it <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have done my homework orally as well as visually <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord and i hope he will be as helpful when we return to the telecommunications bill <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord with his great experience as a doctor for confirming the point i was making namely that it might seem excessive to require full-time medical examinations on site not only excessive but possibly not efficacious either <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord allow me <e> <s> i am most grateful to him <e> <s> i missed what he said at the very beginning <e> <s> is he going to speak to amendments nos <e> <s> and as well as to nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> with the leave of the committee i should like as suggested by the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran to take together amendments nos <e> <s> and though i would point out to the committee that it seems to us that the general issues which the noble lord lord lloyd has raised are also covered by amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> i was going to speak to those amendments as well but may i formally speak to the three which i have mentioned <e> <s> in due course we shall see whether more words from me are needed on amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> obviously i will consider what the noble lord has just said and look it over again very carefully <e> <s> however as i said a little earlier my advice is that the way in which the amendments are worded either does or certainly could given of course the secretary of state in question exclude british telecom from the market in telephone terminal equipment <e> <s> i do not think that my department is always right but certainly we have scrutinised the amendment very carefully and it appears to us to have that effect <e> <s> however if the noble lord who has tabled the amendment insists that it does not or need not have that effect obviously that would weigh with me <e> <s> in that case i would rather doubt whether his other central purpose behind these amendments would be worth while because the effect then would not be materially different from our existing intentions <e>", "<cs> that is right <e>", "<cs> i do not wish in any way to cut short this debate but i should be grateful to have the leave of the committee to come in on the very stern points that my noble friend has raised <e> <s> of course it is the last wish of this government in some way to jeopardise the commercial future of this kingdom in this area <e> <s> in fact the whole point of the bill is to liberalise the existing system in order that a better and a more competitive commercial future in a growth area can be maintained <e>", "<cs> one of the reasons i am often envious of my colleagues in the house of commons is that they do not usually find that the people grilling them on their bills are professionals in the field <e> <s> my noble friend is an electronics engineer i understand he has put very pertinent questions to me and i congratulate him on that <e> <s> in fact i think he need not be alarmed <e> <s> it is not a question of in his rather vivid phrase if i may say so british telecom sitting on the <e>", "<cs> in answer to that question i mean the latter <e> <s> it is quite clear that the public telecommunications network is under the control of british telecom and that the monopoly is therefore not of systems which can include attachments and mechanisms which are manufactured and bought or sold and which slot into the system <e> <s> the monopoly is in the running of the system <e>", "<cs> the advice i have is that the monopoly extends to running systems and that running is defined as in the dictionary as to keep going manage and to conduct operations systems is used to mean a complex whole set of connected things or parts <e> <s> it does not seem to me to be obscure that the basic road network as it were is being retained in bts monopoly and that what is liberalised are the <e>", "<cs> i risked the odium of my back-benches when i gave a lusty hear hear when the noble lord lord underhill made his point <e> <s> he did reinforce very clearly the point that i had made earlier <e> <s> with respect to what the noble lord lord robbins has said i believe we should all be extremely diffident and humble when anticipating the future where technical changes can enormously reinforce a monopoly <e> <s> i do take on board the criticism which the noble lord made <e> <s> in fact the secretary of state has very considerable delegatory powers in this bill indeed some critics of the bill vest their criticism in the fact that too many powers are given to the secretary of state <e> <s> it seems to me to be provident to recognise that because none of us knows the future in this area there should be a certain amount of enabling legislation in the bill <e>", "<cs> to answer that point i believe my noble friend lord torphichen is quite right when he says that there is no reason why this should not be so but it seems to me that it would not be very sensible to arrange things in that way <e> <s> as i am sure my noble friend is pertinently aware the prime difference is that television is not a two-way medium it is not a medium through which we communicate with one another <e> <s> it is not that kind of broad service <e> <s> i agree that television has now become historically or culturally in the realm of necessity rather than luxury in that most people feel somewhat disenfranchised from the kind of society in which they are living if they do not possess a television but it is still a very different kind of communications system from the telephone network <e> <s> we also have to consider the fact that the telephone network is an international medium of exchange in the way that a television does not need to be <e>", "<cs> i congratulate my noble friend on his imagination even as i commiserate with him that many of his earlier anticipations have not been realised in terms of movie entertainment <e> <s> my advice is that subsection about which he asked me establishes bts monopoly which is called exclusive privilege of running telecommunications sytems and defines these in terms of what is conveyed that is to say speech or music and in terms of the form of energy used for conveyance which as our debate on lasers and the rest showed can include electromagnetic energy <e> <s> without being any great shakes as a physicist it appears to me that electromagnetic energy covers most of the foreseeable systems of communication in this field that we can at present dream up let alone identify as existing <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend is reassured by that <e>", "<cs> i am again which is perfectly appropriate under clause stand part driven back at the risk of wearying the committee to the central purpose of the bill which is not to divest bt of the monopoly of running the system but to divest it of any monopoly over the attachments to that system <e> <s> once that is clearly seen to be the purpose of the bill the other issues fall into place <e>", "<cs> i think the noble lord has it wrong in the sense that existing wireless and telegraphic communications legislation is not covered by the bill that is covered by other legislation <e> <s> he is right in saying that if he wished to run as it were a telephonic network but using lasers as a form of communication between one island and another he would be infringing the exclusive privilege <e> <s> but he could do so under licence from the secretary of state he could apply to the secretary of state for such a licence and that might be granted or of course withheld <e>", "<cs> if my off-the-cuff answer is wrong i apologise to my noble friend and will write to him <e> <s> i think the difficulty he is finding with this provision arises from a confusion about what he means and <e> <s> what we mean by systems <e> <s> we use systems in connection with running systems and running implies the control <e> <s> i have tried to make it clear that the public telecommunications network which was under the control of the post office is now to be vested in the control of british telecommunications <e> <s> therefore anyone who uses a telephone instrument or even an instrument of the more science fiction kind that we have described in the electromagnetic field in conjunction with the network does not himself run the system he is using <e> <s> the instruments involved are not themselves the system they are as it were attached to or slotted into the system <e>", "<cs> again without taking advice it seems to me that one cannot run a system which is what this monopoly is about without being able to service it <e> <s> that seems to be reasonably straightforward <e>", "<cs> my noble friends amendment is designed to give businesses the statutory right to compete with bt in providing services to third parties <e> <s> i think i have made it clear to the committee that it is the governments intention to stimulate such competition but through the licensing system to retain its own ability to judge how far it is in the overall national interest to do so <e> <s> it would not be responsible in our view if the government were from vesting day to open the floodgates of competition without first examining what would be the overall effect of that on telecommunication services in this country <e> <s> we have looked to the united states who are further along the road to liberalisation than we are and have been encouraged by what we see <e> <s> but their situation is not an exact model for britain <e> <s> the government have considered as i believe any responsible government must that before they decide how far to allow competition in the use of the network that is in providing value added services and in the provision of the network itself they must carefully examine the consequences and proceed accordingly and at a pace dictated by those considerations <e>", "<cs> i will look at that point <e> <s> i think it is covered by subsection <e>", "<cs> i very much sympathise with my noble friends wish to see the telephone subscriber given the greatest possible freedom of choice <e> <s> this surely is what liberalisation is all about <e> <s> but the subscriber would not gain at all if the result was a serious worsening in his standard of service because <e>", "<cs> when the noble lord lord glenamara and the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran had their little exchange about the semantics of the word liberalisation i could not help thinking how politics have changed since i was a young man when the labour party was widely seen to be the radical party <e> <s> it has now become one of the most conservative parties that we have had dedicated to the defence of large public monopolies and finding every conceivable conspiracy in any attempts to open them up to competition and to freedom <e> <s> i really was depressed by the speech of the noble lord lord glenamara <e> <s> without going quite so far or being quite so robust in my expression as my noble friend lord orr-ewing in the debates at a previous sitting of the committee it is stretching public credulity too far to think of what the noble lord referred to as the poor post office in some way unable to compete unable to defend its interests unable to use its enormous experience in this field and the dedication of the many people who work for it to keep its head above water in a liberalised rgime which is indeed rather more cautious particularly in its timing than many of my own noble friends would like <e>", "<cs> i have listened to my noble friend with care and i must say that i have very considerable sympathy with his views <e> <s> the point does however this was underscored by the contribution of the noble lord lord avebury raise some questions of general policy concerning offences of this kind and i would therefore like to put myself in a position to carry out some consultations on the wider implications <e> <s> therefore i shall consider the issue carefully and return to it at the report stage <e> <s> i hope that in the light of that and with gratitude to him for the contribution he has made my noble friend might withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i do not think anyone likes to be a teetotaller at a birthday party and this is somewhat the role in which i have been cast this evening <e> <s> being the odd man out in this way and in this debate is not entirely new to me because as the noble lord lord glenamara reminded us it is conventional within all governments to have a go and a grumble at the treasury <e> <s> because i spent some years in your lordships house in opposition as a treasury spokesman the corrupting influence of that department so to speak rubbed off on me a little and when i arrived at the department of employment i once in the early days suggested that i thought the treasury was right on one or two points <e> <s> there was a terrible silence as if one had strayed into an hm bateman cartoon <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> i produced no such parallel with british leyland or british steel <e> <s> i simply said that the arguments that we have heard tonight were also put forward at that time <e> <s> i did not think that they were pertinent then and i do not think that they are pertinent now but we have heard them before <e>", "<cs> i was a little unclear as to the purpose of the amendment <e> <s> it appeared to me to intend to remove the duty of british telecom to secure that the borrowing of its wholly-owned subsidiaries is contrained in the same way as that of the corporation itself <e> <s> in speaking to the previous amendment on which we have just divided i dealt with the constraints on the corporation itself <e> <s> it seems to me that the noble lord lord ponsonby is in fact rather overestimating the difficulties posed for the wholly-owned subsidiaries <e> <s> obviously they cannot exist to create a theoretical or actual gigantic loophole for the borrowing of the corporation but they are not in fact prevented from borrowing on the market they are constrained only by the need to obtain the necessary consent and again in the previous debate we went over the issues of consent <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> i think that the contribution of the noble baroness lady phillips was extremely pertinent in relation to the corporation <e> <s> but the fact is that we are debating the pension fund which is run by a tightly-knit body of financially-motivated men and is not an issue in this part of the debate <e> <s> i find this a very interesting subject and i congratulate the noble lord lord ponsonby on the pithy and coherent way in which he moved the amendment indeed i congratulate my noble friend lord hawke for talking if i may respectfully say so very sound financial sense that size is not always a virtue <e>", "<cs> i recognise that it is important to get this matter settled and i share the view that has been expressed by my noble friend <e> <s> we must go carefully but we cannot use that as a pretext for delay <e>", "<cs> if i rise at this point it is not for any purpose of trying to discourage debate hut simply because i think it might be convenient for the committee on this very important issue if i put the governments position quite clearly if i am able to do so at the beginning <e> <s> the amendment is concerned with the integrity of the public telephone service and that is a matter of great importance to all of us who use <e>", "<cs> i tried to make the governments case as fully and carefully as i was able to do and i do not wish to detain the committee by going over it again <e> <s> i listened with great interest to the speech of the noble and learned lord lord gardiner and indeed i could not help as it were mentally commissioning a painting for your lordships house about the rare deliberations between the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones and the noble and learned lord lord gardiner when they were in high office but i think the point he made was well answered by my noble friend lord rawlinson <e> <s> he asked me some specific questions and as he kindly suggested i will write to him on those <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord glenamara in fact told us we debated the principle of this issue at some considerable length last week when we were discussing clause and i regret that there is really very little that i can add to the remarks that i made at that time which remarks appear in column of <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord said we have gone over the principle of this in a different connection <e> <s> the noble lord lord ponsonby suggested that powers would allow the secretary of state to dispose of any asset owned by the post office <e> <s> but this is not so <e> <s> the power extends only to those assets not required for the proper discharge of their duties to provide either telephone or letter services <e> <s> moreover those parts of their undertaking which require the benefit of statutory privileges could not be disposed of without legislation since the various enactments only apply to the corporation <e> <s> i think that the noble lords fears are not well-founded <e> <s> i hope that he will not press the amendment to a division <e>", "<cs> when amendments are very close to those moved in another place we try to look at them afresh and to consider them absolutely on their own merits <e> <s> i have looked at the amendment and i have listened carefully to what the noble lord lord ponsonby has said <e> <s> nevertheless i am afraid that <e>", "<cs> i must confess that in some respects the noble and learned lord not for the first time and i am sure not for the last has bowled me out because i had not really anticipated that this particular amendment would be moved <e> <s> the reason is that almost everything indeed i think everything that i said in our debate on amendment no <e> <s> applies to the interception of mail <e> <s> it is certainly my advice that there is no as it were class distinction as between interception of mail and telephonic interception <e>", "<cs> i have to say to the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran that the position as between british telecom and the post office is identical <e>", "<cs> i am sure that all noble lords on this side of the committee are no less proud about being british than the noble lord lord glenamara <e> <s> again as so often and we must accept this as a difference of view he tends in our view to try to confuse nationally-owned assets with national assets and we do not necessarily make that connection <e> <s> there is no reason why privatising a company or selling government holdings in that company should make it any less or any more successful <e> <s> the questions of the ownership of shares do not seem to me to be the integrally important thing about the direction of such a company <e>", "<cs> i think it is a little wide of the amendment but that is perhaps my fault for introducing at this late hour some general principles but the noble lord lord kennet was good enough to be interested in my principles so i had better qualify a little what he said <e> <s> other things being equal there are great advantages in commercial enterprises being denationalised and being private <e> <s> the qualification exists where there are defence considerations or where there are security <e>", "<cs> given the premises on which the noble lord lord glenamara has pursued his arguments and defended his amendments i am not surprised or in any way shocked at this one <e> <s> i think that it is a little bit disingenuous to think that anybody in the public was really left in the dark about the fact that the policies under which the government fought the last election included substantial measures of privatisation <e> <s> if electoral manifestoes spelt out every clause of every bill that was liable to be brought before the house they would be less read than they are <e>", "<cs> these amendments would in any case be insufficient to achieve the end of trying to prohibit any shareholding in cable and wireless by foreigners since they would not control trading in new issues of capital <e> <s> leaving that aside it is well-known that trade in company shares is a notoriously difficult thing to regulate altogether <e> <s> i can of course understand the noble lords desire that cable and wireless should remain british it is a successful company and a valuable national asset <e> <s> but to prohibit any foreign shareholding would be quite inappropriate for a company like cable and wireless <e> <s> the noble lord himself made the good point about employees share participating schemes which he would wish to have and i would and it would be quite extraordinary if employees of the company were prohibited from employee participation simply because they were foreign nationals <e> <s> that would he an astonishingly illiberal form of provision for so famously international a company <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for allowing me to intervene <e> <s> before he leaves that point about write-off surely he is not suggesting that the british steel corporation should still be burdened with the interest on that lost investment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the remarks of the noble baroness lady seear and the noble lord lord ponsonby of shulbrede <e> <s> this whole bill seems like a somewhat technical bill concerned mainly with financing and writing-off previous investment and interest charges within the general pool of government expenditure but i think that it is in fact a lot more than that <e> <s> it is as i think the noble baroness appreciates though not alas <e> <s> yet the noble lord lord ponsonby a really terrifying indictment of how job protectionism costs money and jobs <e> <s> if this industry had been allowed to adapt its capacity at an orderly pace to the needs of the market those people who were displaced would have been able to seek work and find it in a much more propitious general atmosphere for employment and a no less propitious atmosphere in terms of the redundancy compensation which a civilised society provides <e> <s> again and again we have seen that the illusion has spread that if one works in a nationalised industry ones job can be saved and of course it can so often be saved for a bit longer <e> <s> but when time runs out and the money inevitably runs out all the more jobs go at a cataclysmic rate <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware of the interest in some form of national community service <e> <s> i am also aware that this is a long-standing interest and not restricted to the very critical situation at present when unprecedented numbers of young people are leaving school in an unprecedentedly poor <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for some very sensible supplementaries if i may say so <e> <s> the difficulty is that the kind of jobs available now for year-old school-leavers fundamentally unskilled jobs are disappearing fairly fast out of the economy <e> <s> most people who think of themselves as having a professional background will not seek to put their own children on the labour market aged <e> <s> this is increasingly liable to be denied to others due to changes in the economy <e> <s> the governments longer term objectives are to ensure that all or year-olds not in education or real employment should receive some systematic vocational preparations necessary up to the age of <e> <s> we are trying to move towards this <e>", "<cs> my lords i tried in my initial answer to give the governments view that a form of compulsory national community service would not be possible or desirable and that it would be better to proceed by extending the existing programmes into a systematic form of vocational preparation <e> <s> my lords i apologise for not answering the second supplementary from my noble friend lord sandford <e> <s> he is right to say that there are difficulties particularly as one comes out of recession in finding sufficiently skilled people to act as the trainers <e>", "<cs> my lords the ministry of defence sponsors youth opportunities programmes at present and has done so for some time <e> <s> ministers are discussing what further help might be given to unemployed young people by the ministry of defence <e>", "<cs> my lords i have considerable sympathy with the experience of the noble baroness as i too am in a rather comparable parental position <e> <s> but the youth opportunities programme provides some social skill training including elementary nursing <e> <s> as i said in my original answer we think that refining and improving this programme is still the best way to proceed <e>", "<cs> my lords i have investigated this <e> <s> unfortunately much as i should like to agree with the noble lord there is not a straight trade-off in cost between a form of allowance while one is still at school and either supplementary benefit or a youth opportunities allowance later <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord that it is desirable for people to stay on at school in order to get the right mix of qualifications and skills for a much tougher labour market in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very well prepared to take up this specific case with the manpower services commission which as the noble baroness knows operate these schemes <e> <s> my information is that community service volunteers have had fairly substantial government funds in the past but i will look into the present position <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that nearly everybody is agreed that the present apprentice system is unsatisfactory that it is much too rigid and needs change <e> <s> it is with that in view that the government have asked the manpower services commission to review the apprenticeship system in this country <e> <s> we will of course be deliberating on the results of that review <e>", "<cs> my lords i would have to take advice on my noble friends question <e> <s> i think the position would be that where british telecom are freely competing for the provision of services with the private sector as against any undertakings they have given to my noble friend or others on the mainframe system they would be able to levy a charge <e> <s> but i will take advice about that and come back to my noble friend if he will be so kind as to allow me that passage of time <e>", "<cs> my lords i did say to my noble friend lord hawke that i would come back to his point and in fact <e>", "<cs> my lords at the moment the corporation regardless of the passage of this bill and this is the point that i really want to get across can seek parliamentary assent to levy charges if it finds that it cannot maintain a service economically <e> <s> the short answer to my noble friend is that the position changes in no way <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think my noble friend is right in thinking that <e> <s> as one who hails from the republic of ireland the phrase we use there in this context is these islands <e> <s> that has become a tactful and general geographical expression <e> <s> quite clearly british islands means the united kingdom and the emphasis is on the provision of services to off-shore communities within the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a confusing issue as the noble lord is aware because the technical definition of the word scot is an irishman <e> <s> our history and geography and culture are pretty confused on these issues but i do not think our legislation is <e>", "<cs> but belgravia does do that my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will allow me the point i was making is that belgravia does subsidise the isle of skye and i am sure the noble lord lord lever is very content that it should do so <e> <s> it will continue to do so in respect of the monopoly over the primary network <e> <s> all we are suggesting liberalising is the secondary apparatus which should generate a great deal of development employment in this country and i should have thought that the noble lord lord glenamara would have welcomed that <e>", "<cs> my lords it may assist my noble friend if i explain the purpose of subsection of clause to which he has just referred and to which he drew attention when this house considered the clause in committee <e> <s> i apologise in advance that this is a detailed rather technical matter but i shall do my best to make it clear <e> <s> this subsection is no more than a definition of the phrase services which the corporation has the exclusive privilege of providing <e> <s> it does not create a new conclusive privilege there is only one such privilege conferred by the bill that of running telecommunications systems <e> <s> however the corporation does have power under clause to provide telecommunications and data processing services and of course it has a duty under clause to provide such telephone services as satisfy all reasonable demands for them <e> <s> it is not an undue simplification to say that the running of systems for which the corporation is given an exclusive privilege is a means to the end of providing services <e> <s> it is in the nature of things that some of these services for example the basic public telephone service could not be provided by anybody else unless they were to run a system and to run a system would infringe british telecoms exclusive privilege <e> <s> these are what is meant by services which the corporation has the exclusive privilege of providing and clause simply says so in order to try to make the meaning of the phrase precise <e>", "<cs> my lords i think both my noble friends are unhappy about something which is not in the nature of policy or in the nature of the bill but which is primarily semantic <e> <s> we are concerned to see that the common or everyday use of the word services can continue to function because as i <e>", "<cs> i think i have made the position clear my lords <e> <s> while both my noble friends lord morris and lord orr-ewing have made the area in which they have some disquiet clear i am saying there is no justification for that disquiet <e> <s> while we have phrased the bill in such a way as to make that distinction between systems and services very often the word service is used in a context where the running of a system is also implied <e> <s> that is the problem we have had and i have outlined the way we have tried to solve it <e> <s> i do not think there is any need for my noble friends disquiet in that as we have the basic principle of the monopoly in running the system into which services can be slotted or injected those services can be provided by british telecom in free competition and they can also be provided by other organisations and that is the purpose of the liberalising passages of the bill <e> <s> i do not believe therefore that their anxiety is justified but i shall read in <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the fact that there has been this lively debate indicates that people are concerned about a problem which is not peculiar to this industry or to this parliamentary system but to the whole question of relationships between large public trading sector industries and questions of public accountability and the accountability of ministers who sponsor them but do not run them <e> <s> i share many of my noble friends innate feelings that in an ideal world we would not have started down this road of large public trading sector monopolies with sponsoring ministers but that it would be disruptive and difficult to alter them or to change the system altogether <e> <s> what we seek to do is to try to liberalise them and thereby introduce elements of organic change <e>", "<cs> my lords these amendments would place a formal obligation on my right honourable friend the home secretary to consult interested parties at regular intervals <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend in the interests of getting on with the report stage in that he recommended that we should also look now at his new clause amendment no <e> <s> a <e> <s> my brief argues that the same substantive issues are <e>", "<cs> my lords i take my noble friends point about the necessity not to hold decisions too long and i do not think that anybody has a very glorious record in the public trading sector on this front <e> <s> but it is important that the right decision is made and we have also been debating the need for consultation <e> <s> what i have to rest on is that various noble lords have pointed out that the bill gives the secretary of state wide powers <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the pleasures of preparation for this particular bill was that one went around the industry and received very interesting and enlightening briefings and also a preview of many exciting new products <e> <s> i made every effort to mug-up some technical knowledge in a fast developing sphere <e> <s> i reckon that probably i got to o-level but not to a-level or to phd as evidenced by my noble friends question so i hope that he will allow me the indulgence that he was kind enough to suggest <e> <s> i will have his point looked at and will write to him <e> <s> if he is not satisfied and/or if he wishes to engage the house in the fact that he is not satisfied perhaps we could return to it at a later stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very happy to save time and take up the challenge of the noble lord lord underhill directly <e> <s> the governments policies were not based on beesley they were based on doctrine <e> <s> it is the clear doctrine of the government to try to liberalise british telecommunications monopoly and indeed wherever possible and at responsible speed to try to privatise the public sector trading monopolies wherever they can <e>", "<cs> hear hear <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord allow me <e> <s> i should like to make what i said absolutely clear <e> <s> by between now and <e> <s> that is not a very substantial rise in annual terms <e>", "<cs> my lords it was indeed the case when we debated the previous amendment that there was a clear divide a divide of doctrine if you like between the two principal parties in your lordships house <e> <s> we had made it clear that we should seek to liberalise the public sector where we could and that this bill was designed indeed to preserve the integrity of the network as the noble lord lord glenamara put it but to allow companies to compete in providing the services which could integrate with the national network <e> <s> that is a clear policy issue if you like between us <e> <s> therefore our argument could rest on political or if your lordships prefer the word doctrinal or even theological grounds <e> <s> in fact when i was being brought up a little theology was not thought to be such a disastrous thing from time to time <e>", "<cs> my lords i will give way but i did not want to give way at that sentence because i wanted to go on to say that it is much too gloomy to say that there is no prospect for our native industry that the government wisely in my view are protecting our native industry during the changeover period and that they have interpreted this changeover period pretty generously <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly i agree with the noble lord <e> <s> nothing that i suggested went on the old private/public sector divide <e> <s> i am conscious in my job of the contribution of the coal industry to the export of mining equipment <e> <s> this is an admirable industry and it has responded very well and is providing some of the most advanced equipment in the world <e> <s> there is no division between us <e> <s> we say that a wise parent protects the child as it grows up but that it would be a foolish parent that sought to protect the child once it had become an adult <e> <s> the government have also to take into account other interests <e> <s> in only the last amendment the noble lord lord glenamara was urging us to pay more attention to the interests of the consumers <e> <s> thinking protectionism apart from the damage it would do to a still very flourishing and <e>", "<cs> unlimited fine means a fine on which there is no limit <e>", "<cs> my lords i share the concern and desire of the noble lord lord ponsonby of shulbrede that local authoriies should not have placed upon them additional burdens at a time when we are anxious that so far as expenditure is concerned they should put their own house in order <e> <s> we have therefore not thought it right to impose upon them a duty to enforce the order <e> <s> we are confident that they will be able and will wish to take the steps which they feel to be necessary to enforce marking orders within their areas <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord but in fact we debated this clause with amendment no <e> <s> and i think i had the consent of the then leader of the liberal benches that we should do so <e> <s> does the noble lord wish to debate it again <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the position which the noble lord lord winstanley is in <e> <s> i believe the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran is even now winging his way towards us from the far east <e> <s> it may be that my remarks will percolate through the scaffolding and reach him in one way or another sooner or later <e> <s> this amendment is in fact quite plainly a narrow variation of one introduced by the noble lord lord lloyd in committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i think of my right honourable friend the home secretary as cinderella it is not an easy role for him to take <e>", "<cs> my lords my comment still stands <e> <s> for the duration of the government my right honourable friend is the home office and as i said i feel that cinderella is a curious role in which to cast him <e> <s> in fact it is the radio regulatory matters which are for the home office and they exercise those powers very well <e> <s> our intention is that the bulk of the regulatory work will be achieved under general licences as i said <e> <s> i do not think my noble friend need be too alarmed about the issue of whether departments of state have sufficient expertise <e> <s> departments of state are long-used to dealing with specialised areas of activity in the economy <e> <s> my own department the department of industry and the department of energy all have their own boffins if i may put it that way <e> <s> it is perfectly possible to sub-contract work to boffins outside ones own department where necessary and so i do not believe there need be any great anxiety on that score <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may take up first the point made by my noble friend <e> <s> it obviously is necessary to have powers to set different targets for bts monopoly and competitive activities <e> <s> however it did prove extremely intractable to us to draft the clause in such a way that the powers were explicitly limited to that <e> <s> ministers have told the corporation that they have no intention of using powers in this way <e>", "<cs> my lords it is nice to imagine that we all enjoy unanimity about external financing limits <e> <s> i can console the noble lord and indeed the house by saying that the government will unconditionally welcome any valid means of raising extra finance for telecommunications investment outside public sector borrowing requirement constraints <e> <s> it is not good enough however for the noble lord lord glenamara to say that the government are entwined <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord put the question squarely to me perhaps i might answer it now <e> <s> the essential difference is that it is not so much that governments whether the previous or present government make the judgment about the financing of nationalised industries <e> <s> it is that the money markets do and the money markets judge that financing in this sector on this scale carries an explicit government guarantee <e> <s> if i or my right honourable friend the chancellor were to announce to the world that the government were abolishing a guarantee in this area the noble lord lord underhill would probably find that the financing for such industries was very much harder to achieve <e> <s> that really is the nub of the issue <e> <s> it has not changed between this government and their predecessor and when the noble lord makes political points which it is perfectly fair for him to do he should also recognise that continuity <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> with the leave of the house before the noble lord sits down i wish to mention that in the passage that he quoted from my speech in committee he was making an error of interpretation which might have been due to a fault of mine <e> <s> i did not mean it as a complaint that one has to pay for investment <e> <s> of course investment has to be paid for and money has to be found <e> <s> when i spoke about the noble lord wanting nationalisation without tears i was saying that where a nationalised industry whose financing whether current or capital carries implicit government guarantee one is in the territory of external financial limits whether one likes it or not <e> <s> that is the difficulty which successive governments have had to face and which no government have yet found their way out of <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may answer the very direct question put to me by my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i was asked a question by my noble friend and i sought to answer it but if your lordships do not wish me to then i shall not <e>", "<cs> my lords by rising to my feet i am seeking the leave of the house <e> <s> i will sit down if the leave is not granted to me <e> <s> i think the answer to the very straightforward question put to me very clearly by my noble friend lord morris could also answer the general points made by the noble lord lord winstanley <e> <s> the difficulty is that behind private sector borrowing there is the assumption that competition or investment can end in failure <e> <s> behind public sector borrowing that assumption does not exist and that quite radically alters the character of the borrowing <e> <s> in my contention it alters the character of ones decisions at a very micro-level in private life <e> <s> if you get money from somebody who cannot go broke as against money from somebody who can the terms and conditions of your borrowing alter in degree and of course it is a very much larger degree where governments are concerned <e>", "<cs> broadly my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend for giving way <e> <s> i am very much under the impression that this was debated because the substantive issue is the same and was indeed brought to a decision following the last debate <e> <s> we are still on the external financing limit territory are we not <e>", "<cs> my lords again the complexity of the reply is because as my noble friend will appreciate these are rather plural areas and one dispute is not necessarily like another <e> <s> but broadly as i said the position is that the employment act would withdraw legal immunity in a case of the kind that my noble friend suggests <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the reasons why it happens very little is the passage of the employment act <e>", "<cs> my lords as i think my noble friend will be aware the government have misgivings about the whole system of immunity which obtains for historical and other reasons in our system <e> <s> to that end we have issued a discussion document for consultation <e> <s> the consultation period has now ended and we are considering what might result from it <e> <s> but my noble friend will also be aware that the ability to withdraw ones labour is of course universal endemic and effectively a right <e> <s> it is therefore a difficult area in which to intervene with any confidence <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to say that with the sad exception of the dispute between the government and their own employees we are at present enjoying a greater calm over the industrial landscape in terms of disputes than we have for many years <e>", "<cs> my lords i am in agreement with the sentiments expressed by my noble friend and it would be quite wrong to assume that dynamic and new commercial activities are restricted to towns <e> <s> there is of course in this context the work of cosira as well as some help provided by my own department under the community enterprise programme <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the predominant needs of businesses old and new is for stable or indeed lower rates of interest and the kind of additional costs on public spending required to correlate the sort of information that the noble lord would wish to have would be quite contrary to that need <e>", "<cs> my lords people feed information to governments in a number of different ways <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the major policies of both the previous government and this government has been to reduce employment in old overmanned industries and that is liable to continue for a considerable length of time <e>", "<cs> my lords the essence of getting lower charges for loans for businesses whether provided by government or by the financial sector is to have lower rates of inflation and therefore lower rates of real interest <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think any minister expresses himself satisfied but i am confident that such co-operation exists and i am grateful to the noble lord for drawing attention to its necessity <e>", "<cs> my lords i must first apologise to the noble and learned lord and indeed to the house for not being wholly clear on one point that the noble and learned lord made when he moved a very similar amendment during the committee stage of the bill <e> <s> at that time i made a guess which i think <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord lord gardiner said that i wrote to him but that i did not answer a number of points that he required me to answer <e> <s> that is true and i did not answer him inadvertently <e> <s> i have subsequently sent the noble and learned lord a letter apologising for the fact that the tail-end of my letter was omitted from the original draft and the noble and learned lord now has it <e> <s> my answer may not from his point of view be very satisfactory but i did not intend any discourtesy in my original answer it was simply an error for which i have apologised <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord <e> <s> obviously this is not a closed issue between the noble and learned lord and myself and i will now take up the answers to his questions which should have been given in my original letter <e> <s> the noble and learned lord is slightly incorrect in giving the air that there are some agencies which have the right to intercept our mail or telecommunications for whatever worthy ends <e> <s> agencies are not automatically authorised to do so <e> <s> as i said previously they are simply able to make applications to the home secretary <e> <s> the noble and learned lord asked me which agencies are involved and i repeat that they are the police customs and excise and the security service <e> <s> these are the agencies which can make applications and my right honourable friend can grant an application or withhold it and he exercises that right in each individual case <e>", "<cs> my lords naturally i have listened with great care to the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran and i understand him to be saying that the amendment is necessary in order to give some security for the activities of the air courier companies which at present carry express letters both to and from the united kingdom <e> <s> however i am not sure that the amendment is necessary and i certainly think that it would have undesirable consequences <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may have the leave of the house i would say that i have received further advice and i acknowledge and i apologise for this that i overstated the case in that the amendment before us deals only with mail passing in transit through the united kingdom <e> <s> i think however that my primary objection is not altered by that though i acknowledge that the rhetorical emphasis so to speak that i gave is changed <e> <s> but the integrity of the monopoly which is my prime objection added to the extent to which the government have met the air couriers case which i also repeated and on which noble lords and myself are in complete agreement i think still remain valid <e> <s> perhaps the best thing would be for noble lords to see what i have said on that in the light of my retraction of one part of my remarks and then they can decide whether they wish to return to the matter <e>", "<cs> not really my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to confess at the beginning that i had not anticipated going over this particular argument again at this stage because we dealt with it in considerable detail at committee stage and also it came up again a couple of days ago on the first day of the report stage <e> <s> but i altogether acquit the noble lord lord byers of as it were bowling me a fast one because i share with him the view and i have expressed this from this box as well as elsewhere that one of the central issues in current political and economic debate is the scale and funding of government deficits <e> <s> this is a major area of intractable difficulty for governments of either political party and if we could get it right and if we could get a breakthrough into new or more effective systems it would be very much for the good of industry in the country <e> <s> therefore i welcome the chance to go over one or two of the arguments again <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i am glad that for the duration of this amendment there is a conservative-liberal pact so to say <e> <s> i congratulate the noble lord on the ingenuity of his amendment <e> <s> it cuts right across the primary policy of the bill which is and again i apologise to your lordships for using the word about privatisation <e> <s> one of us will come up with a better word one of these days denationalisation i do not know <e> <s> the policy is also about removing the burden of the corporation from the taxpayer if there is no prospect of viability <e> <s> there is of course no compulsion for the activities of the corporation to be made private in this way and the bill as it stands allows for a variety of possibilities one of which is that the corporation might need to dispose of its iron and steel assets whether or not to private sector interests <e> <s> therefore the policy is to achieve the maximum flexibility <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord ponsonby has made very clear his amendments would remove the proposed modifications to the corporations powers contained in the bill <e> <s> our view is that the modifications of the powers will be important in meeting the objectives of securing the transfer of the british steel corporations owned businesses to the private sector <e> <s> these new powers which must of course be considered in conjunction with the matters which we discussed on the previous amendment with the removal of the duty to supply iron and steel products will allow the corporation to form companies to carry on iron and steel and non-iron and steel activities or to hold shares in companies carrying on those activities in conjunction with clause <e> <s> they will permit the corporation lawfully to carry on no activities themselves but merely to promote other companies in which they hold shares to carry on such activities and also as the noble lord reminded us will permit the corporation to reduce their own undertakings to minimal proportions <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord rochester could go a little further and put even more forcefully the fact that i have sympathy with the position that he has taken <e> <s> the government are passionately keen on consultation and participation within industry between managers and employees <e> <s> we believe that that is the only real way forward to improved industrial relations in this country <e> <s> we also recognise that where the run-down or de-manning of a major industry is involved the government have their own duty to consult to participate and to hold meetings <e> <s> i am glad to be able to tell the committee that my honourable friend the minister of state for industry met the tuc steel committee only last week for a general discussion of a very wide range of matters affecting the corporations future and that the meeting was friendly and constructive and opened channels of communication for further such meetings <e>", "<cs> once more i congratulate the noble lord lord ponsonby of shulbrede on his ingenuity <e> <s> in effect he has said that there is a lot of talk about going private and all the rest of it but that in fact the new clause shoved in at a late stage involves more interference by the government rather than less <e> <s> the short answer is that it is not the governments fault or the governments choice that british steel has grown into so large a figure in the industrial landscape as it has <e> <s> we introduced the powers complained of by the noble lord opposite simply to ensure that competition between british steel and private sector companies could be seen to be fair because this was a matter of great concern to private sector companies <e> <s> we received representations from private sector companies and that is part of the reason for taking a bill through parliament it gives time for people to make their representations <e> <s> that is why we inserted clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that any minister is ever entirely satisfied with anything <e> <s> nevertheless it seems to us that good progress has been made in the seventh round awards have already been made which include substantial commitments for carrying out real work under the licences <e>", "<cs> my lords it is certainly true that all of us would like all taxation to be lower and that certain companies have said that they are reviewing their exploration plans in the light of changes to the rgime <e> <s> nevertheless we have no evidence at all as yet that there is any diminution in interest in applications for licences <e>", "<cs> my lords i have long attended to nursery rhymes as a fountain of wisdom but in fact as i said to the noble lord lord strabolgi we have no evidence that there is any lessening of interest in exploration and the changes will of course yield an extra million in <e> <s> by our efforts to contain public spending i would hope that further taxes would not be necessary <e> <s> however this is a difficult struggle as my noble friend is aware <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are in constant discussion with the industry <e> <s> of course the industry is not happy at additional taxes none of us is in personal or corporate capacities and the government regret the situation which led to their being levied <e> <s> nevertheless i rest on my answer that the progress of the seventh round gives us no indication that there is any diminution of interest <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a geological fact that the quality of north sea oil is very high so we are dealing with that which is extremely expensive in terms of its quality <e> <s> ever since the north sea was developed we have exported north sea oil at a high price in order to buy lower grades of oil at a lower price <e>", "<cs> my lords on the specific question put to me by the noble lord lord bowden i understand that the accounts will of course be available in british telecoms annual statement which has to be laid before parliament but if the noble lord will be so kind as to allow me to check on that i will do so and will also write to him on the methodology employed by the corporation in laying its accounts <e> <s> i imagine it is the same as in the case of all the other public sector industries but i should like to check it if i may <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords when i moved the second reading of this bill i suggested that it was one of the most important bills of this parliament and i think that the subsequent debates in your lordships house have confirmed that judgment <e> <s> telecommunications are and will continue to be of fundamental importance to the country <e> <s> at the moment we are standing on the threshold of very rapid developments in telecommunications <e> <s> the new technologies especially those concerning information handling will revolutionise most of our lives <e> <s> we need a new framework for new telecommunications in order to make this revolution possible and we need a framework that will enourage innovation and give entrepreneurs the chance to provide new services and thereby to create new jobs <e>", "<cs> my lords what the government are trying to move towards is a situation here such as that which obtains in germany where far fewer young people are seeking employment because far more are going on into some form of vocational education <e>", "<cs> my lords to answer the first part of the noble lords supplementary my previous answer indicated a fair degree of hopefulness <e> <s> as i said we are concentrating on the school-leaver the and year-old on the principle that far too many people in this economy seek real paid employment in that age group in relation to our competitors <e>", "<cs> my lords there are some disadvantages to decentralised bodies such as the manpower services commission but one of the advantages is that they are tripartite bodies as it were and the consultative document which we have welcomed is of course backed by the trade unions and i am very glad that that is so <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord kilmarnock will no doubt be aware i shall be moving the second reading of this very bill on tuesday of next week and so perhaps this point had better wait until then <e>", "<cs> my lords the marginally more referred to by the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe is in fact and it seems to me that when you are or that is quite a lot of money <e>", "<cs> my lords while the lead and lag times are both long in the oil industry as my noble friend is well aware i certainly agree with him that these are finite resources and the resource considerations will probably make exploration in deeper waters viable <e> <s> when that time comes the government will certainly be prepared to consider incentives additional to those already obtaining <e>", "<cs> my lords as i believe i have said to my noble friend and to the house before i think we all regret increases in taxation whether in a corporate or a personal capacity but as i said to my noble friend on another occasion i do not think that taxation changes are yet having a significant effect on the general level of exploration in the continental shelf <e> <s> if and when they do the government will act accordingly <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i think it should indeed but i believe we shall see a very different position as the world comes out of recession and as there are more general incentives to produce hydrocarbons rather faster <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> we shall today be debating the very important subject of industrial training and part of the framework necesary to enable <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with every word which the noble lord has said on this subject but i said that the trainee might make a contribution in the form of lower wages <e> <s> the noble lord with all his experience might share my view that perhaps adult rates clock on rather early in this economy relative to the economics of our competitors <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree with the remark made by the noble lord lord granville of eye who has just spoken that the government need more than this bill <e> <s> i would remind the house that i tried to make it clear in my opening speech that the bill is simply a step the creation of a framework in what is a much larger total policy about training and that it would indeed be disappointing if the government were relying on this particular bill to bring us forward into all aspects of training in the next decade <e> <s> that is not the intention at all and if noble lords would be kind enough to check up in <e>", "<cs> my lords what i am saying is and my opening speech suggested that certainly all is not well in the field of training but that we need plural solutions for training <e> <s> i am not convinced and it seems to me that these figures on exemption bear out the point that industry is not capable in very many cases of responding without levy to its training needs <e> <s> what the bill is fundamentally doing is allowing the secretary of state who is after all in the last degree responsible for the money and responsible to parliament to exercise a judgment after consultation with the manpower services commission and after the end of the commissions review to wind up boards if need be <e>", "<cs> my lords that is exactly why i said that two points had to be considered not only the point i have just made which i only produced in evidence as an indicator that many industries do look <e>", "<cs> my lords no not without notice but i shall write to the noble lord on that point <e> <s> on the telecommunications recommendations <e>", "<cs> my lords there may not be a common defence programme as it were but of course the european countries have substantial defence industries and their own procurement not least our own and one thinks of the french have had an important role in the life of gec racal ferranti and many of our great companies in this area <e> <s> but that said i shall of course examine what the noble lord said and perhaps in return he will bring his very sensible views to bear on some of his rather less sensible colleagues in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords as an employment minister and if i may say so a bigger spending minister than i should like to be i am well aware of the high costs of social problems in our economy <e> <s> that is why i should like a more competitive and more wealthy economy in order to be able to distribute the money <e> <s> with regard to the points about the right honourable gentleman the leader of the opposition i would say that it is quite fair and right to put forward alternative policies but it is not fair nor is it right to try to put forward alternative arithmetic <e>", "<cs> my lords it is certainly true that when the right honourable gentleman the leader of the opposition last held high office unemployment doubled and he and his government were in the hands of international creditors in the form of the international monetary fund within months <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the effect would be fairly devastating indeed and i take the point that the noble lord makes <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that that was a very helpful supplementary question <e> <s> the noble lord asked me what i thought <e> <s> i must confess that i have always been an agnostic about policies <e> <s> what i find is that the intractable arithmetic of a trading economy in a world recession cannot be easily bucked <e> <s> no matter how painful it may be one must secure a more competitive economy which can trade more evenly with its overseas competitors in order to be able to restore the levels of social spending that this economy appears to demand <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend in both his agricultural and historical metaphors <e>", "<cs> my lords i really feel that the noble lord must be a little more analytical <e> <s> successive governments of various political persuasions have seen unemployment rise during their tenure of office <e> <s> the sad fact of the matter is that governments do not create very much employment <e> <s> the success or failure of an economy determines employment <e> <s> we are trying to establish the conditions in which the economy can become more successful <e>", "<cs> my lords the usual channels have arranged for the report stage and third reading to take place on friday week and that still leaves us a little time before the beginning of the recess so i cannot say which will be the first <e>", "<cs> my lords we have not discussed this issue specifically with the trade unions as it is best dealt with directly between employers and unions in individual cases <e> <s> the noble viscount is however quite right to point out that if work is shared to create extra jobs those involved must accept that their combined wages should be shared too in order to allow the goods or services they produce to remain competitive <e> <s> otherwise all the jobs will be put at risk <e>", "<cs> my lords no one is keener to bring down unemployment that i am and i know of cases where firms have offered one salary for two jobs to young people and to new recruits and that seems to me to be an admirable and sensible thing to do <e> <s> but overall as i said in my original answer it is more sensible for unions and employers to negotiate together about the sharing of work than for the government to plunge in themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords the per cent <e> <s> figure is not accurate in any respect and the noble viscount must be aware that the unemployment register is a constantly shifting register <e> <s> even at this particular dark hour more than people a month are leaving the register <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords since the proposal is the proposal of the noble viscount lord hanworth and not mine that question is perhaps more properly directed to him <e>", "<cs> my lords i would very much welcome the co-operation of the noble lord and his friends in talking to unions about the lowering of objections to activities by young people which are at present undertaken by unionised labour <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i have no objection to the proposition that lower wages will protect more jobs <e> <s> i agree with both the noble viscount and the noble viscount lord hanworth on that <e> <s> my objection was as to whether the government were the best agency to try to determine what people should bargain at the workplace in this respect <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much enjoy the financial language on the lips of the noble lord with his background <e> <s> i must point out and this is a view not necessarily of the government however that the cbi recently came out against a reduction in hours overall because of loss of competitiveness <e> <s> but as i said to the noble viscount lord hanworth where people are offering two jobs for one salary that would seem to me to be a sensible way to proceed particularly where new recruits are concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> sometimes one asks the committee to resist an amendment with which one has some sympathy <e> <s> this is the case at the moment <e> <s> my objection to the noble lords amendment is the inappropriateness of statute in this field rather than that i have any disagreement with him in his analysis of the poverty of real vocational training in this country <e> <s> we have said that on many occasions and my right honourable friend the secretary of state has consistently compared as have many of his colleagues our own situation adversely even for those in work as the noble lord lord kilmarnock reminded us with the situation that obtains with some of our competitor countries <e> <s> we shall give what the noble lord has said great consideration just as we shall give considerable weight to the report by the msc as and when we start taking decisions about the future of boards <e>", "<cs> first of all not all the training boards by any means are liable to go in fact it is a very open question as to which of them will go at the moment <e> <s> secondly we have in government a department of employment and a secretary of state for employment <e> <s> it seems to me to be somewhat in the area of political science fiction to suggest that any secretary of state for employment however much i myself might disagree with some of his politics or whatever would be uninterested in training issues <e> <s> thirdly we have the manpower services commission which with its tripartite character if i may use that jargon to save time is unlikely not to be interested in training issues within its orbit <e> <s> fourthly those people on the itbs that remain and they are liable to be the key itbs are not likely and on this i think the noble <e>", "<cs> may i just say to the noble lord lord mccarthy that i congratulate him on skilfully driving in the slipstream of the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i am reluctant to repeat myself and as the noble lord lord mccarthy very fairly implied there is some overlap between his amendment and the previous amendment though of course his is <e>", "<cs> well in fact some are paid and some are not <e> <s> but very often a suspicious opposition will say we will try to get this on the <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> i have to say that i do rather share that view speaking in a personal capacity <e> <s> of course i do not in any way wish to gag the noble lord lord hatch of lusby who is as concerned about these issues as i am but perhaps he could beam his general argument on to the principle of the clause and we should get on rather faster <e>", "<cs> i think i can clear up some of the noble lords difficulties quite quickly or rather the specific difficulty that he says he finds in the governments professed desire to improve training and the bill which enables the secretary of state to wind up itbs if necessary after taking the advice of the manpower services commission and subject to the procedures of parliament which i itemised earlier <e> <s> the noble lord lord hatch and the noble lord lord mccarthy are both falling into what i would judge to be a common fallacy in the labour party which is to identify an issue too closely with the institutions that exist to serve it <e> <s> that is a marked difference of view between us <e> <s> again i do not wish to take a contentious example but it might be that there would be a situation where an institution existed to serve the blind indeed many such institutions exist and an excellent job most of them do but the aim of people within the institution or even parliament to reform a particular institution should not be looked upon as an <e>", "<cs> i have always thought that the noble lord lord mccarthy was one of the most sensible members of the labour party in the sense that he has a close knowledge in practical terms of what industry is like and he does not base his work outside this house for industry and inside this house talking about industry on any fictional sense of their needs or even referring back to the last amendment to any poetic sense of their needs <e> <s> yet now he wants to superimpose yet new central government powers on top of the existing system of industrial training bodies <e>", "<cs> i certainly agree with my noble friend lord auckland that there is much in this amendment which the government should attend to <e> <s> it in no way downgrades the amendment or the very clear way in which it has been moved if i say that very much of what is in it and very much of what has been said has already been considered by the government and where issues of principle are concerned has indeed been accepted by the government <e>", "<cs> i simply do not accept that interpretation <e> <s> it seems to me to be semantic it may be a fair debating point because i may not have made myself sufficiently clear or i may have used the wrong words <e> <s> a way of reinforcing what i said by using slightly different language is to draw attention to the fact that the noble lord said we were returning to a pre- position <e> <s> one or two noble lords have suggested that that would be pure reliance upon voluntary arrangements and that as a result training would become inadequate <e> <s> however we have made it very clear and i am happy to use this chance to repeat it that we are not going to get rid of statutory training boards in those key sectors where we believe that essential training objectives we have already debated how these are defined could not be met without them <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that there is some difference of view between my noble friend and myself on this matter even though it may have the effect of making the noble lord lord mccarthy and his friends feel that i am not in some way doctrinaire <e> <s> under the act as amended by the act levy exemption criteria may require compliance with national standards of training but the numbers to be trained must be related to the needs of a particular establishment <e>", "<cs> the clause under discussion extends the possible and i stress possible criteria for exemption from levy to include the needs of the industry as a whole and not just those of the individual establishment <e> <s> and that presumably is the bit to which my noble friend does not utter the words hear hear <e>", "<cs> i do like to create whatever happiness i can in this house i am glad that my noble friend has suggested that my own hands are clean even if he seems dubious about those of the treasury <e> <s> nevertheless i have to tell him and the committee that the government consider that they must have in principle the power to impose a terminal levy on employers <e> <s> of course we realise that many employers feel very strongly that there should be no terminal levies and we shall take that into account when we come to take any decisions about the future of boards <e>", "<cs> the position is that this is an enabling bill <e> <s> we are not discussing the winding up of a particular training board nor are we saying what board might be wound up or when <e> <s> we are giving powers to the secretary of state subject to parliament to make these decisions in accordance with criteria which have been published and when he and by proxy parliament think fit <e> <s> in these somewhat clouty as i am prepared to admit circumstances the secretary of state in our contention should have the power in certain circumstances to impose a terminal levy on employers but employers will not usually be shy about raising objections to this if they think it unfair and those would be taken into account at the time <e>", "<cs> the noble lord must not get away with the notion that health and safety regulations do not apply in enterprise zones <e> <s> of course they do as do most protections which pertain to individuals <e> <s> i do not mind a bit of teasing about the pure milk or whatever it was of free competition <e> <s> i have always looked upon myself as belonging to the gaullist rather than the th century liberal wing of the conservative party <e> <s> i prefer to think of enterprise zones as help for the disabled <e> <s> that is a principle to which all governments have tended to subscribe <e> <s> we have no intention in this year of the disabled of withdrawing our aid from them <e> <s> indeed we have managed to keep it up <e>", "<cs> i tend to believe with my noble friend in the good john hampden principle of no taxation without representation <e> <s> therefore when i was examining this amendment i had to be satisfied by my officials that employers should have a significant say in the disbursement of funds which they had provided <e> <s> but my noble friend wants to go a little further than that <e> <s> we have given careful consideration to the possibility of giving employers an outright majority on training boards but in our view that goes a bit too far in giving employers dominance on boards at the expense of employee and education interests because my noble friends amendment would give employers control over all aspects of boards work and that could be used to frustrate training objectives <e>", "<cs> the point i was referring to was that if you are going to have a levy in an itb there now needs to be a majority of employer members on the board in favour to get that levy <e> <s> that seems a significant improvement in the employer position <e>", "<cs> the bill is certainly not making an attack on tripartitism but as i said in speaking to the fears expressed by my noble friend in the previous amendment on good principles of no taxation without <e>", "<cs> my lords i have very high regard for the british gas corporation <e> <s> but my view is that its main responsibility should be to supply gas which it does very effectively <e> <s> i see no reason why such a public utility should be a major holder of capital in our economy <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend that british private capital is no less british than a british public asset <e>", "<cs> my lords i find that an extraordinary comment <e> <s> up to about billion every year is invested out of the capital markets of the united kingdom and there is plenty of united kingdom capital for such assets of which this is one <e>", "<cs> my lords it is obviously for the british gas corporation itself to conduct the sale but in every other respect i agree with the noble viscount <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not accept the argument of the noble lord at all <e> <s> this is a very successful and very well managed public utility corporation to which i am delighted to pay tribute <e>", "<cs> that is another issue <e> <s> it is a contiguous issue <e> <s> there is no reason why the fact that a company or corporation is successful at something that it should enjoy a continuous monopoly in that field <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble friend who has put the point that i was seeking to make rather more graphically <e>", "<cs> my lords i would think that that would have been considerably later and by then it will be too late <e>", "<cs> my lords i enjoy the good fortune to have friends with whom i stay at the weekend from time to time overlooking wytch farm so i have a personal interest of that kind <e> <s> it is one of the most beautiful parts of dorset <e> <s> it has been well guarded so far and i shall see that that continues <e>", "<cs> my lords for the reason i gave earlier i do not think that is so <e> <s> as the noble lord lord lever reminded us in his maiden speech in this house from the benches opposite there is no shortage of national capital in this economy <e> <s> there is something of a shortage of profitable ventures into which that should go which is one of the reasons why we have very large-scale overseas investment <e> <s> this is a profitable investment and british capital will flow into it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for reminding us of some of the difficulties that can fall on the disabled in respect of post offices and i shall draw her point to the attention of the post office <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful for that information <e> <s> i am glad that dartmouth is so enlightened and i hope that others will follow <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for trying to clarify the bill although i must tell him with great deference and respect that in my view the amendment does not have that effect but in fact obfuscates rather than clarifies <e> <s> the bill provides new consultation requirements before an industrial training board is established and applies the same requirements to cases where a boards scope is changed or where a board is abolished <e> <s> my noble friends amendment provides that the new consultation requirements do not apply to cases where a boards scope is changed or where a board is abolished <e> <s> this therefore would give governments much greater freedom to abolish or change boards without consultation with the manpower services commission and without the commission consulting the industries concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i confess that i am working from my brief rather than from the marshalled list and it may be that i have missed something <e> <s> however my advice here which seems to be clear in respect of what my noble friend has said is that the provisions in section relate to levy proposals made by boards under section and not to terminal levies imposed under section <e> <s> terminal levies are imposed by orders made by the secretary of state without any proposals from boards <e> <s> so the provisions in section a and b are specifically disapnlied from terminal levies by section which provides that a levy may be imposed on employers <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much take the blame for the delay and for the fact that my noble friend received a letter from my noble friend lord lyell rather late <e> <s> the reason for this was that i was in fact anxious to fall over backwards and sideways to try to accommodate my noble friend and have the matter looked at several times to see whether i could meet him and i spent a great deal of time on it myself <e> <s> as my noble friend will appreciate there are of course some pressures and exigencies on business at this time of the year but in spite of that i wanted to go over the matter with the care that i have just mentioned <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i could step into this difficulty between the noble lord lord mccarthy and my noble friend lord mottistone though i am not sure whether i really should because maybe their own fire would hit each other and i should escape unscathed <e> <s> the facts are that the words in amendment no <e> <s> are already in the legislation <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> therefore works by leaving out words about the terminal levy <e> <s> while the government are not happy and do not accept the logic of the amendments moved by my noble friend i have to say that they are extremely well drafted <e> <s> in other words we do not have our squabble about the english that we had on the first amendment <e> <s> there is nothing wrong with the drafting of my noble friends amendments <e> <s> what is wrong with them is perhaps the sentiments <e>", "<cs> my lords both the noble lord lord rochester and the noble lord lord mccarthy in support very fairly said that we were returning to the same ground we covered in committee in a slightly more limited sense as i fully acknowledge <e> <s> i do not want to repeat my remarks at the committee stage particularly as just as one should not seek a false consensus one should not seek false confrontation <e>", "<cs> my lords what has been accepted is not compulsion as to what is taught or how the education is conducted but the age and broad structure the age of the pupils and when they may leave school and the provision by statute for their schooling <e> <s> i would suggest that that is a very different form of compulsion or form of statutory undertaking from what we are discussing here <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i tried to make it clear he must check this carefully with <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has indeed modified the amendment he moved in committee which then sought to preserve the present situation under which the criteria for getting exemption from levy have to relate to the needs of particular establishments of employers <e> <s> he is now proposing to allow these exemption criteria to relate to the wider needs of industry only if individual employers agree <e> <s> i am indeed most grateful to him for trying to move towards the governments position <e> <s> i can assure him that the government are sensitive to the views he has expressed and to the fears of some parts of industry that wider exemption criteria will be used to make them pay for unnecessary training <e> <s> we do not think that these fears are likely to be realised but if they were the government could prevent levy exemption proposals from being put into action <e> <s> that is why i should not think that my noble friends amendment would be necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords i was speaking to the package of amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> i rather anticipated that amendment no <e> <s> would be taken separately but i am grateful to my noble friend for correcting me <e> <s> he took amendment no <e> <s> with his first package <e> <s> all i have to say about amendment no <e> <s> is that the legal powers already exist for grants to be made to employers and already are used to channel government money to those employers who provide training which goes beyond their immediate needs <e> <s> so we have certainly no intention of withdrawing those powers <e>", "<cs> my lords i have absolutely no objection to this amendment except one that it does not seem to me to be needed <e> <s> i agree with my noble friend that it is desirable where employers are providing the money for boards operating costs as well as money for grants and other training expenses that employers should have a controlling voice in the way in which <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the thanks which have been expressed in regard to the notes on clauses and for the kind words which the noble lord lord rochester used about me <e> <s> i am only sorry that i have not made one thing clear and perhaps i may take two minutes at the end of the consideration of this bill to try to make it clear <e>", "<cs> my lords i think all of us accept that and certainly the earnest of the governments intentions in this regard is not simply their rhetoric although i for one welcome any progress away from invervention because we have had too much of it <e> <s> the real earnest is the money that is being spent <e> <s> certainly i do not think we can be accused of not taking these responsibilities at all seriously <e> <s> all i am trying to say is that what we put into statute and what we put into policy may not be distinct but there may be a distinction or difference of view as to what you should exercise in policy and whether that exercise of policy should be framed in statute <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the commons amendments be now considered <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house doth agree with the commons in their amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> this amendment takes account of the points made by the opposition during the commons committee stage <e> <s> it is intended to prevent companies sterilising large areas of the deep seabed by obtaining licences for several sites but carrying out little or no development work on them <e> <s> including diligence requirements in the list of possible terms and conditions for licences underlines the importance attached to this principle and indicates that the government intend to license only serious applicants who can be expected to make good use of their licences <e> <s> we have moved towards the opposition view on this and i hope therefore that the commons amendment is acceptable <e> <s> beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house doth agree with the commons in their amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> here again we are trying to meet a point

ireland in the last years with so little loss of life <e>", "<cs> my lords water cannon are available to the royal ulster constabulary and they are used on occasion <e> <s> but as i said in my original answer this is the most effective form of crowd control <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord brockway for his kind remarks <e> <s> i am of course aware that he addressed the question to issues concerning great britain as well as northern ireland <e> <s> but as i pointed out in my original answer my noble friend lord belstead has just dealt with this in a question <e> <s> the guidance given to the security forces in northern ireland is basically the same as that given to police in great britain <e> <s> everyone regrets that the police should have to use any weapons on any occasion <e> <s> my own judgment for what it is worth is that the presence and the knowledge about this weapon has reduced the need for the police to use other kinds of arms which could be more lethal <e>", "<cs> my lords i would agree that economic conditions in northern ireland are worse than they are in the rest of the united kingdom which is one of the reasons why it is so important to restore stability both politically and in terms of security in the province <e> <s> but i would not agree with the further points made by the noble baroness <e> <s> the evidence does not support her contentions <e> <s> i am glad to report that the northern ireland scheme is proving very successful in providing worthwhile employment for the longer term unemployed and the planned number of places has been not only fulfilled but exceeded <e>", "<cs> my lords i have seen a report of the attack <e> <s> i think it is widely felt that for many years people both within and outside political groupings have been bipartisan about the northern ireland issue and it is very unhelpful not to be so <e> <s> but i think that all political parties have their mavericks and mr

and i have had many meetings with trade unions in northern ireland which certainly confirm my noble friends point of view <e> <s> my noble friend the leader of the house points out that i should not have mentioned a member of another place by name <e> <s> i apologise for doing that but i in no way retract anything else that i said <e>", "<cs> my lords not only should we be concentrating on those issues we are concentrating on them <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state as well as myself and other ministers have constantly reiterated the danger facing the economy of northern ireland and the necessity to restore political stability there in order to encourage inward investment and to encourage too the british taxpayer who pays so much of the subvention to northern ireland <e> <s> we are pleased that this message is getting through <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree with the latter point but the simple fact is that there is not unfair discrimination in the case of northern ireland <e> <s> there is discrimination the discrimination is that northern ireland gets more money comparably than any other part of the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to do that but of course i had to answer a question put to me by my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i was talking about the crown in its pristine splendour somewhere around the mid-s <e>", "<cs> my lords i was around but it is possible that my instruction was outside the strict limits of the law at the time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware of the importance that the noble lord attaches to integration and indeed the importance which many people in northern ireland attach to the issue of integration and i will of course bear it in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful for the extremely helpful way in which the house has debated this sad necessity to go for the order again <e> <s> i am sure that the welcome and the responsible and sympathetic way in which it has been made will commend the house very much to the province <e> <s> we in parliament sometimes are under the illusion that everybody in the country is hanging on our lips <e> <s> they may or may not be <e> <s> but on these occasions they certainly do in the province <e> <s> i am sure that what is being said here today will go down there extremely well <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may take up the last point made by the noble earl i would say that i think that there has been a shrinking away from naming names not because of timidity in regard to the name in question but rather because of a parliamentary convention which i am ashamed to say i myself violated the other day that one does not mention by name people from another place <e>", "<cs> my lords in the last few moments of this most interesting debate i thought that anyone who had casually strayed into the chamber might gain a brief but very valuable insight into why things are so difficult in the irish scene <e> <s> there are <e>", "<cs> my lords the difficulty with referenda and i want to say something about them in just a moment in respect of another point put to me is really twofold <e> <s> it lies in the nature of the question you ask and the timing of the answer <e> <s> it is not a satisfactory permanent mechanism for dealing with these affairs <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord blease for his general support and also for his kindness in giving me prior notice of some of the issues that he wished to raise <e> <s> the noble lord and the house will appreciate that of course this rather limited order dealing with rating issues is not really concerned with wider problems which may be suffered by people who own caravans and northern ireland is an excellent place in which to own a caravan <e> <s> there are many fine sites and broadly we all enjoy facilities without much difficulty <e> <s> but obviously in any leisure pursuit which many people follow occasionally there are problems <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the draft electricity service finance northern ireland order which was laid before the house on th january be now approved <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord blease paid tribute to the staff of the northern ireland electricity service and i am glad to thank him for that and endorse it wholeheartedly and thank him for his commercial in marketing terms for the favourable tariff rates we can offer industry settling with us <e> <s> that was a very good point to make and i hope it will be attended to <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the three noble lords for their reception of the order <e> <s> i would also like to take the opportunity in commenting on their remarks to pay my own tribute as the sponsoring minister in northern ireland to the public service there and to say perhaps as a footnote to what the noble lord lord donaldson has just said that whatever the problems in northern ireland and there are many the quality and calibre of the public servants and indeed of their unions are not the cause of these problems <e> <s> they are excellent in calibre and quality as i have personal reason to know <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord moves on to his next point will he very kindly repeat his first point about the word that troubled him in the forestry estimates <e> <s> i did not quite catch the point and i should like it looked at by my officials <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps r may write to the noble lord on both of those points <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may i should like to congratulate all those who have spoken on the acute and expert points put to me <e> <s> this of course brings a problem for the winder-up because he needs to go into some detail which will be of interest to some while not being of such interest to others <e> <s> i shall have to go at a bit of a gallop because noble lords did not rest on the heels of generalities but asked me quite informed and specific questions <e>", "<cs> my lords in that case so do i the noble lord asked me how serious in employment terms are likely to be the consequences of bankruptcies among de lorean suppliers in northern ireland <e> <s> i am afraid that i can do no more than speculate on this matter at the moment <e> <s> but any loss of employment would of course be a very great blow to the province <e> <s> as has already been made clear by my honourable friend in another place the government cannot accept responsibility for the de lorean motor companys liabilities <e> <s> at the same time however individual northern ireland firms faced with temporary difficulties following the receivership but with firm prospects of viability may be able to get assistance from government under our schemes for the maintenance and assistance of employment <e> <s> sir kenneth cork as the receiver has made it clear that he is committed to continuing the operation of the motor company albeit at a reduced level <e> <s> we must hope that his great talents succeed in bringing it off <e> <s> i can also say to the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge that i like him have had many happy nights at the belfast opera and look forward to many more <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble lord <e> <s> i did make a note of that point and i shall examine it seriously <e> <s> we had discussions last autumn with some of the political groupings about the way forward for the economy <e> <s> last week the noble lord and i both attended a very lively conference at the polytechnic on the economy <e> <s> i will see whether we can knit some of these ravelled strands together <e> <s> nevertheless it seems to me that this is yet one more argument for trying to achieve more political responsibility more devolved activity in the province <e> <s> it is more convincing if the province itself tries to deal with some of the difficulties in the economy albeit with the help of funds raised by the rest of the british people <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to have that learned applause at this point <e> <s> article remedies that injustice so that a thief can no longer set up a defence of limitation but protects a subsequent purchaser for value who has acted in good faith <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful for the remarks made by the noble lord lord blease and by his noble and learned friend lord elwyn-jones <e>", "<cs> my lords on a sad and worrying day i am really most grateful for the welcome from the official opposition front benches which i have just received for my right honourable friends statement <e> <s> that is very gratifying to us and i hope that the remarks of both noble lords will be heard in northern ireland itself <e> <s> the noble lord lord blease said that there had been a stream of statements by politicians as well as leaks and speculation <e> <s> i think that that is the ordinary hazard of the consultative process <e> <s> in fact i do not think that it was so much a problem of leaks as a question of the people whom we consulted going out and issuing press notices quite overtly and right away the moment we had finished talking to them <e> <s> but that is part of the process and we certainly make no criticism of that <e>", "<cs> my lords again i am very grateful for that endorsement of my right honourable friends statement <e> <s> it is particularly welcome coming as it does from a noble lord with considerable distinguished service and experience as a minister in northern ireland albeit in another political incarnation <e> <s> i would also endorse what the noble lord lord donaldson has said about the competence of northern ireland politicians <e> <s> we would just ask them now to face their own reality squarely and to start working together for the good of all <e> <s> if i suggested in the province that northern ireland politicians should go to hong kong i might be open to misinterpretation but i will certainly draw to their attention the point which the noble lord has made <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord lord shinwell has slightly misunderstood what said <e> <s> i said very clearly that no british government can impose their own views on the province <e> <s> nevertheless it is also true and the noble lord with his experience will be aware of this that the views of one side of a divided community in northern ireland cannot be imposed on the other <e> <s> that is one of the principal reasons why the power-sharing <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are constantly paying attention to points of view though of course one particular poll does not make a summer <e> <s> but where the issue of full integration with the united kingdom is concerned the role of northern ireland as a constituent part of the united kingdom has been made quite clear by legislation and by myself in my statement <e> <s> if the noble lord means by full integration a form of extra or improved tier of local government in northern ireland i can only say to him that that does not evade the responsibilities of elected representatives there to make the same mutual accommodations and confront the same dilemmas inherent in northern irelands unique political history and character as i mentioned only a moment ago <e>", "<cs> my lords the bulk of law and order responsibilities for example the royal ulster <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly draw that to the attention of my noble friend the chief whip <e> <s> as the noble lord will be aware these are not matters for me but for the usual channels <e> <s> the noble lord makes his views and desires perfectly clear and they will of course be taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords may i make a general welcome to the way in which the order has been received <e> <s> it is with a very peculiar sense of <e>", "<cs> my lords i missed the last part of the noble lords question <e> <s> what was it that the government foresaw <e>", "<cs> my lords i will not give any hostages to fortune in general and to the noble lord lord wedderburn in particular <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for what he has said and i shall indeed convey the sentiments of the house to the general officer commanding in northern ireland about the tragic incident to which my noble friend has referred <e> <s> as i understand it and without prejudice to the investigation of the case the people involved might not have been even teenagers they might have been pre-teenagers which is a very horrifying indication of what can happen <e> <s> with regard to the situation in the south atlantic i do not think that it and the northern ireland situation are comparable <e> <s> as i understand it the terms of compensation and pension arrangements for service personnel are the same all over the services but at the moment the public are showing their special interest in and support for the servicemen in the south atlantic which we all share <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state for defence is therefore receiving such donations as the public are voluntarily giving in this respect to a special fund <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord shinwell for reminding the house that in northern ireland the police are very much in the front line of security efforts with the army principally in the position of backing up the police <e> <s> it is the view of the police that in particularly dangerous circumstances the plastic baton round is the best form of protection for their personnel engaged in difficult tasks <e> <s> that said as i stated in my original answer the police and the army are both subject absolutely to the requirements of the law one of which is that the absolute minimum force should be used in all situations in northern ireland however dangerous <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i can confirm that <e>", "<cs> my lords in my original answer i stated in response to the noble baroness and to the house that we are continuously reviewing all methods available to us and the moment new methods appear whether at home or abroad we take very great care to research into their applicability in the province <e> <s> however the fact remains that the security forces often engaged in very dangerous tasks can be the subject of sudden attack by small groups of people or even small groups of children and it is better that at the end of the day they should have at their disposal this weapon rather than real bullets <e>", "<cs> my lords it is undeniable that plastic baton rounds have caused some deaths in the province over the last seven years and we would not in any way seek to conceal that fact which i very much regret <e> <s> however as my previous answer showed all the indications are that on those occasions regrettably the security forces had to protect themselves and their tasks there would be far greater loss of life if the alternatives to baton rounds had been used <e>", "<cs> my lords i rather share the noble lords appreciation of the virtues of water cannon <e> <s> it is an admirable instrument when a riot is getting out of hand if i may put it that way but where there are very small groups of people in highly charged situations where they can manoeuvre or be manoeuvred by others behind them water cannon is a much less flexible and effective weapon <e> <s> it takes a certain amount of time to get it into position and i am afraid that i have to say that most of the circumstances where water cannon might reasonably be used are not the same as those in which plastic baton rounds are used <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords invective is quite sufficient weapon directed at a number of members of your lordships house in successive governments <e> <s> of course we very much regret the use of any weapon against crowds of people or individuals <e> <s> the issue is whether this particular weapon which i abominate as i abominate all weapons has not in fact saved more lives since people must in the end be able to defend themselves and their tasks in what are very tense and difficult situations <e> <s> i should like to add that i appeal to the people of northern ireland and since the activities of very young people are on our minds at the moment in particular to parents there to try to control their children who often join demonstrations as a matter of excitement but who end up in very lethal positions indeed and of course put themselves as well as the security forces at very great risk <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful for the very constructive way in which the noble lord lord blease has received the order <e> <s> on the staff side concerns i should like to reassure him that while common personnel and financial services will be used by the whole new department where previously there were two departments and that while this will allow savings of at least posts there are not enforced redundancies <e> <s> throughout the whole exercise there have in fact been discussions with the staff representatives about the implications of the changes and their attitude has been extremely constructive as has the attitude and action of all the staff concerned in the exercise <e>", "<cs> there is one further point i should like to add <e> <s> there is of course precedent for what the government propose <e> <s> in the pneumoconiosis etc <e> <s> workers compensation act the government of the noble lord provided for the appointment of a single person rather than a tribunal to consider awards of compensation <e> <s> that was in the issue of efficiency <e> <s> one was simply trying to determine whether somebody suffered from the disease and how he had contracted it <e> <s> that would not seem to be a case for a tribunal <e> <s> in their employment protection act the previous government amended the conservative governments employment agencies act <e>", "<cs> as i understand them the amendments of the noble lord lord mccarthy would require the secretary of state to refer any applications to an appointed person in place of the provisions of the bill which merely enable him to do so if he thinks fit <e> <s> surely it would be inappropriate and wasteful to be required to refer all cases to the appointed person because commonsense suggests that inevitably there will be cases where the applicant is quite clearly ineligible for compensation <e> <s> he might for example have ruled himself out <e> <s> this point arose at committee stage in another place <e> <s> i can do no better than repeat what my honourable friend the parliamentary under-secretary said then <e>", "<cs> again the noble lord lord kilmarnock is edging towards an interpretation of the role of assessor as a kind of independent quasi-judicial quango-like being <e> <s> he is not <e> <s> he is there to help the secretary of state <e> <s> the important figure in all this is the secretary of state <e> <s> that is of course a difference of view between us and the noble lord lord mccarthy <e> <s> the reason for this as i rehearsed at an earlier period of time is that we are not in territory here where we are trying to establish the rights of individuals or the wrongs of their case but to correct injustices created at a particular period of time for particular individuals which has now been corrected in terms of the broad judicial principle by the employment act <e>", "<cs> the noble lord will be well aware that we went over this ground in detail together in committee during the passage of the act <e> <s> without getting into an argument about the nature of the legislation and it is not open and shut it has been subject to considerable dispute over the years i think we would all acknowledge that the asquith government passed that legislation to deal with a set of circumstances which has changed <e> <s> the situation has changed over the years and lord mccarthy or even i myself might have little enough employment if there had not been development in industrial relations law during all this time <e>", "<cs> i do not see it that way and i answered the point when i said that i made no apology for the strong element of deterrence in this legislation <e>", "<cs> i understand and sympathise with the anxieties which my noble friend has expressed in relation to the kind of situation that the shipping industry might in his scenario get into even though i must say that i find it a rather hair-raising too exciting and slightly far fetched scenario <e> <s> but all things can happen and one must try to take steps to protect industries as well as people from unfair practices <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i should like to answer just one of the points put to me by the noble lord lord mccarthy while it is fresh in the mind of the committee because it may reassure my noble friend lord mottistone and i rather suspect the noble lord lord mccarthy of trying to come between me and my noble friend <e> <s> the noble lord lord mccarthy asked what i was prepared to do to help british shipping to get their ballot and the answer is that the government are proposing to put down an amendment which will in fact ease their situation in this respect <e> <s> we are seized of the point that the noble lord lord mccarthy has made and that my noble friend has made <e> <s> my noble friend lord ferrers will be moving amendments on this to make it clear that ballots can be held over more than one day <e> <s> that will help the communications problems of the shipping industry in order to get the full and appropriate turnout <e> <s> i really think that will meet most of the anxieties of the shipping case <e> <s> no industrial tribunal worth its salt it seems to me would sustain fraud of that kind for a minute <e>", "<cs> not for the first time in debates of this kind the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby has come to my rescue very effectively <e> <s> i think it was two years ago that i had a splendid speech as i thought on secondary picketing which i did not deliver because he had just given a much better one from the opposite side of the house think that the noble lord lord houghton has really answered the anxieties of my noble friend <e> <s> perhaps he will take that answer in conjunction with the rather specialised amendments which we are proposing at a later stage to try to deal with the special difficulty that he has outlined and which particularly but not uniquely affects the shipping industry <e>", "<cs> this amendment my noble friend will correct me if i am misinterpreting him at all or in any way seems to derive from the conviction that employees in a closed shop should have the right to form or join a union of their choice <e>", "<cs> i stand corrected <e> <s> my noble friend was making the point that it was the view of the convention and therefore it should be enshrined in the bill <e> <s> the government as signatories to the convention have sympathy with the principles being raised but i think it would be difficult to enshrine them in legislation and i am also not altogether convinced that that would meet some of the points in the convention in a practical way as i shall argue in a few moments <e> <s> the effect in our legislation would be that no closed shop agreement could continue to have legal force at all unless the employees covered by it had a right to join any union whatsoever <e> <s> again the realities on the shop floor or in industry would be that all closed-shop agreements would be driven underground there is no question that they would cease to exist and the government do not believe that that would be desirable indeed we should be back in some of the difficulties of the act which my noble friend very fairly pointed out at the beginning of his speech <e>", "<cs> i am amazed to hear this rather denning-like sentence <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i followed him most carefully and he has led us through the judgment of the court in order to show his reasons for rejecting the amendment in the name of my noble friend <e> <s> but the ringing way in which he reads out this judgment of the court suggests to me that he must implicitly accept it and he must therefore by inference accept that the legislation with which he was very closely associated in and was a monstrous violation of the kind of freedoms which my noble friend has spent such a time trying to uphold <e>", "<cs> as we would expect of him the noble lord lord spens gave a ringing denunciation of the whole principle of the closed shop and <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for trying to draw me out on this because it gives me a chance not only to answer him but to clarify some points made by my noble and gallant friend <e> <s> i do not think this is a question of poverty of conscience certainly i hope not or of disregard for freedom <e> <s> it is i think and i apply the word empirical an attempt to recognise that the best reforms proceed from some clarity of perspective on the situation as it is and some clarity of perspective of what the <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord lord howie of troon will correct me if i am wrong in understanding that we are speaking to amendment no <e> <s> and to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> i beg the noble lords pardon <e> <s> so i should speak to this amendment and to amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> we are dealing here with what is commonly referred to as a trigger ballot that is one which does not require ballots to be held unless they are requested by a percentage of the employees concerned <e>", "<cs> it would certainly help me <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord howie of troon for gathering the group of amendments together in such a way that it is now clearer to me <e> <s> i have to confess i am sure this is my fault rather than the noble lords that i am still not altogether clear how this group of amendments is intended to operate <e> <s> presumably the effect is that existing closed shops that is those introduced before th august should be subject to a ballot only if this is requested by per cent <e> <s> of the employees covered that is the trigger ballot formula that a closed shop ballot could not be triggered more frequently than once every five years and that in such a ballot for a closed shop to be approved it would need to gain the support of per cent <e> <s> of those voting with a <e>", "<cs> it may be that the weakening is perhaps just my suspicious nature <e> <s> the noble lord and i appear to be rather like two blind men approaching each other in the dark but with a great deal of good will and i think dawning enlightenment as to who exactly we are <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend the duke of norfolk has i think unveiled without any notice to me unfortunately a masterly plan for all irish questions which is perhaps to have the province governed by catholic lord sopers <e> <s> the protestant non-conformist and catholic traditions would as it were meet in the person of the noble lord lord soper were he so constituted and i am sure that that would be extremely well received <e> <s> but i am grateful to my noble friend for reasserting very authoritatively the fact that nothing in the legislation or in the white paper poses any threat whatever to the continued position of northern ireland within the united kingdom <e> <s> the position of the government about that has always been made clear the constitutional future of northern ireland can only be decided and determined by the people of northern ireland themselves <e> <s> that has always been the position and it remains the position <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly tried to deal with that question in my opening remarks in response to what was raised by the noble duke the duke of norfolk <e> <s> if my noble friend returns to <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the draft northern ireland act interim period extension order which was laid before this house on th june be approved <e> <s> an hour or so previously in moving the second reading of the previous bill in the previous debate i reminded your lordships of the need for continued direct rule and indeed extolled the virtues and the necessity of direct rule <e> <s> i have a <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the way in which the order has been received and i will try to answer some of the specific points put to me <e> <s> the noble lord lord hylton made representations about descheduling some of the minor terrorist offences possession of firearms <e>", "<cs> i have asked for information to be given to me on the question raised by the noble baroness <e> <s> it may be too much for our pocket calculators this afternoon but we shall try and get her a <e>", "<cs> not a conservative <e>", "<cs> i did not want to detain or indeed bore the committee by rehearsing the arguments i made in trying to answer the noble lord lord mccarthy on amendment no <e> <s> because these are very substantially the same arguments <e> <s> the noble lord lord wedderburn of charlton said that he wanted to test the government on this same issue of why there <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord for allowing me to intervene <e> <s> the point i was making is that dismissal under racial or sexual grounds is already covered by unfair dismissal procedures <e> <s> the point we are making is why should the new maximum level of deterrent only apply in the case of closed shop unfair dismissals <e> <s> it was the special cases which the noble lord lord harris has just outlined the need for the government to make a response to a deliberate act of defiance in the case of employees whose rights had been sought to be protected by the act and the special difficulties of re-employment should ones membershop card be withdrawn <e> <s> those were the reasons i was giving for this differential in the levels of compensation <e> <s> it does not mean that unfair dismissal oil grounds of sex or race does not still obtain and should there be evidence of employers defying legislation in respect of race or sex i would of course be wholly prepared to look at this issue but i have no such evidence and i am responding to a particular set of circumstances in the industrial economy <e>", "<cs> i should like to take up that last argument because the noble lord is a very experienced and persuasive advocate and i know that he would not wish to mislead the committee <e> <s> i think that <e>", "<cs> i did not say that i said evidence of unfair dismissals <e> <s> i very much regret that some discrimination still exists and i hope that it is rapidly disappearing <e> <s> however my point was about unfair dismissals <e>", "<cs> the committee may find it helpful if i first explain why the government have introduced the special award in the form that they have <e> <s> currently in a case where an employee who has been unfairly dismissed asks a tribunal to order his reinstatement or re-engagement but the tribunal declines to do so his compensation for unfair dismissal will consist only of a basic award and a compensatory award <e> <s> in practice that usually amounts in total to a relatively low sum <e> <s> in it was in terms of a median of under <e> <s> the compensation in such a case is exactly the same as the employee would have obtained had he not sought reinstatement or re-engatement <e>", "<cs> notwithstanding the succinct and modest way in which the amendment was moved by the noble lord lord aylestone i find it a very extraordinary one <e> <s> those of us interested in political life at the moment are of course all sdp-watchers to some extent <e> <s> we are trying to tease out policy from the noble lords on the sdp benches <e> <s> the amendment moved by the noble lord and the way in which he moved it seemed to me to be wholly at variance with the quite trenchant support given to the government on a previous amendment by the noble lord lord harris of greenwich <e>", "<cs> while it is fresh in the committees mind i wonder whether i could answer the points made by the noble lord lord oram <e> <s> i have already tried to show that it is simply not really necessary for employers to dismiss people unfairly <e> <s> if employers can show that pressure has been put on them disruption of their business its continued decline or whatever to dismiss a man the tribunal would of course take that into account and that might not be considered to be unfair dismissal <e> <s> or there are the joinder provisions to join the union and for pressurising the employer <e> <s> we are talking a little as if these large sums of money could gratuitously be imposed on small businesses which could ill-afford them <e> <s> all the small businesses have to do is to avoid unfair dismissal of the people concerned <e>", "<cs> may i answer the points of the noble lord lord rochester <e> <s> as he knows from many occasions i always like to carry him along with me <e> <s> certainly again and i do not want to repeat the little tease that i made about the social democrats what he said seemed to be somewhat at variance with some of the positions taken by the i iberal party in another place on closed shop issues <e> <s> the very fact that these levels of special awards compensations are <e>", "<cs> i tried to deal with the point of why we sought a differential compensation at an earlier stage of the debate <e> <s> i shall of course bring to the attention of my right honourable friend the fact that it is the view of the noble baroness that levels of compensation for ordinary cases of unfair dismissal are insufficiently indexed <e> <s> the noble baroness is well aware of the governments position on that that the way to get them fairer is to reduce the inflation that is going on <e> <s> this is what we are trying to achieve <e> <s> i shall bring that point to his attention <e> <s> with respect it is a slightly different point <e> <s> various people in the committee have been as it were appealing to me to think again hoping that they will not have to divide and hoping that in some way the government may be able to meet them or that an amendment of this kind will have better treatment from the government at report stage <e>", "<cs> i should be most grateful to the noble lord if i may intervene to say that we are straying rather far from the amendment which is incidentally not mainly about trade unions but about employers <e>", "<cs> i stand corrected <e> <s> we are straying rather far from the clause <e> <s> nevertheless in spite of my mistake for which i apologise to the noble lord and the committee we are straying very far from clause which is not about trade unionism generally but about unfair dismissal by employers <e>", "<cs> we have had a pretty stimulating debate <e> <s> i do not know at what point the debate on a somewhat technical issue in this clause not an entirely <e>", "<cs> i confess that i am in some difficulty because the noble lord has defeated me <e> <s> i simply do not quite know what the snark or boojum

own clause and amendment are about <e> <s> it is lord wedderburns objection to it that they do not understand <e>", "<cs> that is now clearer to me <e> <s> the noble lord did not i think make it quite clear to the committee that his argument in objection was to clause as a whole and not to this particular amendment of the government <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord wedderburn was kind enough to remind the committee that my noble and learned friend the lord advocate has had to be away with good reason <e> <s> i am here to take his place on this amendment <e> <s> i must say that i am not fully happy at this substitution at this stage but i will do my best <e> <s> this is the first amendment to clause and therefore it may be helpful briefly to remind the committee what the clause is about <e>", "<cs> not amazed <e>", "<cs> the only thing which rather amazed me about most of the speech of the noble lord lord wedderburn is that it seemed to be about clause and who can sue under clause <e> <s> under clause a person can sue if he is adversely affected by the unlawful practices set out there but under clause which we are supposed presently to be debating a person can sue in tort if he is a party to a <e>", "<cs> i am glad that the noble lord and i are on side about that <e> <s> if i could deal with the point he made i accept wholly that it is a serious point in his interesting story about the fish and chips there may be those who can show that they have been adversely affected by practices outlawed by clause and if so they too may have a course of action under subsection <e>", "<cs> i am extremely grateful for the intervention of the noble lord lord molloy because he has brought us back to earth <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that i meant that there would not be difficulties or i would have thought few difficulties for people once this bill became an act to decide on their liability or on whether or not they could sue <e> <s> the territory we are in in the arena of clause and clause of the bill is pretty simple <e> <s> it does not involve a great deal of learned expertise or difficulty <e> <s> clause is designed to deal with what are generally known as union labour only requirements <e> <s> we have debated the reasons why the government find this long standing practice in some industries distasteful particularly in view of the increasing use by public authorities <e> <s> we can argue the merits or demerits in political <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble lord lord marsh and the noble lord lord harris of high cross who appear not to be present would wish to move their amendments although quite what to do about it i do not know <e> <s> but now i see the noble lord lord harris of high cross approaching <e>", "<cs> i for one am glad that the noble lord lord marsh got to the church on time because the government have considerable sympathy with the plight of employers whose business is disrupted by industrial action <e> <s> it therefore must follow that the government are sympathetic to these amendments which are concerned with the situation where an employer cannot provide work for his employees as a result of industrial action <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> for instance deals with the situation of selective industrial action in the employers own organisation amendment no <e> <s> is concerned with extraneous industrial action which disrupts the supply or delivery of goods or services and that can of course be as damaging to a business as the industrial action in the employers own organisation <e> <s> both amendments therefore seek to give employers a statutory right to <e>", "<cs> the noble lords amendment seeks to change paragraph <e>", "<cs> i do not think that the world outside as well as inside this chamber and i am grateful to the noble lord lord howie for his kind remarks is indifferent to common sense or common interpretation <e> <s> i believe that behaved in a manner is a wide-ish formulation which would cover most situations and i do not think the noble lord need have any fears that he would be implicated in a piece of behaviour which was quite clearly and evidently designed to take steps which he was not authorising <e> <s> i think that he has nothing whatsoever to fear <e>", "<cs> is it not the case that if the noble lord lord howie of troon were too frolicsome or irresponsible the union would be able to remove him <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for his request and i welcome the tone in which he made it <e> <s> again i do not think that it is at all offensive of him in any way whatever to ask for a reply tonight and i will try to give it <e> <s> the plain reality of the matter is and again i try to refer the <e>", "<cs> i think this has been almost an hours debate and perhaps it might be for the convenience of the committee if i now very rapidly gave the governments view <e> <s> i think this is what could be called a yes but amendment <e> <s> i wholly agree with the noble lady lady saltoun that if you asked ordinary sensible people whether there should be ballots held in secret about the holding of major strikes the overwhelming majority perhaps over per cent <e> <s> would say yes <e> <s> it is a certain and true instinct of people that this kind of opinion should be taken and should be taken away from harassment and in secret <e> <s> the buts are when you try to start to work it on the ground and they are rather more than a question of the wording of the amendment <e> <s> a substantial but a substantial objection in the particular amendment rather than in the general sentiment which i am trying to express is that the secretary of state the government here would be asked to intervene in a major dispute <e>", "<cs> i think that we should re-address our minds to clause and not to the european social charter <e> <s> the clause makes four main changes to the definition of what constitutes a lawful trade dispute <e> <s> the first is the most important and i shall concentrate on it <e> <s> it is to restrict lawful trade disputes to disputes between workers and their own employer <e> <s> the obvious and main purpose of this is to protect employers and employees from pressure from trade <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the correction <e> <s> the first thing i have to say about this amendment is that it would by a circuitous route completely nullify the effects of restricting trade disputes to disputes between workers and their own employer <e> <s> as such it comes in a nice try category <e> <s> it would do that by attaching to the definition of a trade dispute in section of the act the much wider definition of a trade dispute which occurs in section of the social security act and that of course is unacceptable to us <e> <s> for that reason alone i would hope that the amendment would be rejected were it pressed to a division <e>", "<cs> the purpose of subsection <e>", "<cs> we have had a good run on this clause and in answering just one or two points i shall be very brief <e> <s> i should like to thank the noble lord lord wedderburn for moving the previous amendments <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the noble lord will pass that on to the noble lord lord george-brown <e> <s> the thing that really puzzles me though after minutes of debate is the way in which members of the committee such as the noble lord lord underhill and the noble lord lord hatch persist in treating workers or members of trade unions as if they were bears of very little brain <e> <s> it is astonishing to find such patronising attitudes coming from the labour party towards what are supposedly their traditional supporters <e> <s> the idea that there are no methods of showing international solidarity or registering disapproval of actions by overseas employers or governments other than taking action winch affects jobs and prosperity here at home seems to me to be quite extraordinary <e>", "<cs> i should have to take advice on that but as i understand it they would not be covered by the immunity so long as they are unaffected by the outcome of the dispute <e>", "<cs> i have listened with great interest to the views of my two noble friends and the views of the noble lord lord monson as to whether the assembly should be able to assume functions which are performed by local government in great britain <e> <s> however i must remind the committee that this is of course rather a separate issue from the question of whether more powers should be granted to the existing local councils in northern ireland and we must make that distinction clear in our minds <e>", "<cs> going in reverse order perhaps i may take first the points made by the noble lord lord monson <e> <s> the central problem in northern ireland as he is aware is how given the composition of the populations in northern ireland and the reflection of that composition in political terms do you get the necessary cross-community support for any proposals <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that there is a greater chance of getting cross-community support within a structure of devolved government than there is outside it <e> <s> i do not like having to say to the committee that noble lords must take my word for anything but most people who know northern ireland would acknowledge that that is the case <e>", "<cs> it may well be that other noble lords wish to come in on this issue of a referendum and therefore i shall not make any references to that before your lordships have said whatever you wish to say <e> <s> i would intervene at this point only to try to clear up what i believe is a deep and critical misapprehension in the mind of the noble lord lord harris of high cross <e> <s> i think the noble lord is of the view that the government are putting forward as it were a novel and ingenious constitutional solution or proposal to try to solve political problems in northern ireland <e> <s> it is not quite like that <e> <s> as i said on second reading and the noble lord who has again with respect to him made a second reading point must therefore forgive me if i repeat my second reading point all policy in respect of northern ireland must ground itself in the realities of northern ireland its history and demography <e> <s> that means considerable humility and modest expectation for policy <e> <s> we are not here unveiling the mark iv or mark v model for a solution to the northern ireland issue we are offering the people of northern ireand themselves the opportunity of devising political structures to cope with the demands and the realities of their situation and to cope this is equally important with the demands and the realities of the sovereign parliament at westminster <e>", "<cs> i have to confess to being a little puzzled by the point at issue here though i know it is strongly felt <e> <s> it was certainly the subject of much discussion in another place <e> <s> leaving aside the practical issues and anxieties connected with holding a referendum on this kind of issue in northern ireland and my noble friend lord moyola with all the weight of a previous distinguished prime minister of northern ireland has itemised those and leaving aside any philosophic objections or anxieties about referenda in general which the noble baroness has just outlined i still do not quite see why we should need a referendum on this issue <e>", "<cs> yes but where the noble lord and i have to agree to differ is over whether there is any correspondence between the situation facing scotland and wales and the situation facing northern ireland <e> <s> that is an irrevocable difference between us <e> <s> at the simplest level a very large percentage of the people of scotland and wales do not vote for politicians who do not acknowledge the sovereignty of the united kingdom <e> <s> that is the particular pickle that we are in in northern ireland <e>", "<cs> as i have suggested in previous debates on amendments the essence of the proposals being put forward by the government is that there can be no question of any devolution order being made unless and until parliament has satisfied itself that the provisions of that order would be likely to command widespread acceptance throughout the community <e> <s> that is quite simply the ultimate test for any devolution proposals <e> <s> to remove this provision now as the noble lord lord monson seeks to do in his amendment would therefore remove a very important safeguard not only for the whole principle upon which the bill rests but in particular for the minority community <e> <s> in theory it would allow for the possibility of a devolution order being made even though its provisions did not command cross-community support <e> <s> i cannot stress too strongly that the per cent <e> <s> is only a trigger mechanism which ensures that a proposal is debated at westminster <e> <s> the secretary of state is obliged to lay before parliament an order or a proposal for an order which commands per cent <e> <s> support <e> <s> it means that the order must be debated by parliament <e> <s> it has no greater signifiance than that <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord monson used a metaphor about these flowery lines <e> <s> in fact these lines far from being flowery really outline the nettle which it is necessary for the people of northern ireland to grasp if they are to devolve the power <e>", "<cs> unless other noble lords wish to speak perhaps while it is fresh in my mind i may answer the point made to me by the noble lord lord blease <e> <s> i hope he will forgive me if i do not get it entirely right because we are of course dealing with the future and i do not have as it were an exact model in my mind to which i can refer <e> <s> obviously it is in the interests of the government to provide the funds for the committee system and the assembly to work effectively <e> <s> while the committees have no formal powers to summon ministers or officials or to have access as of right to departmental papers and there are obvious reasons for this constitutionally ministers are accountable to your lordships house or to another place and they really cannot be accountable to anyone else though there are no such formal powers we have made it very clear that ministers will want to be as helpful as possible to the committees in every respect and that would presumably involve their having the information necessary to do their job <e> <s> we in our turn will be looking to the committees and to their officers for guidance and it would be a waste of time and the guidance would be imperfect if the raw material for debate and scrutiny were not made available <e> <s> i can assure the noble lord that our hearts are pure in intention and if as things grow up there are shown to be blockages in the system we would seek to try to put things right <e> <s> the assembly committees are of course serviced by the assembly itself and obviously it would be open to the assembly to seek outside or specialist advice within its overall budget and its cash limit <e>", "<cs> i will look at it <e> <s> my instinct is to say yes but i will make quite sure and write to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> obviously members of what is an assembly within a region of the united kingdom are circumscribed in the amount of foreign policy they can conduct <e> <s> that is not a transferred matter <e> <s> but the noble baroness as did my noble friend lord brooke-borough puts her finger on an interesting point which is the practical day to day negotiations within the eec of a devolved ministry <e> <s> as i shall be explaining to your lordships on i think thursday when we have the appropriations debate we are in <e>", "<cs> clause which the government of course hope will never have to be put into effect provides for the dissolution of the assembly and for the revocation of any devolution orders which may be made <e> <s> clause which the amendment moved by the noble lord lord monson seeks to alter deals with the revocation of devolution orders themselves <e> <s> it may be of assistance to the committee if i briefly say what it does <e> <s> if it appears to her majesty after taking into account any relevant proceedings in the assembly that the continued operation of a devolution order does not command widespread acceptance throughout the community then such an order can be revoked <e> <s> this provides a safeguard in the event that the initial agreement or series of agreements leading to devolution is not sustained and in the event that the package loses the necessary support of the assembly <e> <s> the committee will notice that the provision also embodies the essential principle of widespread acceptability to which i spoke at an earlier stage this afternoon and which must <e>", "<cs> may i deal with the point put a few moments ago by my noble friend lord brooke-borough <e> <s> he will know that i tried to answer him at an earlier stage at second reading on this issue namely that the government did not show enough enthusiasm for the continued unity of the kingdom in this context and he was critical for that reason <e> <s> it is not that the government are not enthusiastic <e> <s> as individuals or as members of a particular political party we can of course express our enthusiasm as vigorously as my noblefriend expresses it <e> <s> but there is an inconsistency surely in resting your policy as successive british governments have done on the principle of self-determination in this issue and then as it were trying to load the question in such a way that goes against the principles of self-determination <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that i understood the purport of the second question but i understood the first very well and i did try to answer it <e> <s> the essential point is that the provision in the act is as it were a negative one <e> <s> the act says that you cannot have any change without a majority in a border poll <e> <s> i think as i said earlier that my noble friend lord vaizey put his finger on it <e> <s> the situation in northern ireland were you in per cent <e> <s> territory with all the uncertainties that that might involve would be so changed it seems to me that parliament would be looking at totally different circumstances from any circumstances that now foreseeably obtain <e> <s> i also tried to give a personal judgment of how unlikely i thought that would be <e> <s> but i cannot really be drawn as no minister can be drawn on notional situations <e>", "<cs> i hate to satisfy <e>", "<cs> or rather not to satisfy my noble friend or any other member of the committee <e> <s> i felt a little guilty that perhaps at the end of a rather exhausting second reading speech i had not answered him as fully as i might have done <e> <s> i believe that when he reads <e>", "<cs> i can certainly assure the noble baroness and the whole committee that i have great sympathy with the arguments put forward by the noble lord lord hylton and with the very moderate way in which he moved this amendment which seeks to widen the numbers of those who are eligible for membership of the assembly <e>", "<cs> the short answer is that the boundary commissioners have not fully reported to us <e> <s> as i said in my second reading speech we feel that the need for political movement in northern ireland is very pressing in respect of security issues and the economy and there is a wide expectation as i also said that this election will and should take place <e> <s> therefore it seemed to us better to get on with it particularly as the point with which the noble lord is concerned is essentially involved with the westminster parliament and legislature and the in my view justifiable increase in the number of seats for northern ireland rather than with the more limited role of this assembly <e>", "<cs> any parliamentarian even a non-elected one who pronounced on the ways of the boundary commissioners would get himself into hot water very quickly <e> <s> so i must resist the noble lord lord monson trying to draw me on that <e> <s> i understand that they are not very far off completion but i know no more than that <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord knows from my remarks the system is designed to be as flexible as possible <e> <s> obviously the government will wish to take the views of the assembly into account in coming to a view about that <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a third time <e> <s> in doing so i wish first to express the gratitude of her majestys government to your lordships house in facilitating the passage of the bill on to the statute book before the summer recess <e>", "<cs> my lords it gives me pleasure to be able to end our proceedings on this bill by actually agreeing with my noble friend lord ellen-borough <e> <s> of course there will be no devolution unless the people of northern ireland and their representatives want it <e> <s> if they do want it then i would suggest to my noble friend that there would be little danger in giving it to them <e> <s> direct rule goes on because the people of northern ireland are a constituent part of the united kingdom <e> <s> until they determine otherwise or the united kingdom parliament accepts their ruling in determining otherwise i see no reason why they should not have an input of a serious constitutional kind into the affairs of the united kingdom as a whole <e> <s> that seems to me to answer the problems of the west lothian question <e>", "<cs> my lords the debate we have had is perhaps a fair indicator of why my right honourable friend and i may not be as offside as many people have accused us of being in suggesting that more debate and more scrutiny be devolved to northern ireland <e> <s> i am grateful for the genuinely helpful tone that noble lords have taken even when they have been critical <e> <s> my opening speech which inevitably ran for nigh on half an hour it was effectively a budget speech for a very wide range of departments and issues necessarily had to truncate things a little <e> <s> so as not to detain the house too long i shall have to go at a fair lick in my winding-up speech <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord bishopston for his kind remarks and assure him that i am sure that my honourable friend the minister of agriculture there will welcome the noble lord back to any agricultural shows that are going in the province <e> <s> we hope to see him at them once more <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the industrial development northern ireland order a draft of which was laid before the house on th june be approved <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the draft northern ireland assembly day of election order which was laid before this house on th july be approved <e> <s> the draft order which if approved will be made under section of the northern ireland constitution act appoints wednesday th october as the date on which the election to a new northern ireland assembly will be held <e> <s> the assembly was dissolved with effect from th march under section of the northern ireland act <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely gratified by the response of the two noble lords and the noble baroness who have spoken and i should like to offer my thanks to them <e> <s> i should like to answer in reverse order the two points that have been made to me <e> <s> obviously i am very much seized of the problem which the noble baroness has outlined <e> <s> but it is difficult to alter primary legislation in respect of individual cases and for individual activities whether successful or unsuccessful that are still somewhat hypothetical <e> <s> i do not think that quite enough people appreciate that the parliamentary machinery is very cumbersome and parliamentary timetables are inevitably very crowded <e> <s> however i shall consider the point <e> <s> i would perhaps prefer to direct the noble baronesss attention to the very wise words uttered by her noble friend lord blease from the labour benches expressing the hope that those who stand for the assembly or who freely chose to stand will exercise choice in the interests of all the people of northern ireland <e> <s> that would seem to me to be where perhaps i should leave the point for the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords some frustration occurs in debates not when people disagree but when they are in very substantial agreement and both parties cannot understand why given the overall level of agreement the other party cannot see the point of view being expressed <e> <s> this was put very clearly by the noble lord lord pitt of hampstead when admittedly in a different context he said that the provision was not on all fours with the sentiments expressed deploring sexual and racial discrimination <e>", "<cs> my lords if you are an employer and you unfairly dismiss on grounds of sex or race you can be sued for unfair dismissal <e> <s> the higher level of compensation in the cases of unfair dismissal where a closed shop situation is involved is distinguished precisely for the reason given by my noble friend lord campbell that a person may be precluded from getting another job because of his refusal to become a member of the union <e> <s> that is the reason for the distinction <e> <s> i go back to the point made by the noble lord lord pitt <e> <s> he says very fairly that it is equally grave to lose your job if you are black or a woman or whatever and of course it is equally grave but in terms of future hiring you are covered by anti-discrimination legislation which does not cover you in the case of union membership or non-membership <e> <s> so the distinction is quite clear <e>", "<cs> my lords it may help your lordships in considering my noble friends amendment if i very briefly recap on the compensation which the bill will introduce for cases of unfair dismissal because of non-membership of a union or for union membership or activities <e> <s> first there will be a basic award which as now will reflect the employees age salary and length of service but will be subject in the cases we are considering to a minimum of under clause <e> <s> the maximum of this award is currently <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not i am afraid think that i have much to add over what i have said <e> <s> the general principles under which the government have been guided throughout not only the present bill but the act have been to make <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment would mean that instead of a special award being payable virtually automatically i must say that auto-maticity sounds like something dreamed up by saatchi saatchi for the electricity board to employees who are unfairly dismissed for non-membership of a union the special award would be payable only at the discretion of the tribunal where they thought it should be paid having regard to equity and the substantial merits of each case <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree with the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge that it would be irresponsible for the government to raise expectations at this juncture which might in the event not be fulfilled <e> <s> therefore i can say to the noble lord lord banks and to the house that the process of the running down and liquidation of the company the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge also asked me about this will continue <e> <s> however should any realistic possibilities open up of new investors coming along then of course the government would consider every proposal on its merits <e> <s> i also agree with the noble lord lord ponsonby of shulbrede about how badly jobs are needed in belfast generally and perhaps in west belfast particularly <e> <s> i would like to pay the governments tribute to the very great achievement of the people of this part of a beleaguered city in moving very rapidly from having no tradition of motor manufacturing to a tradition of motor manufacturing whose failure was not much to do with them if i may put it that way <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the way in which the house has received this order <e> <s> i can say to the noble lord opposite that the planning appeals commission comprises members five of whom are full-time professional commissioners and five part-time lay commissioners <e> <s> all are appointed by the secretary of state and they are charged as an independent body with the hearing of planning appeals <e> <s> the position therefore is not identical to that in the rest of the united kingdom where the ultimate court of appeal so to speak is the secretary of state for the environment <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships house has a distinguished history in terms of social reform including in this field as i said in my opening speech <e> <s> the debate a rather longer more trenchant debate than i expected but animal welfare and sexual matters always command the attention of your lordships indicated that and i am glad that we were reminded at the end that the noble lord lord boothby had also played his part in the liberalisation of the law <e>", "<cs> my lords while the point is fresh in the mind of the public and of your lordships perhaps i could say exactly what it means <e> <s> the prime minister was quite firmly saying to local authorities that a certain proportion of their budget had been allocated to them in forward planning for capital projects <e> <s> there was no excuse for them not to take up this money in terms of capital projects rather than in terms of maintaining different kinds of services with that particular part of the budget or of keeping up high levels of pay <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very sorry the noble lord has been most tolerant but i must come back on that <e> <s> i think the point there is that it is no use local authorities complaining that they do not have a sufficient allocation for capital expenditure when they refuse to realise the assets that they have <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down it might be for the convenience of the house if i made a short point <e> <s> it is in no way a criticism of the noble lord who is admirably succinct but the house might be interested to know that we are not yet in numbers terms halfway through this debate <e> <s> i would therefore concentrate your lordships minds on the advice given by my noble friend the chief whip a little earlier to see whether we could exercise stringent verbal cuts if not public expenditure cuts on our speeches from now until the end <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall contradict the noble lord <e> <s> there is no question of pensioners being cheated or fiddled <e> <s> this government have done a great deal more for pensioners than the government which the noble lord supported by maintaining all their allowances in real terms <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly should not have interrupted from a sitting position but my emotions overtook me <e> <s> having to remove a roof in order to avoid rates is hardly the fault of the government it is the fault of the local authority <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble leader lady young for allowing me a half holiday so to say from the endless fascination and frustration of irish politics and a return to my first interest in economic affairs <e> <s> those of us who work on the danube are always grateful for a day or two in rome if that is not a tactless phrase to use in connection with northern ireland <e> <s> i am also grateful because in spite of its length this has been an extremely absorbing debate and i have learned a lot from it <e> <s> it has been i believe the longest debate on the queens speech for more than years <e> <s> i will do my best but i am not sure if like the dodo i shall be able to hand everyone prizes if only the dubious prize of a mention <e>", "<cs> my lords i may have misinterpreted the noble lord but he seemed to be going pretty far in that direction to me and my noble friend the secretaty of state for trade was muttering this in my ear at the time <e>", "<cs> my lords in that case i am very happy to withdraw my allegations and agree absolutely with the noble lord <e> <s> i think that we should do that <e> <s> i was interested that my noble friend lord caldecote in a remarkable speech agreed with the noble lord lord byers that some upturn in demand would not be inflationary now in view of the relative success that the government have had in bringing down the overall rates <e>", "<cs> my lords i promised to try to exercise a self-denying ordinance and in spite of the temptations put in my way by the noble lords lord kaldor and lord balogh and now most recently by the noble lord lord allen to resist engaging in a debate on macro-economic policy <e> <s> we debated economic affairs on the queens speech and i had the privilege to wind-up last weeks before your lordships <e> <s> in the spirit of this report we now look more closely at the effects of policies and the effects of economic phenomena generally on individuals and their lives and discuss how we can try to improve things <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend can answer for himself but i do not think that he asked for such a commitment from me <e> <s> he is far too experienced and knows the impossibility of delivering it and the terrible things one could do to peoples rational expectations if one were so foolish as to do so <e> <s> it would be quite extraordinary to ask the government as the noble lord lord oram wished to ask their chancellor to decide how many jobs might exist in any given field <e> <s> how would the chancellor decide for instance the number of jobs that should exist in motor-car importation and distribution <e> <s> it would be a totally impractical task <e>", "<cs> my lords the export credits guarantee department system exists exactly to do that to protect and help exporters but obviously it is a finite system since it is costly <e> <s> the government cannot finance exporters activities indiscriminately particularly in a world which as the noble lord himself was fair enough to admit has great financial problems so far as the developing world is concerned <e> <s> the noble lord himself asked how the developing world gets the money to pay for our goods <e> <s> the international banking and financial difficulties cannot be compounded <e> <s> we dealt with some of those points in our debate last week so i cannot go into them now <e>", "<cs> my lords this is not the case because the unemployment benefit offices act as the agents for the department of health and social security in respect of supplementary benefit <e> <s> therefore the effects that the noble lord has been anxious about do not obtain <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot answer the noble lords last question off the cuff but my suspicion based on my recollection of my time as an employment minister is that the addition would be within the saving but i will check and find out and notify the noble lord <e> <s> we have indeed attended to the select committees report but in this instance the rayner scrutiny was designed to cut out wasteful procedures and save money and make life more efficient <e> <s> it also seemed to us wrong that claimants should be compelled to visit job centres which in many parts of the country was often a wasteful proceeding and therefore the point that the noble lord is raising is not with great respect to him relevant to this particular procedure though of course procedures to try to improve the match of jobs to job seekers are very important in another context <e> <s> in that other context i am glad to say that vacancies in job centres are substantially up on last year and though of course the demand for jobs greatly and sadly exceeds supply the trend is broadly in a better direction <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not see that the noble baroness need have any difficulties in this respect <e> <s> as she knows the overwhelming number of those people who are unemployed wish for employment job centres are prominent in pretty well every town in the land and are perfectly available to people who want to go to them <e> <s> we simply are not convinced that they should be compelled to do so at great cost to the public purse and if i may say so with a certain amount of disrespect to them <e> <s> it seems to me foolish to compel people to go to a job centre when they are perfectly able to do so indeed the job centres are made considerable use of as the noble baroness knows <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has something of a reputation for making statements in this house which are both offensive and inaccurate my lords and i am afraid this is one of them <e>", "<cs> my lords to both the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones and the noble lord lord hampton may i say that the government are grateful for the spirit in which they have received this very sad statement <e> <s> the noble and learned lord pointed out that i come here from belfast <e> <s> i should like to confirm that and also to say that my right honourable friend the secretary of state has come direct from the scene of the crime <e> <s> i do of course take the point made by the noble and learned lord about the favourable treatment which must be given to those who are killed or maimed in the service of their country and countrymen <e>", "<cs> my lords the only distinction that can exist in our minds concerning the inla and the ira is that both organisations are illegal and that both are prepared to pursue political ends by violent means <e> <s> we have made it clear that the legitimacy of political aims and aspirations is unconditional in a democratic society <e> <s> but the means are conditioned by

northern ireland <e> <s> he has at the same time raised a number of specific points and other noble lords have taken up some of these and sometimes added to them which relate to various aspects of the governments policy in the province <e> <s> i will deal with these specific points in just one moment <e>", "<cs> my lords speaking for myself i prefer to await the report rather than a synopsis and i

was still a minister in the department with responsibilities for youth training and the rest i was very anxious that the schools should get in on the act and i am glad that they have done so <e>", "<cs> my lords no such anxiety or confusion has been brought to my attention but if the noble baroness cares to channel some of it my way i shall try to spread some balm <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that in france school-leavers may be a little younger than ours but i should need separate notice of that question <e>", "<cs> my lords i would have to have notice of the second question but the first i can easily answer <e> <s> the fact is that as the noble lord well knows energy prices are linked with the price of oil over which the government sadly have no control <e> <s> but it is incumbent on the industries to compensate for those costs in international oil prices by looking to their own internal costs <e> <s> that is what we have urged them to do and i am glad to say that in the main they have successfully done just that <e> <s> i do not consider that that campaign statement bears much relation to the national interest <e> <s> it is true to what i have always felt is the fascinating conservatism which informs the labour party on these matters the way it continues to cling to a belief in the theoretical benefits of nationalisation expressed by the late herbert morrison <e>", "<cs> they could do just what the noble lord suggests if they were in the private sector <e>", "<cs> my lords two points in my remarks in a section which i wrote myself if i may say so the needs of the consumer were taken up <e> <s> if the noble baroness refers to <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby with his very great experience not only of the working party but also of the

people who do not take part in the scheme would have to have rather strong reasons for not doing so <e> <s> it would seem to me unreasonable if the scheme were provided not to expect them to go on with it <e>", "<cs> my lords of the two noble speakers from the opposition who have spoken the comments of the noble baroness are obviously more welcome to me than the comments of the noble lord lord bruce so perhaps i may take them in reverse order <e> <s> i am very glad that the noble baroness welcomed the end-of-year flexibility which i agree is a thoroughly desirable innovation <e> <s> like

have taken it <e> <s> as to the political point made by the noble lord regrettably perhaps public spending does not follow a political cycle unless for venal electoral reasons you arrange that it should do so and we did not so arrange <e> <s> there was no increase in the rate of spending engendered in this current year by any election commitment <e> <s> we did as i say publish our public spending plans well before the election was called and we are remaining firmly within those published plans <e>", "<cs> my lords given the office which my noble friend has held and given the quiet revolution in public spending that he initiated when he resigned and which bore fruit i think some years later i am extremely grateful for what he has said <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the relatively warm welcome to that part of the statement from the noble lord on the benches opposite <e> <s> i think we would all agree that the end-of-year surge has been a damaging and expensive thing

statement reads as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am really astonished at what the noble lord lord hatch has said <e> <s> i have my speech on the humble address here and your lordships will be relieved to hear that i am not going to read it out for a second time <e> <s> but the whole burden of the speech and indeed of that by my senior colleague and noble friend lord cockfield was the great importance of not jeopardising recovery by adding to inflation or by easing up on counter-inflationary pressure <e> <s> our judgment is that there would be a severe chance of interest rates going up if this corrective action were not taken and it therefore seems wholly sensible to take it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful for what my noble friend has said <e> <s> i certainly agree with him that the people of this country are well aware that if government look after their budgets there will be more for them and also more for the businesses with which they are involved or which employ

say revenue is holding up well as the modest recovery and i stress that it is modest all over the world is taking place <e> <s> our problem was that our own expenditure was rising at an immodest rate

constantly said the great interest of the arts in this country is to have a more vigorous and a more successful economy <e> <s> higher inflation and higher interest rates hit small budgets like the arts budgets just as badly as they do everybody else <e>", "<cs> my lords on the noble lords first supplementary about the responsibility of the government he is certainly entitled to his views but a very substantial majority of his fellow-countrymen appear to disagree with him <e> <s> on the second point i refer him back to the original answer <e> <s> the idea that the government are short of advice in tackling this deep anxiety of high levels of unemployment at a time when whole industries are engaged in major change throughout the western world is absurd <e> <s> we are in touch with

grateful to him for his intervention <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree with my noble friend that if in the short term you seek to preserve jobs against competitive tendencies in a given industry

lowering wage claims in maintaining employment levels <e> <s> we are very aware of it indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords it is certainly the case that international co-operation in coming out of recession is

response of the noble lord lord rochester to that of the noble lord lord underhill <e> <s> of course the legislation was anticipated <e> <s> it was inherent in widespread consultation in the

practices my noble friend has shown himself to be so concerned <e> <s> we recognise that there are some unions which clearly <e>", "<cs> my lords i acknowledge with the noble lord that there are broader issues relating to the funds of political parties overall <e> <s> but the green paper our consultation document for this legislation was concerned with the relatively narrow surely very

divert money to buy more arms or indeed anything else the imf programme being negotiated with the argentines could be severely jeopardised <e> <s> let me just say to noble lords before i give way that the imf programme and any bank lendings contingent upon it do not give argentina any surplus funds to spend on arms <e> <s> indeed the programme puts very tight control on argentinas finances and if the argentines were to divert money to buy more arms this could jeopardise the programme and argentinas ability to negotiate further funding <e> <s> indeed i can tell the house that the international commercial banks have not yet signed the billion dollar loan which has been under negotiation for several months <e> <s> in earlier reports the th of this month was quoted as a possible signature date <e> <s> my present advice is that this has slipped and the loan is unlikely to be signed just yet <e> <s> it is therefore unlikely that any such loan would be effective unless and until argentina has satisfied the performance criteria of the fund programme <e> <s> so the funds the argentines receive will be contingent upon how they behave <e>", "<cs> my lords if there were circumstances of global conflict that would be a great deal easier <e> <s> but there are of course conditions of partial war and peace or of good relations or bad relations that exist between member countries <e> <s> if

is a particular type of body and as a financial body it is highly influential and can influence its creditors in ways which are thoroughly conducive to peace <e> <s> but if it took the frontal approach suggested by the noble lord and others it would immensely diminish its chances of being able to influence countries in their pocket books which is where in fact they are probably most easily and sensibly influenced for good <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend and i should like to say to her that expenditure on special employment and training measures will rise substantially in <e> <s> major initiatives include the youth training scheme which i mentioned and also the community programme which began last year and which will cost about million in <e>", "<cs> my lords the manpower services commission is of course a tripartite body <e> <s> therefore i am glad to be able to say that the great trades unions of the country are wholly behind it <e>", "<cs> my lords on the second part of the noble lords supplementary question because the manpower services commission works closely with the commissioners and because the commissioners have senior trade union representation the question of substitution of that kind is carefully monitored by the commission <e> <s> on the first part of the noble lords supplementary question as i have said very frequently in your lordships house we are passing through a new industrial revolution and this is about training for the future <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no question of a training scheme and this is precisely what the present scheme is being able to guarantee people employment at the end of it <e> <s> as the noble lord will be well aware that will depend on all sorts of factors both national and international <e> <s> but i am confident that the young people who pass through this scheme will be a great deal more employable than they otherwise would be <e>", "<cs> my lords i should be delighted to do so but i would need other notice of that <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree with the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend will give me details of any areas where there have been these difficulties i shall do my best to iron them out <e>", "<cs> my lords the latter figure would be much too gloomy an overall prediction about the state of the economy both at home and abroad <e> <s> but it is certainly the case that there is great awareness both on the part of the trainees and on the part of people generally that as the noble baroness said a training scheme of a foundation character will not of itself guarantee employment <e> <s> the aim of the game is to lessen the odds against young people and the odds are very considerable all over the western world at present <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i am certainly not aware of that figure <e> <s> it sounds very improbable to me <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that all the problems in this economy can be solved by public money but i do believe that it is the duty of the government and of the state to try to ease people through a very difficult transitional period both in their own lives and in that of the economy in which they are liable to be seeking work <e>", "<cs> my lords that seems to be a very ill-considered response from the noble lord lord beswick <e> <s> he is known to have supported a government which took the first steps in this direction <e> <s> we have sought to build on those steps and to improve upon them <e>", "<cs> my lords while welcoming the praise which the noble lord gave to the government before his qualification i am sorry that he then proceeded to spoil things <e> <s> the fact is that i do not believe that anyone on either side of the house seriously believes any more that one can solve the problems of employment opportunities for young people by upping central subvention to local authorities <e> <s> that is no longer i believe a credible position <e>", "<cs> my lords i should need notice of the question which the noble countess has asked me <e> <s> i shall attempt to find out <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> unemployment has risen more in the united kingdom than in other countries over the whole period since for two reasons first our problems were more deep-seated than theirs and secondly if the united kingdom wage bargainers had reacted more quickly to outside events in the period from to the rise in unemployment would have been less <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> first of all the united kingdom total labour force is at the very high end of those of our competitor countries and secondly as i pointed out in my original answer in the past months oecd standardised rates show increases rather greater than ours <e>", "<cs> my lords my own judgment would be that very high levels of unemployment will remain throughout the western countries for the rest of the decade <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble viscount has put it most succinctly <e> <s> i refer the house to the article in the <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> to recognise factors and economic forces at work in the western world does not mean that one is satisfied with them <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree with the noble lord lord beswick that investment is essential but with all of his experience of industry he will know that nowadays investment is nearly always to save labour and not to add to it <e>", "<cs> my lords as i indicated in my earlier answer the governments policies are to set a framework of sensible fiscal and monetary management in order that the firms of this country can become more competitive in relation to those abroad <e> <s> that will save jobs and generate more jobs <e>", "<cs> my lords as i indicated earlier it is certainly the case that under successive governments in this country i make no party point here there has been a tendency to try for the noblest of reasons to protect employment but at the cost of a greater shake-out of labour later as we lose competitiveness internationally <e>", "<cs> no my lords and the noble lord will be aware that the exchange rate has become more competitive in recent months <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the point of the noble lord lord hankey and it is the central thrust of the governments policy to try to discipline and contain the very many and wholly legitimate demands on its own spending in order that more resources are available for industry <e> <s> i am glad to say that there has been some encouragement here and that is why as i said originally the present figures for this country in comparison with our oecd competitors are very good <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a very large question and i do not know whether i can exchange ideas about this vital subject by means of question and answer <e> <s> but certainly it would seem to me that if we do not proceed along the lines of greater investment in high technology our overall wealth base will shrink and that will not generate employment rather to the contrary <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord lord jacques will have to concede that that same highly respectable economic opinion has been advised to nearly all western governments of widely differing political complexions obviously i am thinking in particular of france and that when put into effect the advice has not proved able to generate employment <e>", "<cs> my lords i will not conceal from my noble friend or the house that in the very early stages of what is after all a novel scheme we were a little anxious at the rate of take-up but by th october over young people had entered the scheme and during the first three weeks of october over young people entered it so things are now progressing well <e>", "<cs> my lords i know of no such plans for any such cut but i would urge young people that it is only responsible for them to take up the places which are offered and which are after all designed not to provide makeway activities but real training to enhance their possibilities of real employment in a difficult labour market <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of that <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state for employment has made additional applications to the european social fund for these purposes which are precisely what it is for and is designed to fulfil <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not dissatisfied because i have not been given information which might make me dissatisfied but i will take up the point the noble baroness has made and make sure that the schools are aware of this potential <e> <s> from my own experience as a youth employment minister two years back i know that the schools were co-operating with us very closely on that point <e> <s> if i may i will take advice on that and on her second supplementary question and will write to the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a relatively open-ended scheme so one cannot talk about proportions in that way <e> <s> but it would certainly be misguided of young people to behave as the noble lordsuggests because while there can be no guarantee of permanent employment as a result of participation in the scheme as i said earlier it does improve the odds in favour of real employment at a very difficult time in the labour market <e>", "<cs> my lords as the minister in day-to-day charge of the civil service i have been engaged in quite sensitive negotiations with the unions on this very issue <e> <s> i am optimistic that we shall shortly have a good result but i do not want to say more than that at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with much of what the noble lord said in the first part of his supplementary question <e> <s> however i am afraid that on the second part of his supplementary his assumptions are that the government have control over the overall levels of employment in any given economy <e> <s> in a free society that is simply not the case <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to pay tribute to the church as a very responsible employer if i may put it that way <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that one can ever be satisfied but i certainly think that all the bodies concerned particularly the manpower services commission in terms of its excellent direction at regional level on merseyside are doing everything they can and are spending the money that we give them well to promote the practical usefulness of the scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very happy of course to come before your lordships at any time to report on the progress of the scheme but for what my own views are worth this would be useful when we have had a little more time on the scheme perhaps in six or seven months time <e>", "<cs> my lords i will do what i can to pull strings for the noble lord but he seems to have done very well in the ordinary course of employment <e>", "<cs> my lords business sponsorship of the arts is already running at a very encouraging level <e> <s> nevertheless my office is continuing to explore with the inland revenue and the association for business sponsorship of the arts whether there are further incentives which might be offered in order to attract even more support <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to confess to being rather a hawk where vat is concerned <e> <s> the problem with vat which is a comprehensive tax is to have any exceptions whatsoever <e>", "<cs> my lords i have made it clear both in the house and outside it that i look upon any benefits that we can receive for the arts from private funds as being in addition to rather than in lieu of continued public support <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord lord strabolgi is referring to the report made to me on the funding of the royal opera house and the royal shakespeare company by mr clive priestley <e> <s> i have now received this report and it has gone out to <e>", "<cs> my lords i tried to deal with the question of additionality if i may put it that way in my reply to the noble lord lord jenkins of putney <e> <s> i am of course acutely aware of the high costs of great works of art on the international market <e> <s> i have also to be aware as i think the whole country is of how very fortunate we are in this country in that so many great works of art remain here in both public and private hands <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a great pleasure to be able to welcome a supplementary question from the noble lord <e> <s> it is precisely in order to meet his point that the association for business sponsorship of the arts has been set up <e> <s> a vigorous and successful young director has taken over from mr luke rittner and i am very confident that the association will be able to achieve the purpose that the noble lord outlined <e>", "<cs> my lords it is very nice to be asked for support of a non-financial character and i give it most freely <e>", "<cs> my lords of course we all like more but the fact of the matter is that i have no evidence at this stage that the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware that in general in this country and eleswhere there is a high accident rate in agriculture <e> <s> for this reason special provision is made for health and safety matters in the industry which has a separately organised inspectorate <e> <s> on the second part of lord collisons supplementary about the fall in staff numbers it has indeed been rather sharper this year than anticipated mainly due to natural wastage <e> <s> we are taking steps to remedy this through a scheme of recruitment but in general the overall fall in numbers of inspectors will not lead to decreased efficiency since other steps such as the computerised hazard rating which i mentioned in my initial reply are being taken to improve operational efficiency <e> <s> in this way we shall be able to concentrate on areas of the highest priority <e>", "<cs> no my lords i cannot do that without previous notice but obviously we are concerned at a sharper than expected fall <e> <s> i think the recruitment numbers we would be thinking of would be four or five in the fairly near future followed subsequently by an additional five or so <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not suggesting that computers will do the trick <e> <s> what i am suggesting is that one can improve operational efficiency in this way <e> <s> the important thing in this field is the educative effort because machines are only as safe as those who use them allow them to be <e> <s> it is important therefore to get a proper programme of education and we are consulting with manufacturers about this as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i refute suggestions from the noble lord the leader of the opposition that i feel lackadaisical about this issue <e> <s> the fact is that there is no correlation between the number of inspectors and the overall rate of accidents <e> <s> there were more inspectors in the s than there are now and there have been fewer accidents during recent years than there were in the s <e> <s> one accident is one accident too many <e> <s> there is no complacency about this <e> <s> there is a small shortfall wider than expected in the number of inspectors <e> <s> we are taking steps to alleviate the situation as i mentioned in my answer to the orginal supplementary but i hope that the noble lord and the house will not feel that the sheer incidence of numbers of health and safety inspectors is the main issue where health and safety in agriculture are concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i wholly endorse concern for the health and safety of young people on training schemes in agriculture as elsewhere <e> <s> to clarify the position in relation to the regulations issued by the msc in consultation with the health and safety executive the government are bringing forward new regulations which will bring yts trainees within the full scope of the health and safety at work act <e> <s> i would anticipate that i shall be introducing these into your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think the most efficient way of filling the very highly skilled posts of inspectors in the health and safety executive would be by looking through ordinary lists of unemployed people <e> <s> it is highly specialised and skilled work <e> <s> i have no doubt we shall be able to fill the unexpected small shortfall that i mentioned earlier <e>", "<cs> my lords i am perfectly happy to look at the point that the noble lord lord byers makes but i must rest on my earlier answer that this is extremely senior very highly skilled highly paid <e>", "<cs> my lords the essence of health and safety is that as many people as possible should be involved <e> <s> everyone in the industry has a part to play <e> <s> manufacturers importers suppliers and installers have a duty under the act to ensure that new machines are safe <e> <s> but as i said in answer to an earlier supplementary no machine is safe if safety precautions are ignored <e> <s> that is why i am anxious that there should be an increase in the educational aspect of health and safety at work for those ends <e>", "<cs> my lords i sympathise with my noble friends desire to see a continued industrial calm overall while i share his anxieties where there are breaches of good practice as outlined in the code in terms of picketing <e> <s> however the evidence from academic research i am advised shows that picket organisers generally pay attention to the codes guidance and that usually the numbers are in single figures <e>", "<cs> my lords in spite of spending constraints and such market factors if i may put it that way as falling pupil rolls the overall spending of local and central government on education is still very large and i do know that there is the temptation to dispense with the part-time artist <e> <s> but given the relatively low cost of part-time artists it should be possible for most authorities to resist these temptations <e> <s> i hope they will pay heed to what the noble lord says <e> <s> he will appreciate however that i cannot require them to order their budgets in this way <e> <s> i can simply point out that in relation to total spending on education spending on the arts is small and that the maintenance of a corps of part-time teachers should be possible <e>", "<cs> my lords what the government can do and what the minister for the arts can do and indeed has done is to point out as i have already said that against the overall funds which are available the process of axing part-time artists which i fully acknowledge has taken place to some degree need not be necessary <e> <s> but i cannot enforce this method of <e>", "<cs> my lords i wholeheartedly share my noble friends misgivings about the wages council system <e> <s> when i was the minister responsible for wages councils i sought to take young people out of their remit <e> <s> that would have required legislative change which we were not reluctant to undertake but which would have been in default of the ilo treaty <e> <s> that treaty as i said will come to an end in this respect in <e>", "<cs> my lords it is very welcome to the government to have from the benches of the noble lord so sensible a supplementary question in relation to market clearing prices <e> <s> i wish that we could hear responses of the same kind from the benches of the noble lords party in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have very regular contact with employers both individually and in terms of their organisations and they have never ceased to make this representation to us <e>", "<cs> my lords since we are signatories to the treaty i think that it would be difficult to pre-empt what happens in june but i did say to the house that the government would be ready to consider action the moment that we are released from our binding obligations <e>", "<cs> my lords i am of course very glad that the noble lord lord molloy is recognising that legislation belonging to a previous era is often adverse to the prospects for employment in the present era <e> <s> may i say to the noble lord that that is a great step forward for him i shall of course take note of the other points that he made <e>", "<cs> my lords the wages councils act allows for individual councils to be abolished where collective bargaining develops subject to an investigation by acas if there are objections <e> <s> as my noble friend reminds us in recent years the system has contracted through abolitions and mergers from the level of councils in <e>", "<cs> my lords as i stated in my original answer it is not possible to quantify the effects of wages councils on juvenile unemployment <e> <s> it is simply a matter of common sense that if minimum rates are set for historical reasons at a level that the market will not bear there will in consequence be fewer job opportunities available <e>", "<cs> my lords that would not be at all easy to quantify <e> <s> we have of course some indications of the effects about which the noble lord is asking in terms of the councils which have already been wound up <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his welcome of my announcement <e> <s> i would point out to him that a labour predecessor may have announced the project in but i notice that no labour predecessor of mine actually brought it to fruition <e>", "<cs> my lords it maybe for the convenience of the house if i now repeat an answer given to a private notice question in another place about the dispute at the stockport messenger <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords for the responsible way in which they received the statement <e> <s> also i should like to extend on behalf of these benches our great sympathy and anxiety to the policeman who was hurt in the incident last night <e> <s> we hope that his recovery will be rapid <e> <s> in respect of the remarks of the noble lord lord dean of beswick the point here is that of course acas has a role and indeed has had a role but nothing that acas can do can prevail against those who not only deliberately break the law but continue to encourage their members to do so <e> <s> this is simply unforgiveable and has no place in any kind of credible industrial relations system <e> <s> this was the point made substantively by the noble lord lord rochester and i have to say that i wholeheartedly agree with him <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to my noble friends preliminary supplementary question i have to say that the nga has a particularly bad record in seeking to coerce employees into joining trade unions against their will <e> <s> all the information that i have suggests that the employees of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin conventionally but sincerely in this case with two congratulations <e> <s> i should like to congratulate my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter on introducing the debate and on the way in which he did so and perhaps most of all on keeping the governments eye on the ball which the electorate gave them <e> <s> when faced with the day-to-day problems of any large mixed economy it is very easy to get your eye off the ball which your electorate has handed to you <e> <s> my noble friend reminded us of that and his reminder was echoed <e>", "<cs> my lords like the hall orchestra the royal exchange theatre in manchester is also listed in the white paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i congratulate the noble lord lord strabolgi not only for the pertinent matters he raised and the cogent way in which he raised them but also for attracting so many speakers to a short debate <e> <s> i propose to make a few general remarks about the principal themes which have come up this evening and then deal as best i can in the time available with specific points directed at me <e> <s> if i fail i beg the indulgence of the house since so far i seem to have escaped short debates <e> <s> i shall of course write to noble lords if need be <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord as always made himself clear but obviously the forms will have to he in to the department in good time so that the latter date can be adhered to <e>", "<cs> my lords i will take on board the points made both by the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale and by the noble baroness lady seear and see what i can do <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that i missed my noble friends point <e> <s> if i may i will write to her on that issue <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way since he mentioned me <e> <s> before he leaves that question may i point out to him that managers have no obligation to continue paying any of their workforce in those circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord scanlon will know that i have a great deal of respect and affection for him because when i was a very new employment minister i learnt a great deal from him <e> <s> but i must say that i can follow him in very little of what he said tonight <e> <s> it seems to me that it was extraordinary for him to use the phrase a direct affront to every thinking trade unionist in terms of legislation that all opinion in your lordships house this evening this was not even contested by the speaker from the official opposition benches the noble lord lord dean of beswick and all known tests of opinion whether in election polls or in opinion polls has shown to be wrong <e> <s> as stated by speaker after speaker tonight the threat to the law is a threat to laws that have been passed with an overwhelming degree of popular support from within the trade union movement as well as from outside it <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> i think i can say inevitably guardedly that the government are satisfied with progress so far <e> <s> we anticipate that by the middle of this month nearly young people will have entered the scheme <e> <s> i cannot extrapolate further than that except to say to my noble friend that the intention is that all young people over who choose to take a place should be offered one <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the noble baronesss recognition of the real advantages of yts and it is the case that the government and the manpower services commission have lost no time in making schools in particular aware of the differences between this scheme and yop <e> <s> i am confident that these differences are realised <e> <s> i think that more can be done in the way of publicity and the government are looking at that <e> <s> nevertheless the take-up so far is encouraging <e> <s> in so far as it has been slightly less than expected it is also the case that there are now more real vacancies for young people than there were when the scheme was set up <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have thought that local authorities all over the country would greatly welcome the fact that there are now more real employment opportunities for young people though of course the training element in this scheme means that it will be possible for a young person to be both in employment and under the scheme at the same time which is also i think widely welcomed <e> <s> but i see no reason if local authorities plan sensibly why they should be in any difficulty <e>", "<cs> my lords the reason i cannot do so is simply that it is very difficult to break down the employment figures in this way <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that there has been a sharp improvement in the prospects of employment for young people over recent months <e> <s> that still leaves a very great deal of difficulty for very many young people and it is to them that the scheme is directed <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> that is the case though i could not give the noble baroness precise figures <e> <s> she and the house might also be pleased to hear that of course young disabled people can enter the scheme after the age of <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know of instances <e> <s> i have to tell the noble lord that employers are reluctant in this way <e> <s> certainly the manpower services commission gives them a great deal of help over the scheme and its operation <e>", "<cs> my lords i wholly agree with the noble lord in those sentiments <e> <s> but of course since <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be perfectly within the bounds of local authorities to operate this scheme which they value as the government do within their existing budgets <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we take the noble baronesss point on board by stressing the fact that it is perfectly possible to be in real employment and to be in the scheme at the same time <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that governments if they are sensible are ever wholly satisfied about anything <e> <s> but the fact of the matter is that the manpower services commission operates the scheme in careful consultation with employers and with unions and i have not noticed any volume of complaint along the lines that the noble lord has outlined <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will also attend to the possible disincentive employment effects of the kinds of legislation that he has mentioned <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down i am most grateful to her may i point out that the government are proceeding in the light of the full legal advice of their own law officers not simply the law officers of one department <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> the fact of the matter is a little bit simpler than the noble lord is describing <e> <s> the government thought that the legislation was fully in conformity it was found not to be <e> <s> they introduced proposals which were found unsatisfactory by various representations and bodies <e> <s> they went away as we are again being appealed to do and thought again <e> <s> they brought back proposals which have been widely welcomed by the bodies consulted though understandably perhaps they would like some other ones <e> <s> all the weight of the governments legal advice is that it is now in full conformity with the law as defined by the european court <e> <s> this is not really quite such a complexity as the noble lord is making out <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been an extremely interesting debate one of the most interesting i have heard in your lordships house <e> <s> the difficulty is that all of us wherever we sit in this house tend to be swimming in rather unknown waters with this kind of legislation <e> <s> as he has done so often throughout such a distinguished career the noble and learned lord lord denning put his finger on the dilemma <e> <s> he was kind enough to accept that the governments intentions on equal opportunities for women were good and worthy <e> <s> noble lords on all sides of the house have been kind enough to echo the noble and learned lord lord denning in that and have also been kind to me in respect of my personal commitment in this area <e> <s> as i said on another occasion in your lordships house i appear at this dispatch box only by courtesy of the support of a full-time professional in the form of my wife <e> <s> otherwise i should find it extremely difficult economically to work here <e> <s> i certainly have an interest in this field of achievement and activity <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in my opening remarks europe wants us to do this as soon as possible and the european communities act suggests that we come in line through this process of regulation in order that there shall not be undue delay <e>", "<cs> my lords i share the dislike of the truck acts that is felt by the noble lord lord harris <e> <s> i can confirm that the ilo convention no <e> <s> has been denounced by the government <e> <s> that was done on th september of this year and we therefore cease to be bound by its terms on th september <e> <s> we can introduce new legislation after that <e> <s> we must of course get it right and that is why we shall be initiating consultations early in the new year <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no doubt that the truck acts served a useful and desirable purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords it is precisely because we want to make some haste in this matter that we are to issue consultation documents in the new year <e> <s> in respect of the civil service the government are seeking to encourage the use of cashless pay and simplified payroll systems throughout the economy <e> <s> all new entrants to the non-industrial sections of the civil service are required to accept monthly pay by credit transfer as part of their conditions of service <e> <s> most non-industrial civil servants are already paid monthly by credit transfer <e> <s> there has also been a recent inducement scheme encouraging staff to transfer to cashless pay on a monthly basis the inducement being to each individual who so transfers <e>", "<cs> my lords the views of trade unions and others will of course be fully taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords could i say to the noble lord lord dean of beswick who wanted the secretary of state to call the various parties to this dispute together that exhaustive attempts at conciliation have been made throughout this dispute and particularly in the last week <e> <s> it is now quite clear that what stands in the way of a negotiated settlement is not in fact the future of the six dismissed strikers but the ngas rigid insistence on a closed shop <e> <s> that is what this dispute has always been about and i therefore cannot see sadly that there is much scope for further attempts at conciliation <e>", "<cs> my lords there are two points at issue here <e> <s> part of the shortfall in spite of the improvement i mentioned is i think welcome to this degree that it is a product of increasingly keen competition among employers for able graduates as the economic position is improving <e> <s> of course we would not want it to be otherwise <e> <s> in terms of our reponse we are of course implementing sir alec atkinsons report which was received earlier this year and which is designed to gain wider publicity for the scheme and to improve our liaison in universities particularly in the newer universities <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord glenamara for that correction <e> <s> in fact sir alec atkinson did recommend vigorous efforts at the polytechnics and that is taking place <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that is a most extraordinary suggestion <e> <s> the government <e>", "<cs> my lords as i am sure the noble baroness will be aware there is no bias against women in the selection process <e> <s> my advice is that over the last decade women have filled something like one-third of the administration traineee vacancies <e> <s> this proportion is roughly in line with the proportion that women form of newly qualified graduates generally and therefore the position is equitable though we should of course like to see it improve <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord lord leatherland would care to parade in front of me a lot of sacked civil servants i shall be delighted to deal with the issue <e> <s> i think he will find them hard to find <e>", "<cs> my lords i should not for a moment seek to deny that libraries have had to make as indeed they should make their fair share of economies and that the service has had increased pressure on it in recent years <e> <s> nevertheless i deplore the habit which is not restricted across this section of the economy in recent years of describing increases as cuts <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said the pressure on book funds is there as indeed pressure on all public funding is there <e> <s> but that does not mean to say that there has not been very creditable and good management within resources by the library service which continues to be an admirable service to the public <e>", "<cs> my lords that is rather wide of the present question <e> <s> as the noble lord is aware however the government have a manifesto commitment to the british library and i hope to be able to announce figures in terms of the next tranche of spending within the next few days <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware of what the noble lord told me <e> <s> but as someone with a great interest in northern ireland i am quite happy to take that up with my colleagues <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right in that there has been pressure of course on the library service as a result of the above-average rate of inflation of book prices in recent years <e> <s> i shall look into the interesting suggestion he makes about putting newspapers on microfilm <e> <s> this is of course done by the british library and by others but it may be that we could expedite the process somewhat <e>", "<cs> my lords what i think the noble baroness is saying is that we all whether as individuals or as industries have to reckon with the problems of inflation and this is why it is so wise of the government to try to establish control over inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with much of what the noble baroness has said and as a result in my original answer if i may remind her and the house i said <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall of course take the noble baronesss point seriously though she will appreciate that within the remit of my own ministerial resonsibilities it is the public library service with which i am concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most interested to hear the view of my noble friend <e> <s> as i said it remains the conviction of the government that in spite of the views expressed by the house on th december we are in fact in conformity with european law <e> <s> the object of the exercise of bringing the amended regulations before your lordships house was as expeditiously as possible to close the gap between our domestic legislation and the european equal pay directive <e> <s> i know that it is the view of the noble lord and others that we have not adequately done this but nevertheless we are convinced that we have <e>", "<cs> on the contrary my lords the vote in this house was on an amendment stating <e>", "<cs> my lords there are of course and rightly so procedures for testing the law and for testing whether our legislation is now as we believe in conformity with european legislation <e> <s> as i said earlier what the government have sought to do taking the views of this house is to try to bring our legislation into that conformity <e> <s> we are confident that we have done so but i have to tell the house that of course only time will tell whether we are right <e> <s> we believe we are right but only time will tell whether our belief is well founded <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble baroness and to the house if i have been dilatory in any way in replying to a point she made in the debate <e> <s> i shall of course look into the points that she has raised and consider them again <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that in modern economies there is little correlation between increased economic activity and increased levels of employment <e> <s> that is true all over the western world <e> <s> the principal way in which we can help the long-term unemployed and unemployed more generally is by tackling the underlying causes of unemployment by setting the economy to rights and creating the conditions for growth <e> <s> in the meantime we are spending nearly billion a year on schemes of special help for unemployed people who through no fault of their <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be impossible to be fully satisfied but i am satisfied to the <e>", "<cs> my lords that is not what i said <e> <s> what i said was that increased economic activity in the modern world is not necessarily reflected in the numbers of the unemployed <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with much of what the noble lord says <e> <s> nevertheless demographic factors and the fact that the number of people available for work at any one given period or one given decade shows fairly radical alteration must also be taken into account <e> <s> what we are trying to do at the moment is to ease the special generation facing very particular problems through no fault of their own as i have said into employment through training and re-training and through other measures <e> <s> in the meantime we also have to see to the internal health of our economy and its competitiveness in world markets generally <e> <s> i believe that over the next decade this will ease the situation somewhat <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not consider that the spending of billion of public money on training schemes community programme schemes <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend that it is encouraging that the overall trend in the rise of the numbers of unemployed has stabilised consistently over the past four months and that bears witness to the truth of a great deal of what he has said <e> <s> nevertheless of course the numbers are too high <e> <s> the individual tragedies involved cannot be underestimated and that is why the government are spending the amount of money that they are on the special programmes and other schemes that i have mentioned <e> <s> i also agree with my noble friend that it is very important for us in parliament to give clear signals to this political economy that future employment levels will come in smaller batches than we have known since the war <e>", "<cs> my lords it is at least interesting to look at the very severe unemployment problems that exist in the non-capitalist economies such as china and soviet russia <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not disagree with that analysis at all <e> <s> what i was trying to deal with by way of illustration was the simple fact that if large sums injected into the economy in terms of public spending could correct the economy then northern ireland would have a pretty healthy economy <e>", "<cs> my lords that is precisely why levels of taxation in this country are already high too high in my view so that those of us who are fortunate enough to be in employment can make a contribution towards the plight of the unemployed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most happy to take that point on board so long as the noble lord for his part also looks into the employment consequences of higher rates of interest higher taxation and higher rates of inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords the very fact that the noble lord is able to put that question to me shows that he is usefully employed <e>", "<cs> my lords the government considered very carefully the manpower services commissions recommendation to extend the eligibility to year-olds <e> <s> we came to the view that for it was right to concentrate on developing the quality of training offered and generally improving the existing scheme for broadly the present groups of eligible youngsters <e> <s> the noble baroness and the house will notice from my original reply that because the young workers scheme has been withdrawn from year-olds and on its new basis will encourage the jobs of more year-olds this should be of benefit to those people who are completing their year on the youth training scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wholly understand my noble friends question <e> <s> both schemes <e>", "<cs> my lords i think with respect the noble baroness is confusing the young workers scheme and the youth training scheme <e> <s> the youth training scheme is very specifically earmarked towards training both on and off the job <e> <s> the young workers scheme does not have that element <e>", "<cs> my lords it was always planned that the youth training scheme would involve year-olds <e> <s> as the noble baroness is aware we are constantly and permanently trying to improve the quality of the training offered to year-olds <e> <s> we think the modifications to the young workers scheme will provide incentives to employers to take on those who have been through the earlier training scheme <e> <s> in the long run what people want is real employment so this should be a good idea <e>", "<cs> my lords i am altogether in agreement with my noble friend <e> <s> while i recognise the genuine concern to improve the quality of schemes and to keep both the government and the manpower services commission up to the mark it is unfortunate sometimes that the very people most interested in calling for youth training appear to the public at large to be most critical of it when it is provided <e>", "<cs> my lords the only criticism i would make of the noble baronesss question is the choice of the word failure <e> <s> in fact it is impossible to predict and therefore to fulfill exact targets <e> <s> apart from anything else far more young people this year are getting real employment than last year and we should all welcome that <e> <s> i think it is the use of the term failure when the christmas guarantee to year-olds has been triumphantly met that causes my noble friend to make the criticism that she did <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord and i not for the first time in our lives have totally different interpretations of what the word target means <e>", "<cs> my lords on the issue of publicity and recruitment all general publicity and marketing material has been designed to make the scheme equally attractive to males and females <e> <s> but through specific marketing material we are also trying to encourage young people to use the yts as an introduction to types of work which they might have thought were closed to them because of the traditional attitudes to the role of men and women in jobs <e> <s> to that degree i agree with what the noble baroness has said <e> <s> i must also point out that part of the imbalance is due to the fact and the general evidence is to this effect that young women have a slightly higher rate of taking up real employment than young men <e>", "<cs> no my lords it does not mean that <e> <s> it means that this supplementary and monitoring material is at present in the process of being gathered <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very sorry that the noble lord is not eligible for many of these admirable government schemes but i am sure that we can find something for him <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house <e> <s> i will now repeat a statement being made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for employment <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords <e> <s> in respect of the question about consultations put to me by the noble lord lord dean from the opposition front bench which was echoed by the noble lord lord kilmarnock this is of course a white paper and in itself will be debated and the subject of consultation <e> <s> but further than that the msc will undertake immediate consultations with local authority associations with employers representatives with representatives of further education colleges with unions especially those with members teaching in colleges and with examining and validating bodies <e> <s> these consultations will be about all aspects of the initiative with particular reference to the subject areas and levels to be supported and the appropriate machinery for implementing the initiative <e> <s> the commission will probably have to have arrangements in place to allow negotiations with local education authorities and colleges so that they can plan their programmes and budgets in good time for next year <e> <s> we have to get on with this and this is perhaps why we have issued this in the form of a white paper rather than a green paper <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a passage in the statement which states that through this initiative the manpower services commission is to become a national training authority <e>", "<cs> my lords the role of the department of education and science is that my right honourable friend the secretary of state will be fully involved in considering and approving the manpower services commissions corporate plan and in proposals relating to non-advanced further education and this kind of training <e> <s> he will also be responsible for consultations on appointments to the commission to represent professional education and local authority interests in england and wales <e> <s> in terms of the accountability of the manpower services commission to parliament that will remain as at present the responsibility of my right honourable friend the secretary of state for employment <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding is that the pilot studies have been relevant to the proposals which the government are now putting forward <e>", "<cs> my lords as i suggested to the noble baroness lady lockwood at an earlier stage of this afternoons proceedings the manpower services commission is thoroughly interested in widening the range of work and training provision that is available for young women and in trying to get young women interested in non-traditional skills <e> <s> a national initiative and network for training of this kind will promote this objective <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always wishful thinking that pump priming in one area can be achieved without the well getting a little drier in another area otherwise one would be adding to public spending taxes and interest rates and reducing the number of employment opportunities that would be available thereby <e> <s> this is a sensible use of existing overall resources <e> <s> as i said earlier it is not a very great change in principle because in this area the manpower services commission is overwhelmingly the largest customer where local authorities are concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords on the subject of training the noble baroness will be aware that i made a fairly lengthy statement on training in your lordships house yesterday <e> <s> i hope that the noble baroness will kindly look at that statement because i think she will find that it contains much to encourage her <e> <s> on the subject of the city of birmingham education departments pilot project i have nothing but praise for their initiative in this regard but as i have said it is not part of the manpower services commissions youth training scheme and to extend <e>", "<cs> my lords the government take the view that it would be best to devote resources and the skills and dedication of very many people involved in the youth training scheme not least employers to improving its quality on a constant basis <e> <s> i rather doubt whether to extend it would have that effect <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said i have nothing but praise for the birmingham initiative <e> <s> but if the noble baroness will look at my statement she will see that the government are channelling more resources into training this year than at any time in our history <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i did not hear the second part of the noble lords supplementary question but i think he was again trying to draw me into praise of the city of birmingham and that as someone who resides within an hour of it i am delighted to do <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel slightly tempted to take myself off and appeal to the european court of human rights <e> <s> i had thought that i had accommodated your lordships to a very large degree in these regulations and that you would in fact be rather pleased with me <e> <s> when the equal pay amendment regulations were debated in this house on th december a number of your lordships had serious reservations about them and were anxious that they were not fully in accord with european regulations <e> <s> as a consequence we made major <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but first i should like to finish the point <e> <s> a number of noble lords the noble lord lord mccarthy the noble baroness lady seear the noble baroness lady lockwood and my noble friend lady platt expressed some satisfaction with the changes being made in the light of these consultations <e> <s> the procedure regulations which we are considering today are identical to the revised draft regulations which were made available to your lordships with an explanatory note before our debate in december <e> <s> so as i said earlier i had hoped that your lordships would at least be guardedly slightly more pleased with me <e>", "<cs> my lords the point that i was making was that we did take very closely into account in looking at this legislation the views of your lordships house <e> <s> however i take the point made by the noble lord lord mccarthy that the procedure regulations with which we are concerned tonight were not changed but it was not represented to me that that was the area of difficulty <e> <s> i tried to meet the house on the areas of difficulty which were presented to me and which i outlined a few moments ago as matters about which i had sought to try to accommodate the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i would need to study the noble lords words very carefully but they sound as though they are consonant with what i was saying <e> <s> however i would need to compare his text with mine before i gave a judgment and i use that word in inverted commas in this context <e>", "<cs> my lords that would be my understanding yes <e> <s> i cannot see why that should not be so as the tribunal is the final arbiter of the issue <e>", "<cs> my lords surely what it is at the heart of the whole matter is that the tribunal does in the end have to take a view and make a judgment <e> <s> but where you are dealing with issues of work of equal value you are not dealing with easily or precisely definable facts <e> <s> some appeal to expertise or evaluation is necessary in those instances <e>", "<cs> my lords i will undertake to see that my right honourable friend goes through this debate with a toothcomb <e> <s> i believe that i have answered most of the substantive points which the noble lord and others have put to me but i will look at the debate and measure what noble lords have said against what i have said <e> <s> perhaps i can work an informal consultative method by correspondence or otherwise to say why i feel that i have met the points that noble lords have made <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in my original answer i am aware of the severity of these problems <e> <s> in the case of the whitworth art gallery the gallery receives i think per cent <e> <s> of its funding from the metropolitan county council and therefore that funding will be part of our consultative process in terms of local government reorganisation <e> <s> with respect to the fitzwilliam i have to stand by my original answer and say that that is of course a matter for the university although the noble lord will be well aware that the university is helped by the government through the university grants committee <e> <s> in respect of dulwich i have visited it <e>", "<cs> my lords my recollection is that the soane museum award was in respect of pensions of employees there where an anomaly needed to be corrected but i will take on board what the noble lord says about dulwich <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the benefits of the ashmolean to the university and to the town of oxford will be registered by the university that funds the museum <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already mentioned the whitworth but it seems to me to be a central truth that it is enormously in the interests of modern cities and metropolitan centres that they should attract people in to use their arts and leisure services <e> <s> i am sure that manchester will be aware of the attractions of the whitworth to the rest of lancashire <e>", "<cs> my lords the university grants committee is of course subject to financial constraints but so my lords am i <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble baroness and the house will be aware that as a minister i am something of a way station for funding <e> <s> i have a number of client bodies <e> <s> i argue and negotiate the money for them in each financial year and then hand it straight over <e> <s> unfortunately i do not have a nice little contingency reserve all of my own for these admirable purposes <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is well aware that the governments proposals to abolish the upper tier of local government has nothing to do with arts and museum funding as will soon be apparent <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in my original answer the evidence that we have is that the worst affected groups are young people <e> <s> nevertheless unemployment is an evil wherever it falls and i am of course sensitive to its effects in respect of any group in our economy <e>", "<cs> my lords this is precisely the point which the government would never lose an opportunity to seek to make clear <e> <s> the falls in the levels of inflation have coincided with a marked improvement in the rates of increase in unemployment levels <e> <s> for instance although it takes some time to feed through over the past six months there has been an average monthly rise of compared with an average monthly rise of in the six months previously <e> <s> allowing for the two-year or one and a half year time lag that most economists now bargain for that is a very startling effect indeed and it is thoroughly to be wished that it continues <e>", "<cs> my lords in december the department of employment published a research paper which conclusively showed that there was a relation between levels of pay on offer and the incidence of unemployment among young people <e> <s> i hope that noble lords in all parts of the house will reflect their concern about unemployment among the young or any other groups in society by seeking to persuade those who influence pay bargaining <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not able to state that with precision because of course the only measure we have is those who claim <e> <s> but it is certainly the case that without the very large sums of public money that the government spend in order to help those who are suffering the evil of unemployment the figure would be substantially higher <e>", "<cs> alas my lords words do not create jobs would that it were so <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that only a stable currency and the recovery of the whole of the west from a very deep recession will actually generate more jobs in the real world <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree with my noble friend that it does not help employment in this country if we persistently talk ourselves down <e> <s> of the oecd countries for which regular unemployment figures are available in the past months only five had lower percentage increases than the united kingdom <e> <s> during that period unemployment has risen by per cent in norway per cent in ireland per cent in spain per cent in the netherlands per cent in italy per cent in denmark per cent in belgium and per cent <e> <s> here <e>", "<cs> my lords as a fellow irishman i admire the noble lords ingenuity but that is another question <e>", "<cs> my lords in a previous reply i pointed out to the house and i hope that as a courtesy to me the noble lord will check this that without the very considerable sums of money from central funds which the government are spending on this great problem and evil the rates of unemployment would be considerably higher than they are <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will put that down as a question i shall do my best to answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords it is very much my view that the best way in which we can help the long-term unemployed is by setting the economy to rights and creating the conditions for higher rates of growth <e> <s> but help is available through the community programme which is now providing up to temporary jobs <e> <s> naturally i would wish that help to be extended but we have to take into account that the spending that would improve such a figure would also be to the detriment of recovery generally <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure whether the cbi or the institute of directors have been seeking a generalised reflation of the economy which in a trading economy such as ours could have a pretty adverse effect on unemployment and other areas <e> <s> leaving that point aside i thought that i had made clear to the noble lord and to the house that i think the overall problem of unemployment would be rather greater were the government not tackling the matter in the way that they are <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i would need prior notice to answer that question <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that that is an entirely laudable objective <e> <s> but for british firms to offer more apprenticeships they have to be secure in the knowledge of more orders <e> <s> they have in short to be more competitive <e> <s> government policies are designed to create a climate in which they can become more competitive <e>", "<cs> my lords as i think i said in my first supplementary to create a stable financial environment and to operate both nationally and internationally in a disciplined manner so that the western world can come out of a largely self-induced recession <e>", "<cs> my lords the arguments about this issue have been well rehearsed both in this house and in another place in recent weeks <e> <s> we have now passed st march <e> <s> about per cent <e> <s> of the employees at gchq have freely accepted the new terms and conditions of employment <e> <s> i think we should now settle down and let the matter rest <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not accept that the government are in a hole but i endorse what the noble lord lord shackleton said about the patriotism and loyalty of mr mccall and others <e> <s> that was not in any sense the problem during this case <e> <s> as to the question concerning the machinery of government both my honourable friend mr hayhoe and myself work directly with the prime minister on these issues and we were present at all these meetings <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have made it very clear right from the beginning that this was never an issue connected with union membership matters or union rights <e> <s> this is an issue of correcting an anomaly in an agency whose primary function was with intelligence <e> <s> that was the position from the beginning and it remains so now <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a little wide of the original question but my noble friend is certainly right to say that it would be better if there were rights to not join unions as well as rights to join them <e>", "<cs> my lords with great respect to the noble lord i have answered that question the way he wishes to hear it answered three times already <e>", "<cs> my lords with great respect to the noble lord lord paget of northampton he is missing the point at issue <e> <s> the gchq at cheltenham did not and many of us feel that this was perhaps an absurd situation officially exist until earlier this year <e> <s> once it was avowed it was simply brought into line with the position that obtains at other intelligence agencies <e> <s> it is no different in any other way <e>", "<cs> my lords morale at gchq is excellent <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is entirely right <e> <s> i hope that the house will pay close attention to what he has said <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that one must write that down to a nice try on the part of the noble lord <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that the principle of compensating people whether for loss of employment or for loss of statutory rights is well established in this economy under successive governments and the compensation seemed to be about right in this case <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will be so kind it might console him to know that when he was cutting public expenditure he was praised from the opposition front bench by myself <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> the only reason that i was nodding was that i thought it was an excellent idea at the time and i wish that we had sold more <e>", "<cs> my lords as always where economic matters are concerned the minister winding up can say that it has been a lively and interesting debate only with very often rather more sincerity now than is sometimes the case <e> <s> i have missed participating in economic debates in your lordships house during the last few years and it is very nice to be allowed back in again <e>", "<cs> my lords in paragraph of the white paper we said that the manpower services commission proposes to start implementing its proposals experimentally this year that is and to begin restructuring its own programmes in <e> <s> one of the things that we hope to learn from the pilot schemes is how rapidly we are able to implement the proposals <e> <s> i cannot therefore be more precise at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will be aware of the difficult phenomenon that is not restricted to this country but experienced by all the industrialised countries known as mis-match <e> <s> it is not always easy to deploy a highly skilled worker in one field which may be in decline structurally towards another field of employment without retraining <e> <s> and retraining is what we are trying to do in these circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords i would need a little prior notice about that but i shall examine whether it is possible to establish such a scheme if it does not exist <e>", "<cs> my lords it is my understanding that the labour force surveys are published <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a sad fact as i have said to the house many times that there is no correlation in the western world at the moment between rates of economic recovery and improvement in unemployment levels <e>", "<cs> my lords glasgow is not subject to the exercise in local government reorganisation <e> <s> the problem with the whitworth is that it is a university museum funded by a threatened tier of local government <e> <s> i am confident that the threat posed to it through that particular policy can be relieved <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord the leader of the opposition for giving way <e> <s> what i said was that in my view the white paper very well might be the most important <e>", "<cs> my lords in respect of the arms length principle i can only say that i would consider myself to make a most unlikely fhrer <e> <s> the arts council knows very well what it is doing and as i have said i think that what it is doing is to be commended <e> <s> there is no evidence of any likely decimation of arts provision in london <e> <s> but many people including many on the noble lords side of the house have drawn attention in the past to the imbalance between the regions and london <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome what my noble friend has said and i will draw the attention of the arts council to my noble friends remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords i only disclaim friendship with the noble lord in the politcal rather than the personal sense <e> <s> but i would draw his attention to the wise remark of sir william rees-mogg that all arts funding is on a leasehold rather than a freehold basis <e>", "<cs> my lords the government provided an per cent <e> <s> increase to the arts council this year which is considerably above the rate of inflation and considerably above the level pegging which was my own ministerial remit <e> <s> i would also point out to the noble lord lord strabolgi that that figure does not include wiping off several significant deficits on the part of major companies <e> <s> if one were to <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend with his distinguished record as a previous minister will be listened to in respect of that advice <e> <s> but i have to say that i remain at present rather sceptical about whether it would be wise for ministers to be directly involved in the fortunes of any individual company however distinguished <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe and i shall draw my own attention to his remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords i will look at the point made by my noble friend but i do not think there are reasonable grounds for fear in this area <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord strabolgi will be aware of the vastly increased provision in recent years under successive governments as i would be the first to say in the provision of the very admirable but very expensive high art form of opera <e> <s> however that phenomenon which i certainly welcome as an opera lover does not of course mean that every opera company can be immune from financial problems <e>", "<cs> my lords the provision of time for a debate is of course not a matter for me <e> <s> but the usual channels can take the matter up and i shall be delighted to respond to the wishes of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i congratulate the noble lord lord beswick not only on the choice of his motion but on the effect which the wording of the motion has had on the money markets <e> <s> since he put the motion down for debate we have seen all the major clearing banks in the united kingdom cut their base rates while prime rates in the united states have risen <e> <s> i will say more about this later no doubt the noble lord lord beswick will continue to claim as his speech claimed that interest rates are far too high <e> <s> i agree with him there interest rates are too high both here and abroad on that there is little to debate <e>", "<cs> my lords only one point <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> i drew substantial comfort from the speech from the cross-benches of the noble lord lord seebohm and even to a large degree from the speech from the alliance bench of the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe <e>", "<cs> my lords i have said it before and so i apologise for saying it again but the quality of the economic debates in your lordships house is even allowing for our besetting sin of self <e>", "<cs> my lords my difficulty is that both of my noble friends supplementary questions are somewhat hypothetical as no decision whatsoever has been taken on the future of the eady levy <e> <s> when decisions are taken the interest that he mentions will be borne in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i am keenly aware that if the baby of the national film and television school were to be dropped by eady so to say it would land in my lap <e> <s> therefore i have a very keen interest in these negotiations <e> <s> as i think the noble lord will have been made aware the government value the school very highly <e> <s> that is why the discussions concerning the future of eady are so important <e>", "<cs> my lords there was a temporarily quizzical look on my face because the previous government had considerable difficulties with unemployment as indeed all western governments have had <e> <s> the idea that this is something that has sprung from the genius of mrs thatcher is quite incredible <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble countess sits down and while the point is fresh in the minds of the house i listened most carefully and with great interest to her speech may i point out that it is not a case of saying that no money is available <e> <s> in fact on youth training alone the government are spending more than million so we recognise the need for expansion in this area <e>", "<cs> my lords while it is fresh in our minds may i say that the point about local authority expenditure is not that local authorities do not have the resources for these admirable tasks but that well over per cent <e> <s> of their resources are absorbed by wages and salaries for their own employees <e> <s> that is the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> can he point to a single statistic that i used either arbitrarily or selectively <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships gave me a good run at the beginning of the debate <e> <s> i shall therefore try to wind up as specifically as possible in spite of many temptations not least from the noble lord lord mccarthy and the noble viscount lord chandos speaking for the official oppositions to be again drawn into wider areas of debate <e> <s> i was able <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not dealing with my noble friends or with my honourable and right honourable friends <e> <s> i was dealing with what i understood the noble lord to have said about the imf <e> <s> but indeed i shall turn to the text tomorrow <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may just finish making the point <e> <s> we have to have a framework wherein constraints against competing successfully are removed and that was the burden of most of the labour market remarks from this side of the house we have to go out and get the customers who create these jobs elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think it does <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know about my censure but i was far from extinguished by the right reverend prelate the bishop of peterborough who was kind to the government in pointing to corby as not merely a success story but something of a phoenix-rising-from-the-ashes story <e> <s> the right reverend prelate give us the credit for that <e> <s> i honestly think as a christian of a kind that i must disclaim with due humility this credit <e> <s> i should be delighted to take the credit but it was the workers and the managers of corby who did the job by refusing to knuckle under or to be got down and by refusing to listen to the kind of rhetoric which we have heard tonight from the opposition parties <e> <s> they have to face very difficult circumstances and they are engaged in overcoming them with commendable vigour <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful <e> <s> before the noble lord sits down may i say that he is making such a powerful and eloquent speech that i feel constrained to remind the house that under the bill the situation remains exactly as it has been since <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to intervene and i take the point that my noble friend made about time but i might be able to clarify the issue <e> <s> the point is that the tuc refused to discuss the green paper on trade union democracy with my right honourable friend the then secretary of state for employment mr tebbit <e> <s> that i believe is the substantive point that my noble friend is making and he is perfectly right <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord think of a single job or a single piece of wealth that the ilo has ever created <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not denouncing any organisation <e> <s> all that i am saying is that the noble lord with his customary skill is drawing an international red herring over a sensible and local provision <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not going to be tempted too far by the noble lord lord wedderburn to try and define what the signature tune or special song of this particular piece of legislation should be <e> <s> various members of your lordships house might propose some various tunes such as for instance sir harry lauders keep right on to the end of the road <e> <s> or since the rolling stones were mentioned we might have the more co-operative song of the beatles i wanna hold your hand where democratic and electoral procedures are concerned <e> <s> for myself i think the house will forgive me if i relapse into the role of minister for the arts and financier of grand opera just for a moment i would prefer the great duet between florestan and leonora in fidelio just after the prisoners are liberated <e>", "<cs> my lords may i finish the point <e> <s> it is astonishing too that the posing of such questions and our attempts to answer them should be looked upon in this house as an attack on the trade union movement <e>", "<cs> my lords this point has been made earlier in the house and by more experienced people than i it was my noble friend lord campbell of alloway who reminded the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby who i remember in was himself very aware of this point that every chance had been given to trade unions to reform themselves <e> <s> it is simply the reluctance of trade unions to do this the reluctance of trade unions even to come into consultations on this issue with my right honourable friend the then secretary of state mr <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding is that we have been in discussion by correspondence with the british airline pilots association <e> <s> when i know the results of that discussion i shall bring them to the attention of the noble lord <e> <s> however as i said in my opening speech the fact of the matter is that we are talking not about general malpractice but about bringing the rest up to the standard of the best <e> <s> if the noble lord lord beswick feels and no doubt he has good reasons for doing so that balpa enjoys the best standards they have nothing whatsoever to fear <e> <s> i acknowledge however that this is not a simple issue <e> <s> we shall give very careful consideration to the arguments which have been put forward today by those noble lords who favour compulsory postal ballots but our current view remains that a requirement which from the outset imposed postal ballots for all elections in all unions would be so impracticable as to negate the inherent desirability of the move <e>", "<cs> and belfries <e>", "<cs> my lords while the point is fresh in the mind of the house i would remind the house that it was the national heritage memorial fund and the trustees of the british museum who did not want to purchase the devonshire drawings at that price <e> <s> it was not a question of the treasury being mean <e>", "<cs> my lords on this as on many other issues i am delighted to welcome the noble lord lord strabolgi to the ranks of the free traders <e> <s> i hope that he will spread the gospel of this admirable economic doctrine among his friends on other issues as well <e> <s> i can say to the noble lord because one figure which he gave me was a little gloomy that the <e>", "<cs> my lords again overtime is a rather sensitive and difficult area because many employers find it necessary to offer overtime and also the demands of their businesses mean that it is difficult to plan work if they are unable to offer overtime <e> <s> but in general i agree with my noble friend that it would be desirable if there were less overtime in the economy as a whole <e>", "<cs> my lords between and per cent <e> <s> of the workforce <e> <s> i would have to check to find the precise figure <e>", "<cs> no my lords not without notice <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so that is unworthy of the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord believes that political policies can lead to changes in employment levels he is operating against the grain of almost any government of any political complexion anywhere in the world <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord however that work-sharing while it can be helpful can be so only at the margin <e>", "<cs> my lords in striving to provide a climate in which this country can become more competitive and win more customers at home and abroad that is precisely what her majestys government are trying to do <e>", "<cs> my lords in respect of some sectors of civil service work i have sympathy with the suggestion made by the noble baroness <e> <s> as i said earlier we are operating job splitting schemes and the part-time job release scheme <e> <s> but with her experience the noble baroness will know that these schemes would not he appropriate at all levels of civil service work <e>", "<cs> my lords i was fortunate enough when i was very young to grow up in the shadow of that admirable document <e> <s> my son who is now is less fortunate and is growing up in current economic conditions internationally <e>", "<cs> my lords i would agree with that <e> <s> it is of special benefit to women which is one reason why the government have introduced the scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords while again sympathising with the intent behind the noble lords supplementary question i would suggest with great respect that if he goes and looks at a modern motorway under construction or a modern building site he will not easily see many opportunities for young people <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure whether the latter conclusion could be drawn particularly as we do have an encouraging sign in the very significant increase in employment <e> <s> about more people are now likely to be in jobs this year than last year <e> <s> the labour market is also growing <e> <s> however i agree strongly that the plight of the long-term <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful the the noble lord <e> <s> that was my very point it is certainly gratifying and encouraging that there has been a growth in the numbers of people working as well as in the growth of the labour force <e>", "<cs> my lords on help for young school-leavers as the house will be aware from recent debates and from some of the answers that i have given lately the government are spending nearly million in total this year <e> <s> we are currently bringing direct help through special schemes to nearly three-quarters of a million young people and we are seeing some encouraging signs that this policy is bearing fruit <e> <s> on the point about capital projects as i know from my experience in northern ireland there is no evidence whatsoever that intensive expenditure on capital projects brings about a sustained growth in employment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have to take advice on both of those points and could then either in correspondence or by a separate question answer the noble lord <e> <s> but i could add which might be helpful that there is also an increase in the seasonally adjusted level of vacancies <e> <s> we have had the third <e>", "<cs> my lords what is in no sense suspect is the encouraging sign that though the workforce has been growing in this country so has the number of people going into real and sustained employment <e> <s> the noble lord must be aware that the united kingdom has a large workforce relative to our continental competitors <e> <s> we have per cent <e> <s> of our working age population in work as against some per cent <e> <s> in spain per cent <e> <s> in italy per cent <e> <s> in ireland per cent <e> <s> in france and per cent <e> <s> in germany <e> <s> so while we have a larger scale of problem on the one hand you could put it that we have greater success on the other <e>", "<cs> my lords i would point out to the house that the party of the government remains by far the largest victor in the recent european elections <e> <s> but on the point connected with employment which the noble lord raised i urge him and all of your lordships to be very responsible in this respect <e> <s> any politician who says that policies rather than customers can create sustained employment is misleading people <e>", "<cs> my lords thought is of course given by my department on these issues <e> <s> but as i said in answer to a previous supplementary question the fact that we have per cent <e> <s> of our working age population in work is encouraging and my firm belief is that if we can go on increasing our competitiveness and if we can maintain a stable financial climate we can improve greatly on that figure <e>", "<cs> my lords i am wholly in agreement with the noble lord lord hunt if i understand his inference aright that it would be a very great pity indeed a tragedy if political considerations usually connected with issues which have nothing whatsoever to do with youth training stopped unions from helping as we all must help young people who through no fault of their own are caught up in a great crisis in the jobs market <e> <s> as to the specific point he made my advice is that so far the scheme has not been adversely affected but in relation to the union of communications workers the post office workers as we think of them they did pass a resolution at a recent annual conference instructing their executive to withdraw from the scheme <e> <s> it is too early to say how this resolution will in practice affect the scheme and initially of course that will be a matter of negotiation between the union and the <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i have seldom heard even from the dispatch box opposite two more contradictory statements <e> <s> the whole point of the allowance is that it is an allowance and not wages <e> <s> if it were wages there might be some justification for the line that the noble lord was taking about cheap labour <e> <s> in fact it is not a cheap labour scheme it is a training scheme and should be treated accordingly <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i would have to have notice of that question <e> <s> my advice is that young people entered the training scheme in which is what i was asked <e>", "<cs> my lords i will indeed look at it but i am also advised by the msc that there has been an encouraging take-up into real employment of those leaving the scheme and in some areas the employment prospects for young people have i am glad to say improved considerably <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is i fear living in a dream world <e> <s> there has been no trade union bashing and there will be none <e>", "<cs> my lords the level of the allowance has had no deterrent effect on young people entering the scheme <e> <s> they are entering the scheme for training not for wages <e>", "<cs> my lords i can say to the noble lord that if a young person aged is unemployed and if places are available he or she will become eligible for a place on the scheme and that we do have year-olds on it <e> <s> in respect of the future and eligibility as of right so to say that is under review at present <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a wholly different issue <e> <s> i suggest that the noble and learned lord puts down a question on the allowances when it will be answered by the appropriate department <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord with his financial background will be well aware the government are moving most of their budgeting into cash terms and that is one of the many reasons why the government have been successful in improving the rate of inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords it is no secret i think that there are many items of disagreement <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i welcome the chance offered by the noble lord lord howie of troon and the noble and learned lord lord denning to enable us to concentrate for a moment on the effect of this amendment <e> <s> the efficacy of the amendment if it has efficacy obviously depends on understanding precisely where it lies in the bill <e> <s> it lies in clause <e> <s> clause of part i of the bill is the cornerstone of the bill and deals with union elections <e> <s> it imposes a duty on every trade union to ensure that all voting members of its principal executive committee are elected at least every five years by secret ballot <e> <s> the other issues fall <e>", "<cs> more is involved in this legislation than the election of officers in particular <e> <s> this is the point that i shall seek to argue in a minute <e> <s> the idea that one should bring forward legislation which is in effect optional is a somewhat novel concept and whatever the merits of the argument and i do not happen to share the noble lords views i think it would be agreed between us that this would be a novel idea <e>", "<cs> as my noble friend lord campbell of alloway has just reminded us these amendments are very similar in their combined affect to amendment no <e> <s> which we have just debated <e> <s> like amendment no <e> <s> their purpose is to make it possible in my noble friends words to opt out of part <e>", "<cs> on behalf of the government i can of course plead guilty to dogmatic insistence <e> <s> it is the dogmatic insistence which lies at the heart of the bill that a trade unions governing body should be democratically accountable to the members <e> <s> this amendment would undermine the basis of that insistence of part i of the bill by allowing people who have not been elected in accordance with the basic and i may say very broad democratic principles in clause of the bill to vote on a unions governing body <e> <s> i insist on the breadth of these principles because i think there is an expert and subtle attempt by the noble lord lord wedderburn to imply a very wide and detailed intervention into the requirements for unions in this way <e> <s> our view is that it is essential that the bills requirements should apply quite simply to every voting member of a unions principal executive committee because these persons are the key day-to-day decision-makers in a trade union <e> <s> the way each and every one of these people casts his or her vote can have a profound effect on the lives and jobs of the unions members and can also have a profound effect on those of us in the wider community <e> <s> it is no good the noble lord lord wedderburn of charlton raising in this context the spectre of the in-house rules of whites or the garrick <e> <s> the fact is that the members of whites and the garrick do not control the lives and jobs either of the other members or of those of us who are not fortunate enough as is the case with me to belong to those great institutions <e> <s> it is therefore only reasonable <e>", "<cs> the committee and i would certainly be enormously relieved if the noble lord would address himself to the amendment <e>", "<cs> i did not introduce company law into this amendment or context <e> <s> this is an irrelevance <e>", "<cs> i am not trying to <e>", "<cs> at one point i have to confess that i was a little uncertain as to whether there was universal agreement about which amendments we were speaking to <e> <s> but i am assuming that we are speaking to amendments nos <e> <s> and in the name of the noble lord lord dean of beswick <e> <s> these amendments raise a very important question whether the bill should provide for indirect as well as direct elections to union governing bodies <e> <s> i certainly make no objection at all to noble lords opposite or to my noble friend lord beloff bringing this issue to our attention <e> <s> indeed i share a number of the concerns which have been put forward during the discussion of the amendment <e>", "<cs> i made it clear in my opening remarks to this amendment that i am objecting to indirect elections as a matter of general issue principle or historical event no more than anyone else <e> <s> what i am saying is that in the case of trade unions the <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is a don at oxford <e> <s> i spent long years in oxford having to suffer the rigours of what is called oxford philosophy <e> <s> he is not comparing like with like and is engaged in semantics which would have him drummed out of nuffield <e> <s> it simply will not do <e> <s> the activities nature and constitution of unions are not comparable to those of parliament and the role of parliament in our national life is not comparable to the role of unions in national life <e> <s> i am not arguing that the one is more important or better than the other at this stage <e> <s> i am talking about wholly disparate functions altogether <e>", "<cs> it is contentious to the trade union congress but it is not contentious to trade union members <e> <s> that is the very point of the bill <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the opportunity to clear up any such impression <e> <s> i dislike neither <e> <s> the point i was seeking to make was that a measure of this kind may be opposed by the trades union congress without being opposed by most members of trade unions <e> <s> that was the point i was seeking to make <e>", "<cs> i was most interested by the intervention of the noble lord lord houghton with all his experience <e> <s> that is why i rise rather quickly to deal with the points while they are fresh in the committees mind <e> <s> obviously i welcome what he said about his scepticism about anything being optional in this area <e> <s> since i do not want the optionality suggested by the previous amendments i very much welcome that <e>", "<cs> i shall set the record straight <e> <s> i did not study philosophy formally but i spent a lot of time reading it <e>", "<cs> again these amendments amendments nos <e> <s> and are concerned with allowing trade unions to exempt themselves from the bills requirements on union elections although in saying that i accept of course that these amendments propose that they should be able to do so only on the basis that the referendum of members be conducted by a secret postal ballot <e> <s> i can sympathise with the wish of the noble lords lord rochester lord aylestone and lord howie to ensure that if union members are to be given a choice as to whether the bill should apply to them then that choice should be a genuinely free and fair one <e> <s> but i do not think these amendments remove the governments fundamental objection to this proposal <e>", "<cs> if i may while it is fresh in the minds of the committee i shall take up the point made by my noble friend lord renton <e> <s> it might be helpful if i explained the meaning of subsection as its wording is of necessity rather more legalistic than most of the provisions in part i <e>", "<cs> it would be helpful to the committee if my noble friend could look into it and no doubt return to the matter if he feels that he should <e>", "<cs> i am not seeking to use this to sanctify as the noble lord puts it the bill <e> <s> i am seeking to say that an examination and scrutiny of practices committed by trade unions is overwhelmingly wanted by trade unionists themselves <e> <s> i would not call into account one ballot or a ballot of this nature if it were not part of a general tendency <e> <s> if it were not part of a general tendency it would not have been fewer than per cent <e> <s> of all trade unionists who voted at the last election who supported the labour party <e> <s> more than per cent <e> <s> supported <e>", "<cs> i am very sympathic with the noble lord lord wedderburn when he says that this is not the first time that he has had to open the batting after dinner and engage in what he described as postprandial amendments of a rather technical nature <e> <s> i think it gives rise to a wonderful image of his noble friends hogging it back there puffing away while the wretched noble lord wrestles with these arcane and difficult matters <e> <s> i accept that the noble lord has been trying to be helpful <e> <s> the amendment is concerned with opportunity to vote and in particular with protecting trade unions from the possibility of legal action for breaches of the statutory requirements in circumstances where they have used their best endeavours to prevent such breaches from occurring <e>", "<cs> well done <e>", "<cs> hear hear <e>", "<cs> i must congratulate most warmly my noble friend lord beloff who moved this amendment on the elegant and persuasive way in which he argued the case for postal ballots <e>", "<cs> hear hear <e>", "<cs> very cheerfully <e>", "<cs> my lords a document has come into my possession which seeks to place this debate in context <e>", "<cs> on the contrary my lords the government were correcting a long-standing anomaly <e>", "<cs> my lords the government

rather less than per cent <e> <s> i do not know how many are still employed <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the point put to the government by the noble lord deals with the question that i tried to deal with in the answer to the first supplementary which was that the government were simply correcting a long-standing anomaly <e> <s> no one has made the suggestion that the security services or bodies uniquely and solely engaged with security matters should have union representation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i quite agree with the noble and learned lord <e> <s> it was an imprecise use of language <e> <s> i meant sophistry <e>", "<cs> my lords with this small qualification that the government was correcting a long-standing anomaly i have considerable sympathy with the point put to the house by the noble lord <e> <s> the fact is that the industrial disruption suffered between and was in our view unnecessary as well as unpardonable <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding is that my noble friend is quite right <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments defence was as i implied earlier based on article of convention <e> <s> it seems to me that it would be very difficult to sustain the criticism of the freedom of association committee which is not a judicial body in the light of the ilos own ruling <e>", "<cs> my lords an additional posts have recently been allocated for the enhancement of preventive controls of both passengers and freight <e> <s> most of the extra staff will be uniformed <e> <s> their functions will include the gathering of intelligence so that operations against drug smuggling and other illegal activities can be targeted more accurately <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not accept that more uniformed staff are always likely to lead to more convictions <e> <s> the government share the noble lords anxiety about the increase in this traffic and i think that a flexible response including more intelligence gathering staff more contacts more staff working abroad and the like is very important if we are to obtain increased convictions <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether satisfied is

well <e>", "<cs> my lords i had heard this and the government are extremely concerned about the growth of traffic in what seems to me to be one of the worst crimes that human beings can commit <e> <s> my point is that we are increasing the numbers and therefore the expenditure of those who are dealing with it <e> <s> however that does not mean to say that there are not some staff economies available over the whole of hm customs and excise which also deals with many other issues <e>", "<cs> my lords i would need notice of that <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord bruce of donington

investigators dealing with drug smuggling is even higher <e> <s> for instance the number of full-time investigators based in london has risen from in to in and so on <e> <s> it is not good enough to present this kind of thing as some sort of cut <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall use our best endeavours to try and stem the horrific growth in this crime <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to say that i do not

approved on that occasion but we are not yet in a position to make known our conclusions <e> <s> i appreciate that the committee is understandably anxious to know the governments views but i trust that it will understand that such an important amendment also an amendment which as i suggested earlier by the admission of its proponents is not absolutely workable in its present form requires very careful consideration <e> <s> obviously we shall not take long over this matter <e> <s> i ask the committee to accept from me that this is a very major item on our agenda <e> <s> indeed i was working on it for some hours this morning <e>", "<cs> the point i was making as i believe the noble lord knows very well is that the enormous indeed awesome privilege of immunity in law from actions in tort involves certain obligations and responsibilities <e> <s> the other point i wish to make is that the ability of people to work may depend upon decisions whether economic decisions or decisions

called a trigger before enforcing the requirements of part i amendments nos <e> <s> and from the official opposition would provide that an individual who took his union to court would have to produce evidence either that his application was supported by his branch or section of the union or by members entitled to vote in the election about which he was complaining <e> <s> the other amendments nos

debating they must start from some sense of common actuality or some generally agreed premise <e> <s> to use what is in my case a rather unnatural sporting metaphor the noble lord lord mccarthy and i can either go hunting for <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord wedderburn wishes to employ me and the noble lord lord mccarthy wishes to kidnap me <e> <s> i had no idea that i was such a desirable property to the benches opposite <e> <s> the fact is that this group of amendments would remove from among the grounds on which a union would be liable in tort in the absence of a ballot acts of inducing someone to interfere with the performance of a contract <e> <s> the tort of inducing a person to interfere with the performance of a contract is established in case law <e> <s> immunity is provided by the trade union and labour relations act as amended <e> <s> the essence of the governments case is that we can see no reason for preserving that immunity where a union is not prepared to hold a ballot

order to shoot it down <e> <s> my noble friends are not assaulting the principle of the right of withdrawal of labour they are i think trying to test whether this attribute in our law might be defined in a rather different way <e> <s> however i see problems in the forms in which the amendment has been moved and i should like therefore to explain why the government do not feel able to support this new clause <e>", "<cs> not for the first time my noble friend lord campbell of alloway has brought us back to earth with some precision and common sense <e> <s> listening to the remarks of the noble lord lord wedderburn about there being something evil abroad in this part of the bill and to the comment of the noble lord lord graham that he shared the detestation felt by others towards the intention of clause it would be very easy to take our eyes off what clause actually does <e> <s> clause says something which i think most people would endorse as eminently reasonable and certainly in no sense an attack on the trade unions or on the unique privileges in law which allow them to <e>", "<cs> i did use the phrase consulted by ballot earlier and when i repeated consulted that was the context in which i did it <e> <s> i know that the noble lord lord mccarthy calls me a ballotomane a different province from my other job where i suppose i am a balletomane <e> <s> but be that as it may i think the central point stands <e> <s> most people want to be able to vote on issues which crucially affect their lives <e> <s> this is all that this part of the bill seeks to do <e> <s> i urge your lordships to support the clause and to reject any amendment which suggests that it does not stand part of the bill <e>", "<cs> we are now debating what has undoubtedly proved to be the most controversial feature of the trade union political funding system established by parliament in <e> <s> the respective merits of contracting in and contracting out have exercised the minds of politicians of all parties on many occasions since then <e> <s> as noble lords will know the arguments were rehearsed most recently only two months ago in another place <e> <s> there are many points i could make about the governments approach to this question <e> <s> i shall however try to keep to the fundamentals in view of the lateness of the hour and in view of the fact that only certain aspects of the whole issue have been put to us at this stage <e> <s> i should like to make it clear that we are in no doubt that the way in which the existing system of contracting out has been operated in the past has often failed to safeguard the right of union members not to pay the political levy if they do not want to <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mccarthy was admirably brief and succinct <e> <s> i have a long and splendid speech on this subject but i am not sure whether the committee would be particularly entranced if i delivered it at this stage <e> <s> i think that very wise words were said by the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby in connection with the whole issue of political funding and contracting in and out <e> <s> as i said earlier the government have had consultations with the tuc and the tuc has met the governments wishes at least at this preliminary moment in time <e> <s> so i think that perhaps it would be best to see how things run <e> <s> i am sure that this is not an issue which will rapidly disappear from the political economy <e>", "<cs> on the subject of parallelism i am sure that the noble lord would be one of the first to tease or challenge the government if one part of the bill were inconsistent with another <e> <s> in providing for ballots under part iii of the bill we were faced with a different situation than in parts i and ii as i am sure the noble lord is aware <e> <s> in parts i and ii of the bill we were in what might be described as a green field situation there was nothing on which we could build <e> <s> but the position with part iii was quite different because there already existed arrangements under the act for political fund ballots <e>", "<cs> i have to say that the government can see no justification for loans for political funds whose only purpose would be to enable the union to maintain their party political expenditure at levels above those for which their members have made provision <e> <s> subsection of the bill specifies three different categories of payments which may be made into political funds <e> <s> the first is sums representing contributions made to the fund by members of the union the second is sums representing contributions made to the fund by any person other than the union itself and the third category is property which accrues to the fund in the course of administering its assets interests dividends and rents for example <e>", "<cs> there is no objection from the government or from the conservative party whose views on the state funding of political parties are well known to unions making contributions to the labour party <e> <s> the objection is that there should be devices by which larger sums of money are contributed to the labour party or any political party than the members of the union wish <e>", "<cs> i apologise to your lordships committee <e> <s> i am feeling a little punch-drunk at this stage <e> <s> as i have already advised the committee in proposing amendment no <e> <s> the provisions of clause like most of the provisions in clause come into operation where a resolution has ceased to have effect <e> <s> that phrase needs to be clarified to ensure that both the clause and the clause provisions do not come into effect when an old resolution is replaced by a new one following a successful ballot <e> <s> the problem could be dealt with most succinctly by moving clause into clause thereby avoiding the necessity of repeating the new subsection <e>", "<cs> i am anxious to meet the noble lords case <e>", "<cs> the governments view is that the insertion of amendment no <e> <s> suggested by the noble lord would upset the delicate balance which has been achieved in the present definition and which in our view brings it as near as possible to the meaning of the current definition <e> <s> in our view it could push the definition too far in the other direction and could enable trade unions to finance communications which were overtly party political out of their general funds <e> <s> but it is clear that this is an issue which continues to give noble lords opposite particular concern <e> <s> we in turn are genuinely concerned not to go further than the act definition by restricting trade unions ability to function properly on behalf of their members <e> <s> we shall therefore consider what the noble lord has had to say most carefully and if we can detect any better way of expressing what is intended then we shall seek to do so <e> <s> that is the best i can do for the moment <e>", "<cs> the noble lords lord wedderburn and lord mccarthy deserve something for stamina if nothing else <e> <s> i congratulate both noble lords on a splendid effort throughout this long and often quite arduous committee stage <e>", "<cs> my lords no i cannot say when the trend will be reversed because the government do not accept as the noble lord and his party suggest that the government can control the overall level of unemployment in this country <e> <s> i may say that the noble lords party <e> <s> when in office were singularly unsuccessful in putting that into effect <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most interested in the noble baronesss supplementary question <e> <s> this very morning as a civil service minister i have been working on this issue of part-time posts which not exclusively but largely involve women <e> <s> it is not an easy issue <e> <s> many of the services required by the public need full-time workers <e> <s> however we are seeing that wherever possible we devolve jobs to people on a part-time basis <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the latter point would an unequivocal no <e> <s> it would in my view be an insane thing for the government to do <e> <s> employment is employment and unemployment is unemployment <e> <s> we are highly grateful for any employment we have at the moment in the western economies part-time of full-time <e>", "<cs> my lords not for the first time i am grateful for the perceptions about the very fundamental and in my judgment permanent changes that have taken place in the labour market which have been drawn to the attention of the house by the noble viscount <e> <s> in fact there is no evidence that women are suffering disproportionately from the problem that affects everyone <e> <s> the employment figures show that in june the number of men in work was per cent <e> <s> of the number working in june <e> <s> the corresponding figure for women working full time this includes the part-time issue was per cent <e> <s> while the number working part-time has actually increased in real terms <e> <s> while that is of no satisfaction to women who are seeking jobs and who are not able to find them the overall picture is not as gloomy as the question suggests <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for her point of clarification <e> <s> it is a little wide of the original question <e> <s> i shall look at it and let her know <e>", "<cs> my lords i have two points to make about this <e> <s> the first is the statistical one <e> <s> i am aware of the aridity of statistics in relation to individual suffering <e> <s> however from this dispatch box one has to look at the picture overall <e> <s> there is no statistical <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree wholly with my noble friend <e> <s> there are knock-on effects for people working in traditional areas of female employment <e> <s> the fact is that each day the coal strike continues jobs go out of the economy not simply for the duration of the coal strike but permanently <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said on many occasions the only way in which any government can create permanent sustainable employment is for this country to become more competitive both internationally and domestically <e> <s> it is to that end that the governments policies are precisely directed <e> <s> anything else would be purely short term as the record of the labour government demonstrates <e>", "<cs> my lords i would be the first to agree that much needs to be done in this country <e> <s> usually at this point in questions about unemployment there are suggestions that the government should put more money into capital expenditure <e> <s> however in relation to the original question on the order paper there are very few female jobs in most large-scale capital construction projects <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> we are trying to encourage people to get the basic training to allow them to have a far wider series of choices than did their predecessors <e> <s> that as i think the noble baroness will be aware is a general and encouraging trend in the economy <e> <s> young men and women have a greater range of choice if they get such training <e> <s> that is why training is so important <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite clear of the point that the noble lord lord leatherland is making <e> <s> sometimes from that corner of the house there come suggestions that the overall employment picture would be better if women did not go out to work <e> <s> that is the view that i have consistently and from personal experience resisted <e>", "<cs> my lords when i was a minister at the department of employment i looked carefully at opportunities for job-sharing <e> <s> they exist and as a minister in the civil service i have tried to encourage them <e> <s> i am afraid that job-sharing can only help probably at the margin <e> <s> it might interest the noble baroness to know that the overwhelming number of new jobs being created in the american economy are through very small businesses and through the franchising to small businesses of business arrangements created by larger businesses <e> <s> it seems to me that this is a most profitable and encouraging direction which we should follow <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> the government believe that it is one of the benefits of the bills more easily understandable definition of political objects that the reference to statutory objects has been removed <e> <s> in any event as your lordships know from last nights debates on amendments nos <e> <s> and the new definition adopts an entirely fresh approach to meetings and communications which avoids the need for a statutory object type of qualification <e>", "<cs> it really is rather difficult to understand the bloodcurdling threats of the noble lord because he is not comparing like with like at all <e> <s> as i understand it there is no objection from a political party such as the conservative party and i am well aware that i am not talking for the conservative party at this box that is opposed to state funding of political parties that there should be donations to the labour party any more than there is objection that there should be donations to the conservative party <e> <s> the difference of view between the noble lord and ourselves is a difference conditioned not by our party allegiances but by very large sociological changes in this society whereby trade union members are not necessarily any longer affiliated to the party which in the noble lords words they spawned <e> <s> things have changed <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that at the last general election a clear majority of trade unionists voted for parties which were not the labour party <e> <s> this therefore is a misplaced criticism on the part of the noble lord lord dean of beswick <e>", "<cs> perhaps i could just finish the point <e> <s> i am saying this as a man who not only works for a government formed under our system from a political party but from the point of view of a citizen albeit a disenfranchised one very passionately of the view that there should not be state-funding of political parties <e> <s> therefore <e> <s> i am very keen on political parties being funded by political funds <e>", "<cs> perhaps i could just deal with this point and then i shall willingly give way to the noble baroness <e> <s> as i said in opening my remarks the clause which we have been debating stemmed from a need identified in the green paper to bring the definition of political objects up to date in a number of respects <e> <s> i seem to remember that i was still in the department when this green paper was being designed and consultations were constantly called for and very few came forward <e>", "<cs> the government simply do not accept collectively and again i say that i do not accept personally that the noble baroness is comparing like with like <e> <s> companies do not control the lives of those who have shares in them <e>", "<cs> this is a classic instance of why the closed shop is so venal <e>", "<cs> i was referring to their shareholders <e> <s> their shareholders are free beings who can buy or sell the shares at whim <e> <s> indeed the labour party quite sensibly owns large numbers of shares in companies that make contributions to the conservative party <e> <s> i cannot understand what the noble lord is fussed about <e>", "<cs> it is very seldom that the noble baroness lady seear and i have such sharp disagreements but may i respectfully say to her on this issue that she is wholly wrong <e> <s> the fact of the matter is as i have said at this dispatch box this evening several times that i make no objection whatever either as an individual or as a minister to trade unions making contributions to the labour party or indeed to the party which the noble baroness so ably leads <e> <s> i am objecting to their doing so out of their general funds <e>", "<cs> a company is perfectly free to give money to the conservative party the liberal party the sdp or the labour party <e> <s> noble lords who have been involved in this territory of political organisations as many of us have will be aware that companies give money to all of these parties <e> <s> indeed the labour party has consistently had good contributions from companies until in recent years it went off its onion <e> <s> as a result the noble lord and the benches on which he sits have been the beneficiaries <e> <s> that is why so many members of a previous government have joined them <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to delay the committee on this but we again are not in my judgment making the proper comparisons <e> <s> if the committee were politically cynical it might say that the interests of the conservative party and certainly many commentators have made this point would be served by reinforcing the electoral rump of the labour party at the expense of that interesting new phenomenon on the political scene the alliance <e> <s> the idea that it is in the interests of the conservative party to clobber the labour partys funding is grotesque <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord rochester who could hardly be described as either mad or behind me for the support that he has given me on this amendment <e> <s> it seems to me extraordinary that the noble lord lord mccarthy should defend the present state of the law <e> <s> i must ask him why people should have to ask for refunds and why should not contracting out mean what people think it means <e>", "<cs> if i may in the interests of getting on i shall not deal with the issues of part i because the noble lord lord mccarthy has very fairly said that the government recognise that it would be unrealistic to expect unions to make changes overnight <e> <s> that in a nutshell is why subject to any further considerations which may be occasioned by our response to the amendment of my noble friend lord beloff it is our intention to introduce part i by a commencement order so that it takes effect a little over a year after royal assent <e> <s> that will provide the necessary time for unions to bring their arrangements into line with what part i of the bill requires <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord barnett is a little disingenuous <e> <s> he understands these aggregates perfectly well as he was chief secretary when they were first introduced <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that the united states are fortunate in being able to expand their economy internally at the expense of what the rest of us have to suffer and this is part of the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords again that is a nice try by the noble and learned lord because the government of which he was a luminary to their great credit introduced these methods of monetary measurement <e> <s> they are now the common currency of all governments around the world and broadly speaking if we get our calculations on this front too far wrong and they are complex and difficult we soon suffer whatever our political interests or tendencies from very adverse effects <e>", "<cs> my lords it is my experience that ministers try to master these matters <e> <s> the difficulty is that there has been considerable controversy within the trade if i may so describe it as to which particular altimeter one should watch at which particular time <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that it is a little simplistic to say that all private borrowing is unproductive <e> <s> obviously those people who are the beneficiaries of individuals borrowing and the changes in their spending patterns as a result of the borrowing would not take that view at all <e> <s> many of those who so benefit are of course corporations building societies the construction industry and the rest <e> <s> however it is certainly true that one would wish for an emphasis on corporate borrowing <e> <s> one of the reasons why the government try to keep their own borrowing down is so that business interests will be encouraged to borrow <e>", "<cs> my lords the current movements in the exchange rate particularly against the dollar indicate more about the management of the american economy which the united states can to some degree handle in a manner which is disadvantageous to the rest of us or to many european economies <e> <s> that is a slightly different question <e> <s> as to my breath being taken away i am old enough in the game now to cease to be surprised at the difference between ministers in government and ministers in opposition <e>", "<cs> my lords we continue to give high priority to policies designed to encourage lower interest rates <e> <s> maintaining sound monetary conditions is the best way to ensure a downward trend in inflation and interest rates over the medium term <e> <s> but interest rates are bound to fluctuate if we are to keep control of monetary growth <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that after the milk of moderation of the noble lord lord mccarthy and the milk and water of the noble lord lord howie of troon we have had a slightly stronger brew to cheer us up from the noble lord lord wedderburn <e>", "<cs> my lords i will give way in a moment <e>", "<cs> my lords no one doubts the right to withdraw labour but i would remind the noble lord that it is not the commercial companies of this country that are presently disrupting its industrial recovery <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord mccarthy and to his noble friend lord howie of troon for reminding us that with these amendments we are once again concerned with the proposition that not all voting members of a unions principal executive committee should be subject to the bills election requirements <e> <s> in saying that i appreciate that the noble lord <e> <s> lord beswick who moved the amendment unlike the noble lord lord mccarthy who was seeking to widen the principle was looking for an exemption for a limited and specific range of executive members <e> <s> he made a very good case indeed if i may say so and it was obviously a case that impressed itself on my noble friend lord campbell of alloway <e>", "<cs> we owe it to them to ensure that the bill gives as many trade unionists as possible a practical opportunity to cast their votes in union elections <e>", "<cs> that is perfectly clear in the manifesto and it is perfectly clear what this legisation is about it is about the actual casting of votes and we owe it to the trade unionists of this country to give them the full protection of the law against intimidation and malpractice <e> <s> my lords i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a very considerable debate on this issue on two occasions in committee and on report and my sense of the feeling of your lordships house though i am very much in the hands of the house is that your lordships would now like to proceed towards a conclusion <e> <s> i have to say that i do not think i have ever taken part in a series of debates which has been so interesting in this particular field of industrial relations law <e> <s> i think that the noble lord lord houghton who is one of the members of your lordships house who through my listening to him has taught me most about this field is a little too gloomy <e> <s> he says that the trade union movement is hostile to this legislation and so it may not stick but he added his own qualification when he said at least so far as the leadership is concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords we have not imposed this duty <e> <s> it can be any address supplied by the member including the address of the place of work <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble lord <e> <s> my original brief said amendments nos <e> <s> to inclusive but i see that i have put in my bad handwriting beside it that there should be a separate debate on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it might be for the convenience of the house if we are to have a debate on amendment no <e> <s> that the house should now adjourn for supper <e> <s> i therefore beg to move that further consideration of the bill on report be adjourned for three-quarters of an hour <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord wedderburn is one of the two or three people in the country i would say who are most interested and most expert in industrial relations law <e> <s> this is one of the reasons why it is always a pleasure to listen to him and i always find it instructive <e> <s> but like a lot of experts he does i think sometimes fail to see the wood for the trees <e> <s> i have listened very carefully to him and it seems to me that he has failed to take account of a very fundamental point <e>", "<cs> my lords the point of the certification officer is to get a sensible settlement out of the court so to say but this legislation does not propose to make the certification officer into a kind of judge <e> <s> i do not think the noble lord with his deep knowledge and reverence for the traditions of the trade union movement would want the certification officer turned into a kind of judge <e> <s> as i said the officer may make a declaration but only the court can make an order against the union <e> <s> what the certification officer finds has to be taken into account by the court <e> <s> that is no great novel precedent <e>", "<cs> my lords there is nothing wrong if i may say so with the noble lords memory where union practice or industrial relations law is concerned but i think that while that is certainly the case he does misunderstand this point <e> <s> one can use phrases like court of first instance and so on which are rather intimidating but in practical life we all know that we sometimes appeal to a third party to try to sort out matters <e> <s> this third party is not a novel figure invented by the government and suddenly imposed upon the unions <e> <s> this is not the industrial relations court in the act or the rest of it <e> <s> this is a reasonably familiar figure the certification officer <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not see that the situation would be at all problematic here <e> <s> of course the trade union can defend itself if the members take it to the high court <e> <s> we can all go to the high court <e>", "<cs> what is the problem <e> <s> i may be very dense but i do not quite see the difficulty being presented to me by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i accept that some of these arguments are complex and part of the purpose of report stage is that we should all sleep on things look at the text and see whether we can resolve our differences without dare i say it <e> <s> even getting so far as to appeal to the certification officer <e> <s> but in fact i again feel that the noble lord lord wedderburn is somewhat snowing us with expertise and complexity where none is needed <e>", "<cs> my lords giving comfort and avoiding litigation are among my major aims in life <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord withdraws the amendment i am one of those most eager that he does so i really think that for <e>", "<cs> and that there will be confusion <e> <s> his point is that the unions will be confused that there will be confusion within them as to whether branches or sections are or are not covered by the legislation <e> <s> that is what i find wholly unreal <e> <s> the reality is that in the vast majority of cases the practical test of whether some particular part of a trade union is itself a trade union is quite simple <e> <s> it is whether it is listed as such by the certification officer <e>", "<cs> let me finish the point and then the noble lord can get up again <e> <s> the vast majority of sections and branches of trade unions are not listed as trade unions because they have not applied to be listed <e> <s> they have not applied because they know and the members of branches and sections concerned know that they do not meet the statutory definition <e> <s> but the position is different in those sections of trade unions that retain a substantial degree of separate organisation and which in practice have separate executives and bargain directly with employers <e> <s> where such organisations meet the statutory definition of a trade union it is clearly right that part i of the bill should apply to them irrespective of whether they happen to have chosen to seek listing by the certification officer <e> <s> i do not think there is really so much difference between the noble lord and myself as he is seeking to claim <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know anything about the clydesdale bank section of astms and the noble lord would not expect me to <e> <s> the simple fact of the matter is that if it is engaged in the business of representing its members in negotiation with employers and if it is elected by its members to do this it will be covered by the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords without prejudice if i may use that term i will look into the point which the noble lord has made which may be well founded <e> <s> perhaps we can return to it at a later stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to say that i rather doubt whether there will be immense practical difficulties standing in the way of compliance with the balloting provisions of the bill <e> <s> as the noble lord has told us balloting provisions are subject to tests of reasonable practicability <e> <s> the provision of a voting paper and of a convenient voting opportunity to every member entitled to vote does not seem to me to present enormous difficulties <e> <s> the requirement that voters should incur no direct cost to themselves seems to me to be fairly easy to ascertain <e> <s> as regards the arrangements to secure the secrecy of the ballot one would not need to be an immense expert in this field to satisfy oneself that those provisions were there <e> <s> i should not have thought that it would be a very sophisticated judgment to decide that all those aspects could be reasonably and practicably seen to <e>", "<cs> my lords amendment no <e> <s> would have the effect of reverting to the position before the governments committee stage amendments whereby a trade union could be held liable for interference or constraint imposed by a third party <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> would impose a statutory duty on all persons including employers not to interfere with or constrain union members ability to vote <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i may not be able to satisfy him but i might be able to reduce his disappointment to some degree because my advice is that as a result of what he suggests i may need look again at the wording of the regulations on funding of ballots <e> <s> i am sure that that is <e>", "<cs> my lords whatever the differences between us i think that all of us in parliament are something of a family and there is nothing that a family more enjoys than a nice squabble about money <e> <s> i myself must hesitate to draw your lordships attention to my opinions on this issue <e> <s> i am sure that then others would jump up and we could prolong this agreeable squabble through most of the night <e> <s> i think that the fact of the matter is a simple one but i cannot i think come to it without drawing the attention of the house to a genuine and unusual phenomenon of political change which has taken place <e> <s> if one looks at these committee and report stages of the bill and if one wants to read the fiercest speeches against trade union practices and procedures on this and many other issues one finds them coming not from my noble friends or myself but from previous ministers in labour administrations <e> <s> i simply draw that to the attention of your lordships for what it is worth <e>", "<cs> that is precisely why i drew the houses attention to the point <e> <s> but i had in mind not only the previous chief whip and the previous <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding was that i would speak to amendments nos <e> <s> and together together with amendment no <e> <s> which is purely consequential to nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> all these amendments are concerned with the revised definition of political objects in clause <e> <s> may i not speak to them and then noble lords can pick and choose which of my remarks they wish to oppose <e> <s> i am sure that they will find something if they look hard enough <e> <s> amendments nos <e> <s> and have been tabled in response to concerns expressed by noble lords opposite during the committee stage in fact i do not think that they will able to find anything however hard they try <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord wedderburn criticised me and the noble lord lord dean of beswick was grateful to me <e> <s> this is the classic softening-up technique of the tough cop who makes way for the nice one who praises you and will offer tea and a cigarette <e> <s> i suppose that i am very easily disarmed <e> <s> on the points raised by the noble lord lord wedderburn it was simply because of the uncertainty of the phrase in connection with the candidature that the government felt that it was necessary to spell out that the balance on how to cast union votes at elections to political office was covered <e> <s> the aim was simply to make matters clearer and perhaps to avoid the difficulty that that admirable assistant secretary once found himself in <e>", "<cs> my lords these amendments would have been the natural corollary to amendment no <e> <s> which we debated earlier <e> <s> had it been decided to change the political levy from contracting out to contracting in it would have been entirely logical to consider what adjustments were needed in the provision dealing with the collection of the levy by means of the employer check-off <e> <s> in the absence of such a change the amendments take on a different character <e> <s> they would as the noble lord lord mccarthy has implied have the effect of introducing contracting in by the back door so to speak for the majority of trade union members probably about per cent <e> <s> who pay their union subscriptions through the check-off <e>", "<cs> i think the answer is a simple one and it is not a question of being a trade-off between logic and generosity <e> <s> the ballots in this bill are a new statutory requirement and as my honourable friend the parliamentary under-secretary mr clark said in standing committee in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not see that that would do anything other than establish the principle on a more limited basis than the noble lord would like but which i would say is unjustified <e> <s> as i argued in my original statement we are trying to deal with a new statutory requirement here we are trying to meet the costs of it we are trying to encourage a move towards personal ballots and all are covered by the provision of funds <e> <s> but to give the kind of open-ended commitment for all kinds of political activity on central taxpayers money would seem to me to be misplaced <e>", "<cs> my lords i dealt during the debate on amendments nos <e> <s> and with the suggestion by the noble lord lord mccarthy that trade unions will have practical difficulties in complying with part ii of the bill within two months of royal assent <e> <s> i believe that the house was convinced by what i said earlier that the balloting provisions could be complied with if trade unions so chose without inordinate difficulty <e>", "<cs> my lords i see the logic of what the noble lord is saying but i do not think he is admitting the logic of what i have been saying <e> <s> here are a number of unions which have ballots <e> <s> where trade union rules require ballots or give a discretion for them to be held surely there is no situation in undy and martin or elsewhere which is incompatible with <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord wedderburn said in his usual beguiling way that he was bringing forward at the end of the evening a modest proposal <e> <s> unfortunately for him i am an irishman and i am an admirer of that great high tory <e>", "<cs> my lords we are just finishing the report stage so the noble lords last point is a little confusing <e> <s> perhaps he meant third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite clear if the noble lord wants me to explain to the house why the bill does not extend to northern ireland <e> <s> is that right <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very happy to do that <e> <s> this simply follows the precedents of our earlier employment legislation <e> <s> it is the practice of the secretary of state for northern ireland to consult with the industrial partners in the province before deciding whether to extend the provisions there <e> <s> this has not yet been done in the case of the act <e>", "<cs> my lords again i have the disadvantage of not being learned like my noble friend but that is my understanding yes <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe and it will come as no surprise to the house that the logic of my noble friend lord de la warr is inescapable and is certainly shared by the government <e> <s> the two amendments complement one another <e> <s> the amendment to clause that is amendment no <e> <s> brings the duty to compile a register into effect on the date of royal assent <e> <s> that is the beginning of the <e>", "<cs> my lords with this amendment we return once again to the question of whether part i of the bill should apply to all trade unions save for certain federations which is the position as the bill is drafted or only to certain trade unions <e> <s> in particular the amendment now before us would exempt from the whole of part i of the bill trade union branches which meet the statutory definition of a trade union <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened most carefully to what the noble lord lord wedderburn said in moving the amendment and the support which he received from the noble and learned lord lord denning as well as the noble baroness <e> <s> but i must say that i am still a little bit puzzled as to why we should be seeking as the amendment does to provide a specific right of appeal against what is a non-enforceable declaration <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord wedderburn <e> <s> i simply feel that he has not dealt with the central point of my argument namely that we are not dealing with the certification officer in a judicial position here he has no enforcing powers <e> <s> we are dealing with him if you like as an honest broker <e> <s> if he cannot perform his job of providing a quick and cheap out-of-court settlement by getting the parties together there is no need to have this mechanism of appeal <e> <s> the noble lord is confusing the role of the certification officer in the acts with which he was concerned and which remain on the statute book with the role being suggested for him i should have thought rather practically and sensibly in the case of elections <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may make a comment which might give the noble lord lord houghton some comfort <e> <s> it really is the case that if a union felt desperately aggrieved by a declaration by the certification officer and of course the noble lord lord houghton understands the position in which i was casting the certification officer of trying to achieve a quick speedy and inexpensive solution in the context of elections as against his other jobs despite the fact that the certification officer had not ordered it to take any remedial action because he is not so empowered to do the union could of course apply to the courts for judicial review <e>", "<cs> my lords i was saying only that in my view the noble lord lord wedderburn has blown this question out of all proportion <e> <s> if the house considers the remarks that i made in my opening speech it will come to that view <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the certification officer is available to give good counsel <e>", "<cs> my lords the proposition advanced by the noble lord lord mccarthy in this amendment is that each and every union which does not already have a political fund should be allowed one free go at establishing such a fund <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e> <s> it is in the nature of our proceedings in committee and on report that most of the running is made so to say by noble lords opposite <e> <s> for the most part it is their amendments we debate and that means we are obliged quite rightly to dwell on technicalities and points of detail <e> <s> the virtue of the debate on third reading is that it enables us to lift our gaze from the fine print of the bill and remind ourselves of its underlying purpose and of the abuses it is designed to tackle <e>", "<cs> well my lords i understood that professor ben roberts was recommended to him <e> <s> be that as it may he is an admirable read <e> <s> on page of his book <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down is he really saying that the situation in the mines has anything to do with the government <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i was going to say something on this aspect in my very brief winding-up speech but i shall make the point now <e> <s> as the house is well aware these provisions from on and the step-by-step approach which the noble lord lord houghton told us about are in the field of civil law <e> <s> i have absolutely no doubt whatsoever that civil remedies will be taken as a result of some of the actions we have seen in recent weeks <e>", "<cs> my lords as so often the noble lord lord wedderburn tempts me <e> <s> the noble lord lord houghton made a speech of such wide ranging and general interest about trade union matters that it would be attractive to go on debating some of the wider issues <e> <s> however i think it is the feeling of the house that we should bring the proceedings on this bill to a fairly rapid close and i shall resist these temptations <e>", "<cs> my lords gas safety is an enormously important issue as my noble friend argues <e> <s> that is why i welcome the transfer of responsibility for nearly all the issues affecting gas safety to the health and safety executive which has a very good record in the enforcement of health and safety requirements <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that

language we are returning the family silver to the family and i think the gesture is far overdue <e>", "<cs> my lords again i cannot feel great concern about this since capital markets are there to deliver profits <e> <s> but the fact is that when privatisation takes place all relevant factors need to be considered <e> <s> one has to get the right balance between the immediate needs of the taxpayer and the longer term benefits which in my view are well worth paying for of returning public industries to the public <e>", "<cs> my lords the issue of parliamentary debate is not for me <e>

assumption <e> <s> he equates the assets of the state with the state <e> <s> i equate the assets of the state with those who hold them right across the economy <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the best way to help the long-term unemployed lies in winning orders for british business and industry both at home and abroad <e> <s> a stable financial climate increased competitiveness and greater productivity offer the best guarantee of sustainable growth in output and therefore in jobs <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say that i am rather sorry that the noble lord charges me with repeating a stock answer because i composed that answer myself and have not seen it given in your lordships house before <e> <s> it might interest the noble lord lord dean of beswick and the house that someone close to the noble lords party politically the new prime minister of france has said that the chief reason for modernising the economy in france is to win the battle for jobs that any real improvement in unemployment has to come through economic competitiveness and growth and that the unemployment battle is likely to be difficult and prolonged <e> <s> i find myself very much in agreement with what m fabius the french prime minister has said <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is as so often wholly right <e> <s> the fact is that in a difficult international climate and a climate that is liable to remain difficult every time we score an own goal we lose more jobs than goals <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is very important that compassion begins at home and in the pocket <e> <s> one of the best ways that we can all exercise compassion towards the long-term unemployed is to be modest in our own claims on the total share of resources particularly those of us who work in the public sector <e> <s> i do not accept that the outlook is as bleak as the noble lord suggests because the employed labour force in great britain is estimated to have increased by in the first quarter of this year <e> <s> this follows an increase of in the fourth quarter of <e> <s> it is the fourth consecutive quarterly increase and if as i said earlier we only abstain from scoring own goals there is no reason why that increase should not continue <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord rochester is certainly right that one of the great justifications of the community programme is that it exists not only to try to help the community through the work that is done in the interests of the community to improve the infrastructure and the like but also to help mainly that third of the long-term unemployed who are under <e> <s> that is why it is a valuable programme and an important part of the governments efforts to deal with this very difficult problem <e> <s> to help the other two-thirds of the long-term unemployed as i have said to the noble lord and the house over the long-term we really have to get greater output greater competitiveness and growth <e> <s> it is impossible i think to provide ameliorating programmes to the extent that we should all like <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall spend some of this afternoon as i am sure will the house trying to come to the same conclusion as my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is certainly true that there will continue to be a loss of jobs and a <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of such exchanges <e> <s> indeed when i was the minister in the department of employment concerned with these issues we wished to move towards greater training in the youth employment programmes rather than palliative measures <e> <s> i think all sides of the house would agree that the youth training scheme has been relatively successful in that regard <e>", "<cs> my lords i have considerable sympathy for the suggestion made by the noble lord lord kilmarnock <e> <s> however i think that in a nutshell the extent of the problem is that people want us for the best of motives to do more but the act of doing more would deny others the resource they may need <e> <s> my advice is that the cost of what the noble lord suggests <e> <s> would be closer to million and if i heard the noble lord aright that would not i think be a cost-effective way of tacking this problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble lord <e> <s> i took him to suggest that we should <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that words such as despair and dustbin do not improve morale and morale is very important as we all know when one is looking for work <e> <s> the noble viscount lord st davids is quite right to draw our attention to the fact that britain has to be a very successful economy indeed to provide employment given our resources for as many as per cent <e> <s> of the work force bearing in mind that the work force is large <e> <s> but we want to be more successful still and we want to solve as others do this awful problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i am always prepared to consider proposals as are my colleagues <e> <s> further i am always prepared to support proposals to deal with this problem and even proposals which involve additional public spending so long as noble lords wherever they sit or honourable or right honourable members wherever they sit suggest exactly what we should cut in order to provide additional resources <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i must be very cautious about any comments from this box on procedures of any kind in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords it is precisely for that reason that it is if i may say so always lacking in responsibility to suggest that there is some easy way of dealing with this problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear that the theory that there is a fixed body of jobs in the economy and that once one person vacates a job another person fills it is not the view of most experts in the labour market today <e>", "<cs> my lords the government welcome this report as a contribution to the debate on public expenditure in the longer term <e> <s> we will consider the detailed proposals but it is important to note the emphasis given by the cbi to demonstrating that projects yield a satisfactory return <e> <s> also the cbis proposals are not intended to divert the government from their aims of reducing inflation still further and holding down public spending as a whole <e>", "<cs> my lords in the government halted the massive cuts made by the previous government in trunk road spending <e>

unit labour costs and in the removal of obstacles to the free functioning of markets not by a wholesale increase in investments which inevitably would have to be financed by higher taxation and higher interest rates <e> <s> we have a big programme at present and i should be delighted to <e>", "<cs> my lords there will indeed be a well-thought-out and considered response but it is important to realise i think that there already is a large capital programme not on roads alone but roads form a substantial part of it <e> <s> you do not necessarily add to employment by indulging in extended programmes unless you are quite clear how to pay for them <e> <s> i have cited before i apologise for using the example again but the noble lord will be aware of it that northern ireland has had a great deal of capital spending and relatively few sustained jobs have come out of that programme <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the way to tackle roads in the modern economy is steadily and within the resources that are available to finance them <e>", "<cs> my lords in a number of fields we are trying to build on the work initiated by my noble friend lady young not least on the question of forms and making them easier for all of us to understand <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to be able to tell the noble lord and the house that customs and excise have been carefully ordering their priorities so as to maximise the deployment of resources on the investigation and prevention of drug traffic <e> <s> this year a further staff are to he deployed at ports and airports to enhance preventive control <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i see no sign of recruitment not being satisfactory in view of the lower manpower targets that we have now achieved and the manpower targets that we are still aiming to achieve <e>", "<cs> my lords the customs and excise are very seized of the urgency of the investigation and prevention of drug smuggling <e> <s> there is no question of resources being denied to them for this end <e>", "<cs> my lords there have been some increases of staff in a number of fields not least in the customs and excise as i said to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for what my noble friend has said and i am glad to use the opportunity of her supplementary question to remind the house that these very substantial savings have been achieved by civil servants themselves <e> <s> in my experience after a year as civil service minister morale is high and the programme is being carried forward with a will <e>", "<cs> my lords i will draw the points that the noble lord has made to the attention of the home department <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give the noble lord numbers once people have left the civil service or are engaged in the private sector but it is certainly the case that the net savings of some million in a full year as a result of the manpower exercise is a net figure and takes into account the costs that have been transferred to the private sector <e>", "<cs> my lords these staff savings have been achieved in the usual way by voluntary retirement or natural wastage <e> <s> as i said in answer to an earlier supplementary the quality and calibre of young people coming forward as applicants to the civil service are very good and we shall of course take as many as we are able to afford <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the noble lord is well aware that the problems of unemployment cannot be solved by swelling the public sector <e> <s> in fact the result would be the very opposite <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords it is indeed the policy of the government to shift the burden of taxes from direct to indirect taxation <e> <s> naturally one cannot tell what the future will bring but as i said to the noble baroness and the house the government have no intention at present of imposing vat on young childrens clothing <e>", "<cs> my lords the government also have no plans at present to impose vat on books <e>", "<cs> my lords the present goes on until it comes to an end <e>", "<cs> my lords i am an irishman and i could point out to the noble baroness to the house and indeed to my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer that a government in ireland fell recently over this issue <e>", "<cs> my lords my original answer referred to young children <e> <s> i assume that young children are pre-adolescent <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> i shall answer this point at length when i wind up but while this point is fresh in the minds of the house i must tell the noble lord that there is no evidence whatsoever of any shortage of investment capital in this country for profitable activity <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for giving way but this is an extemely important point <e> <s> when he took me to task in the earlier stages of the debate with the fact that the law was not being used his implication was that the law was not being used at all <e> <s> the noble lords implication has now changed <e> <s> he accepts that the law is being used by some independent sector industries against the national union of mineworkers so he will see that the law is in fact being used <e> <s> he is now asking why the nationalised industries are not making use of the law <e> <s> at that stage i said that the essence of civil law was its voluntary character as distinct as we all know from the criminal law which we all have to obey that it is up to the coal board to decide whether to seek injunctions from the courts and the rest in this instance <e> <s> i also said that i had no doubt at all that if the situation deteriorated this and other industries would decide it might well be in their interests to go to law <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord bruce of donington could best be described as a robust bourbon <e> <s> in his years membership as he described it of the labour party he has not learned a great deal and he has forgotten very little <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg the pardon of the noble lord he is even more bourbonesque than i expected <e> <s> he may have forgotten very little and he may not have learned very much but he delivers his views with robustness good humour and a great deal <e>", "<cs> my lords august <e> <s> it has seemed a longer july than usual and i do not want to extend it artificially <e> <s> i shall simply deal as best i can with some of the points that have been made <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure we could all think of those <e> <s> but as the noble lord knows in the coal industry with which he is profoundly familiar and i welcomed nearly everything he had to say in his remarkable speech about the tragedy facing the coal industry at present the immense volume of spending by the government denies resources to other industries which may need capital projects <e> <s> we have to tailor the capital spending that we all want to the resources that we have <e>", "<cs> international comparisons are only available in terms of the oecd statistic total outlays of government <e> <s> as a percentage of gdp outlays of national and local government combined are as follows <e> <s> the figures relate to the latest year for which comparisons have been published <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend lord young and myself i am most grateful for the kind remarks of the noble lord <e> <s> it certainly would be very difficult given the representation of disabled people within your lordships house and given the connection of my noble friend and myself with the msc for us to dodge any responsibilities where the disabled are concerned <e> <s> i recognise that the noble lord lord henderson would like to see the legislation amended <e> <s> we believe it would be wrong to pre-empt any decisions until we have had the mscs advice but i should emphasise that the commission has been asked by my right honourable friend to look at ways of improving the effectiveness of the quota scheme within the existing legislative framework <e>", "<cs> my lords i again thank my noble friend for his remarks <e> <s> he shows great wisdom in his supplementary question <e> <s> the british are anxious to cope and help people who are less well off than the majority <e> <s> i am sure that is the best way forward <e> <s> as a result we have asked the msc to look at ways of improving the position for the disabled including the mentally disabled within the existing legislative framework <e>", "<cs> my lords again i am grateful to the noble lord for his kind personal remarks <e> <s> i think that the measure of our sincerity and the measure of our anxiety about the position of the disabled cannot be adduced only by legislative provision <e> <s> the best thing is to try to help disabled people improve their situation <e> <s> i know as the minister who was once responsible that the msc had this very much in mind <e> <s> i am glad to be able to tell the house that at a time of very severe dfficulties in the employment scene sheltered employment and other provisions for disabled people has kept pace <e> <s> i have to confess that i am something of a sceptic about whether legislation is always the best way forward <e> <s> i repeat that the msc has been asked to look at ways of improving the situation within the present legislative position <e> <s> however if further legislation will really do the job we would not rule it out <e>", "<cs> my lords as i suggested in my earlier answer to a supplementary question the real trouble with the act is to some degree a problem of success <e> <s> disabled people have felt themselves more integrated with society at large than perhaps they did at that time <e> <s> as a result they are more reluctant than they were then to treat themselves as a special or specially handicapped group <e> <s> they simply require society to take some account of relatively minor difficulties <e> <s> they want to be treated as ordinary people <e> <s> that is one of the reasons why the quota act of is somewhat unrealistic in that disabled people are not registering themselves under it <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that it is quite as disappointing as the noble baroness makes out because strictly speaking we are already a member of the ems <e> <s> we contribute per cent <e> <s> of our gold and dollar reserves to the european monetary co-operation fund and we participate in realignment conferences <e> <s> the pound is also included as a component of the european currency unit <e> <s> sterling does not participate in the exchange rate mechanism because as a petro-currency it rises and falls with oil prices while other community currencies do precisely the opposite <e>", "<cs> no my lords i dare not <e> <s> as i said i think that the time is not ripe mainly because our currency unlike the european currencies is linked to the rise and fall in oil prices <e>", "<cs> my lords i am rather entranced by my noble friends suggestion that he is a congenital waiverer about anything <e> <s> it is certainly the case that membership of the exchange rate mechanism does not provide immunity from the effects of dollar strength on european currencies <e> <s> experience suggests that when the dollar shifts significantly downwards then the exchange rate mechanism comes under strong <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the point i made in my first supplementary to the noble baroness is the one that the noble lord lord obrien with all his experience in these matters could perhaps take notice of that we are already a very considerable participator in the european monetary system <e> <s> the difficulty and the argument is about our participation in the exchange rate mechanism <e> <s> it is not i think so much a question that this will be out of issue that it will not be possible while we have oil assets <e> <s> it will be more a question of europe perhaps coming in line with a currency system that is less linked to oil assets <e>", "<cs> my lords it was in fact in your lordships house in november of last year that the government gave their most recent and fully authoritative view of this position in a debate which enjoyed the maiden speech of the noble lord lord barnett <e> <s> that was the point at which my predecessor my noble friend lord cockfield set out the position most authoritatively <e> <s> he stated quite categorically that we were in favour of participating in the ems and i have dealt with that point and that it would be in an ideal world a good thing to involve ourselves in the exchange rate mechanism but that the timing was not right because of uncertainties in international currencies through their relationship with oil prices which particularly affected ourselves <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always a matter of national pride when ones national assets are fetching very large sums of money <e> <s> but in the real world in which we live the prices of raw materials fluctuate <e>", "<cs> my lords i meant dr owen <e>", "<cs> my lords i too live on the fringes of cheshire <e> <s> i should have thought that one would describe cheshire as one of the richest parts of the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> the point i sought to make was that in some parts of british industry i thought traditionally low wages had encouraged continual overmanning and that as productivity and restored competitiveness came back it was reasonable that fewer workers would have higher wages <e> <s> that does not mean to say that i dissent from my noble friend about people pricing themselves into work in other parts of the economy <e>", "<cs> no my lords the primary concern of the governments economic policy is to establish conditions favourable to the creation of more wealth <e> <s> i hope that the noble lords interest in the wealth gap will lead him to urge that those who wish to buy their council houses should do so and that he will lend his support to the british telecom share issue <e>", "<cs> my lords it certainly is not my view that governments make the rich richer or the poor poorer <e> <s> industry does that and the more investment there is the better <e>", "<cs> my lords i am a little suspicious of the genie that the noble lord is trying to make rise out of his bottle <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that we really must try to translate some of those percentages into cash terms <e> <s> a person need not be very wealthy to be in the top per cent <e> <s> in such a person needed to possess only of marketable wealth <e> <s> i should have thought that it was the policy of the noble lords party as it is of our own to see that more people joined in <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not accept that ownership of assets by government is ownership by the british people <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to be able to say that in a very short space of time the noble lord will be able to own it <e>", "<cs> my lords i suggest that the noble lord like the rest of us tries his luck <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said the point of the governments economic policies is that the country should get richer <e> <s> the distribution of wealth within the country is a matter of great concern to the government and that is precisely why the government are anxious that people should buy their council houses because property is still the largest form of wealth distribution and indulge in wider share ownership as i said earlier <e>", "<cs> my lords i am saying no such thing <e> <s> what i am saying is that the broad distribution of wealth has changed very little under this government since the previous government if one includes the retention of wealth in pension rights <e>", "<cs> my lords i should be delighted to try to find that out for the noble lord if he will put that question down <e> <s> it is a rather different question from that on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i answered the question <e> <s> if the noble lady refers to <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to this is very simple <e> <s> over the last to years whichever government have been in office there has been a gradual trend towards greater equality of wealth which is largely the result of increasing home ownership coupled with the accumulation of occupational and state pension rights <e> <s> however changes take place from year to year because of differential movement in asset prices and recently there has i am extremely glad to say been a fairly sharp rise on the stock exchange <e>", "<cs> my lords the identical trend was taking place <e>", "<cs> my lords working backwards through the noble baronesss supplementary i think that the tension between those without indexed pensions and those with indexed pensions has lessened slightly since inflation has come down <e> <s> i am glad to be able to say that because i think it was a real source of tension <e> <s> i certainly agree with the noble baroness that it is important that those of us who comprise the per cent <e> <s> of the working population who are in work and who have on the whole been doing quite well should when we pitch our economic demands be sensitive to the needs of those who are not in work <e>", "<cs> my lords i should certainly have to have some notice of those figures to check them out <e> <s> but there is of course a marked distinction between the noble lord and myself the noble lord as a socialist is more interested in equality i am more interested in a greater opportunity for more people to become richer <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to be able to confirm to my noble friend that that is indeed the case on both counts <e> <s> although her majestys customs and excise do not maintain statistics of duty-free shops sales which i think he would agree might interrupt their successful commercial development the number of international passengers has been continuing to increase <e> <s> duty-free price levels related to increasing duty-paid shop prices have also increased <e> <s> so turnover will have increased by value which will be a thoroughly good thing for the economy <e>", "<cs> my lords i suspect that it was on grounds of economy <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted that the noble lord lord beswick is to add his very considerable weight and influence to the liberalisation of trade domestically as well as abroad <e> <s> i am certainly on his side as regards that matter <e> <s> however it is a fact of life that greater maintenance of records by her majestys customs and excise will lead to greater staff time and costs which would be adverse to the trade which the noble lord is recommending <e> <s> i think that with me he would welcome that the profits generated by duty-free shop sales have been able to compensate for losses under normal airport operations <e> <s> that seems to me to be good housekeeping <e> <s> as to the fire hazard <e> <s> i was not aware that there was one but i shall look into the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware that parliament was in any doubt about the fact that there is a duty-free system within europe for those who are travelling abroad and landing at another port <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be that i am simple-minded but i do not think that it would be very easy to evade on a massive scale duty-free sales in this way as the noble lord has implied <e> <s> the noble lord is at least as experienced a traveller as i am and he will be well aware of how difficult that would be in practice <e> <s> my point about economy is that it would seem to me to be asking her majestys customs and excise to undertake an unreasonable burden in maintaining statistics of duty-free shop sales because the maintenance of statistics is a very expensive business <e>", "<cs> my lords i have been bailed out by my noble friend not for the first time and i hope not for the last <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to the noble lord the leader of the opposition i do not think that i was unclear at all <e> <s> i said that it was an expensive and time-wasting business to maintain statistics of duty-free shop sales <e> <s> i am thoroughly in favour of duty-free shop sales <e> <s> i was able to confirm to my noble friend that they had been rising with

lord is well aware economics are very important <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has asked me this question as a consumer <e> <s> as a venal consumer i am afraid that i am prone to make use of the duty-free facility when it is available to me <e> <s> but in the light of what my noble friend has said i shall now look at my own consumptive practices in a more rigorous manner <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a matter of correlating statistical information and not that people do not know what is going on <e>", "<cs> my lords i refer the noble lord to my previous answer <e> <s> of course the duty-free shops keep close records which are open to inspection on the volume of sales which they undertake <e> <s> the difficulty i was outlining related to having centralised records of these of the kind that i was being asked for <e>", "<cs> my lords it is certainly true that the airports and harbours concerned do very well out of this practice and as a result reduce the costs on the rest of us <e>", "<cs> my lords i am quite prepared to provide parliament with information of this kind if parliament will will me the means to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i was rather startled while waiting for the second reading of this bill to hear the opposition front bench describe the sale of british telecom shares to the public as one of the greatest scandals of the century <e> <s> it is nice to return to the ecumenical and sunlit uplands of debate on this measure which has at heart in the same way i should have thought as the previous and larger measure the interests of small savers and people involved in friendly societies <e> <s> i am grateful to all three noble lords who have spoken for the general welcome that they have given to the bill <e> <s> may i say to the noble lord who spoke from the opposition front bench that the government are considering the recommendations of <e>", "<cs> my lords i think there is no point in prevailing upon my right honourable friend on some issue on which at present he is not insisting <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very prepared to relay the noble baronesss views to my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords while suspecting that my right honourable friend is a cavalier rather than a roundhead like milton i may say that i am a great fan of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i have seen very few signs of self-destruction on the part of this government <e>", "<cs> my lords many things can be said about vat but an expensive bureaucracy i think is not one of them as the people who pay it are usually the people who collect it <e> <s> i am very well aware of the position as it affects theatres but the fact is that government subsidies to the arts take into account the revenue that the government receive from the arts <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the proprietors of fleet street newspapers need any recommendations from me as to how to protect their interests <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are aware of the argument that vat on cover prices of paid-for papers would give an unfair advantage to free newspapers unless they too were taxed as free gifts by a charge on production costs <e> <s> this question would need to be carefully studied if the issue of taxation on newspapers became real but as i have said as it is the issue is hypothetical <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a big issue <e> <s> if i had to answer in a sentence i think the reason is that i suspect that this economy has rather broader shoulders than the noble lord is allowing for and in general i believe in a greater freedom of choice so far as the taxpayers are concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that this is one of those questions which whatever answer i give somebody somewhere could take that as indicating what the government are liable to do <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that the government have no plans at present to introduce this tax but who knows what the situation will be next april <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that any governments are so innocent as not to consider any potential sources of revenue <e>", "<cs> my lords i can confirm to my noble friend that we examine every possible method of stopping this deadly and murderous traffic <e> <s> we pursue new technologies we do it through personnel and information and crime detection and we also rely on drugs dogs which are very effective <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall take note if i may of the first part of the noble lords supplementary question which was a useful contribution to debate on the issue <e> <s> as to the specific question the extra posts allocated earlier this year were additions to the customs complement in carefully selected locations <e> <s> a similar process will be followed when the new posts for are allocated in the new year <e> <s> the overall effect is of a very considerable increase in the customs preventive effort <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have indicated i certainly think that drug smuggling is a very serious threat indeed <e> <s> that is why as my earlier answers indicate i think we are giving it more resources and more attention <e> <s> i could never be said to be satisfied while any noxious drugs get in the country at all but there has been some evidence of success in the fight <e> <s> in the first months of this year customs and excise who if i may say this to the noble lord are in the front line here seized over kilos of heroin which is considerably more than was seized in the whole of last year that is to say kilos <e> <s> that compares with the total of kilos in <e> <s> there was a spectacular seizure of cannabis from a ship in the river crouch which was one of the largest ever seizures in britain <e> <s> also so far this year some persons have been arrested more than of whom were principals rather than mere carriers so although <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot comment and i have no information about the rival breeds of dogs but i can confirm to the noble baroness that customs and excise have dogs based on a number of regional centres and they are called out regularly to sniff out drugs <e> <s> in the most recent months over dog-aided seizures were achieved <e> <s> these were worth many millions of pounds at street-level prices and i think that the long noses if i may echo the noble baronesss phrase are doing a very good job indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to say that both substances are illegal and the fact of the matter is that most people engaged in drug trafficking are doing so for profit <e> <s> i do not think they enormously worry what they are trafficking in so long as their profits are high enough <e> <s> that is why we have to attack this evil wherever we find it <e>", "<cs> my lords i may be misinterpreting my noble friends question but if i understand him aright i think that we would have to measure our undoubted successes and our undoubted need for greater successes to counter this evil against really very considerable disruption to the public disruption that has been eased by introducing the red and green channel system at points of entry <e> <s> in fact of course as so often with crime detection and with catching criminals careful research careful intelligence and careful under-cover work is really the most cost-effective way of proceeding <e>", "<cs> my lords on the latter point in recent years customs and excise have made substantial staff savings through streamlining their procedures and organisation and as my earlier answers and the figures indicate the anti-smuggling effort has been maintained through careful ordering of priorities <e> <s> i understand that there are nearly sniffer dogs used and they are based in a number of regional centres <e> <s> i know of no special constraints on customs and excise having more dogs if they would be cost-effective <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already to some degree tried to answer that point <e> <s> we have to weigh disruption and annoyance to visitors the vast majority of whom we welcome here very much and to our own people returning against the need to combat this evil <e> <s> the best way to proceed is by tried and tested methods of crime prevention <e> <s> we will of course keep in mind the point of the noble baroness about more spot checks but that as i have indicated most of this traffic is a highly organised international criminal conspiracy <e> <s> we have to proceed against it accordingly <e>", "<cs> my lords i have this point very much in mind as do the government <e> <s> to give a case in point we have had a united kingdom customs specialist investigator in post in pakistan since april of this year and his role is to liaise with law enforcement agencies in pakistan and to feed back operational intelligence <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord kilmarnock must recognise that this very important area is but one part of the customs and excise functions <e> <s> the fact that we are increasing personnel and manning levels in this area is an indication of the importance we give to fighting this great evil <e> <s> that would not of course let the customs and excise or any other government department off trying to achieve manpower savings in very many fields <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that that necessarily follows <e> <s> even at lower rates this is tragically a very profitable traffic <e> <s> i think it is more the evil people reacting to changes in the market rather than anything else <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has a point <e> <s> in fact we obtain quite a lot of our information in that way <e>", "<cs> my lords we have of course made representations to governments <e> <s> this is part of our continuing efforts against the traffic <e> <s> we also have many friends and allies in the western democracies who are in the same boat in respect of this evil traffic and we work very closely with them <e>", "<cs> my lords i congratulate my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter on his choice of subject today <e> <s> that this is more than conventional congratulations is indicated by the splendid team of batsmen which his opening bowling has attracted <e> <s> he deserves particular commendation for bringing before the house a subject which has been left without full debate by your lordships for over years <e> <s> sixteen <e>", "<cs> hear hear <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> what i was saying hear hear <e> <s> to was the fact that in my own opening remarks and i hope the noble lord will do justice to me here i said that getting numbers and costs down was very important but it was not the be-all and end-all of efficiency <e> <s> i then went on to describe what efficiency was <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down since he was kind enough to give me notice that he would not be able to hear the wind-up may i answer very quickly two points <e> <s> obviously at the end of the debate i shall be touching on the gchq issue <e> <s> it would i think be fair to say at this point in response to the noble lord lord shackleton that the offer of a no-strike agreement that was made by the civil service unions was repudiated by other unions and by the tuc as i understand regardless of its merits <e> <s> personally i was not convinced of those merits but that is another issue <e> <s> it was repudiated by the labour movement generally <e>", "<cs> hear hear <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> there is not a shred of evidence that that is taking place or has taken place <e>", "<cs> my lords may i intervene <e> <s> this is a detailed point and i want to deal with the debate generally when i wind up <e> <s> i said in my opening remarks that it is not precisely the same service <e> <s> it is improved in some areas and it is probably done at a less admirable level in others <e> <s> but overall the mix of public services on offer to the public are the same as they were in <e> <s> that was the point i sought to make in the <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has made a series of allegations without a shred of evidence whatsoever and i really think he should start even if he delays the house to give chapter and verse for some of these most astonishing statements <e>", "<cs> my lords a number of speakers during the debate have made the point that it is a thoroughly good thing that people should go in and out of the civil service and into other activities in the economy <e> <s> personally i would seek to encourage that <e> <s> the noble lord is drawing heavily from one piece in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i imagine it is almost a duty of the speaker who winds up for the opposition after a debate which has been excellent but nevertheless quite long to try to jazz things up a little <e> <s> the noble lord lord ennals certainly did that <e> <s> i imagine that most of the house enjoyed his speech <e> <s> i must confess to a slight irritation because it seems to me that he produced little evidence one piece from the <e>", "<cs> well my lords he is encouraged to do so and not least by me because i enjoy a knock-about parliamentary debate <e> <s> in a characteristically restrained and elegant speech the noble lord lord barnett itemised some of the issues raised about morale to which i shall refer at the end of my speech <e> <s> before doing so i pay tribute to the noble lord lord barnett as the founding father of cash limits would that his progeny paid rather more heed to him as he will note we do <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> what i am maintaining is that the amount of information available generally to interested people in this country is greater than anywhere else that i have ever lived <e> <s> i myself learn a great deal of what is going on in central government by reading the newspapers and watching the television despite having access to government papers <e> <s> of course one cannot release every single bit of government information and no government could work if they did <e> <s> freedom of information if i may very respectfully say so is something that oppositions are immensely keen on but tend to backtrack on a little when they come into office <e>", "<cs> my lords this debate has been very useful in demonstrating the concern felt by the house for high and rising unemployment which is of course a social and economic evil that we must fight with all the force at our command <e> <s> i must say however that parliamentary debates urging compassion and concern are not enough as my noble friend lord belhaven reminded us in a very trenchant and admirable speech because our words butter no parsnips and they generate no jobs <e>", "<cs> my lords we are under a time constraint and if i may i want to continue without interruption <e> <s> i have a very long debate to answer and i want to answer every noble lord that i can <e>", "<cs> my lords i said that i will not give way in a debate of this kind <e> <s> i have debated in this house for several years and i have never done so under a time constraint <e> <s> if the time constraint is taken off me i am quite happy to give way but if it is not i would rather not <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i have already said that i shall not give way <e>", "<cs> i challenged the house rhetorically my lords <e> <s> the noble lord lord underhill can write to me and i shall write back to him <e> <s> i intend to <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not hear the noble lords question <e> <s> perhaps he would like to put it to me in writing <e>", "<cs> my lords at that time we also had a far greater share of markets <e> <s> in order to have <e>", "<cs> my lords the point i made is that we have halted the slide and we are beginning to climb again <e> <s> we halted the slide in the year <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not wholly clear what kind of schemes the noble lord has in mind <e> <s> it is of course impossible to block all forms of avoidance <e> <s> a balance must be struck between stopping undue avoidance on the one hand and making our tax system oppressively complex and full of traps for the unwary on the other <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall of course give consideration to what the noble and learned lord has said but i would claim that the tax is still cost effective <e> <s> the estimated yield from ctt for is million and the cost/yield ratio of per cent <e> <s> compares rather favourably with that for other capital taxes <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i think there has to be a balance between what is regarded as avoidance and what is regarded as prudent tax planning which has always been wholly legitimate <e>", "<cs> my lords one should i believe pay ones taxes but one should not pay more in taxes than one can reasonably avoid <e>", "<cs> my lords i confess to a certain personal bias against capital taxation generally and i speak disinterestedly as i am not personally the possessor of capital <e> <s> nevertheless it seems to me a sensible thing for the economy to try to build up capital rather than the reverse <e> <s> as taxes go million seems to me to be a fair amount of revenue <e>", "<cs> my lords the trouble is that the noble lord lord beswick is in the fortunate position unlike myself of being beseiged by people instructing him about the disposition of his taxes so i do not quite know what he is referring to <e>", "<cs> my lords that is precisely why we have tried to raise tax thresholds and narrow tax bands <e> <s> i am encouraged to say that there is some evidence that people are trying to make a bit more money and i hope that they will be able to keep it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware that there is quite an industry which encourages individuals to invest in various forms of investment schemes the object of which is to lower the liability to taxation <e> <s> i am not aware that this is doing any appreciable harm to the inland revenue <e> <s> my advice from the revenue is that they are satisfied with the tax base of this particular form of taxation <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is not only illogical but it is rather a slap in the face of spouses <e> <s> i should have thought that noble lords opposite of all persuasions and indeed all sexes would be reluctant to engage in that <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is famous for his sense of humour but i fear that on this occasion he must be indulging it at the public expense <e> <s> the obligation to pay taxes as he knows well as a former minister is a general one which has no specific conscientious implications in itself in the sense that no part of any individuals taxes can be said to fund or not to fund a particular item of public spending <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy as always to take the noble lords advice and i certainly have no intention of commenting upon a case which may be before the courts <e> <s> but i would point out to the noble lord and to the house that there was a recent case before the european commission of human rights which concerned the individuals right to divert a proportion of tax to a peace-building fund in that particular instance <e> <s> the commission said a number of things but they also said that if an applicant considers the obligation to contribute through taxation to arms procurement an outrage to his or her conscience he or she may advertise the attitude and thereby try to obtain support for it through the democratic process <e> <s> that remains the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i think my noble friend is quite right <e> <s> the questioner in the form of the noble lord lord jenkins of putney and i might both come out badly as previous and present arts ministers <e>", "<cs> my lords i have seldom heard a supplementary question so far wide of the original question <e> <s> i suggest that the noble lord with his experience and his contacts studies the record of the government which he used to support <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i must resist making a comment on the noble lords supplementary question but as one who has worked in your lordships house for years i have during that time on issues of nomenclature always taken the advice of the noble lord who asked the last question <e> <s> i intend to go on doing so <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree very profoundly and personally as a child of military parents and as someone born at the beginning of the last war who has now reached middle age during a period of peace <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that very unlikely <e> <s> it would surely completely undermine the sovereignty of parliament which the noble lord mentioned in his question to allow sections of the community to decide that they did not accept parliaments decisions on overall public spending <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord is right <e>", "<cs> my lords it is precisely because the government recognise that that they have been doing exactly what the noble lord suggests <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is indeed right and that is the case <e> <s> north sea oil will be a very important part of our economy for a long time to come <e> <s> it enables us to get on with the job of making major structural changes in our domestic economy while preserving our welfare services <e>", "<cs> my lords i can think of no single thing that the government have done since their period of office that i personally approve of more than the freeing of exchange controls as was urged on us by a minister in the previous government the noble lord lord lever a predecessor of mine as chancellor of the duchy of lancaster <e> <s> the fact is that we have been turning one valuable asset into another by taking up positions in other countries <e> <s> britain has been a global economy since the reign of the first elizabeth and this is essential to the future of our children and indeed to employment in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords while welcoming very warmly indeed my noble friends supplementary question i rather suspect that he may be anticipating his speech in the forthcoming debate and i imagine that we shall be returning to this topic quite shortly <e>", "<cs> no my lords it means nothing of the kind because as the noble lord is well aware government spending in capital terms has not been falling <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that for a brief moment the noble lord lord kaldor was i think in danger of turning into an overseas asset <e> <s> i am aware and indeed most of the house are aware of the interesting letter which the noble lord wrote to <e>", "<cs> my lords that is an interesting suggestion in terms of conserving energy and getting <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of that and i do not believe it <e>", "<cs> my lords i have read it and i suspect that my comprehension is a great deal more precise than the noble lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord beswick is experienced in government and in industry and he is also as we have just heard a wily debater <e> <s> but i am afraid that his motion asks us to tilt once again at those airy and familiar windmills of british political debate uniting the nation for one thing <e> <s> i am from ireland and i am married to someone from germany <e> <s> i know how immensely fortunate britain is in that even the fiercest arguments here take place in the context of one nation <e> <s> like other countries britain has immense problems and i shall not duck them this afternoon <e> <s> but there is no evidence of disunity on most of the central issues of the day <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say to the noble lord that this list of successes is not boring at all <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> nonsense <e>", "<cs> unbelievable my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords as with rather different language both noble lords on the front benches opposite effectively asked me the same questions perhaps the house will allow me to try to answer them together <e>", "<cs> my lords as to the brevity of my right honourable friends statement i can do no <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for giving me the chance to remind the house that the noble lord lord stoddart supported <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say that after what seems to me like year after year of repetition of simple truths it seems quite extraordinary that the noble lord could assume that local authorities could behave as if they occupied a different economy from the national economy particularly in view of the fact that more than per cent <e> <s> of local authority money is supplied by central taxpayers <e> <s> just as the government have to react to events which they do not welcome and which they think are over-estimated in intensity externally so i am afraid there is no way that one can protect local authorities from the same consequences <e> <s> but i am sure that if we all keep our heads and our nerves and keep our counter-inflationary policies policies which governments of both parties have laid emphasis upon when they have been in office there is no reason over the longer term why these immediate movements in the money market should be too disruptive <e>", "<cs> my lords i do consider that i answered it in terms <e> <s> i said that we could not insulate local authorities from other factors operating in the national economy <e>", "<cs> my lords i congratulate my noble friend on his return from honeymoon in new york and i hope that that honeymoon was not bedevilled by too much economic debate <e> <s> it is indeed the case that the world outside is watching our country carefully in respect of our sorting out our internal affairs <e> <s> as my noble friend is well aware whether it is on counter-inflationary issues or on issues of who manages great nationalised industries the government have made their position clear and are keeping the pressure up <e> <s> i am glad to say that in this respect they seem to be going in the right direction <e>", "<cs> my lords i would say to the noble lord lord ross that in my respectful judgment it would be extremely complacent if the government behaved as if there were no consequences to the national economy of these speculative movements in the money markets <e> <s> that is why as i said earlier all governments have to react to them and we have done so <e> <s> we are confident that the underlying situation is sound and that therefore our reaction will have the right results <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of having made any points which would have been resoundingly endorsed by central office but the <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord diamond has asked me a serious question and i will give him a serious answer <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that i remember many people not least supporters of the noble lord lord diamond and many supporters of the government complaining fiercely at the way money markets erratically as it turned out and those were the words i used over-valued the pound when it was standing at <e> <s> it is very difficult to establish what precisely the right rate is <e> <s> there are some factors in the money markets movements against sterling which are wholly outside the governments control <e> <s> some like our own counter-inflationary policy and interest rate policy are within our control and we have reacted accordingly <e>", "<cs> my lords that statement is untrue on so many points that it is very difficult to answer it in a question and answer session <e> <s> but may i say that the government have never hesitated to make their policy wholly clear <e> <s> it is sustained growth with low inflation <e> <s> that as i pointed out to your lordships in a recent debate has in fact been achieved by the government over a period of four years <e> <s> it is not sufficient to rest policy on that central objective but it is quite impossible to achieve other objectives without holding to that central objective and government after government in this country regardless of their political disposition have learned that the hard way <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with a great deal of that <e> <s> the germans have been running a lower rate of inflation than we have and that is one of the

also point out particularly in respect of the remarks made by the noble lord lord dean of beswick that american real wages over the last three or four years have been falling or have kept level-pegging and that this is a major factor in their better performance on unemployment than our own <e>", "<cs> my lords that is the noble lords right and i shall be delighted to engage in debate with him if the house wishes me to do so <e> <s> but the fact of the matter is that after spelling out what seems to me to be fairly widely agreed indeed they might be criticised for being simplistic

of as he put it this scargill business <e>", "<cs> my lords i obviously have some sympathy with what the noble lord says but in a free society pay is determined by free collective bargaining though there are some limits to that freedom <e> <s> bargaining is constrained by the external financing limit of each industry <e>", "<cs> my lords it is all very well to talk about confrontation but no other industrial group in this country has had and many would have wished to have had anything like the settlement offers that have been made to the num <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only agree with my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords it is quite clear that the coal board and the num must seek to work in the future in harmony but i would point out to the noble lord that the really damaging feature of this dispute has been its internal nature in respect of the num <e> <s> it seems to me that it is for the num to try to resolve that internal dispute and the num is doing that at the moment as i am well aware <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to say that i think that that is very wide of the question which was about the economic costs to date of this dispute <e> <s> nevertheless i can say to the noble lord and the house that of course the government representing the taxpayer who has put so much into this industry no less than an additional per cent <e> <s> since we came to office have an interest in this dispute <e> <s> but it is an illusion to think that governments can solve disputes particularly when as i said in answer to a previous supplementary question the basic dispute occurred within the union itself <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have made on behalf of the taxpayer a major commitment to coal in this economy <e> <s> no one so far as i know has cast any doubt on that and the figures do not allow any doubt to be cast upon it <e>", "<cs> my lords i have tried to indicate in my answers that i believe that this sad dispute has been an education <e> <s> it has been in my view far too costly an education but i have no doubt whatsoever that the lessons learnt will not be lost <e>", "<cs> my lords i yield to no one in my appreciation of continuity regional roots and the trust of communities which are served by institutions but it is nonetheless forever fascinating to me that arguments against change and development are these days made far more by the opposite side of the house than by my highly conservative friends on the back-benches <e> <s> at one point when the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby was speaking i almost felt that he might be nostalgic for a system which delivered per cent <e> <s> or per cent <e> <s> in interest and delivered most of the money in the tsbs to the government as an adjunct of national savings <e>", "<cs> my lords i am tempted to suggest that the noble lord on behalf of shareholders and depositors should not look a gift bank in the mouth <e> <s> nevertheless perhaps we may argue that point further at committee stage <e> <s> i feel that the noble lord is not taking sufficient account of the accumulated previous assets that have been mentioned <e>", "<cs> my lords when we can afford them <e>", "<cs> my lords then we can afford them <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just make the point because i am just about to concede something which the noble lord may be seeking to ask me to concede <e> <s> these disagreements suggest to me that there is no such thing as a truth written in tablets of stone in parties opposite any more than there is in respect of my party on currency issues or in respect for example of agreements between president reagan and mr volcker <e> <s> the air is full of noises where views on the right levels of currencies are concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i am one of those who has been urging the tory party to study the pronouncements of dr owen most carefully because they are extremely sensible on most issues and also because they seem to have a very close correspondence <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord will be happier about my clarification of the governments position if he lets me come to an end of it because i was coming to the point that he has mentioned <e> <s> what i am saying is that there are up-sides as well as down-sides in the jargon of the system that we have at the moment <e> <s> i do not think we should forget that business worldwide has now had rather a long time i have not checked exactly but from recall it is about a decade in which to adjust to flexible exchange rates <e> <s> the experts will tell us that sophisticated forward markets currency options and the like now provide a swiftly growing range of increasingly economical hedges against possible currency fluctuations <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not at all surprised if i may say so respectfully at this divergence of view if indeed it is a divergence of view <e> <s> if you ask any group of people who have just been through a rather battering experience where there has been a considerable degree of fluctuation whether they like it they are bound to say that they do not like it <e> <s> i do not blame them <e> <s> nor would i what the bank of england was doing was showing that over a period of time of these fluctuating exchange rates the outturn for british trade has not been as adverse as is suggested and indeed has not been adverse because trade has been growing <e> <s> what i was also saying was that the dear old and much maligned market is now throwing up all sorts of mechanisms admittedly at some cost by which people can hedge against currency changes in terms of their trading activities <e> <s> i am not saying in any <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord just as i will refer his speech to the chancellor will do me the courtesy of reading my arguments <e> <s> i have tried to argue fairly closely as to why i do not think the time is right at present <e> <s> it certainly would not have had the effect of sheltering us from some of the experiences we have had in the past few months <e>", "<cs> my lords all of these are the kinds of matters which the chancellor will no doubt be weighing as he prepares his budget statement <e> <s> on advertising generally i think that perhaps we rush in too lightly to condemn marketing in this country i believe that it performs a very valuable economic role <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friends supplementary question is an indication of how delicate budget judgments have to be <e>", "<cs> my lords when i said in my initial answer that all other advertising is taxable at the standard rate i thought i was going a long way towards meeting the noble lords point <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not done that because i have not been asked to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that my noble friends sentiment is shared in many quarters <e>", "<cs> my lords i say this in no political sense but the noble viscount reminds me of the late mr khrushchev who always had a proverb for every occasion <e> <s> i should love to have a proverb to cap the noble viscounts in respect of vat but unfortunately i have not come equipped with one <e>", "<cs> my lords in respect of the first part of the noble lords supplementary question i recognise a fellow sufferer <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall note most carefully what the noble lord <e> <s> lord leatherland has said <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord has put that question to me directly now perhaps i may answer while it is fresh in everyones mind <e> <s> is not the noble lord wholly vindicating the continued existence of the arms length principle <e> <s> i had nothing to do with that decision and i was not consulted <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a moment familiar to all opera lovers when some admirable figure like sir john tooley comes on in front of the curtain and says that the tenor has a cold <e> <s> in this case i have no such admirable representative <e> <s> i simply apologise in advance to your lordships for my voice <e> <s> i may have to interrupt my remarks briefly to take day nurse from time to time <e>", "<cs> my lords it is an essential part of my thesis my philosophy and my personal beliefs that governments have very little responsibility in the fields of artistic genius <e>", "<cs> my lords i have praised sir peter hall and indeed the national theatres productions and its management both in public and in private <e> <s> what i said in my speech was that it seemed to me that the terms and conditions under which the national theatre operated including its director were quite reasonably favourable that many others would like them and that it was at least part of the legitimate public debate to ask some questions about the staffing levels and so on at the national theatre <e> <s> i have also not noticed sir peter halls reticence in public on these issues and i do not see why i should sit on my own hands <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> he is being very fair in his logic and criticisms <e> <s> i said a substantial quantum increase not a squeeze <e> <s> the government have up-rated the arts grants <e> <s> it was a substantial quantum increase at a time when other budgets were being squeezed that i thought would be misinterpreted <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down may i repeat one very short point that i made in my opening remarks which i think has given rise to some misconceptions <e> <s> the arts council has not yet announced and i do not know what it is <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord allow me to intervene <e> <s> i intervene only because rather against my advice and my will i have agreed so much with most of what the noble lord has said <e> <s> the noble lord is a very old hand at the public game and he must know that he cannot make cross-arguments from one whole arena of national policy to another in this way <e> <s> i hope that he will not spoil an admirable speech on the arts by leading us into a red or perhaps a stars and stripes shaped herring on defence <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is making a very serious accusation <e> <s> all i was saying was that these artists in many cases are the products of our mixed and plural method of funding the arts from sources such as central government local govern <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is i think wilfully misunderstanding what i said <e> <s> of course i do not think that business sponsorship could by itself support the arts in this country <e> <s> i would refuse to serve as arts minister if that were policy <e> <s> it is not policy <e> <s> it never has been policy <e> <s> the noble lord must listen to what i say <e> <s> he is an experienced criminal lawyer and he knows perfectly well what i said <e> <s> we are running a mixed economy <e> <s> there are a plurality and variety of sources of funding <e> <s> i intend to maintain central government funding <e> <s> i intend to look for growth elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords may i answer that point while it is fresh in the mind of the house <e> <s> what i said and i made it very clear when i was talking about the houses was that they were not aristocratic mausoleums but living social assets <e> <s> i think that if the noble lord were to check <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for giving way <e> <s> i shall try to tackle this point which is such an interesting one while it is still in the minds of your lordships <e> <s> in respect of corporation tax i shall not comment but will study what my noble friend has said <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> again it is a question of dealing with the point while it is fresh in the mind of the house <e> <s> the point i sought to make and i rather agree with the noble lord about the indivisibility of film culture is that i am limited by the possibilities of my responsibilities <e> <s> i am not responsible in the government for the film industry <e> <s> however i am responsible for the british film institute and i do my best to help films through that <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has so nearly represented me a right that i rise only to take him to task for the one area where he has not <e> <s> i said that central government finance will be maintained in broadly level terms and that for the growth and expansion which i agree with pretty well every noble lord who has spoken is desirable we must look to other sources of funding <e> <s> these sources are not exclusively in the private sector <e> <s> they would also include of course local government <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord like me to deal with that point now or later <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> he has interpreted me extremely fairly <e> <s> i did not feel that i could hold the government responsible for additional funding which was made once the policy had as it were cleared its first hurdle in another place <e> <s> however i did feel that the money must be indexed forward to the period of time when the policy would go into effect <e> <s> that is the first point <e> <s> the second point is about the borough and district contribution <e> <s> i think that even my sternest critics would agree that to ask for million off all the boroughs of london or whatever number there are and all the districts affected in the metropolitan areas is not exactly singing for the moon <e>", "<cs> that is right my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to keep getting on up on this but it does keep cropping up and the noble viscount has tried to do me justice but he has got me wrong <e> <s> the thesis is a very simple one <e> <s> to cut the arts is indefensible to increase the sums of money to the arts is defensible <e> <s> to increase the sums of money available to the arts by some large percentage sum which is what i mean perhaps rather inaccurately by a quantum leap at a time when simultaneously you <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with one thing the noble lord lord strabolgi said this has been a vigorous and exciting debate and i have learnt a lot from it even though from my point of view there were perhaps slightly too few flowers ranged amid the vegetables <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that there was it was certainly budgeted for <e> <s> it was just a rather higher budget <e> <s> but i shall come to that because we try to make up the budget on an <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord strabolgi knows perfectly well that whatever my virtues or vices i do not actually make the dispositions in this country to individual arts bodies <e> <s> i would have to consult sir william rees-mogg and luke rittner on that and i do not have time to do that now <e> <s> i understand that a reprieve for a year will give opportunities to see what may be the future of the company <e> <s> certainly i wish the company well in all its efforts and the arts council well in their attempts to save it <e> <s> but that is not for me and if in due course the noble lord lord strabolgi becomes minister for the arts he will find that that is precisely the case with him as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that altogether <e> <s> may i say in further response that on my many trips to the national theatre i have always been specially impressed by the quality of the design <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord beguiles me with various tempting opportunities for the heritage the revenue the world service and all kinds of other things which are very dear to my heart <e> <s> but unlike the noble lord i am rather keen on foreigners and they are certainly doing the economy in this country a lot of good at this moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall look at what the noble lord has said <e> <s> i rather suspect that the second part of his supplementary question was not logically consistent with the first part but i shall do my best <e>", "<cs> i feel that this is one amendment on which as jeeves said i think i will be able to give satisfaction <e> <s> the fact is that tsb scotland limited will be a separate subsidiary within the tsb group and the bank will he managed in scotland where the present tsb scotland already plays a most effective role <e> <s> the holding company in london is not a bank and is not expected to interfere at all in the management of regional banks <e> <s> i certainly agree with the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe and <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> what i said and i must weigh my words most carefully was that if the new tsb group wished to change its structure for example by selling tsb scotland to scottish shareholders it would not need legislation to do so <e> <s> but we have no evidence that it will wish to change the position because as i have been arguing there will be a much more dynamic role for the tsb as part of the financial structure of edinburgh than there was before this bill was put before your lordships <e> <s> i really feel therefore that not only the committee but maybe even the shade of sir walter scott might be pleased with me in this regard and i hope the noble lord will not press his amendment <e>", "<cs> what i said was that the tsb group if it wishes to change its structure could sell tsb scotland to scottish shareholders <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that lord taylor and perhaps i may deal with his point at the same time if that is satisfactory to the noble lord on the opposition front bench is making a point on centralisation and wishing to divide the committee on an issue of centralisation which is simply not founded because what may not be understood by the depositor whose letter the noble lord movingly read out is that the tsb has not been in any practical terms a bank at all up to the present <e> <s> it is now proposed that it should be able to behave like a bank and the management and operations of the tsb scotland will actually be adding to scottish banking activity rather than subtracting from it <e> <s> as a good scot therefore i am very surprised that the noble lord lord taylor should think this an issue on which he should divide the committee <e>", "<cs> we are trying to change the present outdated constitutional basis of tsbs generally <e> <s> the arrangements for scotland cannot be made whether or not they are satisfactory in relation to the present suggestions which appear to have been widely welcomed in scotland if tsbs retain their present position and are not changed in the way suggested by the bill <e>", "<cs> i know that other noble lords may wish to comment but i should like to point out <e>", "<cs> with respect to the noble lord lord houghton that is not the case <e> <s> it is the case that depositors in trustee savings banks wished to have a far wider variety of banking services available to them than existed before this bill was proposed which still exist but which will not exist after this bill becomes an act if it does <e> <s> that really has been reflected in the pattern of investment into tsbs over the past few years <e> <s> it is extraordinary to me to talk as though the government were behaving unethically when the government so to speak in our jargon were coming out of the closet and saying to people look we want this to be a proper bank rather than a hidden method of tapping your funds into our pockets down here in whitehall <e> <s> put in the vernacular that is roughly what the bill seeks to do <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord lord houghton because it saves the time of the committee if a member of it in this case the noble lord accurately defines what he sees as the central issue and demands a response from the government on that central issue <e> <s> the response was made well not on behalf of the government but from the benches behind the government by my noble friend lord bruce-gardyne <e> <s> but what one or two members of the committee seem to me not to be taking on board it may be perfectly ethical is whether it is a good thing in the widest moral and ethical sense of the word good that an organisation including an organisation using aggressive advertising best modern commercial practice and so forth should be pretending as it were to depositors to be a bank but in fact be a channel for national savings <e> <s> that is a fairly clear issue <e> <s> that was an issue on which the labour party in another place i am interested in the silence during this debate of the noble lords who support the party of the noble lord lord houghton seemed to be in wide agreement with us <e> <s> the banking unions were in wide agreement with us and the trustees of the tsb were also in wide agreement <e>", "<cs> i have other objections to this amendment but i was not dealing with those <e> <s> i was dealing with the point put to me by the noble lord lord houghton as the central issue of the entire committee stage of the bill <e> <s> i thought that it would expedite proceedings and provide clarification for your lordships committee if i took the noble lord lord houghton at his word and gave him the answer <e>", "<cs> i do not think i can be accused of not taking the amendment seriously as i have not yet replied to it <e> <s> i was taking very seriously the point put to me forcibly in the form of an interrogation no less than three times by the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby and i think that it was fair for me to do so <e>", "<cs> i am coming to one of the points which lord jacques has made the bonanza point in a moment <e> <s> but the fact of the matter is that at the moment the government of the day are the principal beneficiaries of the tsbs <e> <s> we the government of the day are i would have thought <e>", "<cs> i think that that ignores the discount factor which i mentioned <e> <s> if the noble lord will read what i said and i prepared the answer most carefully and will get out his pocket calculator i think he will see that the position is quite fair <e>", "<cs> i did not make that assumption <e> <s> my per cent <e> <s> was an example <e> <s> it was simply to illustrate that the discount factor operated and would operate in this case <e> <s> i cannot tell what the amount would be <e>", "<cs> i can say to the noble lord that of course the government are not directly involved in the details of the share issue but we do accept and it is on the record in the white paper in my remarks on second reading and again in my remarks this afternoon what sir john read has said namely that there will be privileges for employees in chances to acquire shares <e>", "<cs> the bill received so much assent from my noble friends at second reading vociferously put that they do not feel it necessary to try to tamper with this admirable bill <e>", "<cs> hear hear <e>", "<cs> it is always of particular interest at committee stages to have a whole new clause so i congratulate the noble lord on the ingenuity of his new clause and also on the way in which he has argued it <e> <s> but i am afraid that it will not come as a bitter disappointment to the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon to learn that that is where my enchantment stops <e>", "<cs> fortunate is the front bench spokesman who has the architect of the bill on his back benches <e> <s> i have really very little to add to what my noble friend lord bruce-gardyne has said or to the very cogent objections to the case of the noble lord lord houghton which have also been put by my noble friend lord ferrers <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> i share most of the sentiments expressed by the noble lord on the principle of employee involvement generally <e> <s> employee directors as he said are an option and there are indeed again as he said other options <e> <s> but in our view and we hold this very profoundly and passionately it is for each individual company to take its own decisions in this area <e> <s> i am sure that if the tsb plc comes into being and workers or worker organisations within the company wish to make proposals for employee involvement in this way they will be sympathetically treated and listened to <e> <s> but also if as one hopes large numbers of employees become shareholders with an active interest in the company then that is another way of making views felt <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot imagine a situation where things are put out for discussion comment and consultation which would not have the effects that the noble baroness suggests and of course it is inevitable that in any consultation some people will be happier than others <e>", "<cs> my lords the case for legislation is surely comprehensibly set out in the consultation document <e> <s> proposals in that document are intended to result in clear guidelines within which industries remaining within the public sector will have freedom to operate as successful commercial businesses <e> <s> this will benefit the industries themselves <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> that is not my understanding and it is not what i suggested <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are of course still prepared to consider detailed comments on the nicc document and on the main document but i think that the point which the noble lord has put to me relating to board appointments ranges a little wide of the original question <e>", "<cs> my lords i answered it as clearly as i could by saying that the situation is unchanged since the sponsoring minister remains the sponsoring minister <e>", "<cs> my lords final decisions on the timing and content of the proposed legislation have still to be taken <e> <s> but as i said in answer to an earlier supplementary question the case for legislation is comprehensibly set out in the consultation document <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware that that is the case <e>", "<cs> my lords i have made it very clear that the sponsoring ministers remain the sponsoring ministers <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord wish to ask a supplementary question <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to the noble lord it is a nonsensical question <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that the sponsoring minister remains the sponsoring minister <e> <s> the idea that the treasury is not in contact with the sponsoring minister is ludicrous <e>", "<cs> my lords the secretary of state will in due course have to assign the property rights and liabilities of metropolitan county councils to successor bodies by order under clause of the local government bill <e> <s> otherwise property will pass to the appropriate residuary body under clause <e> <s> should it be necessary to make any incidental transitional or supplementary provisions the secretary of state may by order do so under the provisions of clause <e> <s> in considering such orders the secretary of state will give careful consideration to the views of the society and other interested parties <e>", "<cs> my lords as i think the right reverend prelate will be aware i have recently visited the royal liverpool philharmonic society <e> <s> i am a very great admirer of the orchestra and i think that it is very well placed in the hall where it finds itself <e> <s> the question of future ownership and matters associated with that are therefore very strongly in my mind and in the mind of my right honourable friend <e> <s> as the legislation progresses we shall of course be consulting most closely <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to say that i do not accept the figures put forward by the noble lord <e> <s> it seemed to me reasonable that boroughs and successor authorities should make a contribution to the arts albeit a modest one following the passage of this legislation particularly in view of the benefits to their community not least in terms of infrastructural improvement and employment that the arts can bring <e>", "<cs> my lords as a recent immigrant into wales and one who lives within driving distance of the hall i very much endorse the sentiments of the noble lord lord davies of leek but the fact of the matter is that the hall is not threatened <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure what the interrogative part of that remark was <e> <s> as i understand it the noble lord lord jenkins of putney was saying that he did not agree with me <e> <s> my lords that causes me no surprise <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord will be well aware vat applies across the public sector including the national gallery loosely in this category and the tendency in modern life is for there to be pressures to extend vat not to reduce it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware of what the noble lord was asking <e> <s> i was simply somewhat modest about my power to deliver it <e>", "<cs> my lords the national gallery like other great institutions has to strike a balance <e> <s> this is certainly a major british painting and perhaps the greatest painting by wright of derby <e> <s> it is of course a very high price <e> <s> it is because i am sensible of what my noble friend has said that i have very reluctantly reduced the national gallerys purchasing grant this year in the interests of there being greater overall provision for conservation and display of paintings in our national institutions and for the maintenance of the buildings that show them <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i shall be lured into discussion with the noble lord lord annan about the quality of the turner or other paintings <e> <s> i endorse what he said about the record of the national gallery in displaying the marvellous national pictures that it owns <e> <s> i feel that it is important for the house to realise and for people generally to realise that we probably now are in the era of million million or million being quite commonplace prices for old master paintings <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the national gallery has a kind of aladdins cave or private file of paintings which are denied to the rest of us <e> <s> i would certainly defend the noble lord lord annan in that respect <e> <s> the question of national heritage is a large and slightly difficult one <e> <s> we do of course have a great history as a collecting nation as a nation which collected works by artists round the world and we have to consider that part of our heritage as well but i agree with the noble lord lord grimond that it was a good thing that the national gallery acquired this great wright of derby <e>", "<cs> my lords i am of course well aware that it is the british museum with the victoria and albert musuem rather than the national gallery that tends to be the repository of great drawings <e> <s> as for the noble lord lord grimond i am sure that both he and the national gallery can enjoy each others company whenever the noble lord suggests <e>", "<cs> my lords i am tempted to say that the person who really added the value was joseph wright and he happily for himself is beyond the reach of vat <e>", "<cs> my lords there is <e>", "<cs> hear hear <e>", "<cs> public money <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has a very relaxed view of what governments can do in the way of finding time for additional legislation <e> <s> it is hard enough to get any kind of legislation into the queue these days let alone something which in the governments own judgment is perfectly well covered by the legislation for which they have been able to find time <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a bank and the bank is one of a number of banks owned by the holding company <e> <s> i think that that is a fair description <e>", "<cs> my lords the reason that i do not think we are doing any such thing is that the holding company is a company that has a number of banks <e> <s> it needs those banks to behave vigorously and independently as banks in their areas of influence <e> <s> as i argued previously the holding company is not a bank <e> <s> perhaps if i could elaborate my argument a little further it may deal with some of these points <e>", "<cs> my lords the holding company could only dissolve aspects of the other banks in my judgment if it went off its head <e> <s> the idea of the holding company is to have a vigorous banking group <e> <s> as the noble lords lord taylor and lord grimond

point to make on this but that does not mean to say that i have not in turn listened with great care to what the noble lord lord houghton has said <e> <s> however it seems to me that it is not really needful to circumscribe the tsbs freedom of action in the way the amendment suggests <e> <s> they have said as he has acknowledged that the flotation should be late this year or early next year but

less unique <e>", "<cs> that is indeed right and i apologise to the house <e> <s> the noble lord put points to me directly as i thought and so i felt obliged to answer them <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord puts his argument in a very moderate and persuasive way but i cannot get over the fact that the amendment is the same in principle as that debated in committee except that the percentage of shares to be held by the proposed trustees is per cent <e> <s> rather than per cent <e> <s> while i admit that a per cent <e> <s> holding is somewhat less objectionable than the per cent <e> <s>

my opposition to his amendment at a later stage i will be doing so in good faith on the basis that i have now said i am opposed to it <e> <s> however it would appear that it is not necessary for him to press the amendment now and therefore i hope that he and i are in agreement on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords ministers are indeed satisfied that our present zero rates are legitimate that they work well and that they are clearly understood and well accepted <e> <s> it is our view that they do not cause significant distortion of community trade <e> <s> the difficulties perhaps spring from a

noble lord is showing himself a master of contemporary political idiom <e> <s> the fact is that a lot of this anxiety is hypothetical <e> <s> my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer has stated in another place that for his part he does not intend to make any further extension whatever of the vat base during the lifetime of this parliament <e> <s> the european commission has not yet put the matter to the european court of justice but it has not i have to say yet given indications that it intends not to do so <e> <s> if it did do so those proceedings would of course provide a further opportunity for us vigorously to state our case <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree in general with the noble baroness but i have to say that i feel very strongly about this issue <e> <s> it would be quite intolerable i think if we were to be put under needless pressure to harmonise vat for its own sake <e>", "<cs> my lords while i do not wish to use the convention that i shall draw my noble friends remarks to the attention of the commission i imagine that it will find a way of listening to what he has had to say <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that it is for me to comment precisely on what went on in another place but as i said in my original reply to the noble baroness all the comments that have been received are being most carefully considered and i give the noble baroness an absolute undertaking to that effect <e>", "<cs> no my lords i think nothing that my right honourable friend does is a sorry business <e> <s> however i was trying to meet the noble baroness when i said at the beginning that i was concerned with what takes place in this house and i give the noble baroness and through my answer to her question the house a guarantee that this will be most carefully considered <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords for their reception of the statement <e> <s> perhaps i am a little more grateful to the noble viscount lord chandos than to the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon not least because it surprises me indeed perhaps it rather gratifies me that i appear to cast such terror into the bosom of the noble viscount lord chandos though i had not noticed it previously <e>", "<cs> my lords i will certainly endeavour to do so <e> <s> my advice is that the council has now agreed a draft budget for the whole of <e> <s> that will now go before

the first year <e> <s> this is why we have had to increase the overdraft so to say in this year <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord lord bruce of donington is making even by his standards a curiously hysterical intervention <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that this is a rigorous settlement which the united kingdom has been in the lead in negotiating <e> <s> our own share is less than it was last year and intervention stocks are on their way down <e> <s> there is no system of agricultural support known to me which will not provide imbalances and surpluses in some years <e> <s> one only has to look at the problems that other economies around the world have in this respect to know that <e> <s> that will be the case unless we all go back to fundamentally agricultural economies and i do not think that even the noble lord is suggesting that we should do that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful for the welcome given by the noble lord lord gladwyn with his knowledge and experience of the issue <e> <s> he has posed a hypothetical question to me <e> <s> i do not think the parliament would be so foolish as not to agree but if they do not agree we do not have a budget

is another issue <e> <s> it is indeed another issue which we are going to discuss next week and i suspect i shall have drawn the short straw once again in respect to that debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i am naturally very glad that the noble lord lord molloy is taking a stern view about the use of taxpayers money <e> <s> in respect of domestic politics i wish he took a similarly stern view from time to time <e> <s> of course european expenditure affects domestic economies as well <e> <s> i think strictures is probably too strong a word but i was responding to what seemed to me to be perhaps an exaggeratedly aggressive tone on the part of the noble lord lord bruce of donington <e> <s> i thought that he might for once be rather pleased with what we had succeeded in bringing off but i suppose that was nave of me <e>", "<cs> my lords on vat the agreement so far is that the vat rate would go to per cent next year but there is the fontainebleau abatement where the united kingdom is concerned which will work in our favour <e> <s> the noble lord will also be aware that my right honourable friend the chancellor in his budget speech ruled out changes to the vat base <e> <s> the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon is indeed right in saying that it is the british parliament which will dispose of the expenditure <e>", "<cs> my lords i have considerable sympathy as i think my noble friend is aware with the desire of manufacturers and exporters to have greater certainty but this is not a world in which certainty about exchange rate movements whether within the ems or outside it is very easy to achieve <e> <s> the fluctuations mentioned by my noble friend had they taken place within the exchange rate mechanism would not have been very material because as a second reserve currency linked to oil factors there would have been volatility for sterling in any case <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not rehearsing an objection to joining in principle <e> <s> indeed in my original answer to my noble friend i said that the government had no objection in principle <e> <s> i said that it was not as easy given petro-currency fluctuations as many people thought <e> <s> as to the governor of the bank of england he has been prayed in aid on this subject before so i took the precaution of looking up what he actually said <e> <s> it is somewhat equivocal support because the governor said that joining would produce other problems <e> <s> if i may quote him he said <e>", "<cs> my lords in logic i think my noble friend is quite right <e> <s> this is why the government have no objection in principle to joining <e> <s> the trouble is that movements of oil prices round the world are not dictated by logic and we are uniquely affected by them <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may respectfully say so to the noble lord he is wholly wrong <e> <s> even if only three per cent <e> <s> of our economy were affected by oil price movements that would have a very considerable effect on the movements of sterling <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that i can comment on the noble lords latter point because as i have said we would remain subject to petro-currency regulations and fluctuations even within the ems <e> <s> as to the noble lords former point i am glad if somewhat surprised to be rescued by the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon and i think <e>", "<cs> i sense that the committee may wish now to come to a decision on this issue and i shall simply try to respond to some of the specific points that have been made rather than rehearse all the arguments which have been well put <e> <s> speaking for myself i have found it an extraordinarily lively and interesting debate <e> <s> i say that as something of a rookie in local government legislation <e>", "<cs> i dealt with that point at the beginning of my remarks <e> <s> what i had in mind was pronouncements like that of the then official opposition spokesman on the environment mr kaufman when he said as late as december last year <e>", "<cs> if something cannot be said in about or minutes it is not worth saying <e> <s> this has been absolutely evident <e>", "<cs> i was certainly prepared to extend a metaphorical and ecumenical hand to the noble lord lord monkswell while congratulating him on the speed with which he has become an expert on the constitutional procedures and conventions of this house <e> <s> i think that the point raised by him and by the noble and learned lord lord wilson of langside and others about the salisbury and carrington conventions as they are called is that this house has every right indeed a duty to try to improve bills by revising them <e> <s> our problem in this case is that some latitude has been given to the word revision by a series of amendments which are designed to stop the bill from coming into effect <e> <s> that would i think perhaps be more convincing if the bill were first revised and then perhaps later there were suggestions that the bill should be delayed in coming into effect <e>", "<cs> i will give way but i should like to finish this point i think that this is a cruel and cynical use of unpolitical and unelected officials <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will use his new and considerable influence as a member of this house to ask all authorities to desist <e>", "<cs> i cannot believe that the noble lord believes that <e> <s> my only advice to him is to pull the other one <e>", "<cs> i have made clear when debating some previous amendments that the government consulted on aspects of this legislation not least in my own area concerning the arts and very considerable amendments were made <e> <s> if your lordships put forward amendments and carry them the government will consider them most carefully <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> my lords as someone who in normal life if that is the way to describe it is a small trader i can say that these limits and the thresholds are very important to me <e> <s> i shall look at the point which the noble lord makes about people who are starting businesses and we shall see what is the best that we can do <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that it is the nature of governments to be content with the present situation <e> <s> i do not know the state of negotiations with the ec but i shall try to find out <e>", "<cs> my lords again i would need prior notice of that question but one of the attractive features to governments of vat is that it is a very cost-effective method of tax collection because those who pay the tax collect it themselves <e>", "<cs> nonsense <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> i am not annoyed i am furious <e>", "<cs> the looks coming from the government front bench towards my noble friend lord bellwin are of universal love

particular level of resources to the historic buildings and monuments commission which may or may not be appropriate <e> <s> the historic buildings and monuments commission is committed i am glad to say because i share the noble baronesss interest in and approbation of archaeology in london and we are joined in that by the noble lord lord lloyd to providing financial support for archaeological research and investigation <e> <s> i am glad in an ecumenical spirit to congratulate the glc for what it has done over the years in this respect <e>", "<cs> if the noble baroness will do me the kindness of studying in <e>", "<cs> the noble lord asked me for clarification and i have just this minute given it so i rest on the clarification that i have given <e> <s> i believe that it is right

battersea arts centre and it is million <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> he has put great emphasis on these two points <e> <s> taking the latter point i would concede to this degree to him that it would be quite wrong for this minister or for any minister i think to encourage publicly-funded bodies in the idea that growth of public funding was pretty well infinite <e> <s> it is dictated by the growth of the economy as a whole and by no other considerations <e> <s> but the earlier point i do not concede to him <e> <s> the fact is that if you take cities such as bristol or glasgow there is precisely a multiple funding of the arts <e> <s> the taxpayers through the arts council give money and so does the local authority <e> <s> there is nothing that militates against district and borough councils giving money to the arts particularly in view of the very substantial savings i mentioned million for wandsworth alone which will result from this

the government which even if the nation is not at this moment hanging on my lips i hope that those worried and concerned people at a later stage will read what i have to say <e> <s> the fact is that this exercise of abolition where posts and employment are concerned is not an exercise designed to make a large number of people redundant <e> <s> it is an exercise designed over time to reduce posts

certain amount of time <e>", "<cs> i gave the substantive reasons for including this clause in the bill in moving the previous government amendment and i am sure that the committee would not wish me

making an unreasonable point because a per cent <e> <s> claim in the present climate is not an inconsiderable one <e>", "<cs> my lords if we look back at the past or years of the history of this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with every aspect of that except the use of the word arbitrary <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have gone a long way to implement the review body recommendations in respect of nurses <e> <s> that fact has been very widely acknowledged <e> <s> the fact remains that levels of pay are an important determinant of levels of employment <e> <s> at the moment most people tell us and i would certainly agree with them that the major issue facing this country is the level of employment and not rates of pay <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord and i and my colleagues lose few opportunities to commend the public services in this country <e> <s> one should not always take professional union representation as being a true indication of morale <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said it has been widely recognised that the government have gone as far as they possibly can in respect of the nurses whose services we all so much appreciate <e> <s> however some staging is needed on grounds of cost if service levels are not to be substantially reduced and i do not think that any of us want that either <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e>", "<cs> my lords i confess to some surprise and perhaps a little confusion when i saw that the noble baroness had tabled this amendment <e> <s> the surprise and confusion were occasioned by the fact that i had understood that the labour party had not been originally opposed to the requirement for the new ilea to consult the inner boroughs and the city at least where expenditure was concerned <e> <s> indeed amendments tabled by the noble baroness in committee and by her honourable friend the member for copeland in committee in another place did in fact seek to extend that consultation to other interested organisations <e> <s> but of course the noble baroness is entitled both as a noble and as a lady if i may say so to change her mind <e> <s> this she appears to have done <e>", "<cs> my lords i tried to deal with that very point at an earlier stage of my remarks <e> <s> the gist of my argument was quite simple <e> <s> i said that the new ilea will not have any direct link with any other authority in its area <e> <s> it will be a directly elected authority and its members will not necessarily be members of borough councils or of the city <e> <s> therefore it seems right to us that the councils in inner london should have adequate opportunity each year at least to comment upon the new ileas intended precept and upon issues which may affect the level of their precept because one tends to look upon local taxation in a package manner <e> <s> i certainly do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not concerned to criticise the procedures of the present ilea <e> <s> i was trying perhaps to import if you like into the new body those admirable qualities to which the noble baroness has given weight <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that my noble friend has made the point about the type of issues that should be aired very well <e>", "<cs> my lords while mildly regretting that the right reverend prelate has not allowed me to launch on an astonished house my beneficence on this occasion i can confirm that what he has said is largely right <e> <s> these amendments tidy up clause in the light of the amendments made to the then clause on the review of the new ilea at committee stage <e> <s> they also remove the power for my right honourable friend the secretary of state to transfer functions from the new ilea in the light of the now single discretionary review by order <e> <s> any such transfer would therefore require fresh primary legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord mentioned me so would he care to give way <e> <s> the arts council have not accused me of misleading anybody <e>", "<cs> my lords i sometimes have sympathy with the arguments of the noble lord lord jenkins because i know he shares my own interest in and passion for the arts <e> <s> but what usually riles me are the noble lords rhetorical and parenthetical asides <e> <s> it is always a great temptation not to sit on ones hands about them <e> <s> all governments i might point out to him are monetarist these days printing money has gone out of fashion <e> <s> if the country is sufficiently unfortunate as to have a labour government again in the foreseeable future i will bet the noble lord a grant of from each of us to any arts body which he cares to name that that government will employ a methodology of cash limits and monetary control just as any other government will <e>", "<cs> my lords i referred to glasgow and edinburgh precisely because the bill does not apply to them <e> <s> it would to me be a rather insulting notion to think that other cities in areas not affected by this legislation are not making a substantial contribution to the arts <e> <s> all i am suggesting is that under the legislation the various parts of the country are put on the same standing where local government and where arts funding are concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i am reluctant to interrupt the noble lord but what i have always said in various idioms is that there is no need for the arts to suffer as a result of abolition <e> <s> if people are wilfully determined that they should that is another matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly acknowledge to the noble lord lord strabolgi that he intended this amendment wholly constructively <e> <s> i acknowledge that he moved it in an attempt to be helpful and to ensure support for institutions which may be suffering from anxiety at a time of change <e> <s> the way the noble lord moved the amendment reflects the concern which the government share concerning the anxieties that may come about as a result of change especially perhaps in the context of certain integrated services <e> <s> i am thinking of the integrated museum services for example at present maintained by the tyne and wear and the south yorkshire metropolitan county councils <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be brief in my response to the arguments put forward on behalf of this amendment simply because much of what i have just said in response to the proposed new clause moved by the noble lord lord strabolgi is apposite in this context <e> <s> i pay tribute to the noble lord for his concern for museum and art gallery collections for which no specific statutory provision is appropriate but which are in a position of anxiety which i understand and with which i have some sympathy <e>", "<cs> my lords i felt for a moment that we were straying into the area of a wednesday debate on the economy and on employment rather than being on the report stage of a bill <e> <s> i felt a little confused by that because until i think september last year i usually replied to wednesday debates on employment and unemployment in your lordships house <e> <s> it is always a very severe temptation for me to do so all over again <e> <s> were i to yield to temptation i think i would stick to perhaps two or three themes <e> <s> they would certainly include a feeling that we have talked for an hour or so about employment issues without much mention of products customers the cost of labour or the cost of local or national taxes to employers <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the next amendment is on funding <e> <s> common sense suggests to me that the reduction in the precept liberates resources for whatever purposes the districts and the authorities may decide are desirable <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord cannot get away from the fact that local authorities have considerable discretion on spending overall and they must allocate priorities within that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am speaking to amendments nos <e> <s> azj and azk as well as to amendment no <e> <s> azh <e>", "<cs> my lords in general my noble friend is quite right <e> <s> i can give a short answer in the affirmative to his first question <e> <s> the points raised by his second question where broadly he is right i shall be dealing with in some detail in an amendment shortly after this one <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that if my noble friend reads what i have said she will receive considerable reassurance <e> <s> it is most unlikely that irreplaceable people will be replaced <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obviously disappointed because i thought that the noble lord lord mccarthy would be rather pleased with me <e> <s> he is not but i have to rest on what i said earlier <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment having been withdrawn it might be at this point for the convenience of the house if i repeated a statement that is being made in another place by my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer on banking supervision and johnson matthey bankers <e> <s> my right honourable friends statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the generally supportive reaction from the opposition benches to my right honourable friends statement <e> <s> the noble lord lord barnett asked about the discretion and independence of the governor of the bank of england in this context <e> <s> the governors independence has been accepted by successive governments <e> <s> individual judgments are always difficult and when there has been an upset of some kind any of us can make criticisms with the benefit of hindsight <e> <s> but in this field decisions need to be taken very quickly and it seems to me right that the governor should take them and be responsible for them <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that is right and i am most grateful for that endorsement of the remarks made in my right honourable friends statement as to the general health of the banking community <e> <s> that endorsement coming from one as experienced in both english and scottish banking as my noble friend is a clear signal which we welcome <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of any such cases but i shall investigate the matter and let my noble friend know <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that my noble friend would not be right to assume that the system of legislation covering banking activities was generally wrong because of this particular case rather should he and i think the house be encouraged at the speed at which my right honourable friend the government and the bank of england have agreed to make changes in the system both in terms of the internal ordering of the bank of englands supervisory division and in terms of my right honourable friends proposals to plug what may appear to be some legislative loopholes <e> <s> that seems to be the way empirically and sensibly to proceed <e> <s> as my right honourable friends statement said <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord who of course has a distinguished record as an auditor and an accountant for allowing me the loophole of writing to him <e> <s> having been plunged somewhat into the deep end of this statement in the middle of legislation on another issue i think that i shall yield to the temptation of taking him up on it <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that my noble friend is quite right <e> <s> we must of course learn lessons from what transpires <e> <s> there are lessons to be learnt from johnson matthey bankers itself and its history as well as from any shortcomings in the supervision division of the bank of england <e> <s> i think that everyone in the house who knows or knows of mr vander weyer will know of his ability and independence <e> <s> i hope that that will be an indicator of the kind of quality that we shall be able to command in attempting to learn those lessons <e>", "<cs> my lords i congratulate the noble lord lord rochester on deciding to leave tammany hall <e> <s> it is if i may say so an extremely <e>", "<cs> my lords it is if i may say so a far from salubrious environment for the noble lord i should like to get that on the record <e> <s> i am sorry that the noble lord lord dean in his previous remarks did not take the same decision <e> <s> i remember the fine show of indignation that the noble lord lord dean put on at about midnight on tuesday when he said that <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has had every opportunity <e>", "<cs> my lords if from a sitting position the noble lord is complaining that he was not able to speak to the amendment at past the other night why on earth can he not speak to it at a quarter past tonight <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the house will find that explanation more convincing than i do <e> <s> the fact is that on a previous series of amendments which the noble lord lord dean had every chance of speaking to but which he refused to speak to i went into great detail on precisely the issues that he is now raising in an intervention employment transfers protection and consultations with unions and other groups of workers on how best to protect their interests as individuals in a reorganisation of local government that affects them <e> <s> i believe that i did that with some clarity <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord when he comes to read it tomorrow will not rest on his criticism that i had nothing new detailed or important to say <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord rochester for giving way <e> <s> he indicated that i had disappointed him a little <e> <s> i disappointed him because i am afraid that the part of <e>", "<cs> my lords naturally i have no idea what price movements may be viable at the time <e> <s> the bank of englands own resources were involved in the rescue <e> <s> these come from profits derived from the banks own activities <e> <s> they are not voted by parliament and they are not drawn from taxes <e>", "<cs> my lords i usually agree with <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to the noble lord lord diamond the question on the order paper asked whether her majestys government intended to privatise johnson matthey bankers and i answered in the context of that question <e> <s> but my right honourable friend the chancellor has had discussions with the governor of the bank of england and he like i very much values that association <e> <s> the governor has agreed that in future rescue cases should such be necessary he will inform my right honourable friend of his concerns and intentions as fully and as far in advance as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords third reading is usually a reasonably ecumenical occasion and i do not want to reopen the controversies of a previous stage of the bill <e> <s> but i must say that i think that the noble lord lord dean of beswick taxed our patience a little at least on this side of the house and indulged in what i can only call a whopper which i would define as a statement exaggerated to a comically intense degree <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords i said that for procedural reasons it was not possible for me to accept certain of the proposals consequent upon the defeat of the government in this house at this stage of the bill <e> <s> we accepted the defeats and we shall therefore amend accordingly in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord graham for his welcome to the considerable strides forward that are being made by government and individuals in partnership <e> <s> i have no objection to conferences <e> <s> but as i said in my original answer that would of course be a matter for the industry and for the british film institute <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord jenkins implies there are two major collections of nitrate film held by commercial companies rather than by the british film institute for which i am responsible <e> <s> these two collections continue to generate considerable revenue which i believe the companies could well use to pay towards their duplication on to safety film <e> <s> i hope that the companies will notice what both noble lords have said <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that thanks to the good progress we are making this is the case <e> <s> but i shall of course keep the situation continually under review <e>", "<cs> my lords as i think the noble lord is well aware i have myself considerable reponsibilities for trying to avert disaster as he puts it and as a fellow film buff i do not think that that is too strong a term in the british film institute stock for which i am responsible <e> <s> i hope that the two great companies he mentioned will pay heed to his words and i am delighted to encourage them <e> <s> i understand that the british film institute would welcome the opportunity to carry out the duplication on a commercial basis and should the companies sponsor this the institute could apply for an award under my business sponsorship incentive scheme <e> <s> so i hope that that too will happen <e>", "<cs> my lords in my answers i have tried to show that i am aware of the importance of this issue in terms of the national film archive <e> <s> as i said the question of a conference is a matter for the british film institute <e> <s> but should it be interested in calling one i am sure that i should be most pleased to participate <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this house do agree with the commons in their amendments nos <e> <s> and and do not insist on their amendment no <e> <s> to which the commons have disagreed <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friends statement which i repeated to the house was of course in the nature of an interim statement in order to honour my right honourable friends pledge to keep the house informed <e> <s> i am glad to have had the opportunity to keep your lordships in the picture as well <e> <s> i shall have to leave it at that as investigations are under way <e> <s> we shall have to see what they produce <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord makes an interesting suggestion though as he has said for question time it is perhaps a little far-reaching in its implications <e> <s> it seems to me that on the whole the economies of the western world are benefiting from these new monetary habits <e>", "<cs> my lords the government keep a very close watch on monetary aggregates as the house would expect <e> <s> i agree with my noble friend that there have been some rather eccentric movements in m recently but i am glad to tell my noble friend and the opposition that m has been behaving impeccably <e>", "<cs> my lords the government think that the monetary aggregate indications of the present rates of inflation are broadly right and are a great deal better than the behaviour of any of the monetary aggregates when the noble lord was chief secretary to the treasury <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be saying something along these lines in a very few minutes when we come to debate the finance bill but the situation has changed a little since the s <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i am glad to acquit the noble lord lord beswick of low political behaviour <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that he is sceptical of whether the banking institutions should be the proper sources of supply in this area and we are less sceptical <e> <s> as i say it is a somewhat knotty issue to take up in a question and answer session <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords the only reason that a very brief expression of mirth crossed my face was that any civil engineer worth his salt would be arguing for increased civil work <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord leaves the question of the monetary conditions could he explain to us as indeed i challenged him to do in my speech why if policy of this kind is far too tight and restrictive and interest rates are far too high business is investing at the pace that it is <e>", "<cs> my lords i am simply interrupting because that is not what i said <e> <s> i said that i did not blame people for not taking low-paid jobs if they could do better without taking them <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord wants to distort my words <e> <s> of course some people who are looking for it cannot find work of any kind <e> <s> a large number of people make the from their point of view quite sensible economic decision not to take low-paid jobs <e> <s> everyone knows that <e> <s> it is perfectly evident <e>", "<cs> my lords i was grateful for the early remarks of the noble lord who was nice to and about me <e> <s> i think he was probably trying to shield me from the <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the house <e> <s> i am caught at a disadvantage <e> <s> it was my understanding that i was to reply to an amendment moved by the noble lord lord banks <e> <s> am i wrong about that <e>", "<cs> i beg your lordships pardon <e> <s> my lords after that not very auspicious beginning may i now consider commons amendments nos <e> <s> to on clause <e> <s> i beg to move that this house do not insist on their amendment no <e> <s> to which the commons have disagreed and do agree with the commons in their amendments nos <e> <s> to in lieu thereof <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are satisfied that the legal position is as stated in the white paper namely that neither depositors staff trustees nor the government themselves own the trustee savings banks <e> <s> the government were aware at all material times that a scottish qc the mr john murray who has been referred to had given advice to the contrary in and perhaps we should note that this was prior to the legislation in which now applies <e> <s> both the government and the tsbs have received further advice which has disagreed with mr murrays opinion <e> <s> in my judgment it would be quite wrong to hold up parliaments consideration of legislation because a court was considering a case which might have some bearing on the subject before parliament <e> <s> the proposals now embodied in this bill were announced three years ago <e> <s> the house can draw its own conclusions from the fact that the attempt to test ownership in the courts was started at the very last moment and at the end of the parliamentary session <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only repeat that it is my view that it would be wrong to hold up parliaments consideration of legislation or the consequences of that legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords the bill would of course become law if it is passed but my advice is that it would not be put into operation before the vesting day <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i have answered the point about which the noble lord is anxious <e> <s> as this matter is a bit technical and i am not alas a scottish lawyer i shall repeat what i said <e> <s> if contrary to the advice that the government have received and i spelt out that advice earlier the court finds against tsb scotland the government will consider their action in the light of the courts judgment <e> <s> i cannot commit the government to any course of action in circumstances that are hypothetical and based on all the advice that the government have had highly unlikely <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may reply with the leave of the house <e> <s> it would be an astonishing action to delay parliamentary business because some matter was before the courts <e> <s> obviously the government have to take into account to put it at its mildest any findings of the courts <e> <s> no legislation or very little would pass at any stage if it were simply to he delayed while court hearings for which any citizen can apply were taking place <e> <s> however what should give the noble lord and indeed the house reassurance is that my advice is that any outcome hypothetical as it is in favour of the appeal would delay the consequences of vesting day <e> <s> therefore that is a separate issue <e> <s> the assurances which have been given by the trustee savings bank scotland also bear that out <e>", "<cs> my lords remote and cut off as one sometimes suspects the treasury may be i do not think that they are wholly without recourse to scottish law <e> <s> i should point out to the noble lord that my noble friend the former economic secretary to the treasury while he may not be a lawyer is certainly a scot and it would not be beyond the wit of the treasury to have access to scots lawyers <e> <s> there is a very distinguished scots lawyer sitting beside me on the front bench at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i believe that we are getting very far from consideration of the commons amendments <e> <s> because noble lords are interested in this issue and because i am the last person to set myself up as an authority on the procedure of your lordships i have been listening as avidly as the rest of the house to the remarks and answers of my noble and learned friend the lord advocate <e> <s> i think however that we should probably now complete this business in respect of the consideration of the commons amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords it was a freudian slip <e>", "<cs> my lords i inadvertently said a freudian slip <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect that is not the same thing at all <e>", "<cs> my lords i for one am not surprised that the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby has taken the line that we have all had a good go at the issues raised by this motion to insist on the lords amendment no <e> <s> to the bill <e> <s> no less than three liberal front bench speakers have made the case of insisting but it is the same case that the noble lord lord banks and some of his noble friends put forward in your lordships house on no less than three occasions during the passage of the bill <e> <s> i am therefore simply going to summarise very briefly the arguments that we feel there are against the case and then we shall have to come to a view upon it <e>", "<cs> my lords it is my sense that your lordships wish to take a view of this matter <e> <s> i must say that i live in some fear of a massive vote in favour of reducing my own salary which is no princely sum <e>", "<cs> if i were to delay your lordships for any length of time <e> <s> the noble lord lord rochester made a marvellously characteristic liberal speech <e> <s> he said that he had no quarrel with the recommendations of the top salaries review board but was supposed to have a quarrel with the government and so he had to think of something to quarrel with the government about <e> <s> apart from that this was a first-class and fascinating debate <e> <s> although i acknowledge a little prejudice i thought that the tail-end batsmen all scored about not out <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps on a subsequent occasion i will analyse the word agony with the right reverend prelate <e> <s> it was an extremely difficult decision as it always would be <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it would be well for the opposition benches to remember that these recommendations were not made by the government <e> <s> the people who made the recommendations which the government have accepted were <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the debate in the name of the noble lord lord mccarthy very much and therefore am grateful to him <e> <s> but i am afraid also that old political suspicions die hard <e> <s> i too am a little suspicious of the reasons which may have led the noble lord to table this motion at a time when our unemployment statistics show the largest half-year decline than at any point in the last dozen years <e>", "<cs> took the oath <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to all those noble lords who have spoken and indeed for their welcoming me back <e> <s> this made me feel that i almost ought to have asked for your lordships indulgence as a maiden speaker <e> <s> nevertheless it was very kind and the debate was also gratifying to all those who believe that this house is perhaps the best house for measured consideration of issues of this kind <e>", "<cs> everything the noble baroness has just said we always listen to her on these matters with such attention could be applied to the core subjects of the national curriculum <e> <s> yet as i understand it the purpose of the amendment to which she has lent her name is worry about the apparent lack of flexibility in respect of what are called the foundation subjects <e> <s> for just a minute i wish to address the mind of the committee to this rather worrying but pervasive feeling about the bill that it is rigid and in some way not flexible and that such rigidity and lack of flexibility militates against children of special and exceptional ability i think my noble friend lord beloff admirably dealt with that point or the children who were the concern of my noble friend lord joseph <e> <s> these children while in no sense being educationally subnormal were likely to find themselves at the lower levels of attainment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now read a third time <e>", "<cs> following my noble friend i want to say that it is surely incontrovertible that privatisation has to be tried before it becomes very popular because over the past years of our history it has been a relatively novel phenomenon <e> <s> i think too that my noble friend lord pym in a characteristically trenchant and persuasive speech neglected the fact that it is the chance of a reasonable profit that attracts funds for investment <e> <s> he underplayed the argument of the noble lord lord wyatt of weeford that there are a number of people out there in the capital markets who believe very strongly in growth for the water industry and want to achieve it not by ripping off the consumer so to say or by jacking up prices but by looking to greater efficiencies and cost-cutting as well as opportunities for investment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has quite a different interpretation from mine <e> <s> i said that were i in the noble lords shoes i should think twice about doing so <e>"]
