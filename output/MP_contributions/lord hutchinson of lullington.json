["<cs> my lords the noble lord has mentioned the cuts to the arts council of million <e> <s> does he think it proper for any government to claw back million which has already been <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the noble lord lord foot on this and in everything he has said as to the enormous waste of time in criminal trials taken up with the disputes about what is or what is not said in police stations <e> <s> the trouble about this suggestion for legalised detention is that it has opened a whole new area for the increase in this vast waste of time in criminal trials <e> <s> surely the reality of what is going to happen is that someone will he detained for up to six hours and during that period they will make an alleged confession possibly to an extremely serious offence <e> <s> under this clause that person should have been cautioned before he was questioned <e> <s> he comes out of the detention eventually and sees a solicitor <e> <s> the first thing he will say and he may well be right is i was never cautioned <e> <s> we all know that the caution in fact goes by the board we all know that people are not cautioned and whether or not one is cautioned can never be proved <e> <s> it is the word of the police officer against the detainee <e> <s> so there will be endless disputes about whether or not the caution was administered and whether this confession would be admissible <e>", "<cs> i take exactly the opposite view <e>", "<cs> may i ask the minister whether he will make it his business to see that these circulars go to the professional bodies of the lawyers <e> <s> very often circulars go to courts about which the lawyers know nothing at all <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to start by congratulating the government on taking a step towards the implementation of the phillimore report <e> <s> as regards human rights some progress in this direction even after six years is a matter for congratulation <e> <s> the bill i agree with the noble lord lord renton is simply drafted and is clear and it is perhaps what one might call a well-dressed ewe lamb <e> <s> i would agree with and i support certain parts of this bill <e> <s> the unintentional prejudice to legal proceedings will only be caught where a publication causes those proceedings to be seriously impeded or prejudiced the three defences are provided in clauses and <e>", "<cs> i should like to support my noble friend on this amendment <e> <s> in my submission a matter of principle is raised <e> <s> i shall not of course refer to the case which has given rise to the amendment particularly as i myself played a very small part in it <e> <s> but the matter of principle is important and it seems to me to be as follows <e> <s> should it be possible to limit or hedge round the reporting of or commenting on matters which form part of the public record of proceedings in a court of law save where the court has the power to forbid publication <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful for those last words coming from the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor if i may say so a most enjoyable but difficult ex-client <e> <s> i am bound to say on the question of research that when the learned lord advocate says that the clause does not seek to distinguish between good and bad research that is really the essence of the objection to it <e> <s> i am afraid i remain filled with impartial malevolence towards that type of research <e>", "<cs> when one is just about to give an example one always finds that the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor has experienced the situation one is going to give in a far more excessive form than any example one can give oneself <e> <s> i am rather surprised that he would not welcome with open arms this amendment <e> <s> he talks about making a mouthful but surely these eight or nine lines are in themselves a mouthful <e> <s> all that is wanted is simply a provision for the disruption of the court proceedings <e> <s> surely to be insulted is an occupational hazard that all those who go to court are prepared to accept and suffer and regrettably there are justices of the peace throughout the land who have a somewhat inflated view of their own importance <e>", "<cs> may i say to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor who has thundered about the sutcliffe case that the law at the time of the sutcliffe case was in relation to proceedings being imminent <e> <s> it is perfectly obvious in view of what the noble and learned lord has said that the <e>", "<cs> my lords as chairman of the trustees of the tate gallery may i ask the minister whether he is aware that a very distinguished architect mr james stirling has been engaged by the trustees to design this building and that access to the building will indeed be from the gallery itself and from the outside <e> <s> may i ask the minister enlarging perhaps the sense of the question whether he is aware that the tate gallery now has become one of the greatest museums of modern art in the world and that the rate of expansion of the gallery must therefore exceed the rate of any other museum of fine arts in the country <e> <s> in those circumstances would the minister urge the government to give the development of the rest of the site urgent priority so that the public are able as the minister agrees they are entitled to be able to see the works which we acquire which we are at the moment quite unable to put on show <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i might with all the modesty that i can command reply quickly to one or two of the things which the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor has said <e> <s> he has spoken of stick and if i add a little more stick i know i will be forgiven <e> <s> i say it with no disrespect but the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor seemed to me to be somewhat like a stag at bay at this stage of the debate <e> <s> can it really be that everybody who is concerned with this question in the law is out of step <e> <s> can it he that everybody the lord chief justice of england the noble and learned lord lord edmund-davies the whole of the criminal bar association the bar itself the solicitors and all those who took part in the debate in another place is out of step there being not one single speaker in this chamber to support the noble and learned lord <e> <s> can it be that he alone speaks on this matter with the correct truth and authority and that everybody else is wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords we are debating this evening a situation of extreme crisis in the prison service <e> <s> i should like to thank the noble earl <e>", "<cs> it is not a question of their responsibility but of their interest in the question my lords <e> <s> for too long members of the judiciary and i say members of my own profession have taken the attitude that their job is to get on with the trial of persons and offences to see that the law is obeyed and that defendants get a fair trial <e> <s> when the trial is over they pay no attention to what happens to their clients to those persons who appear in court after sentence has been pronounced <e> <s> for too long has that gone on and we have seen that one of the main causes of the appalling situation in the prisons is the inability of the judiciary and the judiciary come from the legal profession to understand that shorter sentences must be passed that we must move with the times that we must see what happens in other <e>", "<cs> my lords i am only too happy to hear those words fall from the noble and learned lord who sits upon the woolsack and of course i entirely accept that that is the situation <e> <s> if that is the situation and i accept that it is and that constant meetings are taking place between the home secretary and the lord chief justice on this vital matter then i sincerely hope that as i mentioned earlier some solution will be found rather than have to resort to an amnesty to which i fear the home secretary might finally have to resort <e> <s> that was suggested by the noble lord who spoke earlier and it would be an amnesty which would be the absolutely final solution making clear the total failure of any controlled or thought out policy <e>", "<cs> i am so sorry i did not hear the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> then i am obviously wrongly informed my lords <e> <s> i had understood and unfortunately i do not have the context with me but i have seen it otherwise i would not have mentioned it that in fact he supported this idea but then made up his mind to drop it <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely and absolutely agree with the noble baroness <e> <s> i think i said earlier in my speech that priority a crash programme for hostels for that very purpose is one of the vital necessities at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord pay no attention to what the lord chief justice has said to all those whose duty it is to sentence persons in the courts to attempt to pass shorter sentences <e> <s> and if he does not pay attention to that would he tell us why not <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister tell the house whether the hostile reaction to the proposal came from the judiciary <e>", "<cs> i support this amendment as a practising lawyer <e> <s> i would urge that the amendment raises a fundamenal question of principle and of common-sense <e> <s> i am very sad that the noble and learned lord lord rawlinson should have dealt with this amendment on a personal basis and if i may say so on a political basis <e> <s> on that matter miss harriet harman to my own knowledge is a most honourable and upright solicitor who would not have dreamt of doing anything as an officer of the court if she had not considered that what she was doing was perfectly within the law <e> <s> it is only right <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a bill like so many criminal justice bills in the past which contains many good provisions set out in something of a rag-bag set out at inordinate length in some cases and often with a lack of clarity <e> <s> it will be a bit of a nightmare for lawyers let alone the ordinary lay magistrate <e> <s> but basically it fails to get to the root of the real malaise in the criminal process <e> <s> my feeling about this debate is that it is taking place in a somewhat sombre atmosphere first because of the great complexity of the bill and secondly because as i said we all feel that it does not take the opportunity to get to the root of the malaise in this criminal process of ours <e>", "<cs> may i come back to the basis of the question that arises from the amendment <e> <s> what we are dealing with are the young people who are in local prisons and surely the minister would agree with the prison and borstal governors association who have described that situation as being a national scandal <e> <s> i should like to ask the minister not whether things are not as simple as they appear but why some effort cannot be made immediately to build into the prison programme remand centres which are suitable for the type of person whom the noble baroness has just mentioned the person who needs to be locked up but is not requiring in any shape or form the kind of security which is provided in a local prison <e> <s> this national scandal should be <e>", "<cs> before the minister replies to that i wonder whether he can also enlighten us <e> <s> if the rgime has the benefits that he has indicated why are girls deprived of the privilege of undergoing the short sharp shock as much as boys <e>", "<cs> i support what the noble baroness lady birk was saying from the practical experience point of view because i think these words <e>", "<cs> the minister is saying that we must face up to reality <e> <s> that is what the amendment is all about reality <e> <s> the reality is that with all the magnificent provisions for young people there comes a moment under detention sentence when the court says this person is not eligible for a short sentence in a detention centre because he is not fit mentally or physically <e> <s> then what happens <e> <s> that person is given days or whatever the period is in a youth custody centre <e> <s> as i understand it the minister has not made it clear the rgime in a youth custody institution is not suitable for a very short sentence <e> <s> it upsets the training which is being provided in such a centre <e>", "<cs> may i ask the minister why under this proposed clause the court is given not only the same powers as the supervisor i understand that was really the purpose of the clause but in being given these negative powers is not limited as is the supervisor by the limitation of days <e> <s> it would appear that for some reason the court is being given not only the same powers as the supervisor but is being given the added negative powers of which complaint is made without any limitation <e> <s> on the face of it therefore a court unlike a supervisor can impose a negative limitation of unlimited amount <e>", "<cs> so far as this debate has been concerned the only thing which has not surprised me is that all those who have spoken from northern ireland have spoken in different voices and the only voice we have not heard is that of the noble earl lord longford who might have resolved all the differences <e>", "<cs> one has always the same view put forward when it is suggested that this country might take some notice of what happens in other countries <e> <s> one is always told that this country is unique is exceptional we can pass longer sentences here we can send more people to prison here and it is no good looking elsewhere to see what other people do <e> <s> in fact the per cent <e> <s> remission has applied in northern ireland and i must say still to the end that <e>", "<cs> i must intervene having heard what my noble friend lord harris said about long-serving prisoners having their imprisonment reviewed <e> <s> i am absolutely astonished that anybody could have held the office that he held and be completely blind to the psychology of these people who are locked up for or years <e> <s> one must ask oneself with great respect whether he has ever spoken either to these people or to their families <e> <s> the whole of my experience all those people that i have appeared for and who unfortunately on rare occasions have been convicted and have served sentences of long periods of imprisonment with whom i have kept in touch and visited on many occasions shows that the one overwhelming thing to keep those people sane whatever they have done is as has already been mentioned some form of hope <e>", "<cs> i accept that <e> <s> perhaps then it is amazing that my noble friend does not appreciate that the knowledge that their sentence will be reviewed come what may come what the governor may think of it come what the professional experts may think come what the judges may think gives them the hope that possibly as a result of their behaviour their example or what they have done a change will be made <e>", "<cs> quite shortly i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> having listened again to my noble friend lord harris he may have divested himself of his office but he is still if i may say so with the greatest respect wrapped in the stifling cotton wool of the home office official brief <e> <s> it is remarkable that i am entitled to say that if my noble friend lord hunt was here he would be supporting this amendment <e>", "<cs> i drew the committees attention in moving this amendment to the fact that that rule has been tested in the court of appeal and the court of appeal has said that it is not mandatory <e> <s> as a result no one takes the slightest notice of it <e>", "<cs> i cannot say that the report of the noble lord the minister is in any way satisfactory <e> <s> perhaps i might start to reply shortly to this debate by saying to the noble baroness lady masham that there is no magic in the days which could quite easily be lowered at some later date <e> <s> the days was simply taken as a successful part of the scottish criminal process <e> <s> the noble lord the minister has now i am glad to say agreed that he was wrong about the rule which has been held to be not mandatory in this country <e> <s> perhaps i may inform him as a lawyer that all mandatory means is that the court must follow it <e> <s> that rule having been made in the court of appeal it simply is not followed and is merely a pious expression of hope <e>", "<cs> no he is released altogether and acquitted in the sense that he can never again be charged with that particular offence <e>", "<cs> i can only say to your lordships that it is not and that the whole of ones experience in the criminal courts is that it is the prosecution that sets the timetable <e> <s> it is the prosecution which has to get the case committed <e> <s> it is the prosecution which has to draw the indictment and <e>", "<cs> i appreciate that <e> <s> i feel that i shall have to test the feeling of the committee on this matter <e>", "<cs> i am very glad to hear what the noble lord the minister has said about the lord chief justice issuing some proposals for seeing that short sentence appeals are given some special treatment as a matter of urgency <e> <s> i should like to take the opportunity of paying a compliment to the efforts which the registrar at the court of appeal criminal division always makes if one asks him to try to expedite appeals of this kind <e> <s> i know that every effort is made to do so <e> <s> nevertheless the delays continue to be too long <e> <s> but i am encouraged by what the minister has said particularly in his opening words and i would ask him whether in the period which elapses before this matter comes back further thought could be given to this idea of the crown court judge of trial of course it would have to be the judge of trial when the amendment is properly drafted being given this power <e> <s> as the minister said he is wholly on the side of the idea and apart from the procedures which are now laid down for putting your appeal in writing taking it to the registrars office and so on we are surely all agreed that we might expedite these appeals in a very simple way by giving the judge power to grant bail in proper cases <e> <s> so would the government consider bringing this forward as an idea at a later stage <e> <s> but in the circumstances i am content to beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i would very much like to support this amendment although again not as an expert in opportuning nevertheless as an expert in the sense that i have spent a lot of time in magistrates courts on one side or the other in these cases <e> <s> surely this is a nuisance offence if ever there was one and surely here at last is an amendment which could be accepted by the government <e> <s> it is the greatest and most monumental waste of time to have these vice squads in centres of high population spending hours going round public lavatories and drilling holes in walls hiding themselves behind tanks and very often <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord <e>", "<cs> far from pushing at the open door i intend to push the door shut if it is not too late to do so and to oppose this amendment <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord diplock has said that he knows no judge who would do other than support this amendment <e> <s> so far as the bar is concerned there is a very strong division of opinion about it for reasons which i shall outline <e>", "<cs> if i am wrong about that then i apologise at once <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that this proposal of course formed part of the package which was put forward at that time by the criminal law revision committee <e>", "<cs> my lords there seems to be considerable support in the house for the amendment <e> <s> i should like to say two things <e> <s> i wish to address one of the points to the noble baroness who was so mystified by the type of people with whom we are dealing and i seemed to notice in her observations a rather basic hostility to lawyers in general <e> <s> i should like to assure her that the amendment contains no advantage to lawyers because if it were passed instead of the nice long journeys to london which have been referred to lawyers would be deprived of the privilege of a night in london as well as a fee for applying in london for bail all of which they could do on the fee that is marked on the one brief at the trial <e>", "<cs> i should like to complete what i was saying to the noble baroness <e> <s> we are dealing with ordinary people who are being tried by a crown court judge <e> <s> the crown court judge has been entitled to grant such people bail during the trial <e> <s> he has made up his own mind about the seriousness of the offence the type of offence and the background of the defendant <e> <s> from day to day during the trial at adjournments before the trial or during the months which may elapse before the defendant is committed and heard the crown court judge can grant bail <e> <s> the judge knows all about the particular defendant <e> <s> the amendment proposes that whether or not the case is a serious one when the trial is over armed with all the information the judge can continue the bail that has previously been granted <e> <s> having used his discretion in the one case the judge would be enabled to use his discretion when the trial is over <e> <s> there is no mystery about it that is simply the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord the minister to be extremely careful of adding offences to a list <e> <s> the trouble about lists of offences is that everybody always thinks of the most serious case <e> <s> in the criminal law you can have the most trivial examples of serious cases <e> <s> for instance there is here rape <e> <s> people do not appreciate that all rape is having sexual intercourse with someone against that persons consent and in many cases of rape it is a very marginal question as to whether the girl agreed or did not agree <e> <s> sometimes it is only just on a matter of balance and the judge does not send the person to prison as a result because he takes the view that it was a very fifty-fifty situation <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i will be brief but to hear the noble lord lord elton say that a judge takes into account the amount of remission that is to be awarded is absolutely against all principles of sentencing <e> <s> no judge in this country ever takes into account the amount of remission <e> <s> he is trained not to do so <e> <s> it is nothing to do with him whatever <e> <s> i really would ask the minister to think again before he makes an observation of that kind <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the criminal process in this country is concerned this report of the royal commission is probably the most important document that has emerged since the war <e> <s> it is a great pity therefore that the first time that this matter has been debated in your lordships house should be at such a late hour at the fag-end of the session and in an almost empty chamber <e> <s> i think it is a pity also that we are debating this part of the report separated from the rest of it <e> <s> nevertheless i too am grateful to my noble friend lord wigoder for introducing this debate even if it is a hurried and inadequate one <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say a few words in support of the amendment and at the same time support what the noble baroness has just said on the basis of reality <e> <s> i would ask the minister to think again about this question since as the white paper stated the clause has been inserted to <e>", "<cs> my lords as the original mover of the amendment for which this amendment is substituted i should like to welcome the substitution and to express to the minister my gratitude and that of my colleagues as well as the gratitude of the all-party penal affairs group for the form in which these amendments have come forward <e> <s> it seems to me that the work which has been done on this amendment has been substantial and it seems to have put into effect the wishes of this house <e> <s> i must say as a comparative novice in these matters that it would never have occurred to me that the knock-on effect of putting forward an amendment of this kind could be so complex and so complicated as it now appears to be <e> <s> indeed it is perhaps illustrative of why officials very often resist the putting forward of very simple reforms <e>", "<cs> my lords although indebted to my noble friend lord wigoder i must <e>", "<cs> of course i accept that that happens from time to time <e> <s> certainly in all these cases that i have checked in the central criminal court the correct and proper course was followed of the jurymen reporting to the judge in the court <e>", "<cs> my lords not for the first time i seem to have misled the jury <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble earl for introducing this bill as he did with such clarity and to say that on this bench we wholeheartedly welcome it <e> <s> i should like if i may to congratulate the minister for the arts on yet another fine achievement <e> <s> may i also make an apology on behalf of my noble friend lord donaldson who of course should be taking this bill for my party <e> <s> he is overseas at the moment <e> <s> and also for my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite right if i may say so <e> <s> as he has raised this subject i should like to say a word about reappointment <e> <s> i should have thought that there was great advantage in not having the power to re-appoint trustees immediately <e> <s> if you have the power to reappoint trustees immediately it arouses expectation in the trustees and it attracts a certain amount of pressure upon the chairman and indeed upon the staff and the director to re-appoint this trustee or that trustee <e> <s> it is very much easier and healthier for the term of the trustees period to come to an end without any question and for that trustee to be able to be reappointed after a certain period has elapsed <e>", "<cs> i think we would all agree that the noble viscount has done a great service <e>", "<cs> before the minister replies may i say that i would be mildly against the amendment <e> <s> i am against what has already been referred to as a shopping list <e> <s> when replying on behalf of the government about the trustees the noble earl said that the view of the government is that it is the personal qualities rather than the categories which are important <e> <s> rather than that there should be a second-rate artist or a poor craftsman or a desiccated civil servant ora committed sociologist ora worn-out financier on my board of trustees i would much prefer to have a plain farmer who has a passion and an interest in the subject matter of the museum <e> <s> in the end i suggest that it is personal qualities rather than categories which matter <e>", "<cs> i am totally against this amendment <e> <s> it seems to me that one is treating trustees like children at school <e> <s> if one tries to legislate for this sort of thing it is most undignified <e> <s> if a chairman of a board of trustees cannot get proper attendance at his own board meetings then he should not continue to be chairman <e> <s> one cannot try to regulate peoples behaviour in this way <e> <s> one has a vision of what would happen when somebody has got stuck in traffic <e> <s> it will be said old bloggs <e> <s> this will be the third time <e> <s> he has not rung up <e> <s> why is he not here <e> <s> we had better say that it is with our approval just in case <e> <s> the situation becomes idiotic and i suggest that the amendment is not necessary <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment <e> <s> i entirely agree that it is time that what i have referred to as recycling of trustees came to an end <e> <s> there are occasions when we must at last put this type of thing into the form of legislation <e> <s> there should be one exception and that is where we can say that there is <e> <s> in fact an advantage in having a liaison trustee moving from one museum to another <e> <s> an example at the moment is the tate gallery and the national gallery each of which has a reciprocal trustee sitting on the board of the other museum <e> <s> this seems to me to be a very great advantage <e> <s> therefore i personally would very much support the amendment if it could be phrased so that there was an exception in cases where a liaison trustee was thought to be desirable <e> <s> that would cover a multitude of situations where one museum and this might be of great benefit had a trustee who was on both boards <e> <s> otherwise it is high time that recycling came to an end <e> <s> i hope that during the debates on this bill we will get down as other noble lords have said to discussing how we can broaden and deepen the trawl of trustees <e>", "<cs> my lords we have heard a very entertaining contribution from the noble lord lord annan <e> <s> there were two great omissions from what he said <e> <s> there is first of all the situation i think he would agree with me that he speaks alone for the institution which with such distinction he chairs <e> <s> the whole of his staff i understand are against the views that he has expressed and of course i do not speak for his other trustees <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may interrupt the noble lord for one moment may i ask him to explain why he thinks that this procedure is not followed at the moment between the trustees and staff of national museums <e>", "<cs> because it works very well <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment <e> <s> the parallel drawn by the noble viscount is not quite accurate because members of the arts council are not trustees <e> <s> it is a different situation <e> <s> the trouble about the whole matter of chairmen of trustees in relation to the arts is that so much in the arts is considered by those who are not participating as being political <e> <s> in other words if a museum purchases works of art which a right-wing government think are beyond the pale and too advanced immediately they have a political criticism to them <e> <s> equally a government of the left if a museum purchases traditional art after a time will say these are a lot of right-wing fuddy-duddies <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to support the amendment <e> <s> i have a particularly warm feeling that in doing so i am on the same side as those who have put forward the amendment and that on this occasion i am with the with it and forward-looking members of this house <e> <s> i have already said that i support in every way a broader and deeper trawl for trustees of museums <e> <s> i am sure that it makes a profound difference if you can say to potential trustees that they will receive some form of remuneration to cover the amount of money which they will lose by doing this job <e> <s> if this amendment goes forward i am wondering whether some arrangement for loss of earnings in the form of an attendance fee or something like that could be devised in order to assist people to give the kind of service which so many of them want to give <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like briefly and with modesty to add our congratulations from these benches to the noble earl for his unfailing courtesy and his co-operative attitude throughout the bill <e> <s> i should like personally to say how grateful i am to him for the way in which he resisted so resolutely the seductive charm of the attempt by the noble viscount lord eccles to undermine the whole trustee system under which the museums were to operate in this bill <e> <s> let me say to the noble earl that a good radical quickly sniffs out a reactionary wolf masquerading beneath a with-it sheepskin coat <e> <s> it was not long before those of us here saw the dangers inherent in the noble viscounts amendments <e> <s> i am so glad that the noble minister was not long in seeing the same dangers himself <e> <s> i should like also as regards the other part of the bill to thank the noble earl on behalf of my noble friend lord kennet who unfortunately cannot be here today particularly in relation to the redrafted clause towards which he made such a significant contribution <e>", "<cs> my lords this debate opened with a marvellously constructed speech by the most reverend primate but i must say that the contributions made by the other two holders of great offices of state the noble and learned lord the lords chancellor and the lord chief justice filled me with a degree of disappointment <e> <s> although i hold both of them in the greatest possible respect and affection if i may say so their contributions seemed to me to be very strong on condemnation but both of them were weak on the essence of thisdebate which is after all the search for new procedures and new remedies <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am most grateful to the noble earl for initiating this debate <e> <s> it is most gratifying that it should be initiated by someone who is a practising artist <e> <s> it must be i would have thought almost unique in this chamber <e> <s> it has also been a great privilege to have heard in this chamber the speeches that we have heard so far this evening on this subject <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the somewhat farcical amount of time allowed for this debate does not reflect the governments view of the importance of the arts <e> <s> i fear that many may take that view <e>", "<cs> my lords it is clear from this debate that your lordships take the view that this is a bill of pre-eminent importance <e> <s> certainly those of us who speak from these benches take that view as my noble friend lord hooson who apologises for not being able to be here at the end of the debate has already made very clear <e>", "<cs> my lords the point that i was making was that it was in the code but not in the bill and that what is in the code will be disregarded <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment <e> <s> i suggest that it is an important amendment perhaps one of the most important amendments which have been put forward to the bill <e> <s> your lordships will appreciate that the extent of the power which is being given to the police in part i of the bill is very great indeed <e> <s> i imagine that the purpose of this amendment is to limit that power <e> <s> the argument will no doubt be put forward by the noble minister that this power has already been wielded by the metropolitan police force and other police forces in certain municipal areas for very many years <e> <s> i am anxious that the committee should appreciate that in my submission that is simply not so <e>", "<cs> may i support this amendment because once again the purpose is to try realistically to limit these extensive powers <e> <s> it was very heartening to hear the noble lord the minister saying a few moments ago that he conceded that it was necessary to impose restrictions upon this very wide power <e> <s> in the second reading debate the noble and learned lord lord scarman enjoined us all to put our minds to the safeguards in this bill <e> <s> he said that he was very troubled by the safeguards and on the phrase reasonable grounds he asked rhetorically the question who is to judge what is reasonable <e> <s> he suggested that as time went by the police view of what is reasonable would take over <e>", "<cs> may i say a word to the noble minister about this amendment <e> <s> here is a situation where someone has been stopped and searched <e> <s> let us presume that he is in possession of an article totally innocently and the police officer seizes the article and that is the end of the incident <e>

officer is going to take any action about it the person committing the offence must be warned that he may be prosecuted <e> <s> surely what appears in the road traffic act ought to appear here <e> <s> it is a much more serious matter for someone to have property taken away fom him and then later be charged with being in possession of it knowing that it is stolen or some similar charge <e>", "<cs> on behalf of those who sit on these benches i should like to add that we agree with what has just been said <e> <s> it was a great relief to hear the tone in which the noble lord lord elystan-morgan

about this looking at it as a practitioner <e> <s> what is to happen in court when one wishes to take the point that in fact the officer behaved unlawfully because permission was given quite wrongly

judge will have to decide whether in his view it was a substantial financial gain or a serious financial loss <e> <s> i would suggest that all experience would indicate that one judge would consider a certain sum of money was serious another judge would decide that it was not <e> <s> it would be a quite impossible situation <e> <s> one could not have a precedent about it one could not have anything

appear in the list <e> <s> i think i am right <e> <s> am i not in saying that the list originally contained only the first four headings and that at report stage in another place and were added <e> <s> i would strongly suggest that we go back to the four original offences and do not indulge in a long auction of what are serious and what are not serious offences <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the suggestion that there should be a code of practice and i welcome the ministers amendment but i would agree with the noble lord lord mishcon that his amendment really fulfils the purpose much better than does the governments amendment <e> <s> this code of practice is perhaps as crucial as anything in the bill <e> <s> i am quite sure that the minister is aware in fact he has said so that hitherto the powers of stop and search have been misused <e> <s> in saying that in the last debate we had in committee the noble lord said that if there is a defect it does not lie in the definition in subsection <e> <s> it will be remembered that the noble lord lord hooson and myself put down an amendment to try to deal with the misuse by first of all limiting the powers of stop and search to an officer in uniform that amendment has gone through and secondly requiring the reasons for the suspicion to arise out of the circumstances of the stop itself <e> <s> the noble lord said that the defect did not lie in the definition because there must be some concrete basis for the police officers beliefs relating to the individual <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this motion <e>

will be asked to do under this part of the bill <e> <s> they are asked to make decisions first in privacy alone with a police officer in their rooms on matters which i suggest no lay person should be asked to decide <e> <s> as your lordships have seen over and over again they will have to make decisions on difficult matters of law <e> <s> they will have to have their clerk with them <e> <s> there

be of substantial value <e> <s> he will say they may be of value but are they of substantial value <e> <s> what will he in those diaries <e> <s> will it be of substantial <e>", "<cs> taking up the point made by the noble lord lord hooson do i understand that the minister is saying that if a police officer obtains a warrant to search in somebodys office for incriminating documents in a fraud case and should there find evidence of pornographic books or photographs it would then be perfectly open to the officer to bring proceedings under the obscene publications act against that individual although the officer had gone there to search for fraudulent documents <e>", "<cs> this is a very serious matter <e> <s> over and over again in long fraud cases the police go into the office of the defendant or the defendant company and as has been said they seize every document that they can lay their hands on <e> <s> as a result immediately a fishing expedition starts <e> <s> those people who have lost the documents do not know what they are or which have been taken <e> <s> the police sometimes keep those documents for a period of up to two years they search through the documents and build

into this matter and to be even-handed about it <e> <s> of course the police have to take documents but there must be some control over what they have taken and they must notify the defendant of what

his experience over all these years say in terms that these amendments enshrine the protection of the individual in this country when that person enters a police station <e> <s> that is the situation

help the police <e> <s> but in the ministers own code at page it states in paragraph b <e>", "<cs> the simple fact is that people should have these rights and one can see no reason whatsoever for not enshrining them as the noble and learned lord lord denning has suggested in this bill <e> <s> this is one of the most crucial points in the whole bill and having regard to the observations which have been made by noble lords i will test the views of the committee <e>", "<cs> may i ask the minister whether it would be convenient for the committee to take also amendment no <e> <s> c amendment no <e>

moment when a person comes under arrest the moment when he loses his liberty the moment when he is in a police station alone and the moment when he has nobody to speak for him and nobody to whom he can turn <e> <s> he is in a strange environment and at a great disadvantage of course <e> <s> therefore it is a crucial moment <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend replies to this i should like to take up something which has been said by the noble and learned lord lord denning <e> <s> he pointed out that the right of silence means the privilege against self-incrimination <e> <s> that is precisely what i had urged upon the committee earlier that if you say to a person in custody it is necessary to keep you in detention to obtain by questioning such evidence as is sufficient to charge you that is trying to breach that persons privilege against self-incrimination <e> <s> that is precisely what these words do <e>", "<cs> may i say to the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter that i am sure he has heard of the confait case in which there were convicted of murder and arson a number of young people who supposedly had made confessions <e> <s> sir harry fisher was asked to carry out an inquiry into that <e> <s> he found that some of the provisions in the judges rules which in fact were the equivalent of the code which is now attached to this bill only of course in a different form hitherto the judges rules have been the code that everyone has had to follow were not known to the police <e> <s> one of them was not known to the lawyers in the case <e>", "<cs> as far as we on these benches are concerned our view is firmly that if this power which earlier this afternoon was endorsed by the committee this power to interrogate persons in police stations when they have not been charged in order to get them to incriminate themselves so that they may provide evidence against themselves is to be granted to the police then that interrogation should be carried out only if the person has a legal representative <e> <s> that is our view and as that matter has not been accepted by this committee we are root and branch against this clause which enables people to be kept not only for hours but for far longer periods <e>", "<cs> i am so sorry but i thought that we were dealing with clause <e>", "<cs> may i ask the minister one question without taking up any more time other than to say that we support what has just been said here <e> <s> the question i want to ask arises from an article which appeared in <e>", "<cs> the noble lord the minister has not understood <e> <s> what has been said in the article is that during the period from hours to hours the person being interrogated will have the presence of a solicitor as of right and therefore the idea that he will be questioned over and over again in order to get a confession out of him is entirely misplaced <e> <s> all i am asking is if that is his absolute <e>", "<cs> moved amendment no <e> <s> a <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged <e> <s> there is an a after the nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> my lords that is so <e> <s> i am much obliged <e> <s> at the committee stage the noble and learned lord lord denning said that this in his opinion was the most important part of the bill because it introduces a new concept into english law the statutory power to detain someone simply for the purpose of questioning him that is to detain him in <e>", "<cs> my lords in replying very shortly to what has been said may i make just two or three very brief points <e> <s> it seems now <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> before i do so i should like to thank the noble lord the minister for the kind words which he addressed towards me <e> <s> i should also like to inform him that the get well card which he promised to which i saw reference when i read the <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask the minister one question in order to put the record straight <e> <s> he stated that the criminal bar association agreed that people should be held in custody for up to hours <e> <s> the true position is that they agreed to that only on the basis that such persons had a solicitor with them <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> i think that in our debates on these matters we lose sight very quickly of the balance which we are trying to keep <e> <s> over and over again an isolated case is given as an example to justify a power <e> <s> all of us can always think of an isolated case where you feel that you ought to have overwhelming powers <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that to keep somebody in custody for hours without letting anybody know gives a tremendous power to those in the police station to obtain a confession or an admission from that person which may turn out as i have already said earlier in the day to lead inevitably to an appalling miscarriage of justice <e>", "<cs> had given notice of his intention to move amendment no <e> <s> a <e>", "<cs> moved amendment no <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the advice from the noble and learned lord who as we all know always speaks with the greatest humility <e> <s> all i would say in reply are two or three things <e> <s> first of all the noble lord the minister referred to this subsection on the basis of it affording corroboration and said that of course there must be some evidence before you can have corroboration <e> <s> but the essence of this subsection is in paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of those on these benches and if i may say so speaking personally as someone who has spent the whole of his professional career in the criminal law i should like to support this amendment as strongly as i can <e> <s> the noble and learned lord who moved the amendment said at second reading that our efforts at the committee and report stages of this bill would be an historic challenge to the revising skills of this chamber <e> <s> i must regrettably say that perhaps we have not entirely met that challenge <e> <s> it has been a great personal sadness that the noble and learned lord who has moved this amendment has not been able to assist us in any other clauses in this bill some of which are as important as this one <e>", "<cs> my lords may i very briefly lend my support to this amendment <e> <s> it is another amendment among a number which seek to ensure that when evidence of a confession or a submission is given it will be reliable in so far as the law can make it so <e> <s> with the greatest respect to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor <e> <s> i would ask him again why these amendments cannot be supported <e> <s> when surely all around the house there has been recognition that there have been a great number <e>", "<cs> moved amendment no <e>", "<cs> my lords all i should like to say in reply is to refer and i hope your lordships will remember this to the words of sir harry fisher who carried out the inquiry as a result of which the royal commission was set up and who is the reason we are here <e> <s> he said <e>", "<cs> moved amendment no <e>", "<cs> my lords i was quoting the noble and learned lord lord devlin <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful for the views which have been put forward <e> <s> let me say with the greatest respect that the choice of course as has been pointed out is between the flexible guidelines of the court of appeal and the more rigid rule which is set out here in the amendment <e> <s> i would urge upon your lordships that experience has shown as the noble and learned lord lord devlin foresaw that a flexible rule which is put forward in the court of appeal does not in fact guarantee that miscarriages of justice do not take place because the flexibility of the guidelines has meant that all over the country in crown courts and in magistrates courts these guidelines themselves have been watered down and later decisions of the court of appeal which i have already set out have watered them down <e>", "<cs> my lords i invite the minister not to be inflexible on this <e> <s> it took years to get the legislation through <e> <s> since it went through it has taken years to get the courts to exercise their discretion so that the successful defendant automatically gets his costs unless he has brought them upon himself <e> <s> it was thought that it implied criticism of those who brought the case <e> <s> it has taken all those years to get justice for the ordinary defendant <e> <s> could the minister not embark now on another years of urging to get this for the police <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say to the noble lord lord campbell that already in the bill so far as clause <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support amendment no <e> <s> and in doing so i should like to move amendment no <e> <s> and amendment no <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg your pardon <e> <s> i should like to speak to amendments nos <e> <s> and as being a compromise if the house did not feel disposed to the unconditional access to solicitors under amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may interrupt the noble and learned lord i said it because he may not be aware that among its members and on its executive the criminal bar association has treasury counsel including senior treasury counsel <e> <s> one such senior treasury counsel happens to be in my own chambers and i can tell the house that i am not misleading the house i am not saying something which is untrue and i am not saying something which is inaccurate <e> <s> i am saying something which is fact is correct <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already spoken to this amendment but i think i have the right to reply to some of the things that were said by the noble and learned lord who sits on the woolsack <e> <s> i shall take up only a few minutes <e> <s> the attack which was made in relation to the terrorist angle seems to me merely to highlight the paucity of the noble and learned lords arguments if i may say so with the greatest respect <e> <s> as has already been said <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not exercise my right to reply <e>", "<cs> my lords it is ridiculous to suggest that in six and a half minutes one could possibly do justice to an amendment of such importance as this one <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord expresses astonishment that i would wish to reply in any shape or form to the onslaught <e>", "<cs> my lords may i add one word from the other half of the alliance and also in the name of my noble friend lord donaldson <e> <s> i too pay tribute to the minister listening to whose courtesy ability and industry has been a pleasure and an education <e> <s> if i may say so it has also been a salutary education to have been reminded periodically from the woolsack that your lordships house is not the central criminal court <e>", "<cs> my lords when this bill comes to be considered and used in the courts thoughout the country my own view is that it may well be that the codes of practice will be found the most valuable part of it <e> <s> they go a very long way to guaranteeing the proper rights of the individual <e>", "<cs> my lords as a mere barrister it is somewhat daunting to follow no less than four law lords out of seven previous speakers but as most of them have disagreed with each other i am confident that in what i have to say i shall find support from one or other <e> <s> in july when we last debated this topic i leaned towards the concept of the local accountability of the prosecution service <e> <s> i believed as i still do in the virtues of local justice <e> <s> i was and still am resistant to this governments passion for centralisation of power and i had seen the acceptance of the beeching report lead to the creation of centralised crown court complexes with the most unhappy results <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not agree that the criteria which were inserted in the criminal justice act which govern the circumstances in which custodial sentences can be imposed on young people are simply not reconcilable with the concept of suspension <e> <s> would he not inform the lord chief justice that in the case of a young person if the mitigation is such that if he were an adult the whole sentence would be properly suspended then a custodial sentence should not be passed at all <e> <s> moreover if mitigation is such that it should be partially suspended then the sentence should not be longer than the part which would be justifiably suspended <e>", "<cs> my lords i venture to intervene in this debate not because i am an expert in this highly complex field of the law and i am delighted to find that my general distaste for this branch of the law has been shared all these years by the noble and learned lord lord denning but for two other reasons <e> <s> first i am aware of the reservations and disappointments felt by a number of my erstwhile legal colleagues on studying the provisions of the bill which they as practitioners will have to understand and operate <e> <s> secondly i have for long been concerned along with the ordinary consumer at the ease with which unscrupulous operators have hitherto been able to make use of the bankruptcy laws to fleece the public <e> <s> indeed i have noted too in the criminal courts how difficult it is to obtain a conviction for fraudulent trading as that offence is now defined <e>", "<cs> on behalf of these benches i should also like to support this amendment <e> <s> there is no part of the criminal process which is more important than the juvenile and young persons part <e> <s> very few of those at the top of the legal profession have had any direct experience of dealing with juveniles <e> <s> one cannot help feeling that that is the main reason why it has taken such an extremely long time to appreciate that from first to last the system for dealing with juveniles is simply inappropriate if it is based on the same system as that dealing with adults <e> <s> now we have an opportunity right at the beginning to divorce the dealing with young children from the process as it is directed towards adults <e> <s> the series prosecution trial and sentence and then the involvement of policemen prison officers lawyers judges and forms of imprisonment is simply not appropriate as a procedure for children <e>", "<cs> may i support this amendment from these benches also <e> <s> i do not know whether it is declaring an interest but i do so as one who played a substantial part in the liberation of <e>", "<cs> i should also like to support the amendment on behalf of those on these benches for reasons which have already been so well explained <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment and in doing so to speak if i may on behalf of my profession because in our view the success of this service will depend very largely on those who work in it maintaining precisely the same standard which independent members of the bar it is hoped have maintained in their jobs from day to day <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may add that the words of the noble and learned lord the chancellor will go a very long way to reassure the bar which has been deeply concerned with the possible implications of the words that one finds in clause <e> <s> it was the fact that the very basis on which the profession operates as an independent bar could be swept aside by a mere practice direction without provision for consultation or debate that has caused the bar council and the profession the greatest concern <e> <s> i know the words of the noble and learned lord will bring a great measure of comfort to them <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this proposal <e> <s> i shall fall out here i know with the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale on this <e> <s> the mischief of continuing private prosecutions is that the motivation of those who bring private prosecutions may well not be the good of society but may be based on personal spite on revenge on financial gain on blackmail on fanaticism all sorts of motivations <e> <s> if this private prosecution procedure is going to be allowed to continue then i would submit that it is absolutely essential that the director or the crown prosecutor should know in every case that a private prosecution has in fact been launched so that he can look at it and decide whether he ought in the public interest to take over the prosecution rather than allow it to go on either in order to stop it or to prosecute it on behalf of society and not for some personal reason <e>", "<cs> i too confess to being a heretic <e> <s> may i also object to this amendment <e> <s> the noble and learned lord has referred to an ancient liberty <e> <s> i would venture to suggest that it is so ancient now that it has become really an anachronism <e> <s> there was a good historical reason for it in the past but time has marched on and now the criminal process is organised and controlled <e> <s> a reference was made to the mish-mash of removals and the mass of removals on the statute book evidences does it not <e> <s> the view of parliament that this right is really an anachronism now <e>", "<cs> the point i should like to raise on this clause at the moment is that the clause is directed in the main to the level of fees to be paid to barristers having the conduct of prosecutions throughout england and wales <e> <s> the central control of those fees ultimately by the treasury to use the unguent phrase affects most seriously the position of the bar and has serious implications for members of the bar and for its service to the public <e> <s> at present i think i can say that there is profound dissatisfaction in both branches of the profession at the level at which legal aid fees are being fixed and being held from year to year <e> <s> so absurd have been the increases in fees over the past four or five years as compared to the overhead expenses of practitioners that very real hardship is now being caused to young barristers under years in court <e> <s> i am bound to point out with the greatest respect to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor that this is noticeably now beginning to affect the quality of the new intake to the bar <e>", "<cs> what i was trying to do was to draw a parallel and to point out the problems which have arisen from the control of legal aid fees in the department of the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor and therefore the relevance of that to the fact that now all prosecution fees will be under the control of the attorney-general <e> <s> therefore i was going to suggest that the problems which have arisen in the one case might be taken into account when the attorney-general comes to lay down the scales which are mentioned in clause governing the fees of counsel who appear for the prosecution in the future <e>", "<cs> i also support the amendment and would add that the justices clerks society strongly supports the amendment in these words <e>", "<cs> may i also support this amendment and give an example of how this arises very shortly <e> <s> suppose you have been convicted in a substantial case of fraud with a number of other accused people <e> <s> it may well be that your part of the case is quite small but because of the involvement of others the case may take say five six seven or eight weeks to be tried <e> <s> you are eventually convicted and sentenced to years imprisonment or to an enormous fine <e> <s> the appeal at the court of appeal may from the very circumstances take a very substantial time because it will involve the court going through the facts of the case as proved to see whether or not what you are saying which is i played a very small part and i never ought to have been sentenced in this way is true <e> <s> that may involve an appellant in a very substantial sum of money <e> <s> if the outcome of it all is that the court of appeal says this person should never have been sentenced to imprisonment or should never have been fined this very substantial sum of money it will be an enormous penalty to have to pay for the costs of putting the case before the court of appeal <e>", "<cs> i too should like to support the amendment which uses the same words as are to be found in clause <e> <s> one cannot quite understand why if those words are suitable there they should not be suitable here <e> <s> i am sure all practitioners would agree that if one had the words now in the clause just and reasonable it is almost impossible to argue one way or the other as to what is just and reasonable if it is not in some way related to the expenses which have been incurred on the case <e> <s> surely this would be a much better approach <e> <s> one thinks so often in court that the purpose of the power is to compensate the person acquitted for the money he has had to spend <e>", "<cs> if i may say so i take a very different view <e> <s> i must say that i was astonished to hear the noble and learned lord lord denning say that he could see nothing wrong and i am fairly nervous about putting this forward in there being a fairly trivial offence which did not carry a fine greater than so much but as regards which it would be perfectly proper having fined the defendent so much to say well we think he really ought to be punished a bit more than that and so we shall impose a substantial sum of costs <e> <s> surely that raises the matter of principle that if in fact the fine which it is proper to <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask for some guidance on this clause

only one further point <e> <s> i ask myself why does this clause <e>", "<cs> i must say that i am a little disappointed that the noble and learned lord is already showing signs of backsliding <e> <s>

all know secretly there will never be an improvement <e> <s> that has led to the situation in which we are now <e> <s> i support this amendment because drastic measures have to be taken with the situation with which we are now so familiar although there will be practical difficulties about the days and the days <e> <s> of course all of us know there will be practical problems which will have to be resolved <e>", "<cs> may i interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> it is not at all a question of theoretical decisions <e> <s> the decisions would be in actual cases <e> <s> the parties to the case would be at liberty to apply to the attorney-general <e> <s> it is not at all about theoretical decisions <e>", "<cs> i should like to express my gratitude for the very strong support which this amendment has received particularly from the cross-benches <e> <s> i am disappointed of course to hear not that i am particularly surprised what has just fallen from the lips of the noble and learned

and the burden upon public funds <e> <s> i do not have a great deal of sympathy for the former and i find it sad that the noble and learned lord lord rawlinson would find it so difficult to spy a point of exceptional public importance when his predecessor is on record as saying that he would find no difficulty at all <e> <s> we have heard that lord evershed would apparently have found no difficulty at all <e> <s> and other very distinguished lawyers who have spoken to this amendment would by implication have found no difficulty at all <e>", "<cs> if the noble and learned lord reads

now to a division but having regard to the great body of support which i have received on this amendment i do not guarantee not to bring it forward again at a later stage <e>", "<cs> i ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> might i add one matter to what has been said <e> <s> i have certain reservations about this amendment <e> <s> the real trouble is that there is no judicial review of decisions of crown court judges in matters relating to their own jurisdiction <e> <s> that is a matter which has given rise to concern over a long period <e> <s> whether it is right to have an amendment which affects only this particular aspect of the crown court judges decision is a matter for the committee <e>", "<cs> having heard the words that have fallen from the lips of the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor it would be churlish of me to pursue this matter any further <e> <s> i am most grateful to him for the information in relation to the review of our present practice of which he informed the committee and the encouragement which he is clearly going to give to those responsible for that review <e> <s> in those circumstances i happily beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should also like to support this amendment <e> <s> i am sure that the house will particularly take note of the words which have fallen from the lips of the noble and

noble friend lord annan <e> <s> however with regard to what he said about the in lieu provisions perhaps i may take up the situation at the tate gallery <e> <s> until very recently i was chairman of the trustees of the tate gallery <e> <s> perhaps in his final speech the minister will reply to the situation that i am going to outline <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl the minister keeps on coming back to private enterprise and to the amount of private money which goes into the arts <e> <s> do let us face realities <e> <s> as i understand it million is necessary to run the royal opera house the one institution which can for various reasons many of them purely snobbish obtain large sums of private money <e> <s> yet still under per cent <e> <s> of the funding of that opera house comes from private money <e> <s> does the minister really think that mr becketts plays would be put on in london by ibm <e> <s> does he really think that any experimental drama would appear in this country if we had to rely on the midland bank <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that there is no sinister implication being drawn from the fact that i am a criminal lawyer <e> <s> i am devoted if i may say so to the minister personally and i admire him greatly as a debater but some flak will go across the chamber inevitably in what i have to say <e> <s> i am bound to tell the noble earl that in the eyes of those whose work is in the arts in great britain at the moment his policies for financing the arts are regarded increasingly as misconceived and potentially disastrous <e>", "<cs> my lords the

would do it on legal aid <e> <s> all that the minister seems to do is to huddle in his tent at great george street and pull his treasury balaclava closer over his eyes <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may support this amendment and have the temerity to remind the noble and learned lord that his constitutional adviser the lord chancellors advisory committee also stated in its last report that overall responsibility for legal services must rest with central government <e> <s> the committee goes out of its way to deplore once again the lack of any coherent strategy for legal services particularly in the funding of law centres <e> <s> law centres as the noble and learned lord will know are going through a very difficult time at the moment concerned once again with the question of money <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to oppose this amendment <e> <s> i ask your lordships to put your minds to considering why this amendment has been introduced at all <e> <s> the view certainly of the bar certainly of the noble and learned lords who have spoken and many others is that this amendment is entirely unnecessary <e> <s> it seems to have been introduced because the original clause which was attacked in committee and eventually abandoned was introduced without any proper consultation as the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor conceded in committee <e> <s> it was introduced presumably and apparently simply for a matter of efficiency in order to save judge time <e> <s> it had no other merit at all <e> <s> as the noble and learned lord who has just spoken has pointed out this amendment on the face of it seems to take up more judge time and to involve a four-tier form of appeal instead of the perfectly straightforward and simple one which has obtained hitherto <e>", "<cs> my lords my reaction to my noble friends motion can be summarised in four words here we go again <e> <s> the noble lord lord maude who has just spoken referred to the government

the last couple of hours between the two front benches <e> <s> the noble earl the minister has shown tremendous confidence in the ability of the arts council to run the whole of the complex of the south bank and no one has greater admiration than i as an ex-vice chairman of the arts council for that body <e> <s> however i think that one must face the fact that the arts council as at present constituted is hardly a body which is equipped in any shape or form to run a large commercial enterprise such as the south bank and at the moment this bill is extraordinarily vague because all it says is that the whole of the freehold property of the south bank shall be vested in the arts <e>", "<cs> before the minister sits down he has mentioned the sum of million <e> <s> what proportion of that sum does he envisage as going to the south bank <e> <s> is it for the purpose simply of setting up a management committee or is it in fact a proportion of the million which is directed to actually running the south bank in the year of abolition <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister agree that the staff shortage is due entirely to the enormous number of prison officers who are being used on escort duties at the moment <e> <s> will he also agree that the reason why that enormous number is being so used is because the government do absolutely nothing about the scandal of the remand prisoner situation <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord foot referred to following the footsteps of the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> perhaps i might refer to following the steps of my noble friend lord foot <e> <s> i do so entirely in an atmosphere of friendship towards both my noble friends <e> <s> however i am a little worried about this amendment and perhaps they could help me about it as to whether in the circumstances of reality it is not a little too restrictive <e> <s> in this matter of interception obviously the secretary of state will be acting from time to time on information received from some member of the public <e> <s> for instance someone might say they were in great fear that below them in a block of flats there was activity by persons who appeared for instance to be speaking in irish accents <e> <s> the person may say to the secretary of state that they were convinced from certain conversations that they had heard that these people were dealing with explosive substances <e> <s> however there might be no positive evidence to support those fears and it might be that on that basis it would merely be irresponsible not to set on foot an interception to see whether the information was in fact well founded or not <e> <s> an interception might well result in clearing the matter up forthwith and might reveal that what in fact these people were dealing with was not open and above board but had nothing whatever to do with explosives <e>", "<cs> my lords may i also fairly shortly support this amendment and follow up what the noble lord lord soper has just said and also what the noble baroness lady wootton has said together with the reference in the amendment to criminal proceedings <e> <s> there is a matter which seems to me to have been avoided by your lordships throughout our debates and that is a matter which concerns the sexual overtones which undoubtedly exist when it comes to the question of corporal punishment <e> <s> anyone who has spent any time in the criminal courts knows perfectly well that in a very large number of cases where violence comes up before the courts involving people who have administered corporal punishment there are in fact sexual overtones involved <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask one more question <e> <s> can the noble lord confirm that per cent <e> <s> of the women in this unit are on remand and that per cent <e> <s> of that per cent <e> <s> will not be sent to prison or may not be convicted <e> <s> to incarcerate such people in solitary confinement day after day is something that the minister should be more concerned about than he appears at present <e> <s> surely something should be done forthwith to get these women into a situation where they can enjoy the <e>", "<cs> my lords it must be a matter of some regret that there is such a sparse attendance here tonight to discuss this very important question which has been raised by my noble and learned friend lord elwyn-jones <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister what proportion of the increase in the grant to the arts council has been earmarked for the running of the south bank complex <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord agree that it is important not to get hysterical about this matter of rape <e> <s> by definition rape is having sexual intercourse without consent and therefore the incidence of rape varies between the most horrible and violent offences and those cases where ladies withdraw their consent at the th minute of the rd hour <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of the alliance i rise also warmly to welcome these codes <e> <s> six months ago on the second reading of the bill i ventured to say that the codes might well turn out to be the most important part of the act from the point of view of human rights and i suggest that in fact that is how it has turned out <e> <s> if and it is a crucial if senior police officers and the judges insist on the observance of these provisions by the police and not only the provisions themselves but also the spirit of the notes which go with them then the codes may well stand out as a landmark in the long journey of the criminal process in england and wales <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister referred to similar work and similar rates of pay <e> <s> would he not agree that these directors will run departments with back-up secretarial workers no doubt covering activities which hitherto have been covered with complete efficiency by one general manager <e> <s> would the minister agree that if one adds up all the salaries together they would reach a sum which would just about guarantee the future of the cottesloe theatre on the south bank <e>", "<cs> my lords this debate is of great importance although ostensibly it <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with the noble baroness that there is a parallel between the lawyer and the doctor in those circumstances <e> <s> i think she will find that a doctor who is called out and who has to spend or hours with a patient will be remunerated accordingly <e> <s> no doubt solicitors who are called out and who have to stay for hours with their client will be prepared to do so for nothing on many occasions <e> <s> but if this <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister tell the house what percentage of the total funding of arts council clients last year was attributable to business sponsorship <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not agree that there is a very general consensus now certainly in the home office and certainly among members of the all-party penal affairs group that community-based methods of dealing with young persons are far more successful than the use of the blunt instrument of custody <e> <s> nevertheless the number of custody orders is now running at the horrific rate of a year <e> <s> is the minister seriously concerned about that and if so will he consider leaking these figures to his noble and learned friend the lord chancellor in order to galvanise him to educate the magistracy <e> <s> after all they are doing their work in the public domain <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by saying how much i enjoyed the speech of the noble and learned lord lord griffiths <e> <s> i noticed a hint of controversy from him as i might have expected on the buchan scale i should say that it was about five in a <e> <s> i heard him say that he had no memory of the peremptory challenge <e> <s> i know that judges go very quickly into their ivory towers but i did not know that the judicial memory was quite as short as that <e> <s> the speech of the noble earl was

my side as regards some of the more controversial matters to which i intend to refer <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so with the greatest respect the recommendations were directed to improving and accelerating the procedures in the courts for which my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor is responsible <e>", "<cs> my lords one understands where the dust came from <e> <s> as regards chapters and of the report i am afraid that i must introduce a discordant note <e> <s> i found those chapters disappointing and at times even deplorable <e> <s> i found the language tendentious and the argument very anecdotal <e> <s> there is much special pleading and rhetoric abounds <e> <s> the main characteristic of those chapters is their deafening silence as to the nature of the evidence which the committee received <e> <s> in the argument which mostly descends into advocacy there is no attempt to summarise analyse or to assess the evidence in spite of our having heard today from the noble and learned chairman that the committee evaluated the evidence <e>", "<cs> my lords in those circumstances i am encouraged to continue particularly to all your lordships with open minds <e> <s> to deny one class of citizen his right to trial by jury on the order of the judiciary to impose upon him trial by a judge chosen by another judge and flanked on one side by mr price and on the other

particular pleasure to follow the right reverend prelate the bishop of lincoln because i know from <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree that unlike glyndebourne most of the clients of the

authority of the prime ministers press secretary to breach the official secrets act <e> <s> if they do have this power will he tell the house where it comes from and how it can be reconciled with the constitutional principle of ministerial accountability <e>", "<cs> my lords as is his wont my noble friend lord harris has raised a highly topical and wide-ranging subject for debate <e> <s> i only wish to concentrate on crime prevention <e> <s> when we debate law and order whether regarding the police the courts the prisons or the probation service what we are really discussing in each case is an aspect of crime prevention <e> <s> those of us who have consistently questioned the efficacy of long sentences huge prison building schemes short sharp shocks and so on have often been labelled as wets or do-gooders by many members of the party opposite <e> <s> however i believe that there is now a very general recognition that that approach to crime is founded upon a hardheaded policy based on experience which emphasises crime prevention rather than the simplistic and blunt instrument and i say this with great respect to the noble baroness lady phillips of crime punishment <e>", "<cs> my lords the point that i was trying to raise was why the home office does not fund crime prevention when it spends such a lot of money on dealing with crime <e>", "<cs> my lords i say to the noble lord opposite that i knew that the government had been selling off the family silver but i had not appreciated and i do not feel that i can accept that they have brought this country to such a pretty pass

this amendment <e> <s> in referring to the noble and learned lords objection is it not on all fours with the words having regard to in the statutes <e> <s> i would support this amendment because i

commit the offence twice but that if it is committed three times the offender goes to prison <e> <s> it happens of course with prostitution and so on where over and over again this situation arises <e>", "<cs> i wish to interrupt this debate for one moment to ask where have we got to on this question of appeal now having regard to what the minister has said <e> <s> we have been told that so far as imposing conditions is concerned you can go for a review on the question of whether the police officer had a reasonable belief that what was going to happen would cause disorder or damage <e> <s>

that <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord mishcon presses his amendment will he take on board the possible results of informers scurrying around informing against people and giving information that

recollects the problems which arise from having <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may interrupt the noble earl <e> <s> the minister says that the offender will get off scot-free <e> <s> one would precede against him under clause <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend lord foot has just said it is perfectly clear that the noble earl and i say this with the greatest possible respect to him has not taken on board the basis of these two amendments <e> <s> throughout his reply he never dealt in any shape or form with the complexities of the question of the state of mind of the victim the state of mind of the accused the question of the awareness of the accused the question of the belief in the mind of the police officer and finally the defence which can be put forward by the defendant that his behaviour was reasonable <e>", "<cs> my lords i find it depressing that again the main thrust of the argument has not been dealt with <e> <s> i say that with the greatest respect <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord scarman says that these words are undesirable and inconsistent with the concept of english law but we have heard absolutely nothing to show in any shape or form that those words were not true and should not be acted upon <e> <s> that is my first point <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the ministers reply i do not wish to press the amendment and i beg leave to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support this amendment and to take up perhaps with a degree of modesty some of the points that the noble and learned lord has just made <e> <s> when this matter came up in committee the noble earl put two points against this suggestion <e> <s> the first was that the crown court or the magistrates were not an appropriate tribunal to deal with any limitation or condition which had been put on by a police officer <e> <s> it would arise by way of a second guess to use his expression and the courts should be limited simply to matters of law <e> <s> the other point he made was that the time factor where a condition may be imposed very shortly before a procession or assembly made an appeal of this kind impracticable <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble earl to give this matter more consideration <e> <s> surely everybody agrees that you have here a serious mischief <e> <s> there is another aspect to this serious mischief <e> <s> not only is the offence constant and continuous it is far worse than verbal abuse <e> <s> verbal abuse happens and it is over <e> <s> this is abuse which continues day after day <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble earl has said i am optimistic that perhaps he will be giving me my pound of flesh in due course <e> <s> in those circumstances i withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to oppose this amendment and say to the noble lord lord campbell of alloway that uncharacteristically he has got it wrong in saying that the offences against the person act relating to poison is parallel <e> <s> it is exactly not parallel because for administering a poison or a noxious thing with intent to injure aggrieve or annoy the maximum sentence is five years <e> <s> for doing that so as to endanger life or inflict grievous bodily harm the sentence is years <e>", "<cs> my lords may i add from these benches the power of our prod <e> <s> i am sure that the noble earl will not wish to be described as a philistine <e>", "<cs> my lords may i from these benches also pay tribute to the noble earl the minister and express our admiration for the way that he has guided this bill through the choppy seas stirred up largely i am afraid by a battery of lawyers and for the way he has managed to bring the bill to harbour having come to the steering wheel in the middle of the voyage <e> <s> we appreciate and are grateful for his co-operative and helpful attitude throughout the time he has been in charge of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government concerned that this is yet another example of a possible grave miscarriage of justice which has only come to light through investigative journalism rather than through the judicial process <e> <s> does the noble lord think that the time has come for a thorough review of the limits which the criminal division of the court of appeal has placed upon itself as to the grounds on which it is prepared to allow an appeal or to order a new trial <e>", "<cs> my lords i should also like to express my gratitude to the noble earl for initiating this debate because the question that he raises as is so often the case with the questions he raises goes straight to the very centre of the parole process <e> <s> it gives rise to many issues many of which we have debated here over the years and many of which have already been raised in this debate tonight <e> <s> they are are the criteria right <e> <s> are they clear <e> <s> if so why <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the minister will be able to reply to some of the facts to which i wish to refer in this race of a debate <e> <s> this year the government grant to the arts council is million less than its scrupulously costed budget requires <e> <s> last year it was million short <e> <s> sir william rees-mogg describes this years grant as another blow to the arts <e> <s> adopting the australian vernacular of the moment no weasel words or economy with the truth no civil service figures or percentages can hide those straight facts <e>", "<cs> my lords i should also like to congratulate the noble lord for initiating so topical a debate <e> <s> i should like to say at once that i agree with a great deal of the remarkable speech we have just heard from the noble lord lord dacre <e> <s> my justification for speaking is that over years i have had a close professional involvement in court cases involving the security services <e> <s> blake vassall martelli roberts and conway were all my clients as were the editor of the <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble and learned lord agree that section is so broad that it behoves him particularly to see that the <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that he has a crisis on his hands just as serious as that which has exploded in scotland over recent weeks <e> <s> does he agree that the centre of this crisis as has already been suggested is the enormous increase in the percentage of men and women being remanded to local prisons by the courts <e> <s> is he aware that there are today more than such people banged up in cells without sanitation for hours a day <e> <s> what emergency measures does he have to prevent the prison officers and the prisoners deciding to say as they will soon enough is enough <e>", "<cs> my lords it is about the remand prisoner that i wish to speak following up what was so eloquently referred to by the right reverend prelate the bishop of birmingham the male prisoners and holloway <e> <s> i initiated a debate in this house on the same subject in on the may report <e> <s> the may report had described the situation as a scandal and the conditions as degrading <e> <s> there were then remand prisoners per cent <e> <s> of the total prison population <e> <s> today seven years later there are remand prisoners per cent <e> <s> of the prison population a situation described by the home affairs committee as completely unacceptable and later as an affront to human dignity <e>", "<cs> bath <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister think of any motto which is better for the guidance of adult life than this one <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the noble earl agree that one-fifth of all those in prison in this country are on remand <e> <s> they are people who in the eyes of the law are innocent and have not been convicted of any offence <e> <s> does not the noble earl agree that this number one fifth of is far in excess of any other european country <e> <s> does he not further agree that the situation is an absolute disgrace <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister appreciate that the court of three judges castigated the home secretary on the manner in which this policy had been carried out and pointed out that it had led to prisoners being kept in custody for a minimum of nine years far beyond the time the sentencer had envisaged <e> <s> is the minister also aware that the home secretary was castigated for accepting the arrogant view that he could ignore the judges recommendation on tariff if he so wished and substitute his own view on tariff <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister tell the house whether there has been any progress in getting local authorities to remove racist graffiti <e> <s> this matter was raised in the debates on the public order bill and he then undertook to see what could be done <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always a great pleasure to follow the noble baroness lady phillips <e> <s> listening to her speech i was seriously considering whether to put down an amendment to give power to challenge benches of magistrates <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister confirm that in the case referred to by the noble lord who asked this question the list of jurymen was requested with this approval of the prosecution because local newspapers had published a great deal of information which might have led to interference with the fairness of the trial <e> <s> the purpose of looking at the jury panel was to make quite sure that no one on the jury lived in the area where the newspapers were circulated <e> <s> does the minister agree that that was a perfectly proper use of the right of the prosecution and the defence to see the panel list of potential jurors and their addresses <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment which has been moved so ably if i may say so by the noble lord lord irvine <e> <s> any person is the phrase used in this clause any person may be required to answer questions under <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask the minister a question <e> <s> throughout his answer he has referred to the suspect <e> <s> the whole point of this amendment is that it deals with the innocent person who is not a suspect but is simply interrogated because he is thought to have relevant evidence <e> <s> that is the distinction that we have made <e>", "<cs> i should be extremely upset if i made a submission to a judge and then was submitted to a sharp cross-examination by my opponent because i had given evidence which on the face of it was not true <e>", "<cs> with the greatest respect to the minister if he looks at clause he will see <e>", "<cs> i understand that there are four amendments grouped together <e> <s> i should like to speak to all of them at the same time <e>", "<cs> as i understand it amendment no <e> <s> is grouped with amendments nos <e> <s> a and b whch are manuscript amendments and

interruption <e> <s> i am glad that the procedure adopted has been described as a sensible one and in those circumstances i hope that the house will allow me to continue under that procedure and to await the reply of the government before deciding which of the amendments i shall seek to move <e>", "<cs> the word reasonable was to go in the later part of the clause namely <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble earl for his co-operation <e> <s> i say only that i fear it may not take me a long way along the road to reassurance but it will take me a short way for which i am grateful <e>", "<cs> my lords

trunk with the hotel linen knives and forks and perhaps even commits an indecent assault on the chambermaid <e> <s> if the manager makes a mistake in identification if he looks at a photograph of the gentleman who was in room and thinks that it was the gentleman in room it will be no good any noble lord in this chamber coming to me and saying please represent me at bow street <e> <s> this is a terrible injustice <e> <s> it will be extradition on demand <e> <s> the noble lord will receive a notice to say that he shall appear at bow street <e> <s> if the papers are in order if there is some evidence on a piece of paper in spain saying i have looked at this photograph and this is the gentleman he will be whisked off to madrid <e> <s> there he will be incarcerated for some weeks before he employs a spanish barrister and good luck to him <e> <s> that is the simple situation <e> <s> i hope that all noble lords will read the words of my noble friend lord irvine in <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister agree that those of us who have urged upon him and the government year after year month after month the use of camps and the building of camps to prevent the government being overrun by events have done so for two reasons <e> <s> the first is that the camps can be built and used in an emergency and it takes so long to build prisons <e> <s> the second is that they can be used for the purpose of housing remand prisoners who do not require a high degree of security <e> <s> those suggestions have been made certainly by me for the past eight years <e> <s> can the minister now give the house an undertaking that in this emergency which many of us have prophesied over and over again these camps will be used for the purpose of housing remand prisoners so that remand prisoners can be taken out of the local prisons and out of the police cells and the local prisons can be used for the purpose of convicted prisoners <e> <s> this is the centre of solving the problem <e> <s> these camps should not be used simply to provide further places for convicted prisoners <e>", "<cs> my lords with great respect i said those of the remand prisoners who do not require so high a degree of security <e>", "<cs> may i ask the minister what is the particular significance of the word evidence rather than facts <e> <s> when one is dealing in the schedule with the fugitive offenders act on page of the bill and the restrictions on sending people back the words used are the restriction at any lesser offence disclosed by the evidence on which his return is granted <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may come back to the original point which was made when i moved the amendment <e> <s> the minister has enlarged the whole breadth of this discussion by referring to black sheep in europe and by saying that we are the odd man out <e> <s> the point the committee <e>", "<cs> the noble lord must know that most european states claim an extraterritorial jurisdiction over their own nationals <e>", "<cs> it is always a pleasure to educate members of the committee opposite one does not often have the opportunity <e> <s> perhaps i can help the noble lord lord campbell of alloway by reading to him article of the <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to make further inquiries about the substitution of the word information on this occasion for the word evidence <e> <s> it is not merely a lawyers semantic point <e> <s> before the whole procedure of arrest and surrender can begin the secretary of state must issue an authority to proceed <e> <s> he does so after receiving a request from the requesting state <e> <s> in accordance with the bill the request must be accompanied by particulars of the person involved which is the phrase used and not of identification also particulars of the facts and the law under which he is accused including what was evidence sufficient to justify the issue of a warrant for his arrest <e>", "<cs> can the noble lord point to any provision in the bill for making representations or being heard on the matter <e>", "<cs> i just wondered whether the noble lord could point to any provision in the bill for the accused person to have the right to make representations and deal with the evidence so-called <e>", "<cs> to reply briefly to what has been said i wish to make four points <e> <s> first the minister has said nothing about the extra territorial point this surely worries every noble lord in the committee that we send back our nationals and other states do not reciprocate <e> <s> that i suggest is a matter for serious concern <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the correction <e> <s> there is an idea about that one can sweep away juries and the rights of citizens not to incriminate themselves and so on because these provisions are old and out of date and we are advancing into a modern world <e> <s> in my submission one has to advance <e> <s> but when advancing one has to preserve the fundamental civil liberties and freedoms of which we are so proud <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the minister for his conciliatory attitude <e> <s> in those circumstances i will respond to that attitude and not take this amendment to a division <e> <s> however i warn him that although the weather at the moment is only choppy by the time of the next appearance of this clause it may have become quite substantially stormier <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for his remarks and i believe that we are agreed that we are trying to achieve the same end <e> <s> when i look at article of the convention i wonder whether the minister can go a little further <e> <s> the words of article of the convention are <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i rise in this packed chamber to oppose the question that clause shall stand part of the bill <e> <s> we oppose this clause as being far too broadly drawn removing at a stroke some essential safeguards in the criminal process <e> <s> to mitigate the rule against hearsay and permitting documentary hearsay evidence is entirely sensible and acceptable <e> <s> to destroy the rule altogether is to damage irretrievably the fairness of the criminal trial <e> <s> what the clause sets out to do is to make a statement by a person in any document admissible evidence in the trial of any indictable offence that is in the magistrates courts or in the crown courts admissible as to the truth of what is said in the document <e> <s> the only qualification is that the evidence must be of facts which would be admissible if given orally <e> <s> such evidence is to be called first-hand hearsay and the document when put in evidence is to speak for itself <e>", "<cs> may i interrupt the noble and learned lord because this is an important point <e> <s> in saying that this legislation is necessary he is indeed knocking at an open door because the next clause and the one after it deal with those specific matters <e> <s> the point at issue is the breadth of this clause which does not in fact deal only with documents <e>", "<cs> it was like a breath of fresh air to hear the comments of the noble lord lord gifford because what he said was precisely and exactly what i myself was going to say <e> <s> we have been beating the air in this debate <e> <s> i thought that i had made that point in moving the amendment but it does not seem to have been appreciated <e> <s> i made the point that i and those who support it agree per cent <e> <s> that in those massive trials to which the noble lord lord benson refers of course all those documents have to be admitted and of course the provisions of the police and criminal evidence act as amended by clause do precisely that <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord has referred to the irresistible logic of professor cross and indeed it is the irresistible logic that we are trying to resist <e> <s> it is when the criminal law is governed by irresistible logic that it is the end of civil rights and civil liberties <e> <s> the criminal law thank goodness is not governed by irresistible logic <e> <s> irresistible logic leads to the abolition of the jury as indeed the roskill report wished to happen <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister <e> <s> i raise the point because section begins <e>", "<cs> it is always nice to see the minister certain and the noble and learned lord lord roskill slightly unhappy <e> <s> the two are now getting nearer to each other <e> <s> in those circumstances i am happy to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the debate as so often with this bill has been repeatedly so remote from reality that it is almost unbelievable <e> <s> what the noble lords lord gifford and lord irvine have said is absolutely true when one becomes concerned with criminal trials <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord roskill says that the whole fraud case may collapse if this statement is not put in <e> <s> of course the whole case will collapse if this statement is not put in <e> <s> but as has already been said the reality of trials is that statements are made by people under the urging of either a solicitor or a police officer to keep the balance absolutely fair on one side or the other in which they say things which are simply not true <e> <s> they say them on a proof of evidence and the proof of evidence may look totally innocuous when one reads it <e> <s> the witness comes into the witness box and butter will not melt in his or her mouth <e> <s> one then cross-examines the witness and one finds that half the witnesss evidence has been put into that witnesss mouth for a hundred reasons but a hundred reasons which have nothing to do with the truth <e> <s> it may be wicked it may be absolutely understandable it may be compassionate it may be prejudice it may be a thousand things and the judge looks at the statement as it stands and the judge has to test it by what is in the interests of justice that frail and hopeless criterion for a decision of this matter <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for what he has said <e> <s> it was a little difficult to follow the whole of what was said as the proposals were delivered so quickly <e> <s> as i understood it the main point that he made was that he did not wish to impose upon foreign countries a duty which they might not wish to take on board <e> <s> perhaps i may deal with amendment no <e> <s> at this stage <e> <s> that amendment merely suggests the insertion of words at the end of line in clause <e> <s> c which reads <e>", "<cs> i am happy not to move the amendment <e> <s> it is enjoyable to be led on any occasion to be led by the noble lord lord mishcon on this occasion is an added pleasure <e> <s> as his junior here i should not think of saying anything different <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble and learned lord this <e> <s> surely closed circuit television is not apt to describe evidence which is bounced from america through a satellite into a courtroom in this country <e> <s> surely that is a video link <e>", "<cs> with great respect to the noble and learned lord i think really he was addressing his words to the next amendment <e>", "<cs> may i interrupt the minister as he has mentioned me <e> <s> as i understand the amendment it is not at all to do with what the minister is saying <e> <s> i may have got it completely wrong and he may have got it completely right <e> <s> as i understand the amendment both parties would agree that the first statement to be used in the proceedings would be a statement taken by a person agreed by both parties rather than some police officer social worker or whoever <e> <s> the impartial person agreed to by both parties should take the original statement from the child <e> <s> that seemed to me a sensible proposition and that is why i supported it <e> <s> it never occurred to me that it would take the place of cross-examination <e>", "<cs> i support the noble lord hook line and sinker <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may make a contribution to this debate as one who has had to cross-examine a lot of children in my time <e> <s> it is the most agonising job you can possibly have as a cross-examiner <e>", "<cs> may i go a little more deeply into what we are discussing and put in a plea that at the end of our debate we should give time for further thought and further consultation before taking any decision on the matter <e>", "<cs> i should like to put forward some arguments to urge the committee not <e>", "<cs> it gives me great pleasure for once to support the noble lord lord campbell of alloway <e> <s> i agree with everything he has said <e> <s> the proposal of the noble lord lord elton is objectionable on the fundamental ground that it is wrong to try to cure what is an administrative problem the situation of the remand prisoners that we have gone on and on about for so many years by trying to alter fundamental legal principles <e>", "<cs> i also should like to support the amendment <e> <s> it is nice to hear that the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter also supports it because speaking from my own experience i have never undertood why this offence is not triable by jury <e> <s> it has always been one of the great mysteries <e> <s> it is one of the most serious offences that the citizen can possibly be convicted of and must find its place among serious offences <e> <s> it is far more serious than a great many offences for which one can always choose trial by jury <e> <s> one cannot shut ones eyes to the fact that on many occasions an assault on the police is charged by the police when things get difficult

noble and learned lord in general after a great deal of doubt i would not be opposed to this amendment <e> <s> i have taken due <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may also ask the minister before he sits down

the home office <e> <s> unless there is a target and unless the standards are laid down so that everyone can aim for them one will never start on anything <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may point out to the committee something which is perhaps not appreciated namely that already possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life carries a maximum of life imprisonment <e> <s> to use a firearm with intent to resist arrest also carries life imprisonment <e> <s> surely it is right to keep some kind of balance between those offences <e> <s> they carry life and other offences carry something less <e> <s> this is surely the whole basis of sentencing policy <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may just add that i hope the minister will not refer to the poa situation in the prisons as being the cause of this scandal <e> <s> that is merely an addition to the problem <e> <s> as the committee has heard this situation has existed for the past four years <e> <s> it is to the main basic problem that this amendment is directed <e> <s> the poa business simply added to it and is totally irrelevant to the basic problem <e> <s> if there are industrial disputes in the prison as the committee has heard subsection gives the minister power to deal with them by coming to parliament <e>", "<cs> i support this amendment which bears directly on the policy which was instituted by mr leon brittan a policy which in my humble opinion has done more harm to the prison system than any other single act by a minister over the past decade <e> <s> how it was possible overnight to lay down rules that life-sentence prisoners in certain categories of offender not because of the person but the category of the offence should not have their sentence reviewed by anybody in authority for years that is three years before the minimum time of years is completely inconceivable <e> <s> to play cat and mouse with human beings simply for the purposes of political expediency is completely unforgivable <e>", "<cs> it gives me great pleasure to support the noble lord lord campbell of alloway <e> <s> if we go on in this way we both may end up on the cross-benches <e>", "<cs> the minister mentioned my four questions <e> <s> as to the independence point the prison visitors are appointed by the home office <e> <s> under the amendment they would be appointed by the lord chancellor and therefore show independence of the administration <e> <s> as to the point about consistency a tribunal would be dealing right across the board and not separately in each individual prison <e>", "<cs> my name appears on this amendment

lord denning that things have advanced since lord mansfields day and justices have to give reasons now in all sorts of situations in law <e>", "<cs> i think i spy a slight gleam in the eye of the minister and therefore i shall say only a few words in supporting this amendment <e> <s> i do so with great humility having regard to the distinction of those noble and learned lords whose names appear with mine <e> <s> we are dealing with deprivation of liberty wrongful imprisonment and surely that is one of the most serious injuries than can be done to a citizen <e>", "<cs> the words that have fallen from the noble and learned lord justify in themselves do they not <e> <s> the purpose of this amendment <e> <s> it was one of the most remarkable speeches that certainly i have heard in this house <e> <s> it now appears that the prosecution in circumstances which are strictly controlled are prepared to vet jurors in certain cases and to discover that potential jurors are totally unsuitable for jury service for reasons that they may be prejudiced or biased to the case of the prosecution but that the reasons for this cannot be given in open court <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord who has just spoken said some interesting things about a debate which is not taking place <e> <s> the debate now taking place is a question of abolition not what you could have instead <e> <s> the issue seems to me a simple one does this right of challenge contribute significantly to a fair trial or is there evidence that its exercise tends to bring about injustice <e>", "<cs> i rise to support this amendment <e> <s> i do not apologise for spending more time on it because i suggest that if this is not the most important then it is one of the most important amendments in the whole of this immense bill <e> <s> surely the way that we deal with juvenile crime is the key to stopping the crime wave <e> <s> it seems to me that very often we spend far too much time discussing how to deal with adults when we all know that the vast majority of crime is committed by people under years of age <e> <s> it is at the juvenile point that the vital contribution can be made <e>", "<cs> members on these benches also welcome the amendment <e> <s> i have several points to make to the noble and learned lord lord denning <e> <s> everybody here agrees that anyone who is in possession of this kind of thing in a public place should have the onus shifted on him to justify that possession <e> <s> the words <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord said that nacro did not

permissive only <e> <s> it would help if the money coming to an organisation could be used for whatever reason was considered important <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment <e> <s>

wrong and they do as the noble lord lord monson has shown by the cases he has referred to <e>", "<cs> i do not want to prolong this debate but perhaps i may ask the minister two or three questions because the concern of those of us who think that this is an objectionable experiment is that the experiment is almost bound to be valueless <e> <s> how is the experiment going to discover whether cases which the cps say they cannot bring on for days could have been brought on in eight days days or days <e> <s> how is that to be discoverable in any inquiry <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may add one word at this stage <e> <s> the minister has really borne a load which is not sustainable by one man in my view and i pay a real and genuine tribute to the manner in which he has retained his good humour

there <e> <s> it has already been said that this is a massive bill and that it is larger than the criminal justice bill <e> <s> i think it is worthy of a mild protest that it was published on th october and is now having its second reading in less than two weeks <e> <s> no outside organisation has had a proper amount of time to judge or comment on it <e> <s> nevertheless it is a most welcome

already been mentioned it gave rise to expressions of view that varied between out-and-out condemnation anxiety and unease <e> <s> once again i should like to spell out the remarkable indeed revolutionary aspect of clause to which amendment no <e> <s> refers <e>", "<cs> my lords that would take place after he had been committed from bow street <e> <s> the decision would therefore have been made at bow street and the accused would be committed to be sent abroad <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord sits down if subsection m goes there would still be no possibility of taking a case to review on the sufficiency or credibility of the evidence <e>", "<cs> my lords with great respect to the noble and learned lord everyone does not agree that it is a good thing that the power should be in the bill <e> <s> certainly two speakers in your lordships house do not agree <e> <s> under subsection it is of course recognised that the power would not be used by the secretary of state to get round the terms of the bill <e> <s> that was never thought to be its purpose <e> <s> the mischief is that although this secretary of state would not give his consent where it would be obviously unjust to do so once again the subsection gives a power to whoever is the secretary of state at the time <e> <s> we object to the giving of that power <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble and learned lord <e> <s> perhaps i may add one other matter to help him in his resolve not to give up and as an increased incentive to incorporate such an undertaking into the bill <e> <s> he will probably know that two cases certainly have been taken to the court of human rights <e> <s> one of them failed on a technicality and the other seemed to be progressing well when the applicant decided he would rather return to be executed and the whole matter was brought to an end <e> <s> there is now in fact a third case going to the court and it might avoid yet another situation in which something like this has had to be put into a bill because of the decision of the court of human rights <e> <s> that might be an added incentive <e> <s> the noble and learned lord might send his welsh envoy with a packet in his pocket to give him extra power when he gets there <e> <s> in those circumstances i am prepared to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certainly disappointed because i would have suggested that when one is laying down a duty in a statute it is better to express explicitly what that duty is rather than to express it by implication <e> <s> however i do not wish to batter my head against a brick wall <e> <s> in those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am unhappy about both these amendments <e> <s> i ask the government as one always tends to do where children are concerned to hold their hand before coming to any firm conclusion <e> <s> i go along with the amendments in that i should have thought that we had reached a stage in relation to the evidence of children at which they should be allowed to give straight evidence there should be no requirement for the complexities of corroboration at all <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister said that there was ample opportunity to make these points <e> <s> i know that i have always taken the view that when children are giving evidence a warning should be administered to the jury <e> <s> i am perfectly sure without going back to that occasion that i took that view in committee <e> <s> the minister really should not suggest that this is a completely new view which is being put forward by this side of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i too support this amendment <e> <s> it is a great pity that this debate is taking place at this late hour because it raises a very important matter of principle <e> <s> it is a matter which has recently been highlighted in an article in <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down would she agree that the advice a barrister gives to his client on the question of going to trial may depend very much on who is sitting on the bench <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise to your lordships for my delay in speaking to this amendment but i was held up outside the chamber <e> <s> perhaps i may say a few words about it because i moved it in committee <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may be allowed to point out to the noble lord that on this occasion i am not being led by the noble lord lord windlesham <e> <s> if anybody is to give the noble lord an opportunity it will be for me to give it to him <e>", "<cs> my lords it appears from our debate quite clearly that there has been only one voice to support the present procedure <e> <s> that voice came from the noble and learned lord lord denning who suggested that this provision was essential in order that the judge could express the opinions and feeling of abhorrence of the public <e> <s> i am hound with the greatest respect to ask him what about a case of diminished responsibility or a case of arson or a case of rape or a case of robbery <e> <s> in all such cases when the judge wishes to impose a life sentence

should like to support the amendment on the basis put forward by the noble and learned lord lord simon and also as someone who has been involved in a large number of cases involving the official

"<cs> my lords i do not want to take up any more time at this hour of the night <e> <s> it is yet another example of arguments which are theoretical being put forward <e> <s> they have no connection

solicitor who is enormously busy makes his application and off goes the person having been refused bail with the next case called <e> <s> there he is in prison many miles away <e>", "<cs> my lords i also support the amendment <e> <s> i shall not take up any time in doing so because i spoke on this matter in committee <e> <s> it is after all a plea that there should be information for the public

rightly been said those people who are subjected to this humiliation should appreciate why it is done <e> <s> the public should appreciate how often it happens and what the problem is that the customs experience <e> <s> published information can help everyone <e> <s> it can help the customs the traveller and everyone else to see whether the procedure is necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords i strongly support this amendment for one particular reason <e> <s> i support all the arguments which have been put forward so well <e> <s> this is an attempt by depriving defendants of their rights to solve what is an entirely administrative problem <e> <s> the basis of this day idea is an attempt to save the escort duties of prison officers and to get at the hours and hours of overtime they are earning through these duties <e> <s> that is not a proper way of solving the problem <e> <s> the minister shakes his head <e> <s> but the justification for this experiment the unproductive hearings is put forward strongly as an enormous waste of time and money on the part of prison officers who have to do the job <e>", "<cs> i am against this amendment for the very reason put forward by the noble and learned lord lord simon <e> <s> perhaps i may say to the noble lord lord kilbracken that we are dealing with artistic works <e> <s> at the drop of a penny the <e>", "<cs> perhaps the minister can

embarrassment at seeing my name on this amendment <e> <s> it somehow crept on to it <e> <s> i think it must be because of my well-known admiration of the noble lord lord mcgregor <e> <s> nevertheless it should not be there <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment but if it is accepted by the government i should like the amendment to use the words shall include the evidence <e> <s> i am rather sad that this amendment has fallen into the trap of referring to facts and not to evidence <e> <s> this matter goes back to some questions which i asked the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor during our earlier debate on this matter <e> <s> we are continually told that it is the court that decides whether or not a person will be sent back <e> <s> if it is the court that decides then one refers to clause to see what the court considers <e> <s> clause which we debated at length and tried to get rid of without success states <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may differ slightly from the noble lord lord renton and congratulate the mover of this amendment <e> <s> we have here the word evidence which is what we have been looking for all along <e> <s> it is rather surprising that the notice which was to be received from the secretary of state was to include only the facts on which the man was being sent away <e> <s> when it comes to representations on behalf of the person he will be asked to look at evidence tending to establish the innocence of that person <e> <s> that goes further than mere representations i suggest and that is why the amendment should be supported by everybody <e>", "<cs> my lords we should not let this matter go by with everyone congratulating themselves on it without saying that this subsection was a nonsense from the start <e> <s> it did not make the slightest difference to the bill <e> <s> it was put in quite obviously as window-dressing as a cosmetic in order to ensure that the matter went through the lobbies and received the necessary votes <e> <s> it is now being scrubbed out <e> <s> however the fact still remains that of course in judicial review it will be quite impossible for the court to review the evidence in any event <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the intervention but i am disappointed to hear the answer <e> <s> it is not often that the advocacy of the noble and learned lord is not given an opportunity and when it is it usually succeeds <e>", "<cs> my lords i express my gratitude to the noble and learned lord for the way in which he has phrased his reply <e> <s> in view of what he says i do not wish to press the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to be difficult but i rise now in order not to ask the minister a question while he is on his feet <e> <s> can he make clear to me exactly what will happen <e> <s> i entirely agree that it may well be essential for the prosecution to remove a juror in a case of national security or terrorism where he might improperly use sensitive material <e> <s> everybody would agree with that <e> <s> however in the attorney-generals guidelines there is the further ground that <e>", "<cs> my lords in reply to the noble lord who has just spoken i should say that that is certainly not my desire <e> <s> one always comes back to the reality of the situation <e> <s> i am very sorry that the minister has reduced this matter to such phrases as well thumbed briefs and solicitors touting along to different magistrates benches <e> <s> that perhaps gives one some idea of the view in the home office on this very serious matter of applying for bail <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say how much i welcome this change <e> <s> i was the person who described the original wording as being very sloppy <e> <s> no one could call these words sloppy and i am grateful to the minister for his effort in the period intervening <e>", "<cs> my lords i have spent a certain amount of time on this bill and i should also like to pay a real tribute to the minister for his continuous good humour and for his patience in listening to a veritable waterfall of legal argument <e> <s> his great contribution has been to make the long process of this bill a pleasure rather than a penance <e>", "<cs> i echo what the noble lord lord morton said about photography now being regarded as an art form and remind the minister that the arts council of great britain now treats photography as it treats other forms of art <e> <s> it has its own group chaired by a distinguished member <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment and disagree profoundly with the noble and learned lords who have spoken so far <e> <s> concentration has been on the written word and the magazine article etc <e> <s> i should like to consider the amendment from the artists viewpoint <e>", "<cs> labels come off <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord for the observations he made <e> <s> i know that he will bear in mind in his consideration of the artist that signatures on works of art are very ephemeral things <e> <s> they do not continue to stay where they are put <e> <s> they are very often removed and people who have to try to decide who painted and who is responsible for a work of art usually give very little credit to the question of whether there is a signature on the work of art which very often turns out not to be genuine in any event <e> <s> of course if the signature had gone that could not possibly be an assertion to the person who is in possession of the work of art <e>", "<cs> i also hope that the noble lord will think again <e> <s> one of the greatest glories of this country is its private houses <e> <s> i do not know why he does not want the architects name on a great house whereas he would love to have it on a factory or an office building <e> <s> the noble lord lord howie has been reminding us of the great days when architects were not the only people responsible for buildings other artists who were not professioal architects built buildings <e> <s> what a pity we cannot return to those days <e> <s> however that is rather off the point <e> <s> i am against the amendment <e>", "<cs> i echo the confusion of the noble lord <e> <s> i find it very difficult as i said on second reading to understand how this assertion works in relation to works of art <e> <s> if one asserts ones right to the person one passes a work to is that assertion to be passed on by the transferor of the work <e> <s> if one does it by means of an instrument is the instrument to go with the work of art for ever and a day and can one presume that it has been so passed on <e> <s> as regards the concept in subsection of asserting generally ones right in relation to a work of art i do not at the moment understand what a general assertion would be in relation to a work of art rather than a specific assertion <e> <s> how is one expected to assert something generally <e> <s> can one assert it generally and then sit back for ever and whoever comes into possession of that work will be deemed to have had that right asserted to them <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble lord will bear in mind that the discussion on this clause is on the basis that there remains a duty to assert <e> <s> in considering clause i know that he will bear in mind the question whether there should be a duty to assert at all in the case of artists in relation to painting sculpture and so on <e> <s> the discussion has taken place on the basis that that duty will remain <e> <s> i hope that as a result of the ministers reconsideration of clause such artists will be exempted from assertion <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment <e> <s> i wish to speak also to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> as we know the author of an artistic work has the right to be identified <e> <s> that right has been given <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness is quoting from one book out of items in a resource list for ilea found in a library <e> <s> she has taken one sentence from one book <e> <s> has the noble baroness any evidence that that book has ever been shown to a child in a classroom <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to prolong this debate because i know that the hour is late <e> <s> however the matter is of enormous importance and i should like to make one or two comments on what the minister has said and to bring the committee back to the points which were made on the form of the clause <e> <s> in my submission that is extremely dangerous and i do not think that many members of the committee on the benches opposite realise the extent of this clause in the form in which it is presently drafted <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will look at amendment no <e> <s> it starts <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord jenkins has put his finger on the point <e> <s> the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter said that the television viewers will be impressed because the committee has tried to get it right <e> <s> that is exactly what the committee have not done <e> <s> they have tried all afternoon to get it right and have got it wrong <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendments particularly amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> perhaps i might ask the minister why there should not be a defence provided <e> <s> the government have reduced support of material which may show homosexuality favourably to the level of the law of obscenity <e> <s> anyone who is charged with an offence of obscenity has a statutory defence <e> <s> surely here there should also be a statutory defence <e> <s> if you are charged with obscenity but it can then be shown that the work has great artistic merit even though it may be obscene it will not be caught by the legislation <e>", "<cs> in answer to the noble lord perhaps it was a slip of the tongue to use the word conviction <e> <s> i mean finding the offence proved <e> <s> but is the noble lord saying that literary merit can have no relevance whatever under this clause <e>", "<cs> the noble earl has not answered the question on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> this sword of damocles is hanging over the council that if it supports this play then it may be said that it is promoting homosexuality because it is supporting an organisation which is putting on a play which is promoting homosexuality <e> <s> that authority will then withdraw its funding because it has hanging over it the sword of damocles that any member of the public or the auditor may say take them to court <e> <s> they are promoting homosexuality <e>", "<cs> i invite the noble lord to withdraw the phrase to corrupt young people <e> <s> it was i who asked the question <e> <s> i never mentioned anything about corrupting young people <e> <s> young people did not come into my question <e> <s> the question that i asked was whether a play which incidentally promoted homosexuality or put homosexuality in a favourable light would be caught by this clause if it had high literary merit <e> <s> corrupting youth has absolutely nothing to do with it <e> <s> the noble lord has misconstrued the question which i put <e> <s> i should very much like him to withdraw those words <e>", "<cs> is the noble baroness saying that the authority takes the view that the play promotes homosexuality <e> <s> that is what it is all about <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord agree that the whole of this matter we are discussing should be left to the ordinary law and the law of obscenity <e> <s> if not why not <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that to display works of art requires space and that one of the reasons there is so little space to do so is the philistine attitude of this government to the provision of extra space for the national museums <e> <s> that is exemplified first by their refusal to be responsible for the addition to the national gallery in trafalgar square and secondly in their failure year after year to provide a home for the turner bequest paintings left by that painter to the nation <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that the form in which this matter has been put to him merely confirms what many noble lords believe to be the real reason for clause namely to bring in a new form of censorship by the back door <e>", "<cs> i am convinced by what i have heard that my noble friends have an important point <e> <s> therefore i cannot see any reason for not accepting their advice <e> <s> i should like to ask the noble earl this question what is the advantage in making a breach which is already fairly well defended by the immigration rules into a criminal offence and into a continuing one <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always a pleasure to take part in a debate initiated by the noble lord lord st john of fawsley particularly when he so characteristically raises a subject of supreme importance for vast numbers of citizens <e> <s> i should like to start my remarks by congratulating him on everything that he has done for the royal fine art commission

occasion and always with admiration and respect <e> <s> i have also known him for many years as a most admirable <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the chief inspectors report on the disturbances and riots in no less than institutions highlighted the impoverished state of the regime in prisons as being a precipitating factor and advocated that minimum standards should be laid down

the inspector described as bordering on the intolerable <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a very valuable debate because it affords us an opportunity to review the so-called policy for the arts expounded by the minister for the arts mr luce <e> <s> the question raised by the noble lord lord fanshawe is a vital element in the arts policy of the government <e> <s> the national audit offices report on the management of the national collections which has just been referred to by my noble friend is a devastating report on government policy on this very question <e> <s> indeed it supports the recent report of the museums and galleries commission which i suggest is equally devastating on government policy <e> <s> i suggest that the two reports highlight the inability of the minister to get his priorities right on the funding of the arts <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sets off for hades with don giovanni will he confirm that i too was educated at stowe school <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to move that the house do disagree with the commons in their amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the minister has just said that this amendment refines the clause

mind-bending drafting of course it is inelegant drafting but it really does not matter if i may say so again with the greatest of respect whether it is elegant or inelegant <e> <s> this is a matter of absolutely fundamental principle and a matter of the fairness of a criminal trial <e> <s> in those circumstances i feel bound to take the view of the house on the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i support

we intelligently discuss the protection of official information the public interest in non-disclosure or the harm of unauthorised disclosure without taking note of the opposing public interest that the public information is indeed information to which the public should normally have access <e>", "<cs> my lords the question that i put to the noble earl had nothing to do with both of them getting off or both of them being convicted <e> <s> the trouble about that situation and it was the basis of the question was that it would hardly be a good situation for two people to be tried together and for one of them to be acquitted on the basis that there was no damage at all and the other to be convicted because he could not put forward any other defence <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble and learned lord agree that the problem is that one party may want to enter into a contract when the other party will not and therefore legislation is required to resolve the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords

in introducing this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble and learned lord go a little further on this point <e> <s> is the commissioner simply to satisfy himself that the procedures under clause have been properly followed or is the commissioner to put himself in the shoes of the secretary of state and think himself that it is necessary for the warrant to be issued <e> <s> in other words does

sits down perhaps i may ask him in view of the controversy that there has been about the meaning of the words national security and arising from what he has just said whether the committee may take it

the house and it is bound to take a little time when we refer to it again <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down that was not what was said <e> <s> if the noble lord had heard correctly it was said that the judge or magistrate depended almost entirely on the crown prosecution service for the information both on law and fact on which to make a proper judgment <e>", "<cs> my lords the point of the statistics was not to show that the unqualified clerks had not been doing their jobs properly but that in the matter of granting or refusing bail there was something wrong in the system which therefore required persons with the very highest qualifications to improve it <e>", "<cs> my lords it is quite clear that there is here an absolutely disgraceful restrictive practice <e> <s> i rise to my feet as a member of the bar to say that i was not aware of this restrictive practice <e> <s> it most certainly should be struck down even at five minutes to midnight <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord harris of greenwich has displayed courage and responsibility in putting down this question for debate <e> <s> his case as he made it seemed to me to be overwhelming <e> <s> it is no surprise that such a question should emanate from these benches <e> <s> the plight of mr rushdie as has already been said raises questions that extend beyond the pages of the <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that the only relevant statistic is that over the past five years the subsidy to the rsc has increased by per cent <e> <s> while inflation has increased by over per cent <e> <s> does the noble lord further agree that the rsc is only one of the national companies and that all of them are in a <e>", "<cs> my lords without any truculence i should like to support this amendment from these benches <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like strongly to support the amendment <e> <s> the noble and learned lord may remember that on two previous occasions i expressed great fear about the powers under the legal aid act in some way limiting the right of an accused person in the crown court to do exactly what the noble lord lord mishcon has been referring to <e> <s> the amendment sets out exactly the protection to which i have referred on two previous occasions <e> <s> i therefore strongly support it <e>", "<cs> my lords i moved a similar amendment on two previous occasions <e> <s> the noble and learned lord showed no signs whatever of accepting the principle on which i moved those amendments <e> <s> in those circumstances i took the view that it would not be appropriate to put the same amendment down on third reading as this is a <e>", "<cs> my lords the greatest asset of an advocate is courage <e> <s> i am afraid that i shall show courage and be extremely unpopular in the view of my noble friend lord mishcon because there are a number of matters that i wish to raise despite it being five minutes past eleven on the last day of our deliberations on this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to ask the minister about the new policy which was hidden in his answer <e> <s> hitherto the export control procedures affecting heritage items have always been based on the public interest <e> <s> how is it possible for a minister without any previous discussion in parliament completely to alter those procedures which hitherto have always meant that the item would go to a public gallery <e> <s> now it will be open to any dealer to make an offer for such an item and then at a later date to flog it off in the public domain at an enhanced price and to the detriment of the public <e> <s> how has that change of policy been made possible <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that one of the vital lessons to be drawn from this matter is the necessity for the government to review their policy with regard to prisons <e> <s> should not they now abandon once and for all a policy that has been attacked month after month and year after year by many members of this house namely the policy of keeping in the same institution those who have not been tried and not been sentenced alongside those who have been tried convicted and sentenced <e> <s> is not that a policy that has contributed to many of the disturbances over recent years <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may have five minutes of the committees time to beseech the committee to support amendment no <e> <s> za <e> <s> i should like to speak for five minutes as an advocate and to ask the committee to realise what the situation with regard to war crimes will be if it accepts the provisions of the proposed government amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord irvine has raised the issue of civil liberties if i dare use the phrase at a most appropriate moment in the wake of the legal services bill <e> <s> to follow the noble and learned lord lord hailsham is always a most daunting occupation particularly when he is in what i might call his philosophical mood <e> <s> civil liberties for me mean civil rights <e> <s> if i am less philosophical in what i have to say it is because i have spent a great deal of my life upholding the civil rights of the ordinary person <e>", "<cs> my lords civil liberties in that sense come to mean something <e>", "<cs> my lords the question that the noble earl raised so eloquently this evening can be summarised in the language of the recently published government white paper are convicted persons getting their just deserts <e> <s> clearly the answer to the question must be no that is why we have produced the white paper <e>", "<cs> my lords it falls to me to express to the noble lord lord swaythling the congratulations i am sure of the whole house on his maiden speech <e> <s> it was a speech of deep feeling and of great reason <e> <s> i know he will forgive me as there is such a shortage of time if i do not expand further on his many qualities and achievements <e> <s> i should dearly like to speak at length about two aspects of our civilisation for which he is well known horses and the arts but it is not appropriate at this time <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i support what the noble lord lord mishcon said by way of protest <e> <s> in referring to what the noble lord lord renton said it is only right that one should point out that throughout the proceedings in this house protests were made from all sides as to the scope of the bill <e> <s> it was argued that part i should have formed part of a quite different bill and should not have been included in the current bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i have misgivings about these amendments <e> <s> i cannot help feeling that what the noble lord lord renton has said is the wish being father to the thought <e> <s> there are a number of questions that i wish to ask the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor in order to set my misgivings apart <e> <s> i agree with a great deal of what the noble lord lord campbell of alloway has said <e>", "<cs> my lords it concerns me as to how the words conduct opinions or beliefs will cover the advocate who says i will not act for someone who is poor <e> <s> he may say that he will not act for someone who does not live in his city and other such things <e> <s> those situations do not seem to be <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the noble and learned lord what are the implications of this amendment because they concern me <e> <s> am i right in thinking that the result of amendment no <e> <s> will be that part-time unqualified clerks of any sort or description so long as they are acting under instructions will have the conduct of bail applications before crown court judges <e> <s> when that amendment is combined with clause the unqualified clerk is specifically allowed to have the conduct of bail applications for the crown prosecution service <e> <s> the result will be that these matters which affect the liberty of the subject and the safety of the public will be conducted on both sides by unqualified clerks unqualified laymen <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord sits down i am sorry to have to say that in clause the wording says that a person shall have <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i too may ask for an assurance from the noble and learned lord <e> <s> i presume that the purpose of the amendment is to preserve the litigants right to choose his representative <e> <s> i believe that representative should be in the plural to select his legal representatives <e> <s> it is a very small point <e> <s> however if that is the purpose of the amendment the noble and learned lord has power under the legal aid act to provide for the remuneration of legal services by regulation <e>", "<cs> my lords i second those words as i raised this matter first in this house at an early stage <e> <s> these provisions are all-embracing in regard to both sex and race discrimination <e> <s> in my opinion they are undoubtedly necessary in matters of pupilage and particularly in regard to giving instruction <e> <s> as the noble and learned lord has already said the provisions will be welcomed by the race relations committee of the bar which has done such invaluable work in this area <e> <s> i am most grateful to the noble and learned lord for the all-embracing content of this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i presume that the provision relates only to certain inaccessible crown courts <e> <s> if the noble and learned lord agrees with that the consultation which is set out in subsection e is sufficient <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may be allowed to interrupt i have noticed that all the rest of the amendments are repeal amendments <e> <s> i cannot believe there is anything to be said about any of them by anybody <e> <s> could they not be taken <e>", "<cs> my lords very well <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to echo those sentiments if i may <e> <s> perhaps i should add that the noble and learned lord has sat on the woolsack for hours at one go and therefore this is not a record <e> <s> i feel that i have made at least one contribution to altering the whole constitutional principle of going through amendments one by one
