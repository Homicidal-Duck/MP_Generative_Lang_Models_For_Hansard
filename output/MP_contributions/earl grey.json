["<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that most encouraging and satisfying answer <e> <s> can he let me know the rate of grant <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby for raising this very important question asking the government whether they will set up the council for animal welfare <e> <s> dr shirley summerskill when under-secretary of state for the home office said in another place during a debate on animal welfare on rd march last that the advisory committee on the administration of the cruelty to animals act is to be reconstituted and is to have new terms of reference which will give it a much wider role <e> <s> perhaps we may know this evening whether this new government are prepared to carry out that commitment <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord include in the consideration the sale of catapults as in my view they are lethal weapons <e>", "<cs> my lords may i speak to you very shortly because i think that most of the points that are to be made have already been made <e> <s> i welcome the statement made recently by the prime minister that this government are unlikely to renew sanctions <e> <s> i think that it is a fair judgment in the light of the results of the recent elections held in zimbabwe-rhodesia <e> <s> i was fortunate in being asked to go as an observer and after spending nine days touring the country visiting polling stations and interviewing both black and white citizens i came to the conclusion that given the circumstances the elections were free and fair <e> <s> one must realise that the country is at war and to try to change the constitution satisfactorily under these conditions is an extremely difficult task <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble lord the foreign minister for that satisfactory reply may i ask him one or two questions which are perhaps a little outside the main question <e> <s> will the government impress upon flight lieutenant rawlings the urgency of accepting the will of the people of ghana by handing over power completely to the new democratically-elected government <e> <s> also can the noble lord say who is going to represent ghana at the lusaka conference <e>", "<cs> my lords first may i apologise to the house for not being able to stay until the end of the second reading debate on this most important bill <e> <s> unfortunately i have a prior engagement which is unavoidable <e> <s> my lords i welcome this second reading <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the bill which will give the government extra powers to help prevent the threat of pests and diseases in this country in respect of beekeeping <e> <s> i understand that it has the support in general of those involved in the industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i look forward with great interest to the maiden speech of the noble baroness lady trumpington who i know is well qualified and experienced in matters of health and welfare <e> <s> i too am grateful to the noble lord lord hylton for asking this question and i shall welcome any considerations that the ministers may extend this evening <e> <s> we are all aware of the governments policy on cutbacks in public expenditure but i am convinced that there are one or two areas in which the greatest care must be taken before implementing this policy <e> <s> one such area is education which is receiving our closest attention this week and the other is that of the elderly and handicapped <e> <s> i have read the sub <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches also wish to express our sympathy and to extend our condolences to the relatives and friends of those who were killed <e> <s> we are grateful to the noble lord for making that statement <e> <s> we should like to know whether the black box has been translated and if so what it says <e> <s> is it not time that airlines were advised to avoid airports which do not have full-scale up-to-date navigational equipment bearing in mind the growing increase in holiday traffic <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble baroness lady fisher of rednal for initiating this debate to-day because i believe at this time with rising inflation and the prospect of worse to come that it is going to be the less fortunate members of society who will suffer most <e> <s> there are more than blind persons registered in the united kingdom of whom to per cent <e> <s> are over the age of and it is well known that a large proportion of persons who are blind suffer from other forms of disability <e>", "<cs> my lords like the labour party we on these benches are opposed to most of the clauses in this bill <e> <s> it is difficult to amend since on almost each clause it was a matter of for or against <e> <s> nevertheless we regret that our liberal amendments designed to protect the position of the disabled were not accepted <e> <s> the bill as the government have conceded is simply a measure to save million in pursuit of their economic policy <e> <s> we regret that if it was necessary to save such a sum it was decided to save it at the expense of social security <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches welcome any provisions made for pensioners but we are very disappointed that the christmas bonus has not been increased in spite of inflation and of what the noble lord lord cullen of ashbourne said in your lordships house last year that the government have the power to increase the bonus if it is considered appropriate <e> <s> would the minister agree that there is justification this year for such an increase <e> <s> each year and especially this year the value of the bonus decreases <e> <s> is it not time that the bonus was indexed to bring it in line with real values <e> <s> the rate has remained fixed through three governments <e> <s> we feel that the bonus is no substitute for a realistic basic pension <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that there is a large number of farm buildings not in use and could not small businesses be encouraged to utilise these buildings for workshops <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise to the house because i shall be unable to stay to the end of the debate as i am due to attend a function which was arranged before i agreed to take part <e> <s> the government claims that cuts in government spending on education are offset by the reduced demands of a small school population <e> <s> this claim is undermined by the recent hmi report which once one has understood the official jargon makes it clear that standards are unsatisfactory in areas where leas spend less on education <e> <s> to see the problem in perspective it is worth looking at an unofficial survey made by the northamptonshire association of parents since northampton is bottom but one of the expenditure leagues <e> <s> the northamptonshire county councils capitation allowance for in the group for example has gone up by only p to <e> <s> to restore the real purchasing power of the allowances it would have to be <e> <s> the figures speak for themselves <e> <s> the effects that such levels have had on the three secondary schools included in the northampton parents association survey are clear <e> <s> one school lost as many as eight members of staff with the result that classes are mixed-target ones with cse and o-level students together and they are far too large <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble and learned lord for his answer to the amendment <e> <s> i shall refer what he has said to my noble friend lord lloyd and see what he says <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords t am most grateful to the noble and learned lord for going to great lengths to explain his thinking with regard to our amendment <e> <s> i should like to read his answer carefully because i must admit i am not an expert in this matter <e> <s> it is a technical amendment and in view of that i should like to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot totally answer for my noble friend lord lloyd of kilgerran <e> <s> perhaps in view of the fact that he has tabled his amendment he may still not be satisfied but it will be up to him to decide and in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble minister for what he has said <e> <s> i shall withdraw the amendment and i may possibly refer to it again at the report stage <e> <s> in the meantime i ask the noble lord whether he would give an assurance that what he has said regarding the addresses will be given a great deal of consideration <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am of the opinion that this bill is being unnecessarily rushed through parliament especially as has been mentioned earlier as the canadian courts have not yet decided important issues which may have an effect on this bill <e> <s> as i understand it this could make this bill unconstitutional <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble lord lord belstead for being so helpful over this amendment <e> <s> i think that in my amendment i did not make any reference to any obligation i used the words <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that decisions that some of these measures be incorporated in regard to safety were taken years ago and is it not about time that these measures were up-dated <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am most grateful to my noble friend lord banks for raising this important subject especially at a time of year when the needs of pensioners are at their most critical <e> <s> i am pleased that the pensioners are to receive their bonus this year but i am disappointed that next year the government propose to take that bonus away <e> <s> it seems to me that that is an unfair and a totally unnecessary action to take as there is considerable agreement that the retirement pension is too low <e> <s> this is borne out by the fact that a large number of pensioners have to resort to supplementary benefit which to many is undignified and embarrassing <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome any measures which propose to update and improve existing legislation and this bill does that <e> <s> but i am not happy with this bill in that some of the tests and experiments that have been carried out will be allowed to continue <e> <s> there is a widespread feeling that experimentation on animals should cease <e> <s> i for one do not like the idea of animals being experimented on and suffering pain and hardship but i recognise that this practice will continue for the wellbeing of mankind <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches also heartily welcome the bill which is designed to end the formal colonial status of the australian states by breaking the residual rights of the united kingdom parliament over the legislation of the states <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that if a car is on the road without a vehicle licence so far as <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches welcome this short but important bill especially in the light of what has recently occurred at chernobyl <e> <s> that disaster brought home the consequences and the precautions that have to be taken <e> <s> i accept that our nuclear power stations are of a different design but that is no guarantee <e> <s> that kind of disaster is only one illustration of what is covered by this bill <e> <s> i understand that there are only volunteers serving in the civil defence reserves of whom are in my home county of devon <e> <s> i have witnessed the good works and exercises that take place in devon in conjunction with the wrvs and st john ambulance brigade and would welcome the same effort and support being given nationwide <e> <s> i should like to ask the noble viscount the minister what steps are being taken to advertise and promote the need for people to volunteer <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches welcome the bill which extends the local government access to information act of last session to health service joint consultative committees <e> <s> any extension of public access to the meetings of these committees including the provision of agendas minutes and background papers must be very good news for all those especially in my party who have campaigned long and hard for more openness in government at all levels <e> <s> it is little wonder that the public are hardly aware of the existence of these committees let alone their functions <e> <s> we hope that the bill will go some way to make their work better known to the general public and thus increase their accountability <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to confine my brief contribution to the environmental aspects of the bill <e> <s> this bill has the qualified support with many reservations of the united kingdom pilots association in that a reform is needed to improve the safety and protection of our seaways <e> <s> in a reference to clauses and which give total power to port authorities to decide which vessels should be subject to compulsory pilotage the danger is that costs could be reduced by cutting back on the pilot strength of any given area <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to support these amendments because they are related to those that i introduced at committee stage <e> <s> the amendments are designed to protect those pilots who hold only a deep sea certificate and are not covered by any compensation scheme outlined in the bill <e> <s> at present there is stiff enough competition in the deep sea area from abroad <e> <s> it is a difficult market <e> <s> if a deep sea pilot is unable to continue his profession due to overmanning he is unable to claim compensation or remuneration for losing his livelihood <e> <s> i am grateful to the minister for introducing these amendments and i ask your lordships to accept them <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord willis for raising this matter <e> <s> after <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches welcome this bill as we have always campaigned for openness in government <e> <s> i am grateful that this bill passed through its committee stage in another place without any difficulties and that the government have given their approval although with a degree of hesitancy as they were not planning legislation which is contained in this bill as was stated in another place by the under-secretary of state mrs currie <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for introducing this important debate this evening <e> <s> i have discovered that out of a population of over million people million are of pensionable age <e> <s> inhouseholds which had one or more persons aged or over living in them per cent <e> <s> lived on their own per cent <e> <s> lived with their spouse per cent <e> <s> lived with their children or relatives and per cent <e> <s> lived with a non-relative <e> <s> of those receiving care from family friends or neighbours per cent <e> <s> were elderly of which per cent <e> <s> were over <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches are extremely grateful to the noble lord lord stallard for once again bringing to the attention of the government the need to uprate the pensions of british people living in canada <e> <s> it is a serious problem which has dragged on for years <e> <s> it has always received the same answer from the government that they cannot afford it <e> <s> that is irrespective of the fact that it is high time that a satisfactory solution was found <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches are in agreement with this bill that brings into line the clubs with other places where people gather to drink alcoholic beverages <e> <s> clubs are not places where one usually expects abuse to take place as there are more often than not customs and rules of the club that are sadly lacking in other public places <e> <s> on that basis we are perfectly willing to support the passage of this bill through parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords as one of the members of the select committee i should like to say a few words about the special report <e> <s> as noble lords are aware the single issue concerned was related to the importation of coal and the effects the new harbour facilities would create <e> <s> i recognise the need to build a larger terminal at immingham to take ships of up to tonnes <e> <s> economically it makes sense as it would lead to the reduction of transhipment costs and to the recovery of port trade from amsterdam rotterdam and elsewhere <e>"]
