["<cs> i am inclined to agree with the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor that the amendment is indeed drafting and technical <e> <s> the degree of detail and elaboration involved in dealing with the presumably exceptional case of successive thefts not only of the same object but from the same person must be piling pelion upon ossa or whatever the appropriate metaphor is <e> <s> however i agree with the noble and learned lord <e>", "<cs> may i ask whether that brilliant piece of intervention is the product of the home office mind or what the lord chancellors department is pleased to call its mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very happy to associate this side of the house with the approval of these regulations <e> <s> it is partly as a result of inflation that the change needs to be made <e> <s> the green form scheme whereby advice and assistance can be rendered without the preliminary formalities of certification by certifying committees has proved to be of very great value indeed and much advantage has been taken of it <e> <s> it may well be that my noble friend lord mishcon will have some observations to make as to the problems that the solicitors profession have to meet in dealing with this matter <e>", "<cs> this clause effects an important change in that it gives to a court of two judges of the criminal division of the court of appeal the power to deal with appeals against sentences <e> <s> i assume that that will be the general pattern if this bill becomes law that normally the case will be tried by two judges <e> <s> i remember being a member of the donovan inquiry into the court of appeal <e> <s> great emphasis was placed at that time when there was a court of three to determine criminal appeals on how important it was that in addition to the number of three there should be a lord justice presiding at the time <e>", "<cs> my lords we covered this ground to some extent when we recently debated an order to increase the number of puisne judges of the high court from to and the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor then forewarned that like oliver he might ask for more <e> <s> he has done so now at this convenient opportunity <e> <s> it is a sad fact that there has been more than one form of inflation as the noble and learned lord said and the inflation of work in both the criminal and civil courts caused me very great anxiety when i was in office and it still does <e> <s> the need to appoint more judges has become inescapable and i agree that since there is no likelihood in the foreseeable future that the upward trend would be held it is convenient from a parliamentary point of view and from the point of view of the lord chancellors department that the required power should be available without the necessity of legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble and learned lord for having met the point that i raised at an earlier stage of the consideration of this bill with strong representations from the law society that it should be done <e> <s> the noble and learned lord has identified the point we are after namely above all to protect the position where a medical report may contain a gloomy prognosis of a terminal condition in circumstances where the doctors and all concerned might think it would be undesirable in the course of litigation that that should be disclosed to the party concerned <e> <s> on reflection i respectfully agree that it is right that ultimate control should remain in the court and i am most grateful to the noble and learned lord for the care that has been given to the point that has been raised and for the way in which it has been dealt with <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for putting down these amendments to give effect to an undertaking and promise he made at committee stage to eliminate the possibility of confusion between the <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may raise an additional point and i hope that i am not out of order in doing so <e> <s> the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor may recollect that we raised the question as to whether magistrates courts included juvenile courts <e> <s> the noble and learned lord was good enough to write to tell me that he was ensuring that magistrates courts did include juvenile courts <e> <s> it may well be that they do but this is not apparent to this unlearned mind <e>", "<cs> my lords we welcome this amendment <e>", "<cs> it is an improvement my lords <e> <s> we raised the point in committee and we are grateful that the amendment has been tabled <e>", "<cs> my lords it is clearly desirable that northern ireland should be kept in line on this matter and i approve of the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for having met the suggestions that were made <e> <s> as it now stands the provision of clause that in dealing with the claim for dependency of the common law wife there shall be taken into account the fact that the dependant had no enforceable right to financial support by the deceased as a result of their living together while accurate as a matter of law was little stark <e> <s> it might lead an unsympathetic judge although i am not conceding for a moment that there is such a creature to give a merely token grant to the dependant in those circumstances <e> <s> i am most grateful that the language that i have suggested has been more or less adopted and slightly improved upon <e>", "<cs> bearing in mind the quantity and speed of consolidation it is not surprising and it is forgivable that there should be an occasional error <e>", "<cs> my lords we are quite happy to accept the amendment and we are grateful for the thought that has gone into following up the suggestion of my noble friend and the noble viscount to whom the noble and learned lord has referred <e>", "<cs> as it would appear that the purpose is to achieve uniformity of penalty in regard to legislation affecting the united kingdom including northern ireland this would seem to be a sensible proposal <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no opposition to this radical amendment <e> <s> but i believe it would be wrong of me to let a long night pass without expressing the gratitude of the whole house to the noble and learned lord for having borne the heat and burden of the day almost single-handed for the government side <e>", "<cs> may i congratulate the noble and learned lord on now finding the road clear <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the change <e> <s> since those far off days i shall not call them halcyon days such a thing as legal aid has thank god <e> <s> come into existence <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for taking up the suggestions of the law society so clearly explained by my noble friend lord mishcon <e> <s> this has at least enabled me to say something in the course of these proceedings <e> <s> it may also be convenient to indicate that further amendments which purport also to be in my name will be moved by my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i begin with the small silver lining over the dark cloud which the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor is creating in the field of legal aid and advice by these regulations <e> <s> i approve of the first affirmative resolution which increases the disposable capital limit for availability by way of representation for abwor under the legal aid act from to <e> <s> in practice not many beneficiaries will enjoy benefits from the change <e> <s> the primary beneficiaries from the increase will be mental patients who have slowly built up savings while under care <e> <s> how many extra applications will flow from that we do not know but there will be a small amount <e> <s> so far as it goes this little modest improvement is welcome <e>", "<cs> may i intervene merely to join in the congratulations and gratitude to the noble and learned lord lord brightman for the great work he has done along with his colleagues on this heart-breaking and difficult work of consolidation particu-larly on this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will welcome the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor on the introduction of what is i think his first order <e> <s> i wish that i could support it <e> <s> alas i cannot <e> <s> indeed this apparently innocuous order has given rise to a great deal of adverse comment in northern ireland <e> <s> in particular as the noble and learned lord said it is strongly opposed by the legal profession in northern ireland both the bar and the law society <e> <s> the northern ireland bar is a bar to which i have had the honour to belong for a great many years <e> <s> it is distinguished both for its independence and for its competence <e> <s> i do not think its opposition is explained by any selfish advantage which may be suspected to derive to the bar from the existence in a limited number of cases of the jury system <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble and learned lord for the great care with which he has considered a matter of considerable importance to the house <e> <s> where we are dealing with matters of significance affecting the subject it is essential that parliament should make proper scrutiny of them <e> <s> indeed where the subjects rights are affected frankly it would be preferable if it could all be set out in primary legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords again i am most grateful speaking for this side of the house and certainly for the members of the bar among whom by some curious chance i still find myself <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of the opposition i welcome the decision taken by the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor to move this amendment <e> <s> indeed it augurs well for the debate to follow <e> <s> clearly it is necessary that it should be mandatory upon the lord chancellor to have regard to the matters which are listed from a to g in subsection and that it should not be a mere permissive power <e> <s> we welcome the willingness of the noble and learned lord to make this concession at such an early stage in our proceedings today <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for taking part in the annual lord chancellors quartet in regard to the provision of legal aid <e> <s> it is not announced to the sound of music or even a fanfare of trumpets and perhaps the latter <e>", "<cs> here we have an early example of government by regulation <e> <s> we shall be discussing the significance of that at a later stage in consideration of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to thank the noble and learned lord for meeting us most graciously and generously with these amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords in the unavoidable absence of my noble friend lord mishcon who i believe will be returning to the joust before very long i accept the amendment which i understand owes its <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the noble and learned lord on his safe return from what must have been a very exciting visit to the united states <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor <e> <s> if i may say so this is a useful addition to the bill <e>"]
