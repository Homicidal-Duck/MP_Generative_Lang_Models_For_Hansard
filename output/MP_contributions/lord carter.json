["<cs> my lords although i rise with some trepidation to make my first speech in your lordships house i am pleased that it is on this very important topic of farm prices agricultural policy and taking note of the excellent report of the european communities committee presented to your lordships house by the noble lord lord gallacher <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very glad to have a chance to speak in this important debate on education <e> <s> i should like to say something about agricultural education which is a specialist sector of post-school education <e> <s> but before i do so i should like to congratulate the noble baroness lady blackstone on her maiden speech <e> <s> as someone who made his own maiden speech at last evening i think that i can fairly claim to be the most recent authority on the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords it is tempting at the time of a general election to make facetious remarks about anything involving sheep and goats <e> <s> however i shall avoid that temptation <e> <s> i am advised that the regulations as amended will be helpful to farmers and ancillary industries in northern ireland <e> <s> therefore i am glad to give these regulations our support <e>", "<cs> it is the last time <e>", "<cs> my lords at the outset i declare an interest as a grower of cereals and rape seed <e> <s> i believe that i am in the unique position of having taken part in the grower poll <e> <s> i voted in favour of the levy <e> <s> therefore noble lords will not be surprised to know that i shall be supporting the motion this evening <e> <s> it is important and essential for the operation of the hgca that it is in force by st august <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by adding my own good wishes to the noble lord lord belstead in his new role <e> <s> those of us involved in agriculture are very sorry to lose him but we are delighted that we now have a minister responsible for the environment who is aware of the cares and concerns of farmers in that regard <e>", "<cs> my lords do i understand from the ministers answers that disabled children who leave school this year will not be subject to the acts provisions and that another year of their lives will be wasted <e> <s> on the question of resources how does he justify expenditure of million on advertising and fees for the privatisation of british gas and we learn this week from the national audit commission that million of that was wasted when the total cost of the implementation of this act is million <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by congratulating the noble lord lord nathan and his committee on the excellent report that they have produced which deals sensibly and sensitively with a wide range of environmental issues <e> <s> i should like to deal briefly with some of the agricultural issues that arise from the report of the select committee and also the fourth action programme <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say to the noble lord that i did not say that we have created more jobs <e> <s> however if we start with the situation as it is now it is the larger farms which employ fewer workers <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the minister will find that there is unanimity in the house from all sides in asking him to consider this amendment <e> <s> as other noble lords have said it is a question of equity <e> <s> there is clearly a need for a comprehensive review of the compensation procedure <e> <s> the governments proposals for privatisation bring in a whole new area of possible inequity and perhaps this was not foreseen when the compensation code was drawn up <e> <s> we all hope that the minister will be able to offer sufficient reassurance on a review of the compensation procedure that will enable the amendment to be withdrawn <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that in the last years real incomes in farming in this country have declined by per cent <e> <s> whereas in the european community there has been an average decline of about per cent <e> <s> is he aware that at the same time the number of jobs lost in this country in agriculture has been <e> <s> if the squeeze on farm incomes that we are now experiencing continues would he not agree that there will soon be a surplus of farm labour as well as of cereals <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank all those who have taken part in what has been a wide-ranging and excellent debate <e> <s> i thank the noble earl lord arran for his courteous response on behalf of the government <e> <s> i must say that i was disappointed <e> <s> i took the trouble to tell the noble earl before the debate that i would be concentrating on the act <e> <s> i asked the noble earl a number of specific questions on the operation of the act <e> <s> the house will have to draw its own conclusions from the fact that he declined to answer any of them <e> <s> it remains only for me to beg leave to withdraw the motion <e>", "<cs> my lords if the growth in the economy is forecast to fall from per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> or to per cent <e> <s> in the non-oil economy and if the pound is now standing at dollars compared with the chancellors unofficial target of dollars does this not imply an increase in unemployment <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble baroness will allow me to intervene for a moment <e> <s> the example that i gave is not the only one in the industry where such contracts have been entered into <e> <s> if a private consultant were to consider such a contract he would be barred from membership of the british institute of agricultural consultants <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that this is just the kind of research that should be undertaken in the public sector <e> <s> is she aware that some people have expressed considerable concern that if the departments new-found enthusiasm for industry funding of agricultural research goes too far the multinational chemical and spray companies may not be prepared to put their full weight behind such research <e>", "<cs> i should like to start by expressing a little disappointment at some remarks that were made by my noble friend lord john-mackie at the start of the debate when he revealed that the noble baroness lady trumpington had asked him not to be too hard on her <e> <s> i was disappointed because i was rather flattered to think that i was the only person on whom she had tried this rather disarming technique <e>", "<cs> my lords actually it was one per farm and not one per annum <e>", "<cs> i should like on behalf of the opposition benches to welcome and support this amendment <e> <s> as the noble earl lord cranbrook said it is an important amendment and in principle we support it <e> <s> we have some reservations on the detail as the noble earl would expect <e>", "<cs> this is the first attempt that i have made to move an amendment in this house <e> <s> i am delighted that the noble baroness has accepted it and i hope that that is habit forming <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> when the noble baroness accepted the sense of the first amendment that i moved i thought it would be too good to last <e> <s> if the amendment is agreed to the landlords approval will still be required <e> <s> we are not denying that <e> <s> we ard trying to ensure that the approval is not unreasonably withheld <e> <s> on a number of amendments this evening the government have produced legal arguments to say that the amendments will not stand up <e> <s> the phrase not to be unreasonably withheld is well known and well tested in law but i understand the thrust of the ministers argument <e> <s> i shall read <e>", "<cs> we on this side of the committee support the amendment <e> <s> it is an important amendment as the noble earl lord radnor said <e> <s> if the government are serious in their wish to have arable land converted to woodlands the farmer must have some guarantee that the various payments that he will receive under the scheme will be indexed in some way to increase over time <e> <s> as we all know the crop cycle in woodlands is from to years and much can change in farming in that time <e> <s> it is by no means certain that the surpluses and the pressure on prices will continue for the next to years <e> <s> if it does we shall all be out of business <e>", "<cs> it would be unreasonable if all the farming comment in regard to the remarks of the noble lord lord sandford were to come from one side of the committee <e> <s> if all that he has said were true perhaps he could explain why the real income of farmers in this country has declined by per cent <e> <s> in the past years <e> <s> furthermore even if what he has said were true what has that to do with the fact that the farmer is looking ahead to the next years at what is at the moment a fixed income from the woodlands scheme <e>", "<cs> i would have hoped that the noble baroness would have made a longer speech were she prepared to accept the amendment <e> <s> i understand what she is saying <e> <s> this argument will not go away <e> <s> we shall return to it on report <e> <s> but owing to the lateness of the hour and the brevity of what the minister said i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that it would improve the morale of nurses and help to reduce the loss if for example a great hospital like the great ormond street hospital for sick children did not have to go out with a begging bowl in order to raise million for urgent rebuilding <e> <s> i believe that the government have spent considerably more than million on the advertising campaign for the flotation of the bp share issue <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount the leader of the house aware that many farmers are very concerned indeed about the support that the government are giving to the idea of the cereal and oil seed stabilisers which would be based on an estimate in mid-september of the whole community harvest <e> <s> he will know as a farmer that this year for example there have been enormous differences in harvest yields between the north-east of scotland and the borders and between east anglia and the south-west <e> <s> as farmers are we really supposed to take into our calculations besides the weather in deciding whether to bring in cereal or oil seeds the prices and the quality of the harvest in for example italy and greece <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the first question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for that reply <e> <s> in the light of the fact that we have been told that we have had the biggest social security review since beveridge are the government satisfied that people who are per cent <e> <s> disabled as a result of the enniskillen bomb the fire at kings cross or industrial injury all receive different and higher levels of compensation and benefit than those received by someone who is per cent <e> <s> disabled as a result of a congenital handicap <e> <s> does the minister also agree that all the people in the categories that i have mentioned would be well advised to secure their discharge from hospital before april because if they are discharged after that they will all receive benefit at a lower level than that to which they are at present entitled <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister respond to my second question <e> <s> i asked him to confirm whether people who are severely disabled and who were discharged from hospital after april will have a lower level of benefit than if they were discharged before that date <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for that reply <e> <s> does he agree that as well as the problem for the disabled of having to deal with inflation the severely disabled will face the appalling prospect of a change in their circumstances after april <e> <s> for example a spell in hospital could mean a reduction in their level of benefit of about per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> in the light of that what is the rationale behind the governments treatment of some of the poorest and most vulnerable members of society bearing in mind that million of the million disabled in this country are living on or near the margin of poverty <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may press the minister on the level of compensation between animals from northern ireland and the rest of the united kingdom <e> <s> i understand the reasons for the higher level of compensation for pedigree animals when that was introduced but surely that no longer applies <e>", "<cs> my lords i am concerned about the difference between pedigree and non-pedigree animals <e> <s> i can understand the level of compensation being higher for the reasons given by the noble baroness but why is there the difference between the pedigree and the non-pedigree animal <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of the ministers answer that the government wish to encourage the sponsorship of sport do the government support the sponsorship of the fa cup and of individual clubs in the first division of the football league by the manufacturers of various brands of alcohol which will then be advertised and thus consumption encouraged among the supporters <e> <s> this house has recently debated the problems of alcohol abuse <e>", "<cs> my lords there are some points of detail which we should like to put to the minister <e> <s> however i shall not detain the house <e> <s> the first point relates to paragraph on page which relates to the required arrangement between the contractor and the occupier if there is application for grant <e> <s> it provides that the requirement is that there should be an agreement for seven years <e> <s> that is extraordinary because as the minister will know a large area of land is now farmed on a contract basis <e> <s> if grant aid is to be allowed to partnerships which can be determined on one days notice if the partners agree it is extraordinary that there should be the requirement that a contractor should have an agreement which runs for seven years <e> <s> i should be grateful if the minister would explain that point <e>", "<cs> my lords from this side of the house i am glad to welcome and support the amendment <e> <s> we discussed the principle at length at committee stage <e> <s> the noble earl lord cranbrook has already explained the matter at length so i shall be brief <e> <s> he has amended the wording of the amendment to take account of the points raised by the minister at committee stage <e> <s> his first amendment in subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for giving way <e> <s> surely it will be voluntary and the grants will be available only to farmers who have entered the scheme <e> <s> therefore if yields are reduced as a result of bad weather but one has not entered for the voluntary scheme one will not receive the grant <e>", "<cs> my lords from this side of the house we welcome the amendment <e> <s> my noble friend has explained very clearly the need for comprehensive marginal land improvement schemes taking into account the balance between the broadleaved species conifers upland livestock and the environment generally <e> <s> as she has said the hectares which will be spread over all the sdas is marginal <e> <s> that is not really significant if we are to balance all the needs which she has mentioned in the uplands areas <e> <s> we hope that the minister will be able to agree that such a comprehensive scheme is required and will be able to satisfy the house on the arguments that my noble friend has advanced <e>", "<cs> my lords from this side of the house we welcome and support this amendment <e> <s> we have accepted reluctantly but without being convinced by the reasons that the government have given us why they could not accept the indexing of woodland grants as we suggested in committee <e> <s> but the noble lord lord hesketh did commit the government in committee to regular reviews of these grants <e> <s> it is hoped that this amendment seeks to stiffen the governments resolution in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords we are very pleased that the minister has felt able to accept the arguments that we advanced at committee stage and reflected them in the amendments <e> <s> as she says they now make it completely clear that in all the activities covered by the bill both under the diversification scheme and the farm woodland scheme the minister has a duty to balance all the interests involved farming interests the countryside and environmental matters <e> <s> we welcome and support these amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the miserable failure of the ec to create a common market in agricultural goods which was an objective of the rome treaty are the government convinced that the creation of an internal market in other goods will not create many more problems than it solves <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with great interest to the explanation of the noble baroness <e> <s> she has now made clear as i thought that the draftsmen would have found it easier if they had used shall in the first phrase instead of may <e> <s> i understand that the government are saying that if they are so minded they could review the grants every year <e> <s> is that correct <e>", "<cs> my lords i am tempted to say chance would be a fine thing <e> <s> however i accept that that is the meaning of the amendment and we support it <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by thanking the noble countess lady mar for putting down this motion which i believe provides the only opportunity in either house to discuss these extremely important regulations <e> <s> as she said there are a number of detailed points which have to be made on these regulations which are of their nature extremely complex <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl confirm that if the figure of million is correct of the million that is the cost of transitional protection million of it has been provided by not uprating the benefit <e>", "<cs> my lords is it correct that the guidance manual for the social fund includes a recommendation that a claimant should be directed towards the use of credit cards <e> <s> if that is the case will the minister comment on a recent report from the national consumer council which drew attention to the rapacity of the banks and credit card companies in the interest rates they charge <e>", "<cs> my lords if that is the case have the government given any consideration to the sources of finance which are more traditional for the poor for example the pawnbroker and the money lender <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for her reply <e> <s> does she agree that the policy review has some similarities to the review of the national health service which was announced this week by the prime minister <e> <s> it is being conducted behind closed doors at breakneck speed and is designed to produce the answer that the prime minister and the treasury want <e> <s> will the minister tell the house what she regards as the governments own responsibility in agricultural research and development <e> <s> we hear a great deal about near market research <e> <s> how near is near <e> <s> will the noble baroness also explain how it is intended that farmers as an industry who are required to fund research and development which they may be willing to do are to do that without some form of compulsory levy <e> <s> as she will know there is a mechanism for that in virtually every sector in the industry <e>", "<cs> my lords from the interest shown in my question it is clear that your lordships house is extremely interested in the outcome of the review <e> <s> will the minister undertake to publish the review when it is finished <e>", "<cs> i was extremely pleased to have the chance to support the amendment so ably moved by my noble friend lord basnett and also to add my name in support of amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> in considering this amendment i think we should first remember the central fact that million of the million disabled people in this country are living on or near the margin of poverty <e> <s> a number of us were trying to point out to the government the problems which the disabled will face with the operation of the new social security bill after april this year <e> <s> i know that a number of noble lords are active in organisations of and for the disabled <e> <s> the number of disabled persons seeking employment or who are unemployed is twice the national average for able bodied people <e> <s> the figure is highest among the disabled long-term unemployed <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl sits down can he explain this <e> <s> if the local authorities are not the right people to do this job as he is suggesting why have all the organisations for the disabled supported this amendment as a step to ensure a few more jobs for disabled people <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble baroness for giving way <e> <s> is she suggesting that the act should be repealed <e> <s> that is interference in the private sector <e>", "<cs> it would help if the minister and the noble baroness lady blatch could respond to the points that we are making and not those which they expect us to make <e> <s> we did not use the word enforce we used the words supplement and assist <e> <s> i should like to repeat the phrase that i used earlier <e> <s> i said that the only circumstance under which a contract could be withheld would be if a company refused to be assisted <e> <s> we are asking to be left on the statute book only what local authorities are already doing <e> <s> if that is removed from the statute book it is discriminating against disabled people <e>", "<cs> i am pleased to have the chance to support the amendment and to explain why i added my name to it <e>", "<cs> interventions become more and more eccentric as the debate goes on <e> <s> with the notable exception of the noble earl lord onslow all the <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> does he not agree that the figure of people that he has quoted previously at the dispatch box excludes the people who have to go to hospital lose their transitional protection and effectively then become newly disabled at the lower rate and the disabled person whose partner leaves or dies so effectively becoming newly disabled and receiving the benefit at the lower rate <e> <s> the number at risk of having their benefits reduced after april is <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not agree that when he answered my supplementary question by implication he admitted a larger number than who stand to lose benefit in the categories that i mentioned <e> <s> does he also not agree that the department was told in april when the white paper on social security was first produced that this problem would arise <e> <s> the risk starts on th april which is only two months away <e> <s> the government are still talking about an interim scheme and are still in discussion with voluntary organisations which as i said have expressed very grave reservations on that scheme and have declined to take any part in its administration <e>", "<cs> my lords may i begin by joining other noble lords in thanking the noble lord lord ezra for putting down this motion to enable a debate to take place on this extremely important topic <e> <s> a number of noble lords have referred to the common agricultural policy <e> <s> i wish to deal very briefly with the agricultural implications of the proposals for a common internal market and then perhaps to spend a few moments on the wider lessons which might be learnt from the agricultural experience <e>", "<cs> i can understand the administrative convenience although i doubt whether it is for the convenience of the claimant <e> <s> in the light of the answer that the minister has given i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am very pleased indeed to be able to speak in support of the amendments in the names of the noble lord lord banks and the noble lord lord henderson of brompton <e> <s> the amendments are designed to protect those with mental and physical handicaps who need a period of continuing education before they are ready for vocational training or to look for work <e> <s> we have heard from the noble lord lord banks about the likely number who fall into this category and the noble lord lord henderson of brompton referred to the problem over the entitlement regulations <e> <s> entitlement regulation b requires disabled young people to get a doctor to certify them as severely mentally or physically handicapped and this has caused immense problems in the past <e> <s> members of the committee will appreciate the reluctance of parents and schools to label someone as severely mentally handicapped <e> <s> additionally there are very many disabled young people who are in no way capable of getting and retaining a job at but are not so disabled as to meet the doctors criteria for severe handicap <e>", "<cs> not attempting to find work is an attitude of mind not a disability <e>", "<cs> my lords as a member of the subcommittee i should like to begin by thanking the noble lord lord gallacher for the excellent way in which he introduced this report which reflects the splendid way in which he chaired the sub-committee <e> <s> with a rare combination of wit and firmness he guided the committee safely through a very complicated subject <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord the leader of the house can explain whether if the harvest in europe this year exceeds million tonnes the per cent <e> <s> price cut and increase in the co-responsibility levy are to be applied from harvest on the crop <e> <s> if so presumably that will be on the price levels which are agreed at the price review which is about to take place <e> <s> will the noble lord also confirm that since the set-aside proposals and the stabilisers are linked there will have to be a set-aside scheme in force in this country for harvest <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for rising to my feet again but in an earlier answer to me the leader of the house revealed a further concession made by the prime minister which was not apparent in the original statement <e> <s> my understanding was that the stabilisers were intended to work in the same marketing year for example if the harvest this year exceeded million tonnes the price cut would have been applied this autumn but the noble lord replied to me earlier that it will be in the next marketable year <e> <s> that is much more sensible but it is a concession <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my support to the arguments so ably advanced by my noble friend lord basnett <e> <s> the first point to remember is the one he made <e> <s> the amendment is moved at a time when unemployment among disabled people is double the rate for their able-bodied peers <e> <s> the code of good practice on the employment of disabled people encourages companies to develop a positive attitude towards the recruitment and retention of disabled people <e> <s> it helps to overcome discrimination they experience in employment <e>", "<cs> my lords do i understand the noble baroness to imply that the firms employing a higher proportion of disabled people are somehow less efficient than those who employ a lower proportion <e> <s> perhaps i may repeat what the prime minister said <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord be prepared to support the amendment if he were satisfied that it did not require the local authorities to ask those questions but merely gave them the power to do so if they wished to exercise it <e> <s> it would be up to the local authorities to ask whether contractors had due regard to this matter <e> <s> they would not be required to do so <e> <s> would he be prepared to support the amendment on that basis <e>", "<cs> my lords did i understand the minister to say that he did not believe that local authorities should be required to enforce a code of practice <e> <s> if that is the case do the government intend to remove the responsibility on the local authorities to enforce the code for straw burning <e>", "<cs> my lords they do not employ the people who burn the straw <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by thanking the noble earl lord cranbrook who tabled the motion and enabled us to debate this excellent report <e> <s> as we know it is a very wide-ranging subject and tonight i should like to touch upon two aspects <e> <s> it will not surprise your lordships that the first of these is forestry and the other is the environmental aspects of less intensive farming and set-aside <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> perhaps i may ask him whether he is aware of the substantial number of organisations of and for the disabled who have expressed grave reservations about this scheme <e> <s> would he also agree that it is important that the scheme is working as quickly and as effectively as possible so that disabled people are not left high and dry on th april when the new act comes into force <e> <s> i should like to ask the minister how the figure of million was arrived at <e> <s> it was mentioned in the press release put out by the dhss on th february <e> <s> how was the estimate arrived at of the number of disabled people who would be helped by the scheme <e> <s> is the scheme intended to last for only one year and is it to be cash limited <e>", "<cs> my lords when the announcement about the trust fund was made in another place the minister made it clear that this was temporary until the results of the opcs survey into the needs of disabled people and the griffiths report on community care were available <e> <s> will the noble lord give an undertaking on behalf of the government that it is temporary that it will be ended and that the needs of disabled people will be looked after within the state scheme once the results of these reports are available <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to all noble lords who have supported this amendment <e> <s> your lordships will realise that it was put down with the intention of discovering some of the answers the government have given and have not given regarding the administration of the trust fund <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e>", "<cs> my lords from this side of the house i am glad to support all the provisions of the draft order <e> <s> in fact i think that in my years as a farm worker as an unqualified person i carried out almost all of the treatments listed in part i <e>", "<cs> my lords in an earlier reply the minister referred to the use of resources <e> <s> is he aware that in some hospitals it is now extremely hard to admit patients at all <e> <s> in one hospital in the south-west on sunday monday and tuesday of last week the surgeons in just one department wished to admit patients for urgent investigations <e> <s> as a result of the stringency of the budget there were beds available for only four <e> <s> the doctors nurses porters and technicians still had to be paid and equipment at a cost of million was left idle <e> <s> the government sometimes refer to the misuse and waste of resources within the health service <e> <s> does the minister agree that a large proportion of that so-called misuse is a direct result of government policy <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister care to explain that to the people who were not admitted <e>", "<cs> my lords i was extremely pleased to be able to support my noble friend lord basnett in moving this motion <e> <s> my name was on the marshalled list when the amendment was moved on report and i am glad to see that he has now put down this motion to insist on the restoration of the clause to the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i have the great good fortune to be the first on behalf of the whole house to thank and congratulate the right reverend prelate the bishop of guildford on his maiden speech <e> <s> he spoke with all the lucidity and sincerity that we would expect from the bishops bench and i know i speak for all noble lords when i say that we shall look forward very much indeed to hearing him on many occasions in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that although there are many people including noble lords on these benches who supported the closing of the tax loophole on forestry there are a number of owners who are considering a reduction in their forestry staff as a result of the changes because they will not be able to charge the cost of maintaining their plantations against tax <e> <s> perhaps the minister can tell the house the governments views on the employment aspects of the proposed changes <e>", "<cs> my lords i express my gratitude to all noble lords who have taken part in what has been an excellent debate both wide-ranging in scope and <e>", "<cs> my lords although there are many aspects of this bill on which i should like to speak i propose to restrict my remarks entirely to the effect of the bill on children with special educational needs <e> <s> i have to say at the outset that this bill may have a very marked effect unless it is amended on children with special educational needs <e> <s> it is a subject that was hardly mentioned at all when the bill was first published and was referred to in just one or two sentences in the ministers opening speech <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for the reply <e> <s> perhaps he can say whether the government are intending to include a grassland option the so-called grazed fallow in the set-aside scheme <e> <s> is the minister aware that this option has considerable support from environmentalists and from a substantial section of the farming community <e> <s> does the minister agree that provided there are suitable safeguards to prevent an increase in breeding animals on grassland which has been set aside this would be a sensible option <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the minister can explain to his noble friend lord renton that extensification is a piece of euro-jargon <e> <s> perhaps the minister can explain to his noble friend the exact difference between extensification and disintensification which is another piece of euro-jargon <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> is he aware that a substantial campaign is planned for including a three-day agricultural show in hyde park which is likely to be the largest event of its kind since the great exhibition of <e> <s> can he say what practical help the department is proposing to give to food and farming year remembering the considerable amount of government help that was given to industry year and to energy year <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the prime minister referred to the local government finance bill as the flagship of the governments programme <e> <s> can he recall the last time the flagship sailed with only two-thirds of the crew on board <e>", "<cs> my lords i begin by saying how nice it is to see the noble baroness in her place again <e> <s> i should like to thank her for her explanation <e> <s> however i have to declare an interest i do so every time there is an agricultural levy as a substantial payer of these levies <e>", "<cs> earlier today we debated amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i think that those members of the committee who voted the amendment down can now start to see the kind of problems which will arise because of the very narrow prescriptive nature of the national curriculum <e> <s> the problems of the national curriculum for children with special educational needs are only an exaggeration of the problems which will face all children <e>", "<cs> i was glad to put my name to the amendment <e> <s> i shall be extremely brief in speaking to it <e> <s> we all agree that the councils mentioned in the clause will have an important role <e> <s> we feel that it is extremely important that these councils have a full understanding of special educational needs <e> <s> the point has been made many times that per cent <e> <s> of the school population at

mentally handicapped but children with learning difficulties those who require special education for a short time such as after a spell in hospital children who require home tuition for any reason and

what basis will the secretary of state decide that a member is incapacitated <e> <s> that phraseology is all part of the conditioning of society towards disablement to which i referred earlier <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> does he not agree that this is a very unsatisfactory situation <e> <s> the government have been warned virtually since when they first produced the green paper on social security reform of the problems of the severely disabled and in february last they finally announced the proposal for the independent living fund <e> <s> it was supposed to have been in action since th april but here we are in may and we still do not know when this fund is to start operating <e> <s> will the minister tell the house whether the severely disabled people who would have been eligible for grants from th april and who incidentally will receive a lot less in benefit under the new act than they would have done before th april and are relying on this fund to make up the difference <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister tell the house whether those disabled persons are being helped and if so how <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister be kind enough to give a date when he expects the independent living fund to be in operation <e>", "<cs> although the amendment refers only to residential schools for handicapped children the minister in her answer widened the scope to deal with special education generally <e> <s> i shall do the same <e> <s> the amendment refers to residential schools <e> <s> as the minister said there are only about children with special educational need in boarding schools <e> <s> there are children with special educational need in day schools <e> <s> they must also be considered <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness referred to savings which she foresaw through the reduction of support services <e> <s> which support services did she have in mind <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness said support services and i wondered what she meant <e>", "<cs> i am glad to support the amendments from these benches <e> <s> they seem to have a number of advantages <e> <s> first they have identified disabled people on low incomes <e> <s> the per cent <e> <s> rebate is both targeted and tapered and i should have thought that that would appeal to the government <e> <s> it relates <e>", "<cs> i understood the noble baroness to say that the disabled and handicapped should have enough income to meet the requirements of society <e> <s> the case for comprehensive income support for all disabled people irrespective of their income has been discussed for many years and rejected by the present government and by previous labour governments <e> <s> if it were accepted the disabled and handicapped would pay their rates and taxes in the same way as everybody else <e> <s> that is all <e>", "<cs> i shall be extremely brief but we have heard from noble lords that yesterday we had a visit from a number of severely disabled and wheelchair-bound young people accompanied by the young volunteers who do this magnificent job of looking after them <e> <s> i was given one example of a young man who is severely disabled <e> <s> he has been told that he needs a spinal operation <e> <s> he depends for his income <e>", "<cs> there is an area which i believe is unclear and perhaps the noble earl can help <e> <s> in the catholic church there are examples of members of a religious community who are running a parish <e> <s> they are not living in a community but are members of a community <e> <s> i understand that the intention is not to exclude the minister or vicar who has an income and who has not taken a vow of poverty <e> <s> therefore one could have a situation where there are two parishes alongside each other one is run by a member of the secular clergy who will be liable to the poll tax and the one next door will be run by a member of a religious community who is not in his community but is detached to run the parish who will be exempt from the poll tax <e> <s> perhaps the minister can tell me whether or not that is the case <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister give the governments response to the excellent report recently produced by shelter entitled <e>", "<cs> my lords in the late s the department of the environment revealed that there was a need for houses to be adapted for the physically handicapped <e> <s> since that time less than per cent <e> <s> of the total housing stock has been adapted <e> <s> are not the government being complacent about this <e>", "<cs> i should like to come in by a side wind and refer to the extraction of methane gas used for the generation of electricity from agricultural sources <e> <s> i am referring to manure <e> <s> there is increasing interest from farmers in that process although in some cases their enthusiasm has been a little diluted because there is a tendency for methane and other digestors to explode <e> <s> however as i said there is interest among farmers for this alternative source of energy <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with great care to what the minister has said <e> <s> i have to admit that i fail to understand if it is implicit in the bill and would put at rest the fears of a number of people concerning some aspects of the bill why she cannot accept the amendment <e> <s> however i understand what she says <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware of the recent report by shelter which indicates that the increase in the number of disabled people with all disabilities not just mental illness recorded as homeless is increasing at twice the percentage rate for able bodied people <e> <s> can he say what are the governments plans to deal with that very serious situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment <e> <s> it is intended to ensure that the special purpose grants must take full account of the extra costs incurred in educating pupils with special educational needs <e> <s> the amendment is designed to ensure that that payment will be made <e> <s> we believe that there is a need for a precisely-worded power to provide specifically for special educational needs and that it should appear on the face of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down i should like to understand what she has said <e> <s> if a school which has not had children with special educational needs becomes grant-maintained and thereby incurs extra costs after it becomes grant-maintained will the grant be increased

to widen and improve section of the act <e> <s> i remind your lordships that that merely stated <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> it is intended to ensure that there will be someone with a special knowledge of special educational needs on governing bodies who can bring the views of organisations and individuals regarding disability problems to the attention of the governing body <e> <s> ideally that should be somebody who has actually experienced special education as a consumer <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not meant to intervene on this amendment but i am drawn to my feet by the speech of the noble viscount lord eccles <e> <s> when he referred to the education system providing for some plums at the top of the tree will he agree that the point was put much more elegantly in the past i believe by his noble and learned friend lord hailsham of saint marylebone when he implied that the secondary modern schools and the technical schools were for the hewers of wood and the drawers of water <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> however i find it extremely disappointing and i think she will know why <e> <s> does she agree that <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that i am surprised that she was not able to answer the question from the noble earl lord halsbury because industry funding is the governments own term <e> <s> will she agree that since she is holding these meetings sector by sector i understand very detailed figures are being given of the minimum and maximum extent of so-called near market research it is a pity that the information is given to outside organisations and not to parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the assurance that the minister has given <e>

gave i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i am very pleased to support these amendments which all have the same purpose namely to seek to ensure that there is proper representation on the various bodies mentioned for disability interests and to ensure that special educational needs are given proper attention <e>", "<cs> my lords i am pleased to support the amendment from these benches <e> <s> it is obviously receiving support from all parts of the house <e> <s> in moving the amendment the noble baroness mentioned that per cent <e> <s> of the student population in further education is disabled <e> <s> that compares with the per cent <e> <s> of the population as a whole who are disabled <e> <s> disabled students are obviously under-represented in further education <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to add to the arguments already deployed by the noble lord lord ritchie but when the minister replies will she answer a question which has occurred to a number of us <e> <s> if the government decide not to accept the idea of a trust and neither the boroughs nor the counties wish to take on the schools what will happen to them <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment <e> <s> i know that the minister and the government chief whip are becoming increasingly impatient and so i shall be brief <e> <s> the amendments are important <e> <s> we are talking about the education of londons children <e> <s> the governments policy on special education is not clear <e> <s> on a previous amendment the minister quoted from the governments draft guidance to london boroughs as though that were enough <e> <s> i have to remind the house that repeating an unverifiable assertion that the london boroughs are to take over the service does not constitute a policy <e> <s> having read three times the section of the draft guidance to which the minister referred i observed that all it really said was that the government do not have a policy on this matter and would the boroughs tell them how to do it <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the change in the basis of the calculation of pensions is now worth some billion a year to the exchequer <e> <s> does he agree therefore that the whole of that billion in tax cuts which is now entering the national pay packet is not a result of the success of the governments policy but in fact comes straight out of the pockets of pensioners <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that answer <e> <s> is she aware that there is considerable disappointment among many environmentalists and farmers that the set-aside proposals do not include a grassland option a so-called grazed fallow <e> <s> will she agree that the government are to be congratulated in achieving what the labour party has wanted to achieve since it was formed namely bringing about the demise of the private landlord in british agriculture <e> <s> it will now make no sense to re-let a farm which has become vacant on a secure lifetime tenancy rent of say an acre when all the landlord has to do is to plant the whole farm with a cover crop and draw the set-aside compensation of per acre <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down perhaps he could explain this point <e> <s> under the new system if the local authority decides to be extremely generous in the services it provides for disabled in its community and thereby sends its community charge up above the average will not the disabled in that authority be in some form of double jeopardy under the noble earls proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords if in the future a local authority decides to be generous as regards the services it provides for the disabled in its area and thereby sends its community charge up above the national average will not the disabled in that area be paying for those services themselves and therefore be in some kind of double jeopardy <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i am pleased to support the amendment to which i have added my name <e> <s> there have been numerous attempts at various stages of this bill in both houses to ensure that the problems and requirements of special educational need are fully taken into account in the work of the various councils that are mentioned in clause <e> <s> at report stage the government rejected the idea of a national advisory committee on special educational needs <e> <s> however as the noble lady lady kinloss pointed out the government have accepted that the national curriculum council and the other councils will have a special remit to consider the requirements of pupils with special educational needs <e> <s> in order to ensure that that special remit is properly attended to this amendment builds on a suggestion made by the secretary of state mr kenneth baker when as reported in <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely disappointed with the ministers answer and also that the noble baroness lady masham was not able to intervene in the debate

an interest at the outset since as a child i attended a speech clinic for some two years to deal with a speech impediment <e> <s> so i am very well aware of the marvellous work which is done by speech therapists <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the minister said that the intention was to increase the supply of therapists <e> <s> surely it is the principle of classical economics that if one wishes to increase the supply of something one increases the demand <e> <s> accepting this amendment would increase the demand for speech therapists <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say how extremely pleased i am that the minister has agreed to accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say exactly what her department will be doing at the food and farming celebration in may <e> <s> is she aware that that will be the biggest event of its kind in london since the great exhibition of <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may congratulate the government on the success of the esas so far <e> <s> i am sure that the minister will be the first to agree that we have a long way to go <e> <s> will she agree in the light of our problem with surplus agricultural production that there is much to be said for directing agricultural policy towards less intensive farming <e> <s> will she comment on the imaginative proposal put forward by the chairman of the countryside commission to the effect that eventually the whole of the united kingdom should be an esa <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that a large number of serious diseases of animals and plants which have been eradicated in this country are still endemic in many other countries <e> <s> does he agree that it is vital for the ministry of agriculture fisheries and food to use its statutory powers vigorously to ensure that there is no risk to animal and plant health in this country from the importation of domestic and other waste from overseas <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that because of pressures on their budgets a number of health authorities are underfunding community care in order to balance their books <e> <s> can he say what plans the government have to deal with that serious problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i begin by thanking the minister for her excellent exposition of the scheme which we broadly welcome <e> <s> we believe that the scheme will go well and that it will certainly fare rather better than the scheme for setting aside agricultural land that she mentioned <e> <s> whether the government will actually achieve their planting target of acres in three years is perhaps doubtful with the initial level of compensation proposed <e> <s> i should like an assurance from the minister that the government are sure there will be enough nursery stock to plant up and reach the planting target <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord stanley of alderley has pointed out that there is considerable concern in the agricultural industry about the effects of this bill on the tied cottage situation <e> <s> his right honourable friend the minister for housing and planning mr william waldegrave wrote to me on this matter in response to a question <e> <s> he stated <e>", "<cs> it was not the role of the adhac that i wanted on the face of the bill but the responsibility of the secretary of state to ensure that the duty was carried out <e> <s> under clause the secretary of state can taken into account any matters which he regards as relevant and we wonder whether that should not be spelt out <e> <s> the matter which is relevant is the rehousing of agricultural workers <e>", "<cs> my lords like my noble friend on the front bench i should like to express deep and immense disappointment that this amendment should have been rejected <e> <s> it was so ably moved on report by the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale who has spoken to it again today with impressive knowledge and sincerity <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down will he accept a correction <e> <s> i believe he said that in the debate in the other place the deputy speaker at the beginning of the debate said that it was a matter of privilege <e> <s> it was said halfway through the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that besides the delays in the payments of export refunds to traders there are also considerable delays in the payments for such things as the premiums on homegrown rape seed <e> <s> is she further aware that the crusher has to reclaim the premium from the intervention board before it can be paid over to the farmer <e> <s> will she agree that with interest rates at their current level this can be equivalent to a reduction in the farmers price of to per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords this discussion of the regulations provides the only opportunity the house has had to debate the set-aside policy and to draw attention to the report on set-aside prepared by sub-committee d it also provides an opportunity to pay a tribute to my noble friend lord gallacher who i believe finishes his term as chairman of the subcommittee at the end of this session <e> <s> suffice it to say that i have never served anywhere under a better chairman whose combination of wit firmness and courtesy has made membership of the committee a positive pleasure <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the enderby report showed that there should be speech therapists per population <e> <s> that means that there should be speech therapists in post <e> <s> in fact there are only <e> <s> can the minister say what plans the government have for dealing with this shortfall of speech therapists <e> <s> does he agree that a large part of the problem is due to the pitifully low salaries which speech therapists are paid <e>", "<cs> i was very pleased to put my name to this group of amendments <e> <s> as the noble viscount lord ingleby has said they are intended to ensure that the special housing needs of the chronically sick and disabled are properly looked after by housing action trusts <e> <s> hats are being given wide powers to improve the housing and social conditions in their areas <e> <s> they will fail if they do not succeed in doing that

quite finished <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> states that hats must have regard to special housing need <e> <s> we believe that it is extremely important that that is stated on the face of the bill so that representations can be made and hats can be kept up to the mark as regards special housing need <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that one of the research projects identified as near market in the poultry section is the prevention of salmonella <e> <s> in view of recent events in this house is she aware that some noble lords feel that to include that area of research in potential cuts is near the bone rather than near the market <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister and to other noble lords who have spoken on this <e> <s> i understand that the minister is in difficulty on amendment no <e> <s> and why he wishes to reserve his position until the discussions tomorrow <e> <s> as to the <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl <e>", "<cs> it may surprise the committee to know that some of us on this side of the chamber have been active as regards a number of bills which have appeared before the committee concerning disability <e> <s> we have some difficulty with this amendment and i wish to explain why <e>", "<cs> i understand the problem entirely <e> <s> i was asking the minister to give local authorities the power to release the money <e>", "<cs> the object of the exercise would be to enable the disabled person to move to another house and then obtain all the help he needed to get the adaptations made <e> <s> the object is to preserve the stock of adapted housing in the hands of the local authority <e> <s> i see the point which the noble lord is making but we are only talking about the transferable discount applying to perhaps or such buildings in the whole country if this proposal was accepted <e>", "<cs> it would help if the minister would say that in addition to consultations with organisations concerned with the disabled he would include consultations with the treasury and other departments to see whether the rules about the expenditure of local authority funds could be relaxed to enable the local authorities to build houses to replace those which might be bought <e>", "<cs> i am extremely grateful to the minister for his reply <e> <s> i am sorry that he is bound by the treasury convention that an abatement of the purchase price is not the same as a cash discount <e> <s> in old-fashioned accounting outside the public sector it certainly is i can assure him <e> <s> i am not sure that it is correct that the disabled should not have some positive discrimination in this field because of the particular nature of the housing with which they have to deal <e> <s> i appreciate his offer to discuss the matter <e> <s> on that basis i withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the blandford fly breeds in river beds and that the problem of disappearing rivers in dorset due to the high levels of abstraction upstream by water authorities which is having a disastrous effect on the ecosystem surrounding the rivers could well be one of the causes of this problem <e> <s> is he aware that there is considerable concern that the proposed privatisation of the water industry could mean that such environmental problems are even further neglected <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that the situation is that if a disabled person is in receipt of income support and he goes into respite care and his benefit pay day is a monday if he goes in on a sunday and comes out on a tuesday he will receive a full weeks benefit but if he goes in on a tuesday and comes out on a sunday in other words if he is not in on his benefit day he will not receive any benefit at all <e> <s> does that not convert the whole system into a lottery <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord suggesting that such people are on a swing or a roundabout <e> <s> which does he advise <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not agree that if the use of bovine somatotrophin is to be allowed it will be subject to a directive from the european community <e> <s> if that is the case what is the governments view regarding the enforcement of such a directive <e> <s> in some countries of the community the average herd size is extremely small perhaps only five or cows <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the minister a question on the disability allowance but will he clarify a matter regarding compensation for the poll tax as he passed over it rather quickly <e> <s> will compensation for income support for the poll tax be based on average liability for the population as a whole or as the prime minister pledged on the average liability of those on income support <e> <s> the minister will be aware that it has been calculated that the liability to poll tax of claimants on income support could be per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> higher than the figure which is based on the national average <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure there is not a member of this house who does not agree with the principle of this amendment <e> <s> but your lordships will know that on this side of the house we have some difficulties with these amendments <e> <s> in principle it is absolutely right that disabled people should not be discriminated against <e> <s> we have all received many heartrending letters to that effect from disabled people who wish to buy their adapted or specially built houses <e> <s> but the point has to be made that if an adapted house is sold and is not replaced the stock of such houses is reduced <e> <s> that then works to the disadvantage of the very large group of disabled people who can only afford to rent such housing <e> <s> that group is much larger than those who wish to buy <e>", "<cs> my lords that assurance does not go as far as i would have hoped but it is enough to persuade me to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords in his first reply the minister referred to the keen competition for this company and in a later reply he said that that was reduced to two bidders <e> <s> can he confirm a press report that the winning bidder was able to pitch its price just above the figure at which the under-bidder would have been required to call an extraordinary general meeting to obtain the permission of shareholders for the bid <e>", "<cs> my lords the successful bidder only needed to read the articles of association of the under-bidder to enable it to pitch its figure just above the point required <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl give way <e> <s> he cited the analogy that i drew with agricultural property <e> <s> is he saying that he will be happy if all housing which is specially designed or adapted for disabled people has the planning restriction that we have in agriculture and that it can be occupied only by disabled people <e> <s> if that were the case i should be extremely happy to accept it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to all your lordships who have spoken in this debate <e> <s> not everyone who has spoken seems to have completely understood the amendment on the marshalled list <e> <s> the points about

a farm tenancy which is owned by a company <e> <s> there is no buyer or seller but there has to be a valuation for taxation purposes <e> <s> planning law on the matter is clear <e> <s> one assumes a willing buyer and a willing seller <e> <s> that is how the problem is solved <e> <s> it happens every day with district valuers in all sorts of capacities <e>", "<cs> my lords the continuing restriction is that the local authority is buying it back at the going market price to let it to a disabled person <e> <s> that is the point <e> <s> the district valuer has to fix a fair price on the basis of a willing buyer and a willing seller so that can be done <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that the noble lord has understood the amendment at all <e> <s> that is not the case <e> <s> the amendment makes it extremely clear how the system will work and i do not propose to repeat it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i apologise that this is turning into an argument about valuations and not about disabled people <e> <s> my amendment as tabled was supported by the royal association for disability and rehabilitation radar <e> <s> that should be made clear

the front bench of jumping on the bandwagon was to say the least unworthy <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister confirm that in a review of the legislation the government will take account of the fact that something like per cent <e> <s> of the homeless people in the country are in the rural areas <e> <s> they are not all on the inner cities <e> <s> can he say what the government intend to do

valuable report and for providing the opportunity for this debate today <e> <s> the report deals with the social and economic integration of people with disabilities and those are the two aspects that i wish to discuss <e>", "<cs> my lords discussion of this report enables those of us who served on the committee to thank my noble friend lord gallacher for his chairmanship of that committee which l believe ends at the end of this session <e> <s> the combination of wit firmness and courtesy which he showed from the chair made service on the committee a positive pleasure <e>", "<cs> my lords i am

one distinguish this work <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister said in part <e> <s> i asked what would happen to the million that would be saved million less million for strategic research <e>", "<cs> my lords million and million total million <e>", "<cs> my lords research funds or the treasury <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the social services advisory committee wrote to the department in october pointing out that the governments proposals at that time regarding hostel charges would cause considerable hardship to the elderly the physically disabled the mentally ill the mentally handicapped and young homeless people and could well result in a number of hostels having to close <e> <s> can the minister say what is the governments response to that observation by the advisory committee <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that virtually all the organisations connected with environmental issues regard the set-aside policy <e>", "<cs> my lords is the

the lord chancellor were extremely helpful <e> <s> on that basis i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister inform the house whether besides uprating benefits there is an intention to put right the many anomalies and injustices in the new social security system <e> <s> for example is he aware that in the case of an elderly couple where one partner receives a severe disability premium that couple receives a lower income by way of benefit than a person living alone who receives a severe disability premium <e> <s> do the government believe that in the case of disabled people two can live more cheaply than one <e>", "<cs> my lords if we follow on from that last answer is the minister aware that implementation of section of the disabled persons services consultation and representation act would go some way to removing many of the fears regarding the closure of hospitals for patients with mental illness or mental handicap <e> <s> does the minister agree that implementation of section of the act would make discharge without regard to the patients requirements a thing of the past <e>", "<cs> my lords supplementary questions have concentrated on small litter <e> <s> in asking my question i declare an interest because i farm to the edge of a town in the midlands <e> <s> is the minister aware that large items of litter such as bedsteads old armchairs and bicycles cause a great deal of trouble to farmers <e> <s> does he have any idea of the damage which can be caused to the inside of a combine harvester by an old bedstead <e>", "<cs> it is not just the football tout <e> <s> it is the scottish supporter who comes down with a spare ticket which he sells in the pub on the way to the ground <e>", "<cs> will the minister explain the practicalities of attending a football match <e> <s> i went to a match recently <e> <s> a number of young spectators were sitting on the hoardings outside the ground <e> <s> they could see the whole of the match although they were not in the ground <e> <s> would they be committing an offence under the new scheme <e>", "<cs> at a number of football grounds young men clamber on the hoardings around the ground <e> <s> they look into the ground and can see the match <e> <s> are they inside or outside the ground <e> <s> will they be committing an offence under the new scheme <e>", "<cs> oh oh that is interesting <e>", "<cs> we learn that the boys on hoardings outside the ground are not trying to enter the ground and so are ok we saw a demonstration of the smartcard technology and we discovered that no one is kept out <e> <s> even if someone has an invalid card in he goes <e> <s> the turnstile always works <e> <s> even if they are in error because they have the wrong card under the use of the smartcard technology everyone gets into the ground <e> <s> everyone who happens to have the wrong card with them or whose card is out of date will be committing an offence <e> <s> is that correct <e>", "<cs> name one <e> <s> speak for yourself <e>", "<cs> my lords like other speakers i wish to begin by thanking the noble lord lord hunter for putting down the motion and giving us the chance to discuss this important subject <e> <s> we were told to expect fundamental review and have received a complex presentation of the white paper and eight working papers <e> <s> the review poses more questions than it answers <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for the very clear explanation that he gave of these codes <e> <s> those of us who have worked with animals will regard them as codified common sense <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble viscount will give way i can inform him that goats meat is the most widely eaten meat in the world <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that on th february in a written answer col of <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that there is still some confusion concerning visits to farms that start during school hours but finish outside them <e> <s> can the minister explain how that works <e> <s> if there are pupils who wish to make a visit but cannot afford it can the minister say whether there is any way in which the school can help <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble viscount for that answer <e> <s> is he aware of the wide disparity of provision of lip-reading classes in different areas of the country and the wide range of fees charged <e> <s> some classes are free some charge a nominal amount of i a term and some charge as much as a term <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount aware that lip-reading training and speech therapy are not the same things <e> <s> there is some confusion on this point <e> <s> can he confirm that the assurance he gave about the future of the city lit centre for deaf people which is concerned because of the reorganisation of ilea extends to courses it provides for the training of lip-reading teachers as well as to the provision of lip-reading classes <e>", "<cs> my lords we can all agree that this interesting debate on an important subject was opened most ably by my noble friend lord gallacher <e> <s> we are in an extraordinary position <e> <s> who would have thought last summer that from november to february the media and political life would have been dominated by food and farming <e> <s> i am not sure whether any of your lordships saw the spoof headline in <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware of a report in the french newspaper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that since the number of veterinary surgeons in the state veterinary service has gone down by per cent <e> <s> that the inspection of abattoirs for animal welfare and for hygiene purposes has gone down by per cent <e> <s> and that we now have a european community draft regulation which is intended to remove frontier controls on the movement of livestock and meat <e> <s> all that is likely to increase the demand for veterinary work <e> <s> with all that in mind should we not now consider an increase in the supply of veterinary practitioners as opposed to the closure of the veterinary schools at glasgow and cambridge <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> is he aware that the global project is part of the united nations world programme of action concerning disabled people which focuses on prevention rehabilitation and equalisation of opportunities so that disabled people can make a statement about their rights their needs and their status <e> <s> this is the most imaginative project which is intended to heighten awareness and above all to change attitudes <e> <s> with all that in mind should not the government be doing much more to assist the project than just providing some free office space for the international secretariat <e>", "<cs> my lords if the increase in interest rates is designed to reduce inflation will the noble lord indicate the level of interest rates that will produce the governments target of zero inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister said she was relying on restrictions on movement to control disease <e> <s> how are these restrictions supposed to apply to wild deer <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply but is she aware that morale in the agricultural research and development sector is now at an all-time low while uncertainty about the future is at an all-time high <e> <s> i believe that the minister indicated there would be job losses in the order of posts <e> <s> is she aware that the true figure is likely to be in excess of jobs <e> <s> those are jobs lost in agricultural research and development where britain leads the world <e> <s> can she also confirm that the cuts and the closures that have been announced recently are only the first tranche of the million that was identified by barnes as near market research and development to be funded by the industry <e> <s> when will we know the full effects of the entire million <e>", "<cs> my lords in relation to the question of near market research does the minister agree with the report on agricultural and food research produced by the select committee on science and technology of this house which concluded that the list of research projects identified as near market by the government does not reflect a government intention to fund research work in the public good and therefore should be reassessed <e> <s> will she confirm that if industry funding for such work is not forthcoming work will cease on a large proportion of the projects <e> <s> that amounts to per cent <e> <s> of the commissioned work in agriculture and per cent <e> <s> of the commissioned work in horticulture <e>", "<cs> my lords in speaking to these two amendments perhaps i may first thank the minister for his kind remarks about my involvement with the bill <e> <s> i am sure he will agree with me that there could be no happier or more enjoyable part of the bill to deal with than part iv dealing with the registration of company charges <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord said when he spoke to his amendment and the noble lord opposite said concern was expressed in committee about the uncertainty <e> <s> everybody concerned with the bill agrees that legal certainty must be paramount in the operation of the register of company charges <e> <s> in committee my noble friend lord mishcon pointed out that it is absolutely necessary to have the registrars certificate as conclusive evidence <e> <s> anybody dealing with commerical law will appreciate that at once <e>", "<cs> my lords i have little to add to the remarks of the noble lord lord hacking <e> <s> that is hardly surprising because both of us received the same brief from the law society <e> <s> i have two questions and one or two points on drafting <e> <s> in what form will the right to register negative pledges be restricted <e> <s> it is only to permit the registration of undertakings by the chargor to restrict its right to create a further charge over the same property as that which is charged under the charge which contains the restriction <e> <s> in what form will this be done <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to intervene but before the noble lord sits down can he say whether he has tried to deal with the last point made by the noble lord lord hacking about the changing of the words acquires and acquired to takes and taken <e> <s> it seems to me that that is the sort of undertaking which he could give now <e>", "<cs> my lords i should just like to say that we on this side of the house feel that the contents of the amendment are clearer than those in the bill <e> <s> we understand the reasoning behind the amendment and it is something which we welcome <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran said there was considerable debate on this matter in committee <e> <s> members of the committee clearly felt then that there was a material difference between mis-stating the name of the chargee and mis-spelling it <e> <s> indeed i had intended to use the example given by the noble lord <e> <s> if for example the name of the chargee is carter and the particulars quote the name of strathclyde i would regard that as a serious mis-statement <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to add a great deal to what was said by the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran in moving the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down is he saying that he is now satisfied that the bill as drafted gives protection to prospective creditors of oversea companies which they are entitled to expect <e> <s> i think that that was the gravamen <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that it appears that incorrect information was included on the application forms which were sent to owners of fishing vessels wishing to be entered on the new register and that that caused problems in meeting the closing date of st march <e> <s> are the government aware of that fact and what do they intend to do about the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like the minister to explain his point with regard to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> he said that disabled people would go into designated areas in a football ground <e> <s> that implies the physically disabled in wheelchairs <e> <s> there are a number of disabled people the blind for example who go to football matches <e> <s> is it the intention that these people would have to go into designated areas or would they have exemption from the scheme <e> <s> if the minister is not careful the scheme will discriminate between different kinds of disability <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister referred to the control of the blandford fly by insecticides <e> <s> is there any work being undertaken on the control of the fly by the use of insect predators <e>", "<cs> is the minister aware that there is an area of corporate activity which is a true democracy and i refer to the co-operative movement <e> <s> i am involved in a number of agricultural co-operatives where there is a genuine shareholder democracy namely one man one vote <e>", "<cs> i do beg my noble friends pardon <e> <s> i should have said that it is one person one vote <e> <s> it is standard practice always to include a reply-paid form for the member to return and as a result of that there is a very high response <e>", "<cs> i believe that i dealt with this amendment or the relative amendment in part iv of the bill <e> <s> we understand that it runs on from that amendment so we welcome it <e>", "<cs> my lords i begin by joining other speakers in thanking the noble baroness lady <e>", "<cs> my lords the question refers to contamination of the coastline <e> <s> there is obvious concern as regards the effect on fish stocks <e> <s> are there proposals and tests on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that at the moment civil research and development is bedevilled by the concept of near market research and development <e> <s> this is based on the theory that if the user of the research wants it he will pay for it and if he refuses to pay for it he does not want it <e> <s> can the house be assured that this concept will not be applied to medical research <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord butterworth and his committee for producing a truly first class report <e> <s> it is thoroughly researched makes substantial recommendations and i am sure that we are all looking forward to learning the governments response to the report from the minister when she replies to the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that reply but is he aware that last year million claimants did not receive a full uprating in line with inflation and that million in fact lost money <e> <s> as he said this year over million have received either no increase or an increase lower than the rate of inflation <e> <s> will he explain to the house the purpose of a system of social security under which the million people who are the worst off in society and many of whom are disabled become worse off each year <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the crucial statistic is the cost per pound of tax collected <e> <s> can he say what is the cost of collection per pound of rates and the cost of collection per pound of poll tax <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> am i to understand that the government will be bringing forward an amendment at the next stage to subsection b <e> <s> in the light of that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the minister for explaining this order <e> <s> as she says it puts into legislation a community decision to end the beef variable premium and to replace it with the headage premium <e> <s> this is not the place or the time to go into the merits or the demerits of the change but it is worth noting in passing that according to a written answer to a question in another place on nd may the minister of agriculture was asked to provide the details of the actual amount paid to beef producers in the last available months of the variable premium and to give his estimate of the total amount of the new premium which will be paid to the producers in the first year of the premiums <e>", "<cs> my lords it was about the sale of cattle on the farm to dealers <e> <s> who will be eligible for the premium <e> <s> how will the ministry ensure that when cattle are sold in that form the premium will find its way back to the producer <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble baroness will give way it is not the punching of the ears but their removal which is mentioned in the order <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that considerable concern has been expressed by among others the british medical association and the institute of environmental health officers that the irradiation process does not kill toxins in contaminated food and that the organism which causes botulism is an example <e> <s> is the minister able to tell the house whether research into the irradiation of food is regarded by the government either as being for the public good and therefore will be funded by the taxpayer or as being near market and therefore suitable for funding by the food industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> is he aware that speaking on television on th april last year his right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer said that to have half the average earnings in this country is to be poor <e> <s> so that is what it means to be poor to have half average earnings <e> <s> it is hard to get hold of the exact figures because conveniently the government stopped collecting them last year <e> <s> however does the noble lord agree that this could apply to about million people who would come into the category of earning half the average wage <e> <s> does he agree with the definition of poverty given by the chancellor of the exchequer <e>", "<cs> my lords while it is hard to define poverty can the government say why they discontinued last year the collection of statistics that related the number of families on low income to benefit scales <e>", "<cs> my lords why have the government discontinued the collection of statistics which were collected for a number of years <e> <s> last year the government decided to discontinue the collection of information that would have enabled them to identify the families on low incomes and relate those numbers to benefit scales <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for having to rise again <e> <s> perhaps i may correct the point that was made by the noble lord opposite <e> <s> i referred as did the chancellor of the exchequer to half average earnings <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that he confused the average with half the average <e>", "<cs> my lords as a number of your lordships have said the bill brings in yet more changes to the social security system <e> <s> for that reason it should perhaps be judged not only on what it contains but on how it measures up against the many real problems which beset so many of our people <e> <s> i shall give a few examples the million disabled people who are now worse off than they were before the act the million people one-sixth of the population living at or below income support level an increase of per cent <e> <s> since pensioners who are now in total billion per annum worse off as a result of breaking the link between earnings and pensions <e> <s> the government take considerable credit for the billion surplus in the public sector which is being used to repay the national debt <e> <s> we should remember that almost half of that figure has come out of pensioners pockets <e> <s> there are the claimants who saw no increase in their cash income in the recent upratings and the claimants who received less than the full increase <e>", "<cs> i was pleased to add my name to a number of the amendments in the group <e> <s> as the noble lord lord stanley of alderley pointed out we are dealing with the danger of differential <e>", "<cs> i am extremely grateful to the noble lord for his reply <e> <s> i was aware of condition of the draft licence <e> <s> the disability organisations have been concerned that these measures would not go far enough <e> <s> i hope that we now have it on the record <e> <s> it was obviously in the nature of a probing amendment <e> <s> i am sure the minister realised that <e> <s> i shall read with care what he has said as i am sure will the organisations which briefed me <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> where in the social security system can the help be obtained <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to declare an interest as the director of an independent television company which makes a weekly programme for people with disabilities which goes out on the commercial network <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no wish to detain the house but i have just a couple of questions to the minister which i hope she will be able to help us with <e> <s> in relation to the environmental top-up scheme do we yet know the governments proposals for the extensification scheme which has to be introduced by under the european directive <e> <s> is the top-up scheme part of this or are we to hear about the wider scheme in the near future <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister mentioned the increase in the help given to rural housing <e> <s> will he confirm that that help amounts to a total of houses <e> <s> is that not a minuscule addition to the solution of the rural housing problem <e>", "<cs> my lords is it the case that everybody is expected to pay one-fifth as a minimum of the community charge <e> <s> on the figures that the noble lord has given does it mean that the poorest will be bearing a bill of about million <e>", "<cs> i am extremely grateful to all noble lords who have spoken <e> <s> i understand that the minister is personally sympathetic to the problems that we have described <e> <s> however i find the governments attitude extremely hard to understand <e> <s> the cost would be virtually nothing in terms of the total cost of mobility allowance <e> <s> it would be of the order of million to million <e> <s> it would help severely disabled people <e> <s> we know the numbers <e> <s> we do not need the opcs to tell us <e> <s> the government are not able to answer the argument and have to hide behind the survey which has no relevance <e> <s> we know the numbers <e> <s> we are not proposing a new allowance or a new category of people <e>", "<cs> i have my name to amendment no <e> <s> which is grouped with the amendment moved <e> <s> it would be helpful if the noble lord could confirm the point about voluntary work <e> <s> i had a letter from him only this morning and had i received it earlier i should not have needed to table the amendment <e> <s> will the noble lord confirm that where a person is engaged in voluntary work that will be taken as evidence that he is available for and actively seeking work <e> <s> if that is the case i shall not need to move amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down can he say what are the circumstances where the threat of the loss of benefit could help a person to secure employment <e> <s> can he explain that <e> <s> i did not understand it at all <e>", "<cs> although i had not intended to speak in connection with this amendment perhaps i may put one question to the minister before he sits down <e> <s> it occurs to me that the problem could also apply to gang workers in agriculture <e> <s> they often have to take casual work for short periods of time <e> <s> have the government given any thought to that problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i am pleased to add my support to the amendment <e> <s> it seems to meet all the points and objections made by the government on this subject during previous stages of the bill <e> <s> it seems to protect the rights that should be protected while giving the secretary of state all the rights that he needs <e> <s> it seems to strike the correct balance between private rights and public duties <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> is he aware of the considerable concern on this matter that has been expressed by among <e>", "<cs> like what <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> is she aware of the very considerable concern that has been expressed at the closure of this research institute in view of the massive increase in food poisoning that is taking place <e> <s> the minister referred to the fact that food hygiene safety work is to be protected <e> <s> if that is the case can the minister say why as a result of the government cuts two research projects have been closed at bristol this year <e> <s> the first project was into the subject of salmonella poisoning in poultry and eggs and the second involved research into botulism <e> <s> can the minister say whether it is part of the new enterprise culture that the scientist responsible for the botulism work is now the manager of a golf course <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of that reply can the noble baroness say what will happen to the new million food hall at bristol which is unique in the world and what will happen to the work carried out there <e> <s> in addition will the work into food refrigeration techniques be stopped including work on the alternatives to cfcs <e>", "<cs> my lords i am referring to research into the processing of food at the food hall bristol which is unique <e>", "<cs> my lords this bill has many political and financial implications and will affect local government substantially <e> <s> my noble friend lord mcintosh has ably covered the broad sweep of the provisions of the bill <e> <s> i should like to concentrate on two aspects of the bill <e> <s> the first which i do not think has been touched on is the way that it will affect people with disabilities and the second is the provision of low-cost rural housing <e>", "<cs> my lords

accommodation five years ago was and the bill this year is <e> <s> that is because per cent <e> <s> of the homeless are in rural areas <e> <s> what plans do the government have to solve the housing problem in rural areas because if they do not solve it it will wreck the social structure of the countryside <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for her explanation of the order and declare an interest at the outset as a rapeseed grower a director of a major oilseeds co-operative one who voted yes in the recent grower poll and one who wrote in the agricultural press and urged other farmers to vote yes <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a seed that produces oil <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble baroness for explaining the regulations <e> <s> perhaps i may repeat the comment made in another place when the order was discussed is this a case of mr delors strikes again <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e>", "<cs> my lords the phrase has been on the statute book since the social security act was enacted <e>", "<cs> my lords i begin by thanking all noble lords who have spoken in what has been <e>", "<cs> my lords that is absolutely true <e> <s> if the opcs survey was relevant to this amendment then that would be quite correct <e>", "<cs> my lords if this amendment were accepted there would still be some borderline cases <e> <s> indeed there always are in such matters <e> <s> however they would be very much reduced in number <e> <s> that is the point <e> <s> as i say the phrase is already in the act and in the regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> we could save a good deal of time on the bill if on successive amendments he were to stand up and say opcs and then sit down <e> <s> in the light of what he said which i found fairly helpful i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am pleased to support the amendment <e> <s> as the noble earl said there is a real problem for those who suffer from aids and hiv infections <e> <s> it is one of the problems we foresaw with the abolition of the additional payments under the old system of supplementary benefit for items such as heating laundry and bathing <e> <s> the government replaced targeting with the relative inflexibility of the disability premium and the severe disability premium <e> <s> with the aids condition there is severe sweating and incontinence <e> <s> pneumonia is almost invariably associated with aids with the extra heating costs that are required <e>", "<cs> my lords i am pleased to have the opportunity to add my own words of thanks to the minister for the courtesy and good humour which he has shown in the conduct of the bill <e> <s> we are all aware of the considerable personal concern which he shows for the various problems which we have brought to his attention <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the lowest estimate of ec fraud is equal to twice the total income of the whole of british farming and the highest estimate to six times the total income of british farming <e> <s> does this not indicate the scale and severity of the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely understand and accept what the noble lord the leader of the house has just said which is that we are entitled to debate the amendment again but i shall not do that <e> <s> i think it will surprise the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter that i intend to agree with him <e> <s> the noble lord may well look surprised because i think this will be the first and the last occasion <e> <s> the noble lord used the phrase substantial charges on public funds a number of times <e>", "<cs> i am extremely grateful to the minister <e> <s> this is one of those situations where as the noble lord said all we want is the technique in order to achieve the answer on which we are all agreed <e> <s> i take the point that the noble lord made about the first two amendments <e> <s> however the third amendment amendment no <e> <s> is a rounding up amendment to make sure that the intention is clearly understood that nothing earlier in the clause should affect the selection of any person who is disabled <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply but is she aware that when her right honourable friend the prime minister opened the royal show about a fortnight ago she referred to the success of the governments agricultural policies <e> <s> if we bear in mind that agricultural investment in the years of this government has fallen by per cent <e> <s> in real terms that we have lost jobs and that farm incomes have declined by per cent <e> <s> in real terms can she tell the house if that is success what the government regard as failure <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister referred to the per cent <e> <s> of the total value of the agricultural industry that is borrowed <e> <s> that figure includes the value of land <e> <s> if she would be good enough to look at the borrowing figure against what is normally known as the tenants capital in agriculture she would find that the industry was extremely highly borrowed <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that answer <e> <s> is she aware that the current proposals leaving aside those that are still to be announced mean that agricultural research establishments are to close a further six are threatened with closure and substantial reductions in funding are planned for eight more <e> <s> in the light of all this can she tell the house exactly what her right hounourable friend the prime minister meant when she told the royal society last year <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the low morale in the agricultural rd sector is exceeded only by its bewilderment regarding the future intentions of the government <e> <s> can she therefore assure the house that following the per cent <e> <s> cut in research funding between and and the further substantial cuts which have been discussed this afternoon the government at some stage will issue a definitive statement draw a line and leave this sector to plan in peace the reduced role which is left to it <e>", "<cs> my lords my question concerns the balance of payments <e> <s> the minister referred to the strength of our overseas assets <e> <s> since the income from those assets is taken into account in the calculation of the deficit on the balance of payments and since they are largely held in private hands could he please explain how the strength of the overseas assets can be mobilised to finance some of the deficit on the balance of payments <e>", "<cs> i am extremely pleased to add my name to this amendment and to give support to it from this side of the committee <e> <s> however before i proceed to the amendment i must ask the noble lord lord swinfen to meet me afterwards and explain exactly the changes required to a mini-car to enable it pull a plough <e>", "<cs> i was pleased to add my name to these amendments <e> <s> in fact i had my name to both amendments nos <e> <s> and but it only appears on amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i found the ministers answer extremely disappointing <e> <s> i know that he is personally sympathetic as regards this matter but the governments reply was not satisfactory <e> <s> it would assist the committee if the minister were to state in terms the principle which the government are adopting <e> <s> are they saying that they do not accept the principle of grants as of right to disabled people irrespective of income to meet the extra costs of disability <e> <s> that factor is fundamental in the consideration of disability income and the noble earl will realise as we debate the opcs reports and the review of the benefits which the government are introducting that this will be a central argument <e>", "<cs> i shall speak to the group of amendments because i have only a general point to make and i know that detailed points will be made by the noble lord lord swinfen as he comes to each amendment <e>", "<cs> this is extremely good news and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> that is the answer i expected <e> <s> it misses the point i made <e> <s> i understand the logic of the ministers argument <e> <s> the point is that there is a substantial number of disabled people this is happening now in scotland and it will happen in england

the reduced rates that they were paying before <e> <s> they do not think of their neighbours <e> <s> all they can think of is their own outgoings this year and in scotland it was last year <e> <s> there is a substantial increase <e> <s> i do not propose to press the amendment at this stage <e> <s> we shall have to return to it at the next stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i had not intended to intervene on this amendment but it occurs to me to ask the minister a question <e>", "<cs> i am extremely glad to support the amendment from this side of the committee <e> <s> i should declare an interest in the subject from the outset in that the farming company in which i am involved is actively considering the setting up of a low cost housing scheme <e> <s> the noble lord lord stanley has set the scene admirably and i shall therefore be brief <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> the research that was undertaken by mencap during the course of the social security bill was accurate <e> <s> we are quite confident that the number who would have benefited was a few thousand <e> <s> the government tried to reject the amendment in this place by referring to a figure of and in the other place <e> <s> they are now saying <e> <s> can the minister confirm that this absurd figure includes either by action or design a substantial number of the mentally ill not the mentally handicapped and those suffering from other conditions which are completely outside the definition in the question on the order paper <e> <s> since we are satisfied that our original figure was correct can the minister say when the government will stop playing the numbers game with the severely mentally handicapped <e> <s> when will they bring forward proposals to extend the mobility allowance to a few thousand of the most severely handicapped people in society <e>", "<cs> my lords i have just made a quick calculation <e> <s> is the minister aware that the absurdity of the governments new figure of is illustrated by this fact <e> <s> if the governments figures are correct there are in excess of people in london alone who are severely mentally handicapped and in need of physical control and assistance <e> <s> does he agree that this figure is not only an insult to the intelligence of parliament but plain daft <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> is he aware that the institute of fiscal studies which is an independent and much respected body agreed with the social services select committee in the other place that the government changes made in the calculation of the poverty statistics <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister also aware of the excellent report by the national association of citizens advice bureaux entitled <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord middleton for introducing the report <e> <s> as the first member of sub-comittee d to speak in the debate i thank him for his skilful chairmanship in steering us through a complex subject <e>", "<cs> my lords i was pleased to add my name to the amendment as indeed i did to other amendments on similar subjects at earlier stages of the bill <e> <s> the problem which lies behind the amendment was well aired during the initial stages and the situation has been explained again with great clarity by the noble lord lord swinfen <e> <s> therefore there is no need to repeat the arguments in detail <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the house is grateful to the noble lord the chairman of committees for that helpful answer <e> <s> can he confirm that the televising of the proceedings of this house will not be subject to the restrictions that have been placed on the televising of those in another place <e> <s> we must assume that the coverage of the proceedings of this house will be diminished <e> <s> therefore can the noble lord explain the criteria for deciding which of our proceedings will be televised <e>", "<cs> my lords there is still one point which is not clear <e> <s> i understand that the proceedings of the committees of another place are to be televised <e> <s> will that also apply to the proceedings in committee of this house <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that per cent <e> <s> of the increase in the level of spending has been due to an increase in the number of claimants and that only per cent <e> <s> is due to an increase in the level of benefits <e> <s> does he agree that that is hardly surprising since virtually all social security benefits with the exception of the mobility allowance have been frozen in real terms for the last years and in fact the level of the sickness benefit has declined in real terms <e> <s> since we have all been sharing in an economic miracle is it not rather unfair that those who receive social security benefits have not benefited from that miracle <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to my noble friend lady ewart-biggs for tabling this motion for debate and enabling us to discuss this extremely important problem <e> <s> the motion deals with a wide sweep of family problems and i propose to concentrate on that part which deals with social provision <e> <s> as has been said there is a raft of problems which is placing enormous strains on the family as a social unit <e> <s> for example there is the increase in divorce the growth in illegitimacy the lack of parental responsibility the increasing level of violence and drug-taking among some young people <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be extremely grateful to the noble baroness for the way in which she has explained these orders <e> <s> from this side of the house we welcome them in principle <e> <s> the noble baroness will know that i have always been a supporter of the principle of development councils <e>", "<cs> my lords i join with other noble lords in thanking the noble lord lord hunter of newington for introducing this most timely debate <e> <s> it has emphasised the concern we all share to ensure that the national health service delivers the services the patient needs in the most effective way possible <e> <s> it would be fair to say that most speakers have expressed what one can describe as a measured criticism of the proposed reforms <e>", "<cs> my lords the bill which we are discussing involves at one level substantial questions of ethics morality and religious belief and at a different but no lesser level agonising human choices and decisions <e> <s> those of us without a theological medical or legal training will have to reach our decisions on the bill in the privacy of our own consciences and those decisions will be none the worse or the less considered for that <e> <s> since each of us will be exercising a free vote it is important when joining in the debate to make ones own personal position clear so that it can be taken into account when the house is considering the arguments that we each put forward <e>", "<cs> my lords while i congratulate the government on the abolition of the earnings rule something which we warmly welcome from this side of the house the pensioners who benefit will be liable to tax <e> <s> can the minister tell the house whether the government propose any action to correct the situation whereby pensioners who pay tax are worse off compared to other taxpayers since <e> <s> will the government restore the situation which existed before so that pensioners who pay tax have the same relationship to other taxpayers which existed at that time <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that the noble lord understands my question <e> <s> the differential in favour of the tax paying pensioner was of the order of per cent <e> <s> compared to other pensioners and is now only per cent <e> <s> it has gone down by a third in the past five years <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord will write to me as i do not think he has understood my question <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> i understand exactly what she is saying but the problem lies in the words fodder or feeding stuffs <e> <s> the amendment refers to animals or birds and we wish to be clear that the bill is not intended to deal with the rendering of animals or birds as a form of feeding stuffs <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am disappointed by the ministers reply <e> <s> in my view if the amendment had been accepted it would have given the government the chance to deal with many of the problems and concerns in connection with local authorities which have been brought to our attention <e> <s> i must say that consultation is not the same as a five-year projection or commitment <e> <s> further as i understand her answer it would be possible for the money to be clawed back <e> <s> i trust that i understand the position correctly <e>", "<cs> is the minister saying that it cannot in fact be clawed back <e>", "<cs> in that case it would mean that in negotiations on the rate support grant there is no way that the money could be reallocated so that the million was not in fact available <e>", "<cs> if i may say so that is a most welcome assurance <e> <s> however i shall read with care what the minister said and perhaps return to the matter at a later stage of the bills proceedings <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> is the noble baroness happy with the proposed words as appear to them in other words which appear to the government to be representative or would she accept the words <e>", "<cs> from these benches we support the new clause because it is a reasonable and sensible proposition <e> <s> the noble lord lord stanley of alderley has drawn attention to the considerable injustice that can result where restrictions are imposed and it is then shown that there was no danger in the food <e>", "<cs> the drafting may be at fault because we are obviously not understanding each other <e> <s> this amendment is intended to show that if the purchaser is not himself or herself prejudiced but someone else is that other person can take action <e> <s> at the moment the third party who is affected by the unsafe food is not able to take action <e>", "<cs> in the light of that assurance i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i certainly wish to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> however the answer that has just been given regarding eggs is extremely interesting <e> <s> as we know the problem with imported eggs is that the rest of the consignment has disappeared into the food chain while the eggs that are suspected of contamination are being tested <e> <s> i hope the noble baroness will write to me to tell me how the government propose to deal with that problem <e> <s> i should be interested to know that <e> <s> however in the light of the comments that have been made i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> it is important in discussing the amendment to consider the technical point of the status of the scientific protocols concerned in the measurement of residue levels <e> <s> this is extremely important to manufacturers farmers and consumers <e> <s> the minister will be familiar with the example of oilseed rape <e> <s> the ec introduced a change in the subsidy rules which meant that there was a maximum level measured in micromoles of glucosinalates <e> <s> this affected the subsidy <e> <s> but there was no agreement about the way in which this should be measured <e> <s> it is important for the minister to explain to the chamber perhaps she may need to write to me afterwards exactly how the government intend to deal with the status of the scientific protocols in determining the levels of the residue <e>", "<cs> since we on this side of the house have put down a number of amendments in which we encourage and exhort the government to consult with all interested bodies we have no hestitation in supporting this amendment and saying that anything which brings the consumer and producer closer together is wholly desirable <e>", "<cs> although the drafting of the amendment may not be perfect as the noble lord lord tordoff has said we feel that in principle it is a good idea <e> <s> perhaps the government will consider it <e>", "<cs> this is an interesting amendment <e> <s> it seems that there is an omission in the bill regarding the implications for pick-your-own which the draftsman has not really thought through <e> <s> the minister will know that we are encouraged by the ministry and by adas to diversify our farm enterprises including the operation of pick-your-owns <e>", "<cs> on these benches we are pleased to support the amendments <e> <s> considerable concern has been expressed by a number of organisations about the quite draconian powers contained in clauses and of the bill <e> <s> we all understand and accept the need to protect trade secrets although i expect that the lawyers will have a field day in defining a trade secret <e> <s> the protection of a manufacturing process which may have no commercial value and which may involve an imminent risk of injury to health is not acceptable <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that the minister has solved the problem because i am talking about the case of a private consultant who is acting as a public analyst <e> <s> however i do not wish to take up the time of the committee now <e> <s> i shall read what the noble baroness said and i may come back again at a later stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am extremely grateful to the minister for that explanation <e> <s> i believe that she has met the concerns we have expressed <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for that assurance and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my name is attached to amendment no <e> <s> which is grouped with this amendment <e> <s> the minister has been making helpful noises throughout the bill about her wish to consult with other organisations so i shall be interested to hear her views on consultation with food authorities <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for that explanation <e> <s> i shall read carefully what she said and in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the explanation is helpful <e> <s> i shall read with care what the noble baroness has said <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the house is extremely grateful to the minister for the way in which he explained the orders <e> <s> i appreciate the lateness of the hour but we must take just a little time to consider them because we are discussing a most important matter which has caused great economic loss to many farmers in the affected area <e> <s> moreover i believe that this is the first time we have had the chance to discuss the problem in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps it may help the minister to know that per cent <e> <s> of the increase is due to an increase in the number of claimants and per cent <e> <s> is due to an increase in the real level of benefit <e> <s> however in view of the figures which he has given can he comment on the church of england report <e>", "<cs> my lords i can tell the noble lord that i believe the relevant figure is per cent <e> <s> compared with per cent <e> <s> for the old supplementary benefit <e> <s> however was the ministers unwillingness to answer the question i put to him about the church of england report due to the fact that the government do not agree with the conclusions or because they do not like them <e>", "<cs> my lords we all agree that parents who default on maintenance payments should not be able to hide behind the social security system <e> <s> however does the minister agree that the most important consideration in question is the welfare of the million children in lone-parent families <e> <s> does she agree that by far the easiest cheapest and most effective way of keeping all children in lone-parent families would be to uprate child benefit annually in line with inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords how does that help the children in families which are not receiving income support <e>", "<cs> but my lords they would still get the child benefit <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware of the circular dated th january from the department of social security which states <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble duke for giving way <e> <s> i should make it clear that the parents who were present yesterday were not seeking a cure for their condition but were supporting research to ensure that handicapped embryos would not be implanted <e> <s> that was the point of the lobby <e>", "<cs> i am extremely grateful to the minister for her reply <e> <s> she is absolutely correct <e> <s> i was anxious to underline the severe and very real responsibilties that we are placing on the members of the licensing authority in deciding on the lines of research that they will license <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to the minister for her reply <e> <s> however it did not go as far as we hoped <e> <s> incidentally we also heard the word prioritising in the human fertilisation and embryology bill and we did not like it then either <e>", "<cs> my lords we are pleased to support the amendment from this side of the house <e> <s> it has been explained with great clarity by the noble lord lord stanley of alderley <e> <s> i should like to refer again to the point that he made which was mentioned in the letter sent to him by the minister and to add my surprise at the suggestion that the fear of having to pay out large amounts of compensation would be likely to deter ministers from taking swift action the result of which would inevitably be to put consumers at greater risk <e> <s> surely we are not to believe that the fear of compensation would mean that the ministry would not act with all the speed and expedition that one would expect in a matter of food safety <e> <s> the house is entitled to ask the minister to explain what was meant by the wording <e>", "<cs> my lords we are very grateful to the minister for the way in which he introduced these motions and i congratulate him on the lucidity with which he dealt with these very complicated matters <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i should like to know whether he agrees with the point that i put forward <e> <s> employees are covered by occupational sick pay schemes <e> <s> if those schemes are funded through the insurance system is it not a fact that if they have to pay out more the premiums will increase <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will permit me to intervene it was the brutish insurance association which suggested that <e>", "<cs> my lords i pose a question either to the minister or to the noble lord lord tordoff <e> <s> is the blood species specific <e> <s> the noble lord referred to animal blood <e> <s> it is extremely important to know the answer <e> <s> one assumes that it is the blood of cattle which is used to reconstruct the steak <e> <s> in view of all the scares that are around at the moment it is important to know whether the blood is species specific <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my words of thanks to those of the noble lord lord tordoff as my name was also to the amendment tabled in committee and i too spoke to the amendment <e> <s> we are extremely grateful that the noble baroness listened to us and has returned with the right amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> she has produced an amendment which entirely meets the point which i raised in committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for this amendment which picks up a point that was raised by a number of noble lords in committee as to the consultation procedure before the codes of practice are issued <e> <s> the government have now accepted the case that codes for the guidance of food authorities which will be crucial to the success of the legislation should be discussed with the organisations concerned beforehand <e> <s> it would be helpful if the minister could spell out a commitment to consult the local authority associations specifically because these will be the people most closely involved <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble baroness for explaining the amendment <e> <s> i recognise the difficulty the minister has had with the clause and subsection <e> <s> there is still a degree of imprecision in the wording <e> <s> i presume that this will be taken care of in the regulations <e> <s> we shall look at those very carefully when they come before us <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the minister both for explaining the regulations and for the welcome announcement of an increase of per cent <e> <s> in money terms in the hlcas for ewes on the higher hills <e> <s> as the noble earl said the income of these farmers has been quite severely depressed in recent years <e> <s> they face very hard farming conditions <e> <s> there will be a review in autumn and the noble earl can be assured that we shall all be watching it very carefully to ensure that the full needs of the farmers in the lfas will be met by the increase next year <e>", "<cs> my lords surely she is going to be a rehabilitation officer for the blind <e>", "<cs> my lords it is one of the nicer courtesies of this house that we thank noble lords for bringing forward a subject for debate <e> <s> i am sure that the house will be particularly grateful this evening to the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale for giving us the chance to discuss this very important topic which i believe has not been discussed for some considerable time in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with the noble lord <e> <s> however even if you can understand the actors voice it is not much help if you are on the wrong train to be told the destination after you have left the station of embarkation <e> <s> surely the annoucement should be made before the train leaves the station <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is right indeed that was the point i was just about to make <e> <s> let us take a simple example of what can be done to assist the disabled <e> <s> i am told that on the new york underground the announcement is made as the train enters the station that the door will be on the left of the direction in which the train is travelling <e> <s> because the announcement is extremely clear a person with a visual handicap or someone with a hearing handicap will know as the train comes into the station which side to find the door <e> <s> i think that that is extremely important <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e>", "<cs> the noble lord referred to the views of roman catholics <e> <s> does he accept that a number of roman catholics are opposed to abortion on moral grounds and i am one of them but that i would in no way attempt to impose my views on the rest of society <e> <s> does the noble lord also accept that i personally found it deeply offensive when the views of roman catholics on this issue were related to the dreadful events we have seen in romania <e> <s> i hope that on reflection the noble lord will withdraw the analogy that he appeared to make <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that essential needs payments which were running at million a year in were cut under the social fund to only million last year <e> <s> in that respect it is hard to see how the social fund officers were supposed to exercise the flexibility and discretion that the government required when the total budget for essential needs had been cut by per cent <e> <s> and the guidance from the department was illegal <e> <s> will the minister inform social fund officers that they cannot now withhold payments for essential needs on the grounds that their budget is exhausted or is likely to be exhausted <e> <s> will he also confirm that the government are prepared to pay the compensation to all those who were wrongfully denied help as a result of the illegal guidance from the department <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to all those who have spoken in the debate <e> <s> the debate has been in the best traditions of your lordships house <e> <s> it has dealt with a central problem of social policy sincerely held differences of view have been expressed cogently and there has been constructive criticism <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall have to wait and see <e> <s> the policies are clearly stated in the labour party policy and review document which is available to all <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the next labour government will require that money purchase and pension schemes will only be allowed to contract out of serps if they can guarantee a comparable minimum pension <e> <s> will the government now introduce a similar requirement <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister referred to the recent announcement by the government <e> <s> is he aware that the scheme which did no more than the government required by way of uprating would cut the real value of pensions dramatically <e> <s> a pension preserved for years would today be worth less than per cent <e> <s> of its original value under the governments new proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords will the gainers include the pensioners in scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the minister for the clear way in which he has explained the regulations <e> <s> of course we welcome the uprating which is broadly in line with inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for the clear way in which he explained the order and we welcome it <e> <s> the order tidies up the rules and extends the number of bodies in which continuous local government service can be achieved <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that as one of the longer-term implications of an ageing population a recent independent report has calculated that there will be a need for an extra places in residential and nursing homes in england alone by the year <e> <s> is he further aware that less than per cent <e> <s> of elderly people will have sufficient income to pay for that care without public support <e> <s> in the light of those figures does the minister not agree that it is extraordinary that the national health service and community care bill which we shall be discussing later today includes deliberate financial disincentives for placing old people in local authority homes and deliberate financial incentives for placing them in the private sector <e>", "<cs> my lords a number of noble lords have said that we are considering two bills <e> <s> i propose to concentrate on that part of the bill concerned with community care <e> <s> i am aware of the lateness of the hour but i also wish to comment briefly on some of the points raised in the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister will remember that when the scheme for compensation was first introduced the government were pressed extremely hard to pay compensation at per cent <e> <s> of the market value <e> <s> can she say what was the saving to public funds regarding paying compensation at the rate of per cent <e> <s> further can she say what the increase has been in the number of reported cases since the compensation rate has been increased to per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord spell out to the house exactly how the independent living fund is supposed to limit the scope of its awards <e> <s> can he say which groups of severely disabled people will lose out as a result of this decision <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that the amount that the government are making available is exactly half the amount that the trustees asked for in order for the fund to be able to continue <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> is she aware that the association of directors of social services has reported that one-third of local authorities and social service departments have had to implement service reductions and also abandon some new developments in community care as a result of the poll tax <e> <s> i am referring to authorities which have not been charge-capped <e> <s> the authorities which have been charge-capped now face the prospect of failing in their statutory duties to provide community care <e> <s> how do the government suggest that these authorities resolve that problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely surprised by the answer that the minister has just given <e> <s> does she agree with the calculation that has been made that charge capping will result in a reduction of million in the social services expenditure of charge-capped authorities <e> <s> that sum is equivalent to the cost of home helps and places for the elderly in residential homes <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the minister for his lucid exposition of what he correctly said is not a big bill <e> <s> but it is a very important bill even though we are discussing it at what i can only describe as the connoisseurs hour of am on friday <e> <s> as the minister said we are used to having a social security bill every session and like all such previous bills from this government it contains a number of measures which are welcome and a number which we regard as a step backwards but the bill also omits a whole range of important provisions which i shall mention <e>", "<cs> it was repeated time and again as my noble friend says <e> <s> the increase for the poorest group was in fact per cent <e> <s> against an average increase of per cent <e> <s> those figures show that the poor have become relatively poorer as many of us have been arguing for some time <e> <s> the income divide between the top per cent <e> <s> and the bottom per cent <e> <s> of men in work is now wider than it was years ago <e> <s> the relative pay of the lower paid is now the lowest on record <e> <s> seventeen per cent <e> <s> of the population is receiving income support which is a per cent <e> <s> increase since <e> <s> there has been an increase in poverty and homelessness a reduction in the real value of social security benefits a widening of the gap between the rich and the poor and the creation of the so-called underclass <e> <s> it is sad to say that while in the traditions of this house we shall support the second reading of the bill it does nothing to deal with the situation that i have described <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister said that the imputed return for a couple with savings of is per cent <e> <s> if one deducts per cent <e> <s> for inflation that gives a real rate of return of per cent <e> <s> the governments own requirement for the real rate of return on public investment is per cent <e> <s> therefore why are people on benefit expected to achieve a real rate of return on their savings of - per cent <e> <s> which is greater than the governments own target <e>", "<cs> there is support on all sides of the committee for the spirit of this amendment <e> <s> we have touched on a very important aspect of the bill <e> <s> as i said on moving the amendment it overlaps to -some extent with part iii of the bill but we thought it important to consider it now when discussing functions <e>", "<cs> yes and i mentioned the internal market <e>", "<cs> i shall withdraw the amendment but i found the answer rather disappointing <e> <s> it seems that the accommodation is to be left to the workings of the internal market <e> <s> visiting costs it seems are to be left to a combination of the social fund and charity <e> <s> it is a little disappointing <e> <s> we all agree on the importance of this matter <e> <s> we are not very happy with the way in which the government propose to deal with it <e> <s> however at this stage i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> from these benches we are very pleased indeed to support the amendment <e> <s> it intends that earmarked or ring-fenced central funding should provide some specific estimate within the standard spending assessment for community care as the noble lord has said to allow for parliamentary scrutiny and also to enable a comparison of resources with demographic and community needs <e>", "<cs> it is clearly understood that no one is asking central government to fund the community care budget per cent <e> <s> the amount that is allocated for that budget should be protected <e> <s> however local authorities are perfectly free to add to that if they wish to do so <e>", "<cs> it is absolutely analogous <e>", "<cs> we have had a good debate on this first amendment <e> <s> before the noble lord lord allen decides what to do i wish to respond to a few of the points that have been made <e>", "<cs> all the organisations which represent local authorities have asked for ring fencing <e> <s> we have been inundated with briefing which requests and sets out the arguments for ring fencing <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for that reply <e> <s> however i think she is overlooking the fact that the amendments are important as we are now in the whole new world of ring-fenced funds <e> <s> the noble lord lord jenkin referred to the need for a measured pace <e> <s> he is absolutely right <e> <s> the amendments are intended to achieve a timetable of implementation which proceeds at a pace with which the secretary of state is satisfied <e> <s> the timetable for implementation must satisfy the secretary of state alongside the protection of the sums allocated <e>", "<cs> i am very glad to support the previous speakers from these benches <e> <s> this is a very sensitive and important matter <e> <s> the noble lord lord mancroft speaks with great experience on the subject <e> <s> as the noble lord lord winstanley said he has drawn the attention of the committee to what could be a very serious problem <e>", "<cs> i am extremely grateful to the minister <e> <s> i do not wish to be pedantic but he said that he hopes to come back with another suggestion <e> <s> i hope that he will return at the next stage of the bill with some proposals <e>", "<cs> i am extremely grateful to the minister <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am extremely grateful to the minister <e> <s> i will read with care what he said because i wish to be absolutely sure that the clause covers the people brought to our attention who through drugs or whatever are in these stages of rehabilitation <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i can deal with that point immediately <e> <s> this was a report prepared by the director of social services in tayside <e> <s> the extract that i have does not mention the proportion of use for which the noble baroness asked <e> <s> if the government proposals are accepted the ludicrous result will be that tayside will receive such a large subsidy to put its clients into private care that it will be cheaper for tayside to put them into the more expensive sector <e>", "<cs> i am extremely grateful to the minister although i felt that we would not agree <e> <s> i shall withdraw the amendment at this stage of the bill <e> <s> however i shall give the minister an example <e> <s> perhaps he will place the reply where all members of the committee can see it <e> <s> i have referred to the example where the cost of accommodation is a week <e> <s> in the private or voluntary sector with the various allowances and benefits the income available is a week <e> <s> the local authority therefore has to meet the difference of <e> <s> if the client is at income support level in a local authority home the various allowances and benefits available add up to <e> <s> the local authority has to meet the difference of compared with in the private voluntary sector <e> <s> the extra cost to a local authority of placing a client in one of its own homes on the assumptions stated is therefore a week or in excess of a year <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord allow me to intervene <e> <s> can he answer the question which i put to him and tell the committee when the information which the secretary of state proposes to collect in order to make those

the next stage of the <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale who moved the amendment with his usual lucidity and clarity <e> <s> it is worth re minding ourselves again of the figures which he gave the committee and which the government have produced over the past year <e> <s> when we discussed the matter in committee last year the government gave no figures of their own to compare with the lower figure of people and the higher figure of people which those of us who supported the amendment had quoted on the basis of the mencap research <e> <s> only three weeks later at report stage the government produced the figure of people <e> <s> we said at the time that we were sure that the government had it wrong because the opcs survey did not allow a calculation of the number of people who would be caught by the definition in the amendment <e> <s> as the noble lord said about a week later the figure of had suddenly grown to <e> <s> by the time the noble lord lord henley responded to my starred question in october it had grown to but by december it had fallen in correspondence to <e>", "<cs> that figure was in a letter from the department to mencap <e> <s> the last figure that the noble lord gave was <e>", "<cs> the minister mentioned extension of the mobility allowance which we welcome <e> <s> perhaps he will tell the committee or write to me and put <e>", "<cs> i am asking about the number of <e> <s> there will for example be some of them who are over <e> <s> what is the number of the who are likely to benefit from the extension of the mobility allowance <e> <s> it is not a figure i have seen anywhere <e> <s> we should find it helpful to be told <e>", "<cs> on these benches we are pleased to support the amendment <e> <s> it is intended to increase the rate of severe disablement allowance to the rate of the invalidity benefit <e> <s> a severe disablement allowance sda is a basic non-contributory income replacement benefit for people of working age who are incapable of work and who have not paid national insurance contributions which would entitle them to the equivalent of contributory incapacity benefit namely invalidity benefit <e> <s> sda is paid only at per cent <e> <s> of the basic rate of invalidity benefit because the government consider that people who have not made any or the correct number and type of national insurance contributions should receive less than those who have paid at the full rate <e>", "<cs> the committee will understand my reasons for tabling this amendment as it is very complicated <e> <s> perhaps the minister can tell the committee whether when the consideration is complete and i shall not attempt to press her on when the changes can be enacted through regulations or whether primary legislation will be needed <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the arguments for these amendments have been put so well that there is very little more to say <e> <s> however one point should be emphasised <e> <s> deafness is a particularly disabling handicap not only in obtaining vacation employment the problems we have heard about in regard to the telephone communications within work and so on but also with the speech defect that of ten accompanies total deafness <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness decides what to do about this amendment and as my name is attached to it i say that the governments answer has been very unsatisfactory <e> <s> a number of very strong points have been made <e> <s> very few people are involved in this matter <e> <s> we have pointed out the exceptionally disabling nature of deafness compared with other handicaps <e> <s> none of these points has been met <e> <s> i hope that the noble baroness will take these factors into account before deciding what to do about the amendment <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl decides what to do with the amendment the minister and the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter made some play with the weakness of the phrase <e>", "<cs> under the national health service bill it will also be different because the bill says adequate for any person <e> <s> every person will have different requirements <e>", "<cs> i am extremely grateful to the minister <e> <s> the assurances that she has given are welcome <e> <s> i shall obviously need to read what she has said with care but i believe she has met the points we have been trying to make <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i think that an amendment of this extremely important nature should have been tabled before last friday <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> is tabled in my name and that of the noble earl lord russell on the marshalled list <e> <s> i think that the ministers grouping should commence with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> this may be a mistake on the grouping list <e>", "<cs> i think perhaps that i should formally withdraw the amendment tabled in my name from this particular grouping <e> <s> in that way the minister will be able to speak to the government amendments <e>", "<cs> on these benches we think that this is a very sensible amendment <e> <s> it is a disregard which would provide a strong incentive for the payment of child maintenance <e> <s> we believe that the argument put forward by the noble earl is a good one <e> <s> in our view there is a longer-term benefit in encouraging the lone parent to claim maintenance <e> <s> there may come a time when the lone parent may be able to seek employment <e> <s> the mere fact of having a maintenance order may make the difference between whether the lone parent can afford to take up that employment or finds that the family would be poorer after paying the child care costs than if they stayed on benefit <e> <s> the disregard would help to overcome that situation <e>", "<cs> i shall be extremely interested to hear the ministers reply <e> <s> at first sight it appears that the amendment is concerned to look after companies and their administrative cost at the expense of lone parents <e> <s> perhaps i have misunderstood the noble lords explanation <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for that explanation <e> <s> i shall withdraw what i said and say instead that the amendment looks after the companys industrial relations at the expense of lone parents <e> <s> surely if the liable person does not consent to the making of such an order the lone parent will suffer <e> <s> the government will have to make that balance of judgment <e> <s> i shall be interested to hear the ministers response <e>", "<cs> i am obviously disappointed by the ministers reply <e> <s> he referred to the measured steps that the government are taking <e> <s> some people feel that the steps are not just measured they are funereal <e>", "<cs> the noble earl has described the situation extremely well and has drawn attention to the harrowing cases that we all know about which lie at the root of the problem <e> <s> this amendment is designed to try at least to reduce the number of those cases <e> <s> i hope that the government will feel able to accept it <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl decides what to do with the amendment perhaps i may refer to an answer given by the minister which i found extremely puzzling <e> <s> the noble earl referred to a survey conducted by the department of the <e>", "<cs> i am pleased to support this amendment which is also in my name <e> <s> the noble baroness referred to the survey which has only been published today <e>", "<cs> as the noble earl has spoken to amendment no <e> <s> and said all that i had intended to say perhaps it would assist the minister if he replied to amendments nos <e> <s> and together <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> he is aware that as regards the second amendment the main purpose is to bring home to the government the urgent need for the housing authorities and associations to plan for the resources that they have to provide after april of next year <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i shall wish to respond to all those points at the end of the debate <e> <s> it would help the committee if the noble lord could say how many war pensions have been awarded since in <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may intervene <e> <s> if the husband died of a cancer other than leukaemia or myeloma and had been involved in the nuclear test programme since the evidence is before the war pensions board at the moment the widow would not be able to prove this <e> <s> she would have no reasonable chance of proving that those cancers were associated because the department relies entirely on the nrpb report to deal only with leukaemia and myeloma <e> <s> is that correct <e>", "<cs> i wish to express my gratitude and the gratitude of those outside the chamber who are most intimately concerned with this matter that is the survivors from the test programme for the debate <e> <s> shall deal with a few of the points that were raised <e> <s> i was glad to hear the remarks of the noble lord lord walton of detchant who is a world expert in this matter <e> <s> the noble lord referred to the different opinions among experts on this subject <e> <s> he emphasised the fact that although the nrpb was not able to prove that an association with other cancers existed it could not prove that such an association did not exist <e>", "<cs> i was very glad from these benches to add my name to this amendment <e> <s> as the noble earl said we have been over this ground before <e> <s> however there is no harm in doing that because it is very important <e> <s> we hope that eventually the government will accept the strength of our arguments <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may deal with the point about numbers raised by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> it was a fair question <e> <s> the social security statistics for reveal that the last time a count was made on st may of to year-old men and women were receiving income support so the figure is about <e> <s> a large proportion of those people would now be either on a youth training scheme or living at home <e> <s> having got the number who would now be eligible under the amendment one would guess that the figure would be well under half of the perhaps or which at a year would be in the order cf million or million <e> <s> that is the best that i can do <e> <s> i hope that the minister perhaps has a more accurate answer <e>", "<cs> on the point of costs the noble baroness mentioned the figure of million taking into account all elements <e> <s> does she have a breakdown of the various parts of the amendment because obviously it is those in full-time study who are adding to the costs <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for the figures she gave <e> <s> i certainly do not want to enter into argument but i find her remarks difficult to follow <e> <s> she said that the cost of applying the scheme to and year-olds would be million <e> <s> as i pointed out the last time the figures were collected in may there were around young people in receipt of income support at around per year <e> <s> that brings the figure to million <e> <s> if the figure of million is correct that means that per cent <e> <s> of that have not been found new places on the yts scheme <e> <s> i find that very hard to follow <e>", "<cs> my name also is attached to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> in my view it would be better to discuss both amendments at a later stage than speak to them now <e> <s> i also suggest to the minister that perhaps it was a little unwise of him to invite members on this side of the committee to be present later this evening <e>", "<cs> i was pleased to add my name to the amendment on behalf of these benches <e> <s> i was surprised to hear the noble lord lord jenkin as a former secretary of state for social services express some pride in the social fund <e> <s> i believe the social fund is almost the worst aspect of the much vaunted social security reforms in the act <e> <s> we should remind ourselves that the purpose of this amendment is to remove the total ban imposed by the secretary of state on social fund payments either through grants or loans for deposits for accommodation <e> <s> while a payment for rent in advance can be made but only in the form of a loan the directions of the secretary of state prohibit any kind of payment even a crisis loan for a deposit <e> <s> this amendment would prevent the secretary of state from issuing any direction which would ban payments for deposits <e> <s> it would still be open to him to issue guidance on this subject which social fund officers would have to take into account <e> <s> however that guidance would not be binding on them <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl decides what to do with the amendment perhaps the minister will comment on the figures which i quoted regarding the refusal of crisis loans for rent in advance <e> <s> rent in advance is a very common requirement <e> <s> can the minister say whether it is the policy of the department that crisis loans should not be used for rent in advance <e> <s> experience at the office in paddington which i mentioned which deals with a great many homeless people has shown that the vast majority of applications for loans for rent in advance were turned down <e>", "<cs> i am neither surprised nor disappointed to hear the answer of the minister <e> <s> it is exaclly what i expected <e> <s> we heard once again the extraordinary phrase that the fund will operate flexibly but within a strict financial framework <e> <s> that sounds like bank managers i know <e> <s> if one has to keep to a financial budget which has a cash limit in a demand-led situation and that demand results from the operation of many other aspects of the act there is only one answer <e> <s> any economist will tell you that the answer is rationing <e> <s> that is exactly what is happening to the social fund it is being rationed <e> <s> it is described as being a responsible use of money <e> <s> this chamber has heard of many examples of what happens in practice in relation to the social fund <e>", "<cs> i am pleased to support this amendment from these benches <e> <s> my name was supposed to be attached to the amendment but somehow it did not reach the marshalled list <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> that was the explanation which i expected <e> <s> as the noble baroness said dependency must cease somewhere and this seems to be the result of a tidying up more than anything else <e> <s> in the nature of things the number of hardship cases would be less if the amendment were accepted <e> <s> i am rather doubtful in view of the great pressure on financial resources of local education authorities whether they will be able to help in the way suggested <e> <s> i shall read with care what the minister said and in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may ask the noble lord a question <e> <s> he referred to discretion in the use of the surplus <e> <s> would the trustees have the discretion to award extra increases in pensions payments to certain groups of employees such as senior executives or directors <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord decides what to do with the amendment perhaps i may first <e>", "<cs> the minister referred to the requirement for existing schemes to run down their self-investment <e> <s> am i correct in thinking that when this was first proposed it applied to self-administered schemes that now it has been decided that self-administered pension schemes will not have to act retrospectively so to speak and that the limitation on self-investment will only apply to their investments in future <e> <s> the decision caused considerable anxiety at the time among the self-administered pension schemes <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for that most helpful reply and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i wish to say very briefly that so far as one can see the government appear to be seeking to minimise the effect of rulings by the social security commissioners and appeals to the house of lords acting in its judicial capacity and the european court of justice <e> <s> i am just surprised by the governments lack of ambition in this matter <e>", "<cs> as the minister said this is a wholly welcome amendment <e> <s> can he say whether any <e>", "<cs> i am advised that the amendments are not wholly beneficial <e> <s> at present the pay and conditions of many staff in the health service including nurses are determined within the whitley council framework by an independent pay review body <e> <s> the national health service and community care bill currently allows the nhs trusts to set aside the recommendations of that body <e> <s> it seems that it would be perfectly possible for one of the nhs trusts to terminate all contracts and replace them with new ones and negotiate either individually or collectively with their staff <e> <s> with new contracts trusts would be entirely free to set aside previous arrangements such as clinical grading for nursing staff is that correct <e>", "<cs> from these benches we are pleased to support this important amendment <e> <s> as the noble earl said the reason for the rule is not clear <e> <s> in fact the reasons continually change <e> <s> we have been advised by the national association of citizens advice bureaux which lists a number of harrowing cases of refugee families who have been left without support it would be helpful to the committee if the minister could explain the rationale behind the rule <e>", "<cs> there is not one <e>", "<cs> i shall have to read with care what the noble baroness said <e> <s> however in passing i should like to say that as regards some of the difficulty to which she referred in deciding whether someone was normally resident in a household and the period of their temporary absence i should have thought that people in prison would be the one group in respect of which those questions could be easily answered <e> <s> as i said i shall read with care what was said <e> <s> i reserve the right to return to the matter on report <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness lady david has expressed the view of these benches extremely well <e> <s> however during discussion of the bill there have been examples of the governments hard-heartedness <e> <s> on this amendment they are displaying that to a degree <e> <s> on a practical point i understand that morning sickness occurs in the first three months of pregnancy with all the problems associated with it <e> <s> from the governments replies on these matters they seem at times to be detached from reality <e> <s> the minister asked for evidence <e> <s> we have much evidence from the national association of citizens advice bureaux of individual and harrowing cases of problems which this amendment seeks to solve <e> <s> has the minister read of the cases that have been reported by the nacab <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that cutting the link between the increases in pensions and the increases in average earnings which was referred to by my noble friend lord stallard has saved the exchequer billion since <e> <s> that is the money which would have gone to pensioners <e> <s> when the government take credit for the reduction in the national debt in recent years should they not be thanking the pensioners who contributed substantially to that reduction <e>", "<cs> my lords if the minister intends to quote the figures for the occupational pensions and the savings which contribute to pensioners incomes is he aware that the governments own figures show that these contribute only a small amount to the incomes of the poorest pensioners that one fifth of pensioners are totally reliant upon benefits and that per cent are relying upon state benefits for per cent of their income <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that disappointing but revealing answer <e> <s> we felt that it was important that there should be a formal procedure built into the bill <e> <s> we hope that the governments expectations regarding the role of community health councils are fulfilled <e> <s> the answer was disappointing but at this hour i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i may seek clarification of the noble baroness <e> <s> does she agree with the sentence that i read from the <e>", "<cs> my lords the contribution would be per cent <e> <s> of all incomes over per week <e> <s> there is no charge to public funds <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to all noble lords who have taken part in what has been a good and perhaps i may say fairly predictable debate <e> <s> it has shown how many noble lords are prepared to ignore the standing orders of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches support the amendment <e> <s> we discussed the matter in committee as the minister will remember <e> <s> all noble lords who have spoken to the amendment have put the case extremely well and i am sure that the minister will have listened with particular care to the remarks made by my noble friend lord rea <e>", "<cs> my lords i had hoped that the minister would be able to tell us when the long promised review would be complete <e> <s> after all it is not that technical and i should have thought it was comparately straightforward <e> <s> i have heard what the minister has said and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously that was a very disappointing answer <e> <s> i said when i moved the amendment that very little cost is involved <e> <s> every time we try to deal with the situation the argument seems to founder on the assumption which is almost an obsession with the government that young people belong at home with a stable job on a training place are never estranged or subject to abuse or violence and live in a loving environment <e> <s> life for many young people is not like that <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not realise that i was tempting the noble baroness to go further or too far <e>", "<cs> my lords when we were discussing last years social security legislation and the subject of disability benefits i said to the then minister the noble lord lord skelmersdale that it would save the time of the house if he stood up said opcs survey and then sat down <e> <s> in discussing this subject today if the noble lord were to stand up say a perverse incentive and sit down it would be equally time-saving <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a highly complicated matter <e> <s> one is tempted to observe that the ministers reply would perhaps be easier to understand in the original sanskrit <e>", "<cs> my lords when we discussed the first amendment today dealing with child benefit noble lords opposite waxed long and eloquent about the sacrosanct nature of the national insurance fund and the relationship of contributions to benefits <e> <s> those noble lords will be able to deal with the points that my noble friend has made about the obvious lack of relationship between contributions and unemployment benefits to students <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not intend to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> the governments answer was disgraceful <e> <s> to deal with the terminology <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter said that the amendment was unnecessary <e> <s> would that it were so <e> <s> the minister referred to the good faith of the government <e> <s> i have to disappoint him <e> <s> the government are not trusted by the disability organisations working in this field <e> <s> we had the opcs survey <e> <s> the message was that we should wait for opcs <e> <s> we then had the white paper without any consultation with disability organisations working in the field and we had the bill within days of the white paper <e> <s> there was the promise of an independent review then an internal review then no consultation at all the white paper and then the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems to me that the governments attitude is like the attitude towards the housemaids baby they do not mind dealing with the problem so long as it is a small one <e> <s> i understand the point about the cost <e> <s> we understand why that is the reason the government will not extend the provision to widowers <e> <s> i am grateful to the minister for her reply <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl has explained the background to the amendment so well that there is little to add <e> <s> it is true that there needs to be an incentive in this case that one is better off having the maintenance order than not having it <e> <s> we believe that a disregard will also be an incentive for the father to pay if he knows that his children will thereby be better off <e> <s> there is also the longer term benefit of encouraging a lone parent to claim maintenance <e> <s> there will come a time when the lone parent may be able to seek employment <e> <s> having a maintenance order with this disregard may make all the difference as to whether the lone parent can afford to take that job or find that the family is poorer than if it stayed on benefit having paid the child care costs <e>", "<cs> my lords a minor point has been made to us and in answer perhaps the noble baroness will write to me <e> <s> it has been pointed out that the effect of the amendment could produce some slightly odd results if the liable parent having received a refund from the dss is then required to pay the money to the dependent parent as a result of a variation of the court order <e> <s> no doubt the noble baroness will wish to read <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a most interesting debate <e> <s> we keep bringing this problem to the attention of the government but still they refuse either to acknowledge it or to deal with it <e> <s> the information that they want is available <e> <s> many of the voluntary bodies have the information now <e> <s> if the noble baroness lady ryder of warsaw were here she could certainly tell the government about the shortfall experienced by residents of the cheshire homes <e>", "<cs> my lords i was glad to add my name to the amendment and to support it <e> <s> there is little more to say because it was moved by the noble lord lord allen with his usual lucidity and clarity <e> <s> clarification of the definitions is crucially important <e> <s> the government are replying on previous legislation but we believe that the definitions should be spelt out clearly in the bill because it must be apparent who will receive community care <e> <s> the minister promised to think about the matter and come back on report <e> <s> the government have not brought forward amendments and therefore we hope that they will be able to explain their thinking <e>", "<cs> my lords i put a specific question to the minister and i should be grateful if she could answer it because upon the answer depends the way in which we regard the amendment <e> <s> i quoted from turning point which stated <e>", "<cs> my lords i was pleased to add my name to the amendment tabled by the noble lord lord mancroft and i spoke in committee in his support <e> <s> the importance of the matter is that we all understand that speed is essential in certain cases <e> <s> we hope that the government have gone far enough but we shall decide what to do with our amendment when we hear the ministers answer <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i point out that there is something odd with <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to the minister <e> <s> the amendment is the result of an undertaking that the government gave at committee stage to deal with the problem <e> <s> we feel that the amendments do so <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble baroness said we have been over this ground a number of times <e> <s> we have been unable to convince the government <e> <s> however we intend to keep on trying <e>", "<cs> my lords on a point of information if it had been improper i presume that the amendment would not have been accepted <e>", "<cs> my lords on a point of information we should make clear that the amendment is wholly different from the one we discussed previously <e> <s> it is no good the minister saying pah <e> <s> the amendment simply asks that local authorities be able to assist those over pension age <e> <s> it is wholly different in terms and in spirit from that which was debated and divided on previously <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i may say that i raised this matter with the hansard office <e> <s> it is correct in the weekly edition of <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to the minister for that reply <e> <s> as he will know the purpose of putting down the amendment was to get on record the remarks he has just made <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> i shall read carefully what he has said because it is a complicated point <e> <s> his reply was disappointing <e> <s> i do not believe that the government have taken sufficient account of the way in which some local authorities ignore circular / on attendance allowance <e> <s> in this amendment we have touched on a fundamental difference between the policy of the noble lords party and the policy of my party in the treatment of disability <e> <s> it is in our policy that there should be a comprehensive disability income and a disability cost allowance <e> <s> it is the simple argument that irrespective of income and whether or not he is rich or poor a disabled person should have the extra cost met first <e> <s> he would then be on a level playing field to use a phrase with which we are all familiar with everyone else <e> <s> the noble lord summed up the issue very well those who can pay should pay even if they are disabled <e> <s> we do not agree with that <e> <s> but at this stage i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords we hoped when we put down the amendment that it would stiffen the governments resolution in this matter and that they might have been able to tell us what the consultation process would produce <e> <s> it is obvious that we are not going to learn that <e> <s> it is disappointing but there is another stage of the bill <e> <s> we had hoped that by putting down the amendment we would find out how far the consultation had progressed and whether we would need to put down an amendment at third reading <e> <s> at this stage of the bill i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i may clarify one point <e> <s> the noble baroness referred to the guidance <e> <s> does she have any idea when the guidance will be available even in draft <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not friday the th is it <e> <s> it is extraordinary what an amount of guidance is being put out the day after we discuss these amendments <e> <s> i am sure that it is perfectly coincidental and happens completely by accident <e> <s> when i hear ministers say that they place great reliance on the assessment for community care local authorities responsibilities the smooth transition liaison and co-ordination i am tempted to say although it would be extremely rude that the government are passing the buck to local authorities <e> <s> i shall not say it <e>", "<cs> my lords we supported from these benches the amendment which the committee accepted at the previous stage of the bill <e> <s> as the noble lord lord seebohm has said it is obvious that all authorities must be treated in the same way <e> <s> if the government intend to reject the amendment i ask them how on earth the system will work if where housing needs are concerned all authorities are not treated in the same way as regards community care <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord ennals moved the amendment and i wish to bring to your lordships attention a case which illustrates extremely well the need for it <e> <s> in the town where i live devizes in wiltshire there is a geriatric hospital and a district hospital <e> <s> the intention was to close the geriatric hospital and to rebuild the district hospital with geriatric beds <e> <s> because of the slump in the property market they are not able to sell the site of the geriatric hospital in order to raise the money for the district hospital so the whole proposal has been deferred <e>", "<cs> my lords are amendments nos <e> <s> and a also included in this group <e>", "<cs> my lords as my name is attached to amendment no <e> <s> b perhaps i may say a few words on this point <e> <s> we are grateful to the government for making an attempt to meet our concerns and to the minister for the useful meeting that we had the other day in order to discuss this matter <e> <s> a problem that the government should address which was touched on by the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale is the distinction between organisations of and organisations for the disabled <e> <s> let me give a simple example <e> <s> the national federation of the blind is an organisation of the blind <e> <s> the royal national institute for the blind is an organisation for the blind <e>", "<cs> my lords that is the answer which we expected from the government <e> <s> in passing it is a fact that per cent <e> <s> of the homeless are from outside the metropolitan areas <e> <s> a substantial number are in rural areas <e> <s> there is a definition of rural area which we discussed during the passage of the housing bill when we were discussing the definition of rural housing <e> <s> therefore there is a definition on the statute book <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down do not the government accept that it <e>", "<cs> my lords i have added my name to the amendment <e> <s> the noble lords who have already spoken have explained the argument extremely well but it is worth emphasising that the amendment does not propose an unrestricted right to assessment on request <e> <s> it seems to express the governments own concern but within the context of what we feel is a clearer procedure <e> <s> it ensures that users will receive a fast response to their requests <e> <s> it also makes entirely clear the nature of the preliminary inquiries which would lead to assessment and it makes clear to the applicants the grounds on which they may be refused an assessment <e> <s> in other contexts the government have always seen the consumer as king <e> <s> the amendment reflects that approach <e>", "<cs> my lords we are pleased from these benches to support this amendment <e> <s> in committee we discussed an amendment that dealt with the needs of carers which was not accepted <e> <s> these amendments deal with paying proper attention to the views of the person being assessed and also the views of the carer <e> <s> after all the carer is likely to know much better than anyone else what those needs are <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a sensible amendment <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> will deal with cross-boundary funding <e> <s> the amendment before us deals with cross-boundary assessment <e> <s> it is important that the government should explain how the problems which the noble lord has described so well will be dealt with <e> <s> it is not entirely clear when one reads the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we can all agree that the availability of a right of appeal if a person is dissatisfied with his assessment is essential <e> <s> however the house would be interested to know how the government propose that the problem should be dealt with <e> <s> clearly as the community care packages start to come into operation there will be people who are dissatisfied with the assessment they have been given <e> <s> how is it proposed that such people will be able to express their dissatisfaction without a right of appeal being provided for in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am pleased to add my name to the amendment and to express the support of these benches <e> <s> the amendment draws attention to a very important aspect of the whole assessment procedure which has been exceedingly well described by the noble baroness <e> <s> as she said we have been briefed by crossroads who have great anxiety about this matter and other organisations <e> <s> they have drawn attention to a problem in the assessment procedure with which the government must deal <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down perhaps i may ask for two points of information <e> <s> first she referred to the draft guidance referred to last thursday and published last friday <e> <s> is it intended that we should receive a copy of the draft guidance <e> <s> it has been referred to a number of times and it will be helpful to all of us <e>", "<cs> my lords i too was pleased to add my name to the amendment and i support it from these benches <e> <s> we have been round this course before over the past four years <e> <s> the minister will know that there was a meeting last week between the noble baronesses lady hooper lady darcy de knayth lady masham and myself which did not take us much further <e> <s> it is clear that the government are going through the consultation procedure <e> <s> they have sent a letter to local authorities which virtually <e>", "<cs> my lords let us take the example of a schizophrenic referred to by the noble lord lord mottistone <e> <s> let us assume that he is registered with one authority for the community charge but happens to be found in need of help in another authority <e> <s> will it be the duty of the second local authority to provide that help <e>", "<cs> my lords that was the answer i expected and it is extremely disappointing <e> <s> the noble baroness said that she believed that local authorities would be forced to consider the matter <e> <s> how can a local authority be forced to consider a <e>", "<cs> my lords i was very pleased to be able to add my name to the amendment <e> <s> as usual the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale has explained the situation admirably <e> <s> the amendment proposes that people with disabilities should be given a right to advocacy thus enabling any individual regardless of his communication difficulties to have a public voice <e> <s> that is what sections and deal with <e> <s> we can all agree that the right to freedom of individual expression is fundamental <e> <s> most people take it for granted but some people may not be able to exercise the right because of mental sensory or physical disabilities <e> <s> as the noble lord said without the right of representation some disabled people will be unable to have a say in how they live their lives <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord confirm that the letter which was sent to local authorities was dated february or march of this year <e> <s> in any event that is three and half years after the bill was enacted <e>", "<cs> my lords i am in exactly the same position as the noble lord lord mottistone <e> <s> my amendments amendments nos <e> <s> and have now been pre-empted <e> <s> obviously this is a very unsatisfactory situation <e> <s> we have a number of anxieties about the revisions which have been made <e>", "<cs> my lords i have been pleased to add my name to the amendment and to support it from these benches <e> <s> we all know that the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords we seek clarification on this point <e> <s> we tried extremely hard as the minister acknowledged to gain some idea of the time-scale involved so that the local authorities and voluntary organisations will know how to plan their activities <e> <s> can the minister give us any hint as to when these consultations will be completed and their likely outcome <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure whether the ministers remarks amount to an assurance <e> <s> however in the light of his final words i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am moving amendment no <e> <s> and speaking also to amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords as i expected that was a disappointing answer <e> <s> it is clear that the government do not intend to do anything for carers over pension age or for those who are under pension age who are ineligible for ica <e> <s> we hear that the findings of the crossroads report will be kept in view and that the situation will be monitored <e> <s> as the noble earl lord russell said the cost of the provision million must be set against the savings to the community of carers unpaid efforts of about billion <e> <s> we have tried hard to get the government to change their mind <e> <s> the only thing we can do is to ask for the opinion of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that is what is called half a loaf <e> <s> the minister said that the governments best guess at the cost of the measure was million <e> <s> however he then said that the government in monitoring the situation had found that no cases had arisen which could not be solved by the existing rules <e> <s> i found that rather difficult to understand <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to the minister for that explanation <e> <s> i can assure him that the noble baroness lady seear and i will come back at third reading with a suitably drafted amendment <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i was very pleased to support the amendment from these benches when we discussed it at committee stage and i am pleased to support it again today <e> <s> it may help the house if i give a brief idea of the size of the problem in terms of individual payments <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that reply <e> <s> as he did in reply to a number of previous amendments he trailed a hope and left us in the air about what will happen <e> <s> when ministers come to the dispatch box and talk about equity and extra costs i can only refer them to the poll tax <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the minister for that reply <e> <s> i was not completely surprised by it <e> <s> he said that local authorities will have complete discretion but i believe i am correct in saying that the extra cost of any award they make will all fall onto the poll tax because it will not be taken into account in the standard spending assessment <e> <s> we all know the problems that will face local authorities next year under pressure from the government to keep the poll tax down <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to the minister for that explanation <e> <s> it is indeed good news <e> <s> presumably there will be an amendment to regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that that reply will gladden the hearts of all those who have been aware of this flaw or anomaly depending on ones <e>", "<cs> my lords i was very pleased to add my name to the amendment <e> <s> i apologise to the house for not being in my place initially when the noble baroness ably moved the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down let us suppose that a local authority is required to provide services in an area where that is not now the case <e> <s> if the standard spending assessment is unable to take that into account is not the only way in which the local authority will be able to provide the service by an increase in the poll tax <e>", "<cs> my lords i am pleased to support the amendment from these benches <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very pleased to support the amendment from these benches <e> <s> indeed i had intended to add my name to it <e> <s> as the noble baroness said when she moved the amendment we discussed similar amendments at both committee and report stages <e> <s> the government while recognising that a very real problem exists felt unable to accept them <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to the minister <e> <s> that was exactly the assurance we required and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lord until this morning i believed that the government were going to accept the amendment <e> <s> the minister has produced a curious argument <e> <s> the only thing that i can do is to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> we have drawn attention to the problem <e> <s> i was hoping that the minister would say that they would take the amendment to another place <e> <s> the government still have the chance to do that and to amend the provision in line with the agreement that i thought there was on it <e> <s> however i have listened to what the minister said <e> <s> i thank her for the explanation and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am pleased to support the amendment from these benches <e> <s> we have been <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say a few words about the community care aspects of the bill <e> <s> those aspects have been my responsibility on this side of the house <e> <s> we welcome the governments agreement to some of the points that have been put to them the consultation with the housing agencies voluntary organisations and carers groups <e> <s> we welcome the institution of the complaints procedure and of procedures to deal with emergency situations <e> <s> we welcome the agreement by the house to the ring fencing of community care funding the implementation of community care on the basis of adequate resources and the provision by the government of help with start-up costs <e> <s> we welcome the acceptance by the house of the requirement for the disclosure of criminal convictions of proprietors of residential homes <e> <s> we cannot believe that the government will reject that position in another place particularly not on the grounds that the association of chief police officers does not like the extra work <e> <s> we welcome the decision of the house that there should be a housing dimension in the planning process <e>", "<cs> my lords i am pleased to support this important amendment as indeed i did in committee <e> <s> perhaps the only thing to do is to repeat the remarks that i made then <e> <s> with this clause and without the amendment the government are seeking to overturn the effects of rulings by social security commissioners the court of appeal the house of lords acting in its judicial capacity and the european court of justice <e> <s> as i said in committee i continue to be surprised by the governments lack of ambition in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that reply <e> <s> the amendment was a probing one and was intended to put on the record the assurance that he has now been able to give <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords to deal with the first point made by the minister i meant that one tends to know when people are coming out of prison <e> <s> they do not suddenly appear through the gates so their period of temporary absence is clearly defined <e> <s> i hear what the minister says <e> <s> his reply is no more satisfactory than the one we heard in committee <e> <s> it is clear that the government do not intend to change their minds on the matter <e> <s> i do not intend to divide the house and so i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to support the amendment from these benches <e> <s> we discussed the matter on the bill last year and i well remember taking part in the discussions <e> <s> i did not understand the rationale for the governments answer then and i hope that the minister will be able to give a satisfactory answer this evening to what seems to be an obvious injustice <e>", "<cs> my lords as my name was attached to the original amendment and indeed i spoke to it when it was agreed by your lordships committee perhaps i may be allowed to say a few words <e> <s> the concession on grants to voluntary organisations dealing with drugs and alcohol is very welcome as far as it goes <e> <s> but we have already heard from those active in the field that it does not go very far <e>", "<cs> my lords on a point of information it was a point made by a conservative member of the other place <e> <s> i was merely repeating it <e>", "<cs> my lords as i moved the original amendment in committee and secured the agreement of noble lords i am very disappointed by the response of another place <e> <s> i find the reason very curious that it would unreasonably delay the commencement of part iii of the bill <e> <s> the press has recently been full of a briefing and a counter-briefing on the point that the government intended to slow down the implementation of community care and we generally felt that a clause of this nature would help the government out of their difficulties <e> <s> after all to quote the amendment any responsible secretary of state would surely want to satisfy himself that the resources available to local authorities are adequate <e>", "<cs> my lords this too is an amendment that i moved in committee and to which i secured the agreement of your lordships <e> <s> it is indeed as the minister said linked to the previous amendment on ring fencing <e> <s> i remind the house of the functions which local authorities will now have to undertake without any extra help from the government in terms of funding <e> <s> they have to produce and publish a community care plan and to revise it regularly they have to publish criteria for undertaking individual assessments they have to carry out individual assessments there is the assessment and collection of individual contributions towards the cost of services they must create the monitoring and inspection units they have to set up complaints procedures and they must create the purchasing and budgeting systems and set up systems for case management <e> <s> for all those functions no additional funding is proposed <e>", "<cs> my lords my name is also on the amendment <e> <s> i am glad to add my ungrudging thanks to the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to the minister for those remarks <e> <s> i presume that if the format has gone to the printers it cannot be in draft form <e> <s> i presume that the department has ordered the supply of documents that it requires <e> <s> however i am still grateful to the minister <e> <s> this is a topic that we have discussed all the way through the bill <e> <s> the various clarifications that we have received at each stage of the bill have been helpful <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords there are occasions when ministers come to the dispatch box when we wonder whether they are living in the same world as the rest of us especially when we hear of self-inflicted homelessness and encouraging youngsters to sleep rough <e> <s> that may well be the case in a tiny minority of cases <e> <s> however i am not a lawyer but i am told that hard cases make very bad law <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord mentioned the research when speaking to this and the previous amendment <e> <s> can he tell the house who will be conducting it <e> <s> we remember the promised independent review of disability benefits <e> <s> that was in fact an internal review <e> <s> it turned into a white paper which was produced without any consultation with the voluntary organisations and was succeeded by a bill published three days after the white paper <e>", "<cs> i was pleased to add my name to this amendment <e> <s> as the minister is aware it is a problem that we have discussed at various stages of this bill and indeed of the national health service bill <e> <s> as i have said in the past and will repeat successive governments of all colours have shamelessly exploited carers over the years <e> <s> they save the public purse a great deal of money and this is the sort of amendment the government should be prepared to accept <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the problem to which the minister has referred <e> <s> it is extraordinary that the department misinterpreted the regulations <e> <s> this young man simon crompton suffers from downs syndrome <e> <s> he needs constant care and supervision from his parents who are themselves retired <e> <s> they do not receive any extra help for looking after him <e> <s> it is extraordinary that the department interpreted the regulations in the way that it did <e> <s> this is an obvious case for assistance <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister will not be surprised to learn that i do not agree with all that he has just said <e> <s> indeed to compare this bill with a curates egg would be extremely unfair to curates <e> <s> there are aspects of the bill that obviously we welcome <e> <s> for example the inclusion of a provision for attendance allowance for the terminally ill at a number of stages of the bill we have congratulated the government on fulfilling the obligation they gave in last years debates on the social security bill <e> <s> the house will remember that it agreed to amendments on students and benefits and on the clause concerning the recovery of damages from benefit payments <e> <s> however we could make very little progress on more fundamental issues such as administration of the social fund benefits for and year-olds and the plight of homeless families <e>", "<cs> only ministers my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the whole house wishes to congratulate the noble baroness lady darcy de knayth upon having persuaded this house to agree with her original amendment and bringing about a change of heart by the government <e> <s> since the arguments in favour of extending benefit entitlement to deaf students are and were so strong we cannot understand why the government did not accept them in the first place <e> <s> however this is a welcome concession and we congratulate the government on their change of heart <e>", "<cs> my lords that was not the argument advanced for rejecting the amendment when we debated the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords like my noble friend i am extremely disappointed at the governments decision to reject the amendments <e> <s> we should be clear that the effect of the rejection is to create citizens who irrespective of their level of income will not be eligible for certain benefits but who would have been eligible had they not been students <e>", "<cs> my lords on a point of information when i nodded i thought that the noble lord was about to say that the amendments involved financial privilege <e> <s> we knew that because amendments always do with regard to social security <e> <s> but he actually said somet ling else <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for that reply but it is becoming increasingly clear why the government have so adamantly refused any form of ring-fencing or earmarking of government funds for community care <e> <s> is the minister aware that in this house on th may in another place on th june and again in this house on th june a succession of ministers gave repeated assurances that adequate resources will be made available next april for the proper funding of the full community care plans as set out in the national health service and community care bill <e> <s> the bill received royal assent on th june <e> <s> does the minister agree that it would be a record to renege on such an important commitment within three weeks of making it <e>", "<cs> my lords that is not an answer to the question i put to the minister <e> <s> my question was not about ring-fencing which was a comment i made in passing <e> <s> are the plans to be introduced in full and without delay on st april as we have been told repeatedly in this house and in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords the deputy leader of the house will know that the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter took almost five minutes of the time available and did not ask a single question <e> <s> in one of her answers the minister took over two minutes <e> <s> it was another statement <e> <s> i believe that we should have a few more minutes <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i am very pleased to support this resolution <e> <s> it has been most carefully drafted <e> <s> i can assure the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls that considerable work has been done behind the scenes to ensure that it is within the conventions of this house <e> <s> it has been carefully drafted to ensure that in accepting the motion the house also accepts the regulations which will be taken formally after this debate <e>", "<cs> my lords on access funds if it is left to the individual institutions what is the departmental or parliamentary sanction on an institution if it gets a disbursement badly wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that answer <e> <s> however do the government accept the fundamental principle that visually handicapped people should have access to the printed word on the same basis as sighted people <e> <s> can she confirm or indeed perhaps she will deny it that it is the governments intention to reduce the grant to nil over a period of five years by reducing it in the sum of a year <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the minister will tell her noble and learned friend that the visually handicapped do not wish to depend upon charity <e> <s> in a previous reply she mentioned the efforts made by government departments to have their literature transcribed into braille <e> <s> that is what the departments should be doing <e> <s> is she aware that when her department produced its glossy leaflet on the reforms of the nhs it forgot to transcribe it into braille until it was reminded by the rnib <e> <s> if the rnib is to rely upon sponsorship for general literature which is what the grant covers there is a risk that commercial sponsors will wish to have some say in the literature that is transcribed <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the minister for giving us that long complicated statement <e> <s> there are certain points in the statement which we obviously welcome but there are some that need further probing <e> <s> it would help if the minister could say how many if any benefits have been increased by less than the per cent <e> <s> inflation figure which has been used for the statutory up-ratings and how many benefits have not been increased <e> <s> i picked up the higher rate of statutory sick pay and the one-parent benefit as
