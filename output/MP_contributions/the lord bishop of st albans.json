["<cs> my lords i came this afternoon to listen and not to speak but i am provoked to <e>", "<cs> my lords as someone who for the past two months has been living in east jerusalem i should like to express gratitude to the minister for the way in which the question has been answered <e> <s> are the british government prepared to take up with the government of israel the case of dr mubarak awad who is a highly respected palestinian christian advocating non-violent resistance to israeli military occupation and who has been rewarded for his pains by the threat of expulsion from the land <e> <s> i am wondering whether he would care to point out to the government of israel that it is only by retaining these people in the territories that they will have non-violent people with whom they can discuss the future of the territories <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord will clarify whether it is the view of the government that the character of sundays should be conditioned solely by enterprise profitability economics and the tourist industry <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl tell the house whether he has received any representations from any of the major denominations in this country requesting that the ban on religious advertising be lifted <e>", "<cs> my lords while not wishing to discuss the merits of the particular film which in the course of my duties i had the tedious responsibility of watching through all its two hours and minutes will the minister give some indication to the house as to the attitude of her majestys government to the report on blasphemy produced by the most reverend primate the archbishop of canterbury through the working party of which i have the honour to be a member <e> <s> we <e>", "<cs> my lords noble lords will have noticed that there are two bishops in the list to speak in todays debate <e> <s> we look forward to hearing before long the words of the right reverend prelate the bishop of winchester <e> <s> before i come to my speech i hope i may trespass upon your lordships time to express the sympathy of your lordships house to the diocese of winchester through its bishop and to those other parts of the south of england over the dreadful tragedy that has overtaken many of their people in the clapham rail disaster <e> <s> we send our sympathy and our prayers to them as we think of the tragic deaths the grievous mutilations and horrible shock that have been caused to so many people at this time <e>", "<cs> my lords i first express my sincere apologies to your lordships and to the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter because i shall not be able to stay for the conclusion of the debate <e> <s> i mean no discourtesy but as noble lords may have noticed today is ash wednesday the first day of lent and bishops normally have full diaries and diocesan duties on a day such as this <e> <s> i am no exception <e> <s> indeed i am astonished that the bishops bench is so well served today and i wonder what neglect of diocesan duties this represents <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to your lordships and to the noble lord for my inaccuracy <e> <s> the right reverend prelate the bishop of london may be in a better position to answer that question <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will hear me to the end of my speech he may find the answer to his question <e>", "<cs> my lords the importance of this was reinforced in a number of ways <e> <s> first when a hebrew theologian wanted to write about the nature and origins of the universe around him he described it in what we know as genesis chapters i and ii in the framework of a six-day week with the seventh day representing gods cessation from the work of creation and his taking a rest <e> <s> this gave further divine sanction to the sabbath day as a day to be universally observed <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the churches are very grateful for in this instance the masterly inactivity of the government in implementing the easter act especially when they can express it with such consummate erudition <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a painful debate and it is good for us that we are experiencing the pain of it <e> <s> in our pain we must be grateful for the opportunity to reflect on the report <e>", "<cs> my lords at a time when a mere handful of cathedrals are attempting to raise million for their repair bills will the noble lord agree that the care of cathedrals measure which was recently discussed by the general synod and will shortly come before the ecclesiastical committee setting up a cathedral fabric commission to include representatives of english heritage represents a better position in which the government can grant aid to the cathedrals which are in need <e> <s> will he also ensure <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i can intrude by saying a few words of tribute from these benches <e> <s> they are inevitably personal ones <e> <s> i learnt of the death of lord elwyn-jones just two minutes before taking prayers yesterday <e> <s> i felt instant regret that the traditions of this house did not allow me an opportunity to voice the prayers of those present at the loss of so distinguished a member <e> <s> however hours later i am glad to rectify things <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down will he agree that when he and i served on the select committee during which we had many a tussle perhaps the final agreement of the committee was contributed to in some part by the fact that i withdrew from its membership <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl agree that using anomalies cheapens arguments <e> <s> does he further agree with the view of the church of england board for social responsibility which argues that the prime consideration is that we should work for freedom from work on sunday rather than freedom to work on sunday <e>", "<cs> i wish to add a few words to those of the right reverend prelate the bishop of liverpool <e> <s> the church has appreciated the way in which the government have moved in the direction of religious programming <e> <s> however it expresses anxiety about the way in which religious advertising has been brought in by a side wind so that hardly anyone has noticed it <e> <s> the matter was not debated in another place and it is not being debated adequately in this chamber at this hour of night <e> <s> even though the iba have consulted all kinds of people in preparation for a code it is strange that parliamentarians are not having a proper opportunity to discuss this important matter <e>", "<cs> as i entered the chamber this evening the noble lord lord winstanley was volunteering me as someone who would support the amendment <e> <s> therefore i am very happy to put myself on record as doing so <e> <s> it is an important and valuable amendment and one which i hope the government will take seriously <e>"]
