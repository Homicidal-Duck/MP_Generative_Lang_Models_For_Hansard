["<cs> my lords if i may correct the noble lord the white paper suggested that there should be area boards <e> <s> i believe that the present government are thinking of reducing that number to seven <e> <s> i and i think the noble viscount lord thurso agrees with me believe that it would be undesirable to reduce the number below <e> <s> i believe the noble viscount suggested that there should be area boards <e> <s> i personally opted for about without being absolutely wedded to that figure <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not propose to make a long reply because i feel that that would be out of place in a short debate <e> <s> but i should like to congratulate my noble friend lord seafield on his excellent and almost non-controversial maiden speech <e> <s> i thought that his figures were most interesting and i only wish that we could have the same sort of figures for other parts of scotland because i think that we would find that the further north and west we go the more dependent the economies of those very rural areas are on fishing in general and salmon and trout fishing in particular <e> <s> i thought that his statistics were most interesting and i very much hope that my noble kinsman will be able sometime in the future to produce some figures for other parts of scotland based on the same premises <e> <s> i should like to thank noble lords who have taken part in this debate <e> <s> i found it a very interesting debate largely because i agreed with almost everything that was said which has not always been the case <e>", "<cs> i hope that my noble friend will not bring in a two-year minimum and maximum period <e> <s> as a great believer in free enterprise i am sure that it is essential to give the trial areas a reasonable amount of time to work and i should have thought that the original three years minimum might have been a fair compromise if it was also going to be the maximum <e> <s> obviously as has been frequently said a great deal of investment will be involved and i do not see how people can be expected to put up the amount of money required if they have a guaranteed time of only two years <e> <s> i have the feeling that the experiment may well take considerably longer to prove either a success or a failure <e> <s> i very much hope that my noble friend will not be taken in entirely by the blandish <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask my noble friend to confirm that this new clause applies to scotland as well as england and wales as i believe it does <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down will he confirm that the government consulted the equivalent scottish bodies to those which they consulted in england <e>", "<cs> i know nothing about cambridgeshire i was an oxford man myself but i should like to ask the noble baroness whether her amendment is not really meant to be situated at the end of line rather than line as published on the marshalled list <e> <s> it seems to make no sense at the end of line whereas it would fit in at the end of line <e>", "<cs> may i make one further point <e>", "<cs> as the most junior member of the renton committee on the preparation of legislation i should very much like to support my noble friend <e> <s> it seems to me that this subsection adds nothing to the bill <e> <s> one of our recommendations was that unnecessary verbiage should be cut out wherever possible <e> <s> this is a case which might well come into that category <e>", "<cs> i agree with almost every word that the noble lord lord donaldson has said <e> <s> none the less i come to a different conclusion <e> <s> it is that the woodcock is already mature by st september and it is not that one is shooting immature woodcock as such during september <e> <s> very few are shot in scotland during september <e> <s> i do not think that anyone has established the figure but certainly no one of my acquaintance goes woodcock shooting as such in september and i think that he would be remarkably ill-rewarded if he did <e>", "<cs> on this occasion i think that the noble lord lord donaldson has a point <e> <s> while i do not entirely go along with it i think that the number of snipe has diminished substantially in the last few years <e> <s> i should have thought there was a good argument for shortening the whole snipe season at both ends but unlike him i should have thought particularly at the december and january end when snipe must be getting much weaker and therefore easier targets <e> <s> whatever he says they are extremely difficult targets even in august <e> <s> i am sure he knows that only too well <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendments of the noble lord lord donaldson with one exception <e> <s> that is the knocking out of subsection <e> <s> i agree that if these amendments are carried some sort of alteration would probably be needed but i think it is important that at any rate <e>", "<cs> may i add to what my noble friend has said that in the case of occupiers it is even more difficult if there is no compensation <e> <s> in many cases they farm a minimal amount of a land <e> <s> not to be able to do what they want to do with it could be extremely difficult for them <e> <s> i can visualise cases where the owners would agree but the occupiers would <e>", "<cs> i have my name down to the amendment <e> <s> may i say that in the event of the committee accepting amendments nos <e> <s> and it will not be my intention to move amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i am satisfied that amendment no <e> <s> covers amendment no <e> <s> with the exception that possibly the word property should be inserted <e> <s> however i should have thought that even stored grain was still crops as such <e> <s> possibly my noble friend has taken legal advice and discovered that stored grain is not crops <e> <s> it seems a strange definition <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may speak briefly on amendment no <e> <s> which redefines semi-automatic <e> <s> as my noble friend lord swansea explained automatic guns are already illegal so there seems no point in having any definition for them in this bill <e> <s> the definition in clause for semi-automatic weapons is totally inadequate <e> <s> after discussions with the department of the environment we have come up with the definition which i have down as amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> if my noble friends amendment to leave out line on page is not accepted it is my intention to support him in his amendment to leave out the present definition of automatic and semi-automatic weapons and to move my definition of semi-automatic in the appropriate place when we reach clause <e>", "<cs> many of us have several stuffed birds dating from the last century or a little longer which are in the old inventories of our houses <e> <s> if we wish to offer them for sale and we do it through one of the more reputable auctioneers would we have to obtain a licence or would the auctioneer obtain a licence having satisfied himself that these birds did date genuinely from before the date of this bill <e>", "<cs> i should very much like to support my noble friend but i have one slight doubt when he says there is no other way of moving about <e> <s> i should have thought that the london tube in the rush hour provided a typical way of moving about which was neither by land sea nor air in any normal sense of the words <e>", "<cs> i am not going to mention duck after this first mention but it seems to me totally illogical and always has done that the green plover is protected and the golden plover is not <e> <s> from personal observation i would say that the green plover is extremely common in most of this country and the golden plover though quite common in certain places is by no means so universally common <e> <s> i very much hope that my noble friend will refer this whole flatter to his advisory body <e> <s> possibly he might put the golden plover on to the protected list and take off the green plover or at any rate out of schedule i am not sure whether it is there <e> <s> it seems to me that we have those two species the wrong way round and we ought to reconsider both of them <e>", "<cs> i think i must declare a small interest in that i am the honorary president of the scottish wildlife trust so somewhat naturally i thoroughly support the objects of my noble friends amendment <e> <s> but i think it is defective and it will not achieve its purpose for the very reasons that the noble lord lord donaldson has given from the bench opposite <e>", "<cs> i too should like to support the two noble lords who have spoken <e> <s> i do not believe that sparrowhawks will ever become common again because i think that unlike the kestrel modern life is against them <e> <s> if the noble earl on the front bench is worried about the number of birds that we want on schedule then one which in my opinion he might well consider removing would be the hen harrier <e> <s> that is an infinitely more common bird where the environment is remotely suitable for it than the sparrowhawk and in the opinion of most people it does far more damage <e> <s> i think that it would be a very popular move so far as the farming community in scotland is concerned to remove the hen harrier from schedule and to keep the sparrowhawk on schedule <e>", "<cs> i rise to support the noble lord lord kilbracken most strongly in this amendment as far as the second part of it is concerned that is the words all birds included in part i of schedule <e> <s> i see the difficulty about the first part <e> <s> if you happen to shoot several mallard on st january and you wish to sell them it would be very difficult to sell them legally and even more difficult for the game dealer who bought them on the evening of st january to dispose of them again that night <e> <s> therefore i think there are advantages in giving th february as the closing date <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has said that the prohibition on the sale of dead wild geese has worked very satisfactorily <e> <s> there seems to be a theory in this committee that it has but so far as scotland is concerned it has been considered an absolute disaster <e>", "<cs> am i right in thinking that if the amendment is accepted you would not be able to offer for sale the pearls from the pearl mussel <e> <s> this may be necessary i am afraid i know very little about how common the pearl mussel is <e> <s> i know that there are one or two people in perth who are full-time pearl mussel fishermen and i feel that they would not be at all happy if this particular provision went through if my understanding is correct that it would ban the sale of the pearl from the pearl mussel <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may answer that <e> <s> it is very difficult to keep the red squirrel from the seeds of trees fir cones and such like when you wish to gather them and grow young trees in your nursery <e> <s> the red squirrel has the advantage that it can get up a tree when the seeds are ripe much more quickly than any forester can <e> <s> foresters find the red squirrel a great nuisance <e> <s> i am pleased to say that i have only red squirrels so there is no doubt that it is the red squirrel and not the grey that does the damage <e> <s> i thoroughly support the view of my noble friend on the front bench that they can be a pest <e> <s> i do not say that it would ever be such a pest that it would be right to kill it in large numbers but i can see that there might be an occasion when people might have to kill one or two red squirrels which could be particularly damaging to rare trees which they wished to propagate <e>", "<cs> if i may just interrupt it is not damage to the trees which i agree is virtually nonexistent it is that they take the seed from the trees when the seed is ripe for taking and propagating in the nursery <e> <s> that is the trouble <e> <s> i agree that the damage to trees is minimal <e>", "<cs> i should very much like to support this amendment <e> <s> i can see no reason why bows or crossbows should be allowed for killing any mammal and i would have thought that this was an amendment which the government could well accept <e>", "<cs> i should like very briefly to raise one point <e> <s> would the front bench consider making sub-aqua guns harpoons and such like weapons illegal for the killing of animals <e> <s> it seems to me that they can do a lot of harm <e> <s> they are getting more and more common in many scottish rivers and it seems to me an undesirable trend <e> <s> i apologise that i have not put down an amendment to this effect but i think it would be desirable to include such weapons in this clause <e>", "<cs> in reply to the noble baroness lady david i believe that recently its numbers in the north of the mainland of scotland have decreased considerably due to a large extent to people taking it as she rightly said to put in their gardens at least i presume that is why they take it <e> <s> it is therefore important to get it into schedule <e> <s> she is of course right to say that in orkney it is a fairly common plant but orkney is quite inaccessible and as it disappears from the north of scotland we may find that it starts diminishing in orkney too <e> <s> i should be happier as my noble friend lord inglewood said if it could be put in schedule now while locally in orkney it is still reasonably common rather than waiting for it to become rare in orkney as well as on the mainland of scotland <e>", "<cs> i feel bound to withdraw the amendment because my noble friend said he would take account of what i had said <e> <s> i believe that if he now refers the matter to the nature conservancy council in scotland he will find that they are not averse to putting the scottish primrose in schedule and i put it no higher than that <e> <s> i shall probably return to this subject on report because i think the minister will find when he has taken the most recent soundings that there has been a considerable decrease in the numbers of this plant in the north of scotland in sutherland and caithness and that it may need protection so far as the mainland of scotland is concerned although as i said i agree that it is still fairly common in orkney <e> <s> with those observations i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> may i ask my noble friend one question <e> <s> under what clause of the bill does the licensing system come <e> <s> it does not seem to come under clause <e> <s> clause says that sections to do not apply says sections to and says <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is quite right <e> <s> it does come under clause <e>", "<cs> before withdrawing the amendment may i ask my noble friend to tell me the position about homing budgerigars <e> <s> many people keep them <e> <s> they fly around their gardens and at night come into their cages shut up to be kept safe from the foxes <e>", "<cs> i am still not happy about the budgerigar i must admit <e> <s> i should like to give your <e>", "<cs> i should like to find out the answer to one question which is whether any of these amendments apply only to new buildings <e> <s> because while i have every sympathy with the disabled i feel that in the case of many old buildings which apply for planning permission for alterations or something like that it is not possible to provide access for the disabled without totally wrecking the interior of the building <e> <s> the fire precautions which have had to be provided under the act of i think have in many cases wrecked the interior of buildings to a very considerable extent <e> <s> i agree they have probably added to the safety of the people who stay in those buildings but personally i think that the extra safety provided is a very dubious plus compared to the wrecking of the interior <e>", "<cs> i too should like to support the amendment <e> <s> so far as i know i have no interest to declare because although i have some trees covered by tree preservation orders i have no complaints about that and i have no desire to cut down any of them <e> <s> but they can be a nuisance partly because it seems that once a tree preservation order is imposed on a group of trees it is extremely difficult to remove it <e> <s> as trees become older they undoubtedly become dangerous and it is very difficult to show to the <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for that answer i should like to ask him one further question that is whether the sub-committee of the statute law committee has taken into account the fact that computer techniques have advanced very considerably in the last six years since the renton committee reported and that the whole of the operations described particularly in recommendation of the renton committee would probably now be considerably cheaper than they were in <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that there are many small communities in scotland which are dependent on the -line services to receive any television reception at all and that they would bitterly resent it if the government increased the speed with which they are phasing out the -line services unless they received their own particular local stations on -lines <e> <s> i imagine that that would be a fairly expensive undertaking at present or for that matter at any future time <e>", "<cs> i should like to make one point on this matter <e> <s> i am a member of the red deer commission and i think that i should declare that interest straight away <e> <s> i personally feel that the red deer commission will not want to be involved in this because they find the register extremely useful for statistical purposes <e> <s> i think they would fear that if <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble viscount is being a bit difficult here because surely things will work much better if there can be agreement between the people who hold the licences and the red deer commission <e> <s> that situation is more likely to obtain if they feel that the red deer commission do not have a veto on the distribution of licences <e> <s> i should have thought that for the records to be at all accurate it is essential for the red deer commission to have a good relationship with the people who hold the licences <e> <s> i feel i may well be wrong that this is more likely to obtain if the red deer commission do not have a veto on who does and who does not have the licences <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may tell the noble lord lord northfield that the red deer commission would very much like to know the species of the deer but there are difficulties because in many cases when they pass between dealers they will probably already have been skinned and it is extremely difficult for instance to tell a fallow buck when it is skinned or prepared from a small red deer stag <e> <s> so there are difficulties about that <e> <s> i am no expert on the subject but i should think that the difficulties probably outweigh the advantages <e> <s> possibly my noble friend lord glenarthur will get in touch with the red deer commission about this <e> <s> there are members of the commission who know much more about this than i do <e> <s> but my feeling is that from the point of view of the red deer commission the important thing is the number of carcases and the sex <e> <s> nearly always if one has some idea of their origin one can have a fairly good idea of their species <e> <s> if they come from the highlands of scotland the chances are that they are red deer <e> <s> if they come from further south they are probably either roe deer or most likely fallow deer <e>", "<cs> i would very much like to support the amendment of the noble lord lord northfield <e> <s> but i think that if it were inserted into the bill there is not a cat in hells chance of the bill getting through unless of course the government decide to adopt it and even then i think it would be quite difficult <e> <s> as has been said the difficulty is the definition of enclosed land <e> <s> we all know that there are certain so-called farmers who string a bit of wire along a bit of hill plant a few turnips there and wait for the deer to come in and then shoot them time after time as they come in and this is their source of income <e> <s> those are the type of people whom we want to get at not the genuine farmer whose genuinely enclosed and well-fenced land is invaded by deer <e> <s> i simply do not <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble viscount lord thurso is slightly wrong about the night shooting code because as i read it it will apply only to authorisations given by the red deer commission under subsection a and not subsection to the occupier who shoots his own deer at night and who is entitled to do so at the moment <e> <s> in many ways i agree with the noble viscount that this is a pity but i suppose that it has been drawn up in this way because my noble friend felt that to try to interfere with the rights of the occupier would be a disastrous procedure so far as the progress of this bill is concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords when my noble friend sends the figures to the noble lord lord john-mackie and the noble lady may i ask him to say also how much forestry commission land which has been sold although not under trees is capable of being planted as opposed to that which is unplantable <e>", "<cs> my lords could my noble friend tell us the total amount of money that goes from this country to unicef that is the government contribution and the voluntary contributions from the churches and other organisations <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the minister can enlighten me as to the date on which this act is likely to be brought into force <e> <s> under clause the government will need to make orders to bring it into force <e> <s> can he give any indication when this is likely <e>", "<cs> having been a member of the committee on the preparation of legislation i feel compelled to support the noble lord <e> <s> lord hughes in <e>", "<cs> will the lord advocate also consider my point <e> <s> it is a serious point that someone has to put up money for rebuilding steadings cottages or houses when a new road is threatened to go through them and the building of the new road appears often to be postponed sometimes for up to months or two years <e> <s> this means that the landowner concerned is very much out of pocket for much longer than he thinks <e> <s> the reason why i support the first amendment of the noble lord lord hughes was that i thought the advance could be made to any person on the acquisition of land when the line of a new road was definitely agreed upon <e>", "<cs> i very much hope that my noble friend the minister will accept these amendments <e> <s> i personally would be quite unable to support the government on this particular group of amendments <e> <s> i am chairman of a group of provincial newspapers an interest which i feel i should declare but i assure your lordships that i am not and never have been a journalist in any form shape or size <e> <s> sadly i think i would not be capable of writing sufficiently well to pursue that career <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend the minister for that answer <e> <s> may i ask him whether before bringing into effect the second section of that part of the act that he was going to bring into force on st october if all goes well he would consult with some or all of the many conservation bodies that exist in this country and also whether it would be possible to exclude large raised reservoirs in remote areas where even if the dams burst they would do little harm and where they are useful both for fire fighting and as a wetlands habitat for many species of birds butterflies and dragonflies which are becoming very rare in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to rise to ask the noble viscount whose bill this is two questions <e> <s> first may i say that i am very much in favour of this bill in principle and secondly that i have an interest to declare in that i own some very moderate salmon fishing and i am also trustee for some rather better salmon fishing <e> <s> the two questions which i should like to ask the noble viscount are these <e> <s> in clause of his bill he quite rightly gives anglers the right to vote for the amalgamated boards but not the right to vote for boards that do not amalgamate so far <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to support the amendment of the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran but i should also like to ask the noble lord why has he not put down an equivalent amendment to the scottish clause clause of the bill <e> <s> it seemed to me unfair that in england one would have a period of months as a result of his amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment of my noble friend lord ridley but before doing so perhaps i should declare an interest in that i own some rather indifferent salmon fishing in scotland <e>", "<cs> i should like to say a few words about amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> although i have not moved the amendment i felt because i shall have the opportunity so to do that it was worth raising the issue at this particular moment <e> <s> i feel that my noble friend can have no idea of the difficulty of getting people to answer letters <e> <s> my noble friend the marquess of lansdowne as chairman of our local fisheries board sent out a circular not long ago and he was delighted because he received about a per cent <e> <s> response but it was a fairly easy form to be completed and a stamped and addressed envelope was provided for its return <e> <s> therefore i think the chances of anyone actually getting four-fifths are remote <e>", "<cs> first perhaps i could point out that there are many fishery boards where undoubtedly one can buy several houses for twice the amount of the assessment collected by that particular board each year <e> <s> secondly if one is buying heritable property on the whole one has security for it whereas borrowing under the previous section clause a one might be borrowing for other purposes and there would be no security for ones borrowing <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that i must disagree with my noble friend lord ridley on this subject <e> <s> the committee may not be aware but there is a very nice river called the inver which flows into the tay opposite dunkeld cathedral and about a quarter of a mile up the inver is a lovely beauty spot which belongs to the national trust for scotland called the hermitage or ossians hall <e> <s> from the hermitage one views the most magnificent waterfall and if one is really lucky one can see a whole lot of salmon trying to jump up it and always failing <e>", "<cs> on the strength of that assurance i am very pleased to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> i have indicated that i am not entirely happy with my amendment <e> <s> i believe that it goes too far the opposite way <e> <s> i shall be delighted to withdraw it but i should like to suggest to my noble friend the minister of state that if we can come to some halfway arrangement this might be a good idea <e> <s> i believe that in the larger fishery board districts like the tay the secretary of state will have an impossible job in satisfying himself that every proprietor is in favour of what act he is going to exempt <e>", "<cs> with that i am more than pleased to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend withdraws the amendment i should like to say that i am somewhat disappointed with the reply of my noble friend the minister for the very reasons given by the noble lord lord carmichael <e> <s> i feel that the smaller boards are probably the most likely to transgress and regard an annual meeting as being unnecessary <e> <s> i do not think that will happen in the case of my noble friend lord lansdowne and his board but i do think it might happen with some of the smaller boards <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps it might be for the convenience of the house if i were to say a word about amendment no <e> <s> even though i shall not be able formally to move it assuming that the governments amendment is accepted <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support these amendments or whichever one is decided upon or if none is whatever the government produce as an alternative <e> <s> i should also like to point out that the number of salmon injured by these drift-nets in northumberland is very considerable <e> <s> the figures that my noble friend lord lansdowne has produced obviously take no account of the number which are injured and die on their way to their final destination or reach it and die very soon afterwards and are no use either for angling or for breeding <e>", "<cs> may i point out to my noble friend that an extra by has crept into subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment <e> <s> i do not think it goes against the governments thesis that everyone should bear their particular share of the burden <e> <s> that is a thesis with which i entirely agree <e> <s> however as the noble lord lord grimond has said the proposed system seems very unfair on the orcadians and i feel that they need some relief <e> <s> perhaps my noble friend has some suggestions to make <e> <s> i suspect that the amendment may be deficient in some ways <e> <s> but i should very much like to support it in principle <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment which has one good feature over many such amendments <e> <s> it is that it does not stipulate the <e>"]
