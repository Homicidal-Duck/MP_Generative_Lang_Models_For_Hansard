["<cs> my lords from these benches i want to add my own warm and heartfelt support to the motion <e> <s> all who have paid tribute to queen elizabeth the queen mother in these days have drawn on many different strands in her character and they have not been short of material <e> <s> in these sentences i hope that i can give voice to the gratitude felt by all who cherish the christian and indeed the religious traditions of our society <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to express from these benches our gratitude to the noble baroness lady masham of eton for tabling this motion and for drawing attention to the beginning of the international year of disabled people <e> <s> i will not elaborate on what the noble baroness said so well about the importance of this year and the present needs of the disabled <e> <s> nor will i take up the time of the house to answer some of the charges laid by the noble lord lord wells-pestell against the contribution of the bench of bishops in critical and constructive concern with social issues <e> <s> i do not believe there is any imbalance between our contribution under the last administration and our contribution under this <e> <s> but since i take as seriously as he does that such a contribution should be made i hope there will be some other occasion when we may have a more creative exchange about it all <e>", "<cs> my lords some play has been made in another place with the fact that the churches together have levelled criticism against the proposed british nationality bill and there have been references to the enthusiastic amateurs of the cloth tripping over themselves as they rush to the barricades <e> <s> i hope i shall not be accused of tripping over myself if i try to put before noble lords some of the reasons why the churches are so concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i want heartily to endorse all that has been said in support of the motion <e> <s> the marriage of a prince of wales is in itself a matter for great rejoicing by the citizens of this country but there are many reason why this particular marriage gives such great pleasure not only here but throughout the commonwealth and indeed the world <e> <s> walter bagehot said in his work on the english constitution <e>", "<cs> my lords when i spoke in the debate on second reading i explained why the leaders of the churches in this country felt that they must oppose this bill and expressed the hope that this house would be able to remove some of those aspects which had caused the deep concern that i tried to voice <e> <s> i am glad to join with others in acknowledging the changes which the government have been <e>", "<cs> the my lords the tributes already paid to the noble and learned lord lord scarman are well deserved and it is appropriate to give credit to the home secretary for acting so promptly to set up this inquiry and for his choice of the man to conduct it <e> <s> i regret that the right reverend prelate the bishop of southwark through illness and the right reverend prelate the bishop of liverpool through an inescapable engagement are not able to take part in this debate <e> <s> they would be better qualified to reflect the recent experiences and attitudes of the churches in places like brixton and toxteth <e> <s> but i was anxious that these benches should not remain silent on such a grave moral issue <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make a short contribution to this debate first to associate these benches with the concern and the prayers of our people for all who are involved in this crisis and particularly in this place for those ministers who bear heavy responsibilities in decision-making <e> <s> i also have a direct responsibility for the appointment and support of the chaplain to the islanders two-thirds of whom are anglicans and their little cathedral church named after canterbury cathedral which figures in many of the pictures of the islands is one of the focal points of community life there <e>", "<cs> my lords when i last spoke in this house five weeks ago i stressed that there were two important principles at stake in this unhappy dispute the need to ensure that nations act within international law which is the bulwark on which the future peace of the world depends and the need to stand by the interests of the falkland islanders to ensure that they and other similarly exposed groups of people do not have to live in continual fear of aggression by more powerful neighbours <e> <s> i said that our first aim must be to seek a diplomatic solution but that this must not be a solution which fudges these principles <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i beg leave to say a few sentences in support of the motion to express pleasure on behalf of the lords spiritual for the splendid way in which the motion for the loyal address has been proposed and to express also our enthusiastic support for it <e> <s> governments may come and governments may go but the lords spiritual always sit in the same place and this <e>", "<cs> and this is for a different reason <e> <s> no not a different reason but the same reason i hope that the lords spiritual believe in government as such and order in human affairs and rejoice that that has its focus in this beloved country in the person of her majesty the queen <e> <s> i simply wish to say that i hope the lords spiritual will play their peculiar part and make what i believe is sometimes a constructive contribution to your lordships debates <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say in reply that this is a subject on which i hope there will be more publicity <e> <s> i believe that the church is engaged in many projects and has many spokesmen dealing with that matter in relation to education <e> <s> on another occasion i should be very happy to respond in detail to the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords at this late hour you will expect me to be brief and i would simply like to express my gratitude to all who have taken part in this debate <e> <s> your lordships have been most generous in your response to my introduction of this subject and i only wish that i were able to be here more often not so much to speak as to listen <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like first to thank the noble lord lord sudeley for the manner and generosity of his speech not least in the references he has made to recent writings and statements of those of us who sit on this bench <e> <s> in responding to the speech of the noble lord i want to emphasise four points <e> <s> first i want to make it clear that i understand the reasons which have prompted the noble lord to bring forward this bill and the genuine anxieties behind it <e> <s> secondly <e> <s> i want to set out what the intentions of the church of england were in introducing the alternative service book in and what they were not <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my voice in support of the whole of <e>", "<cs> my lords it remains for me to express my gratitude to all those who have taken part in a debate which has more than fulfilled my expectations of the contribution this house might be able to make to the commemoration of the th anniversary of the united nations and our thinking about its future at a critical turn in the fortunes of the world <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister take note of the fact that many of us who opposed this bill are extremely unhappy at the present state of the law <e> <s> secondly that we regret that reasoned amendments tabled in this house were not found acceptable <e> <s> thirdly will he take note of the fact that church leaders will feel a responsibility to take some initiative to draw together those of us in this country who still believe that a compromise proposal such as we had before this house is still possible <e> <s> will he take note of the fact that meanwhile archbishops and bishops will take the consequences of what has transpired in our own house <e>"]
