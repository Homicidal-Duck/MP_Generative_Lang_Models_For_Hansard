["<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his answer <e> <s> will he accept that the driving of motor cars at inordinate speeds which is rampant in this country is not only a danger to life and limb but a very serious consumption of valuable fuel <e> <s> will her majestys government consider the possibility of introducing a speed limit such as obtains throughout the whole of the united states of america of miles per hour and also consider imposing penalties which would concentrate the mind on the importance of keeping the law <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that this school is needed in order to match up to the first and middle church schools that there is very considerable support in ealing for the school and that it is not regarded as a sectional school but as a contribution to the society and the community by the church of england so as to offer the kind of education that can be given in a church school to the community as a whole <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise for not having put my name down on the list of those who wished to speak on this bill but finding myself in the house and having been very much concerned in recent years with the gaming legislation i hope that your lordships will bear with me if i say one or two things <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord birkett that this is a bill of minor importance and therefore i would not want to oppose it <e> <s> my only comment is that it seems to be of such minor importance that i wonder whether it is worth while bringing it in at all <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord wigg that there are much greater issues involved in the whole question of the legislation on lotteries and i think he speaks well when he suggests that there ought to be an overall examination of these issues rather than dealing with them piecemeal by small bills such as this <e>", "<cs> my lords at this late hour i do not think that there would be any profit in analysing even if i were able to do so all the admirable speeches made during the course of the last two and a half hours <e> <s> so i would wish first to thank most sincerely all noble lords who have taken part in the debate <e> <s> i think there is general and universal agreement at any rate there was in the earlier speeches in the debate that there is a great need for new initiative and new vision <e> <s> it has been therefore a matter of some regret that in the last speeches in this debate there has been in my view a narrowing of the vision which i sought to place before your lordships <e> <s> i have not thought of youth service as being something which is going to get us out of the problem of unemployment or of keeping people out of trouble or of keeping them away from borstal <e> <s> i have been endeavouring to put before <e>", "<cs> my lords may i from these benches add our words of congratulation to all those who

successful conclusion <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord lord soames knows that he has our support and prayers in the very difficult task which he has ahead in implementing this very satisfactory outcome <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to add my voice in the expression of thanks to the noble lord lord nugent of guildford for introducing this motion and i too have to ask him and the house to accept my apology for being unable to stay for the whole of the debate since i too have a very longstanding engagement which requires my presence elsewhere later this evening <e> <s> i am also glad to extend my felicitations to the noble lord lord strauss on making his maiden speech and i am glad that he is in his place to hear the chorus of praise which has been expressed by every speaker in the debate

"<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his intervention <e> <s> whether or not he is right i am simply making the point that the williams committee goes out of its way time and time again to say that all printed written material shall be completely free of any kind of restriction and i find that an astonishing recommendation <e> <s> it is based on the thesis that the harm done solely by reading is minimal <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while i thank the noble lord for his answer does he appreciate that it will cause very great disappointment to the charities and to the churches which are looking forward to the implementation of the recommendations of these two committees and will he in particular note the very clear and unambiguous recommendation on the subject of political activities in pursuit of charitable objects and try to clarify the situation since there is grave difficulty in the way of well-known extensive charities because it is suggested that they are indulging in political activities <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the methodist conference at its last meeting in passed a resolution expressing concern at the inland revenues reported refusal to allow covenant-giving to be used for the purpose of world development <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this house do direct that in accordance with the church of england assembly powers act the deaconesses and lay workers pensions measure be presented to her majesty for royal assent <e> <s>

indeed i have some embarrassment in asking your lordships to spend some time upon consideration of it <e> <s> i have however to do so for this reason <e> <s> the church commissioners are only permitted to disburse their funds in accordance with the directions of parliament <e> <s> therefore if they see a reasonable cause to which they should make their contribution they have to seek parliamentary approval to give them power to make such a contribution <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that it is not only the amenities societies but the forum of representatives which represent all the community activities in this area who are totally and unanimously opposed to the refusal to grant listed building consent and are absolutely opposed to the destruction of this building since they believe that it is essential to the community activities in the area <e>", "<cs> i trust that the noble baroness lady young will not think that those of us who are critical of this clause offer our criticisms in any carping spirit <e> <s> for many of us it is a deep matter of conscience <e> <s> we greatly admire the skill expertise and knowledge with which the noble baroness has steered this bill during the long hours of the committee stage <e> <s> many <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that not only the leaders of the anglican communion but also a number of other people have written letters to the secular and the church press asking for the reasons for the withdrawal of bishop tutus passport and also the reason for the detention of the reverend david russell

take place on certain disused burial grounds subject to the consent of the secretary of state and with appropriate safeguards and for purposes connected therewith <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord sudeley for taking this opportunity of addressing your lordships house and for giving me notice of the points he wanted to make <e> <s> i was greatly relieved to hear that the two instances which the noble lord gave are in the diocese of gibraltar and not within the jurisdiction of north and central europe so i hope that i may be held to be guiltless of any of the charges which he has raised <e> <s> but the fact that the two cases he has mentioned are in the diocese of gibraltar places upon me the responsibility of being very careful what i say because at the moment the diocese of gibraltar is a separate independent diocese responsible only to the metropolitical authority of the archbishop of canterbury and has nothing to do with the church of england or the general synod <e> <s> therefore i must not comment too forcefully upon what he has said lest i should be trespassing on an area which is beyond my jurisdiction or my powers <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to give my support to this bill and to express the hope that your lordships will give it a second reading <e> <s> as we have been reminded by the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran in december and again in the noble baroness lady wootton of aibinger endeavoured to carry a bill through this house which sought to remove all the

accept that and i did not indicate that it was not so in the words that i used <e> <s> she was unsuccessful on both occasions <e> <s> i could not be present on the second occasion but on the first i opposed the bill on second reading and proposed amendments in committee <e> <s> i made it clear on both those occasions that in my view there is a considerable difference so far as marriage is concerned between those related by kindred and those related by affinity <e>", "<cs> my lords it had been expected that at this point the noble earl lord longford would have been addressing your lordships <e> <s> it would have been particularly appropriate that a lord temporal should have been the first to express the felicitations of the house to the right reverend prelate who has just delivered his maiden speech <e> <s> however he cannot be here and so the happy priviliege falls to me to congratulate my right reverend brother on such an admirable maiden speech <e> <s> if i may say so without condescension it was very well informed very well marshalled and very clearly delivered <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware of the very close relationship between the work of westminster hospital and kings college london and that the closing of the westminster hospital would have very serious repercussions upon medical teaching at kings college london <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support the speech which has just been made by the noble viscount lord simon especially as regards the instruction which he is moving <e> <s> my concern and interest in this matter is not because it is in my diocese because in fact this work is to be done in the diocese of southwark and is the responsibility of my reverend brother <e> <s> this bill is a sequel to the london transport act and in that the london diocese was actively concerned and had to face the same problems as are facing the southwark diocese by this private bill at present <e> <s> therefore i want to underline the two points which the noble lord has made so eloquently and so clearly <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the closing of the old charing cross hospital will create a situation of the utmost seriousness <e> <s> is he also aware that the voluntary associations involved in providing accommodation in such places as centre point or the crypt of st peters eaton square are stretched to the utmost <e> <s> will the noble lord give all possible encouragement to facilitate the progress of the working party and to see that it is able to provide adequate alternative accommodation when the old hospital finally ceases to be available to the st mungo community housing association <e>", "<cs> my lords i have been very glad to be able to add my name to the amendment moved by the noble baroness and i most earnestly plead with the government to accept it <e> <s> it is most important that in this bill we should defend and protect the rights of old people <e> <s> as i observed in my speech at second reading and as i am sure has been the experience of noble lords in this house i have received an enormous correspondence both from individuals and from organisations concerned with one aspect or another of the bill <e> <s> a great many of the representations which i have received have been from organisations that are concerned with the protection of the rights of old people and a great many of the fears which have been expressed in letters have come from old age pensioners who are afraid that the places where they have lived and which they have secured by their savings may be in jeopardy <e> <s> i believe that that danger <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that those of us who served in capital ships during the war very much regret that it was not possible to

this amendment <e> <s> it concerns a very vital and important area of safety and we have already seen in london the awful consequences when there are not proper safeguards <e> <s> the amendment of the noble baroness gives a cutting edge to this clause and i hope that the government will accept it <e>", "<cs> my lords before we send this bill on its way i should like to add a word from these benches <e> <s> on the second reading i observed that this was an extremely complicated and technical bill but that beneath all this verbiage there lay the most important things of human rights and human happiness <e> <s> therefore we owe a great debt to those who have carried us through the complexities of this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord to appreciate that the anxiety which many people have concerns not so much the right of people to propagate their views but the means which they employ in order to do so <e> <s> is he aware that very undesirable means are used especially by the moonies to capture the allegiance especially of young people and to retain it once they have initially succeeded <e> <s> will the government therefore keep a very careful watch over what is already and is potentially further a very dangerous organisation <e>", "<cs> my lords i must ask the indulgence of the house and especially of the noble lord who will reply if i am not able to stay to the end of this debate <e> <s> i hope however that your lordships will feel that i am using my time profitably later this evening even if i am not in this house for i shall be supporting the noble baroness lady macleod of borve in an effort to raise money for crisis at christmas that admirable organisation inspired by her late husband <e> <s> indeed she would have been present at this debate

associations should receive every encouragement and help that they can get in order to be able to do this essential work for our people <e> <s> i know of course that charitable organisations get tax relief but is it not very unreasonable that so many of them should have to spend so much money in paying vat for work which is being done for purely charitable purposes <e> <s> again i know that there has been a relaxation on covenanting but here again if there is a change in the standard rate of tax there are not many people who will readjust their giving so that the charities are not out of pocket <e> <s> i hope that serious consideration can be given to the help that the charities and the voluntary organisations need in order that they may increasingly be able to do their work <e>",

connected therewith <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am among those who are very grateful to the noble lord lord nugent of guildford for his having the courage and pertinacity to introduce the bill again and i very much hope that the amendment will be defeated and that the noble lords bill will be given a second reading <e> <s> i have been interested and involved in road safety for a number of years and for a time i was president of the pedestrians association for road safety <e> <s> i have read all the literature on this subject <e>

unprejudiced mind to the evidence that is before us and i am utterly convinced that without any possibility of contradiction the case has been made out that if the wearing of seat belts was made

time <e> <s> in moving this second reading i think i can take your lordships into a shorter and possibly less controversial debate <e> <s> at any rate i can claim so far as i personally am concerned

possesses <e> <s> i have the privilege of being the chairman of the churches main committee a body which represents all the religious communions of this country in their secular relationships with the state and it is because i have realised the difficulties with which those other churches are from time to time confronted that i find it a very great honour on their part to be able to present this bill to your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the house for giving such a favourable and friendly reception to the bill and i thank the noble baroness lady david and the noble earl lord avon for the kind way in which they have received it <e> <s> the house can well appreciate that in these days when at a certain level ecumenical relationships do not make quite the

bill which will be of such benefit to them <e> <s> it is in that spirit of ecumenical goodwill that i invite the house to give the bill a second reading <e>", "<cs> i intervene in this debate with considerable hesitation in view of the formidable array of noble and learned lords who up to this point have for the most part been debating these amendments <e> <s> but this amendment before the house raises a question in the mind of a layman in the law which i think must be voiced <e> <s> i presume that this clause would give to journalists a particular and special privilege in the courts that if they were to be asked what was the source of their information they could refuse to answer the question and their refusal would not be interpreted as contempt of court <e> <s> if this is the case am i not right in thinking that it opens a door through which a great many other people with perfect right and legitimacy could ask to pass <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am interested to see the inclusion of the consistory courts under the heading of inferior courts and tribunals <e> <s> i confess that i did not come to this house with the preparation that i would wish to have made to be able to pronounce rather more authoritatively upon this matter <e> <s> if it is the intention to include the consistory courts in this category then there must be some careful consultation with those who are more learned than i am in these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords in inviting the house to give a third reading to this bill i wish to take the opportunity of thanking the house for giving it a fair wind <e> <s> this bill is completely uncontroversial and its sole purpose is to extend to other religious communities in this country the powers which are already possessed by the church of england in dealing with disused churchyards <e> <s> in the pastoral measure the church of england legislating for itself took powers whereby disused churchyards could be dealt with by pastoral measure <e> <s> we obviously had not the power to legislate for other religious communities and they still have to labour under the difficulties and disadvantages that if they want to deal with a disused churchyard they have to proceed by way of private bill in parliament <e> <s> that is a long drawn-out a complicated and an expensive procedure <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i would like to associate myself both with the words of sympathy that have been so eloquently expressed by speakers and also with the congratulations to those who have acted with such speed and with such efficiency <e> <s> i was bishop of chester throughout the last terrible outbreak <e> <s> i know what an appalling experience this can be for the communities who are involved <e> <s> there are stock-breeders who wake up in the morning with their stock intact stock upon which they may have expended a lifetime of care and expertise but by midday they are all dead <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to support this amendment but i do so on less abstract and more practical grounds than the noble lord lord mishcon has attributed to the bench of bishops <e>", "<cs> my lords i supported the previous amendment on the grounds of simplicity <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lords who have tabled amendment no <e> <s> and to the government for having indicated that they accept it in principle because this is a very important protection especially as i have been saying for charities <e> <s> i am grateful

presidents family for the people of egypt and also those who will be taking such important decisions in the immediate future as a result of this great tragedy <e>", "<cs> my lords if the course which is proposed by the noble lord is necessary what i believe would make a considerable difference would be if the title in line on page could be changed and brought into line with the other titles <e>

clear what is intended by the other amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness lady llewelyn-davies of hastoe for emphasising our responsibility for the preservation of human rights <e> <s> the matter that i wish to raise might seem small compared with some of the great issues that have been debated today but it is not small for those who are directly concerned <e> <s> i wish to speak about one aspect of the proposed patriation of the british north america act namely the effect that it would have upon the aboriginal peoples of canada <e> <s> i appreciate that the matter was the subject of an unstarred question in in this house but the answer that was then given by the noble lord lord trefgarne did not seem to me to give the reasons for the interpretation of the law which is maintained by the government <e> <s> on my own account i feel justified in raising the matter again and i am encouraged to do so by the anglican church of canada <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i cannot answer the noble lords question but i will endeavour to find the answer as soon as i can and if the answer is in the negative try to see that it becomes the affirmative <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it will not surprise your lordships if i say that in speaking to this bill which in general terms i welcome i wish to refer specifically to clause and schedule <e> <s> this clause and schedule place many and particularly those on these benches in a difficult position <e> <s> on the one hand if we support this clause there are those who and as i shall argue not without reason say that we are giving a public stamp of approval to sex establishments <e> <s> on the other hand if we oppose the clause there are those who maintain that we are thereby acquiescing in the uncontrolled spread of such establishments <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i ask him a question <e> <s> i do not know whether i misheard him earlier in his speech but i thought i heard him say that contrary to what i had said because sex shops existed some form of control was necessary <e> <s> would the noble lord accept that i did in fact having made clear my position on sex shops accept that control is necessary and what matters are the terms on which it is provided and the context in which it is done so as to be the permission of what is regrettable and undesirable rather than the licensing of what is perfectly acceptable <e>", "<cs> my lords the views of the bishops on the question of marriages between those related by affinity are well known to this house and i shall not repeat them in detail this afternoon <e> <s> we opposed the bill introduced on three occasions by the noble baroness lady wootton of abinger because we believed that her

including the words in the clause which refer to all the functions being capable of being devolved to the boroughs <e> <s> what is left <e> <s> a body without any functions <e> <s> it may be that technically it would still exist but i cannot conceive what it would do <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble earl for what he has just said <e> <s> however i must confess that i remain wholly unconvinced <e> <s> i should like to make two points <e> <s> first i can appreciate particularly in view of the additional burden and duties which will be laid upon the ilea that some sort of review should take place <e> <s> however that is provided for in the amendment <e> <s> we are not denying the need for a review we are not denying that it should take place <e> <s> we are leaving it to the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> before i speak to this amendment to which i have attached my name may i apologise for the absence of the right reverend prelate the bishop of southwark who is at this moment presiding over a conclave i think conclave would be the proper word of all his clergy at a conference in the midlands which was arranged many months ago <e> <s> he is very sorry that he cannot be here with us today and hopes that it will not be taken amiss or to represent any lack of concern on his part <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord the minister but i still think that my main point holds which is that the money has got to come from the boroughs and that we cannot just ask them to do what the glc did even in its better moments <e> <s> the function of legislation as i understand it and i have said this here before is to make it easier for people to do what is right and harder for them to do what is wrong <e> <s> we all need it and i believe that the boroughs need it in this instance <e>", "<cs> i am very much obliged to the noble lord lord renton and i should like to follow up what he said if i may have the indulgence of your lordships for a few more minutes <e> <s> in consultations that i have enjoyed with the government about this bill i did say that one thing which would make all the difference to us would be to have some statutory recognition given to some body with responsibility for co-ordination <e> <s> if in fact the situation relating to the london boroughs association was what it was previously and i am grateful to the noble lord for informing me about this because nobody else has provided any information that would go some way to meeting my point <e> <s> but now as he says himself it has become voluntary and i do not think this job can be left to a voluntary body in that way <e>", "<cs> i apologise for having to be out of the chamber for a few moments <e> <s> first perhaps i may say to the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter that in my reply i may have been insufficiently grateful to the noble lord lord elton for his additional financial help <e> <s> i thought that in what i was saying i was trying to help to bring about precisely what he said he intended should come about namely encouraging the boroughs to work together and giving them a framework in which to do so <e>", "<cs> i wish the chairman had repeated it later on <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may try and answer the noble lord <e> <s> my understanding was that it was to come through a precept on the boroughs made by the boroughs themselves <e> <s> that is why i was able to say that this is not another tier with its own funding not another body <e> <s> there is the money which comes from the rates and the body exists to enable that rate money to be shared in a way which fulfils what is being asked for in clause <e>", "<cs> as i understand it it would fulfil the functions which are at present provided for in clause <e> <s> the boroughs would set their own rate <e> <s> they would have obligations as regards voluntary grants and they would agree among themselves under this framework as to how the money should be distributed <e> <s> that is the situation as i understood it <e> <s> however there may be other noble lords better equipped to answer the point <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise simply to ask a question <e> <s> i hope that the minister will be able to answer it <e> <s> it relates to the purpose behind subsection of the clause <e> <s> so far as the authority is concerned i should have thought that what the clause provides applies to any education authority in the country and that it is not necessary to spell it out again in respect of this particular one <e> <s> is therefore the purpose of subsection the reference to the councils <e> <s> the councils are not education authorities and presumably therefore are not under the obligation laid down in subsection <e> <s> they have been brought into the situation through the earlier subsections of this clause <e> <s> is that the purpose of subsection <e> <s> otherwise i cannot explain why it should be there <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble lord the minister can elucidate that point <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble earl the minister again may i say that i am sorry if i deprived him of the opportunity to demonstrate his munificence but i was merely concerned to ensure that in my opening remarks i could not be accused of being ungrateful for mercies received <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very glad to be able to add my congratulations to those of the noble baroness to the noble lord lord mellish for his maiden speech <e> <s> other have already spoken of the experience that he brings to your lordships house <e> <s> like the noble baroness lady macleod i have seen at first hand something of what he has achieved in the docklands area and it is very remarkable <e> <s> his speech today has shown that the house will benefit greatly from that experience and will enjoy doing so <e> <s> we shall listen to his wisdom and may i say his enthusiasm with attention and respect on future occasions which i hope will be frequent <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the minister for his understanding reply <e> <s> i should like <e>", "<cs> as i have been mentioned once or twice perhaps i may say what actually happened so far as i was concerned <e> <s> when i first saw the amendments i had exactly the same impression as the noble lord lord sandford that it would be for me to move amendment no <e> <s> and the others would follow accordingly <e> <s> i was then advised by reputable authorities that if we first made a decision on the first amendment this would have the disadvantage of apparently anticipating all the decisions which were made on the other amendments <e> <s> that seemed to me to be a very understandable objection and i asked what would happen if i had leave to withdraw amendment no <e> <s> and these other amendments were agreed to <e> <s> the answer quite simply was and i think i can quote the words there was nothing unusal in having as a result of the committee stage contradictions in the bill as it then stands <e> <s> i was told that these would be sorted out at the report stage when the matter could be remedied <e>", "<cs> i cannot resist pointing out that not since has the bishop of london been allowed to live in fulham palace <e> <s> he lives in a modest house not far from here <e>", "<cs> i thought i made it clear in my speech that the small shops are not restricted in any way and that the schedule in the amendment applies only to those which have more than five employees <e>", "<cs> i must confess that i stand here very deeply disappointed having heard the speech of the noble lord the minister <e> <s> at the same time i must confess that i have had an answer to the question i have been asking myself for a very long time what in fact is moving the government forward <e> <s> what motive is directing them in this particular bill <e> <s> i find that the answer has been given to me twice tonight <e> <s> it is wrong to influence the market artificially <e> <s> now we know exactly why it is simply economic forces <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for that comment <e> <s> but in that case why did he go on to say that one objection to my amendment was that it did not meet the demand when he now admits that there is no conclusive evidence of what that demand is <e> <s> i merely make these points to show that to talk about demand is irrelevant to this issue <e> <s> it is fundamentally one of principle <e> <s> i will not go on <e> <s> there is a fundamental principle here which is simply as has now been revealed do we just let market forces have their say in this issue we have tried to meet some of the needs or are there more important considerations which must be taken into account and of which we have tried to take account in this amendment <e> <s> that i believe is the issue before us and i must leave it to the judgment of the committee <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of what is generally said about prelates at the present time i was surprised to hear the noble earl suggesting that we had actually talked about the threat of eternal damnation because that is not what bishops talk about in these days <e> <s> would the noble earl kindly give the reference to the point at which any right reverend prelate in this house has actually threatened eternal damnation for doing the things which the noble lord has suggested <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble earl for his careful and detailed answer <e> <s> clearly there still remain certain differences between us with regard to the significance of the particular case and its practical implications <e> <s> however in view of what the noble earl has said about his willingness to reconsider the matter and the meeting that i shall be having with the secretary of state i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the noble earl <e> <s> in the discussions we had with the department while this bill was being drafted it appeared that there was some reluctance on its part that model instruments and articles should be published once again <e> <s> i say once again because they had been generally available since the act and it is only recently that they have not been available <e> <s> it is <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl the minister for his reply <e> <s> in the light of what he has said i beg leave to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> i do not propose to speak in detail about this amendment but i must make one or two remarks about it to begin with <e> <s> the noble lord has just referred to flexibility <e> <s> when i read this amendment i see not flexibility but inconsistency <e> <s> i do not think that i am altogether lacking in numeracy but i find it extremely difficult to do the sums which the amendment requires <e> <s> i am told that the instrument of government shall provide for an equal number of parent governors governors appointed by the local education authority staff governors the head teacher and then either one foundation or one or two co-opted governors <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the noble lords assurances that subsection of amendment no <e> <s> is intended to cover county controlled or maintained special schools <e> <s> in that event where is it proposed that the government of aided and special agreement schools should be provided for in view of his express intention to oppose the motion that clause shall stand part of the bill <e> <s> that clause relates specifically to aided and special schools <e>", "<cs> in view of the explanation and assurances that have been given i agree that the amendment as it stands does not threaten the dual system in the way that i suggested <e> <s> i am grateful for those assurances <e> <s> i still wish to oppose the amendment on other grounds not least the size of the governing bodies <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for what he has said and i should like to make two points <e> <s> first of all on the size of the governing bodies to which he has already referred my point is that the bill as it stands sets ceilings on governing bodies for different sized schools <e> <s> the amendment does not and it would not prevent very considerably sized governing bodies being created for relatively small schools <e> <s> so i do not think his argument stands there <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that your lordships will all join wholeheartedly with me in expressing appreciation for the maiden speech of the noble lord lord kirkwood and in congratulating him <e> <s> it was an illuminating apposite speech borne out of his experience <e> <s> we welcomed it and look forward to <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support what the noble lord has just said but from a slightly different angle <e> <s> i too would not question what the noble lord lord mcintosh said about the recommendations in the taylor report but i do not think that we can implement them simply by increasing numbers in this way <e> <s> from our point of view it has a serious consequence <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord <e> <s> my point was not that the noble lord was making any proposal about the actual number of foundation governors but that in proportion to the overall number of governors they would be reduced well below the figure in previous education acts which was regarded as the minimum desirable <e> <s> although i have a certain sympathy with some of the noble lords arguments which spring from the taylor report i would urge your lordships to resist this amendment and the others attached to it <e>", "<cs> my lords i may have misunderstood the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey when he spoke to an earlier amendment <e> <s> he read out rather rapidly the number of the amendments to which he was speaking <e> <s> i though that he was including this amendment in his earlier speech <e> <s> i apologise for confusing the matter <e> <s> what i said in my earlier speech applies even more to this amendment because merely adding to the number of pupil governors reduces considerably the proportion of foundation governors <e>", "<cs> my lords when i first read the amendment moved by the noble viscount lord buckmaster of course it gained my wholehearted support for what it said <e> <s> i must confess that i then had certain reservations raised in my mind <e> <s> i found myself asking the question is statutory legislation really the right place for what at first sight appear to be statements of general principle <e> <s> should not legislation be confined to more precise indications of what can or cannot be done <e>", "<cs> i do not think that i have the reputation of being iconoclastic in theological matters and i should like to assure the committee that my zeal for tradition in that sphere is matched equally by my concern for the past in the matter of buildings <e> <s> i should like this evening to make one or two points in response to the noble lord lord kennet and then to say a few words as chairman of the churches main committee <e> <s> i have been involved with the churches in london for some time from to first as archdeacon then as bishop of willesden and then since when i returned as bishop of london <e> <s> i should like simply to say that i cannot think of a single case in which the amount of money that we should obtain from a particular site has been in any way a consideration in decisions that we have made <e> <s> i want to say that as clearly as i can <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to hear that <e> <s> the point i am making is that that was because the churches were needed there <e> <s> they were in the right place <e> <s> the only ones with which we had slight difficulties were the victorian churches <e> <s> conservationists seem to love them much more than the churches built many hundreds of years ago <e>", "<cs> i did not actually say that financial considerations did not enter into this <e> <s> that is not the point that the noble lord lord kennet made <e> <s> of course financial considerations enter into it because of the whole question of maintenance <e> <s> i said that the value of the site available for disposal was not a material factor <e> <s> that is very different <e> <s> we do not look around at possible churches to sell and say that a certain one would produce the greatest sum of money <e> <s> that is the point i was making <e>", "<cs> my lords generally speaking we on these benches welcome the bill <e> <s> many of its provisions implement recommendations which the church in various ways has been making for a number of years <e> <s> in expressing certain reservations about it i hope that i shall not be taken in any way to be reducing the welcome which we give to the provisions <e> <s> we very much welcome that so far as possible any stigma or disabilities which flow from being illegitimate should be removed and we are wholehearted in that view <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for his exposition because he has now made the point for me that i wanted to make <e> <s> what we are talking about here are the legal points which he made but that is not how it is necessarily seen in the country <e> <s> this is my worry and the worry of those of us on these benches <e> <s> what is seen is a suggestion i put it very crudely that henceforth the government do not think it is necessary to get married <e> <s> that i know is what the noble and learned lord does not mean but that is how i believe it will be commonly understood <e> <s> i am not alone in thinking that <e> <s> i am most grateful to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for that exposition because if he had not given that i should have had to draw attention to the fact that the only way to do what he said which is to eliminate the differences would be either to abolish marriage or to compel everybody to get married <e> <s> neither would be a practical nor desirable course to adopt <e>", "<cs> my lords before i speak specifically about the bill the amendment and canary wharf i apologise to the house for any confusion which i may have created in your lordships minds by putting down an amendment and then withdrawing it before it came on to the order paper <e> <s> as bishop of london with a pastoral responsibility in the east end i felt obliged to secure some public discussion of issues which lie behind this bill and i was advised that it was the proper and indeed the only way in which i could do so <e> <s> however i did not feel that it was right to presume on the willingness of the house to allow me to withdraw my amendment when the time came and i therefore <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his intervention <e> <s> i certainly hope to be here to listen to what he has to say and i shall be very interested to hear what he has to say about the price of houses which are available for people who at the moment are living in very inadequate accommodation in the surrounding borough <e> <s> i shall not develop the point of housing further but i merely say that it is a problem and it is bound to be a problem and it needs to be faced and dealt with when you have two different standards of housing cheek by jowl <e> <s> it may be that this is inevitable but at least it should be dealt with in a way which is based on consultation and understanding <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> first i agree that it would have been more appropriate if these matters had been aired at second reading <e> <s> however the time factor was against us <e> <s> on the question of consultation with the lddc all i can say is that the london churches group in particular which is not generally a wild and extravagant group has made repeated and continuous efforts for this kind of consultation <e> <s> it has done so precisely because it feels that it makes its points and that there is very little come-back <e> <s> i therefore felt that it was necessary to raise the points i have made to this house this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the strictures of the noble lord on the need for self-discipline as you would expect a humble prelate to do <e> <s> however i would remind noble lords that this whole massive development has come to us only through a private bill <e> <s> this has made it extremely difficult <e> <s> i cannot at the moment give chapter and verse <e> <s> but we were certainly given to understand that it was not appropriate to raise most of these issues at second reading of a private bill <e> <s> we may well have been wrongly advised but there have been no other stages as there are in the ordinary way with a public bill when we have been able to comment <e> <s> frankly i do not see how we could have acted in any other way <e> <s> another point is the question of where in public inquiries could we have made our voice heard <e> <s> it is precisely because of the legislation about enterprise zones and such matters that we feel that that opportunity is not given and does not arise <e>", "<cs> my lords how does the noble lord relate what he has just said to the recognition in the select committee report that <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down perhaps i may say two things <e> <s> first i do not propose to defend myself against the strictures of the noble lord lord mellish <e> <s> i have been down there i have visited people in their houses and the people to whom i talked are people who respect the corporation and acknowledge what it has done <e> <s> it is precisely because of what they have done that we are concerned that community relations there and all that members of the community have done may not be harmed in any way <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am happy to welcome the bill on behalf of those who sit on these benches <e> <s> the noble and learned lord the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most obliged to the noble lord for what he has said <e> <s> as one who has been bishop of cornwall i do not need much encouragement to think highly of the part played by our celtic forebears in our christian civilisation <e>", "<cs> my lords some years ago when i was general secretary of the national society and of the church of england schools council i was asked to lecture to americans on the english educational system <e> <s> i took proper pride in being able to begin by referring to the fact that in this country and in wales there were no state schools <e> <s> responsibility for education had always lain with local authorities of one kind or another <e> <s> i drew attention to the fact that our educational system had developed from local initiatives and depended upon a partnership between the local education authorities the managers or <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his intervention <e> <s> i must be honest and say that in view of my reading of the record of these negotiations i shall believe that agreement can be reached only when it is <e> <s> what matters is that any solution is based upon our tradition of partnership <e> <s> in this respect i support the plea of the association of metropolitan authorities that a national agreement among parents staff governors local education authorities other providers and central government would <e>", "<cs> my lords after years it is right that the basic legislative framework of our education system should be reviewed <e> <s> the bill presently before the house i too am grateful to the noble baroness for her introduction signifies the decision of the government that the present situation demands a new radical act that will restructure the education system <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down perhaps i may raise a point with him <e> <s> i think he said in his speech that i stated that with the amendments which are to come in the bill the situation will be as it was at the time of the act <e> <s> in fact that is not so <e> <s> there were significant changes in that as broadcast by the minister first the standing conferences will be mandatory <e> <s> secondly they will be subject to review which will be required <e> <s> thirdly the complaints procedure will be extended in this sphere <e> <s> i do not for a moment say that the church has not done all it could but i believe that the provisions which are now being made will enable the church to take a much more vigorous part than it has been able to take in the past <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for intervening again but before the noble earl sits down perhaps i could say in fairness to the secretary of state that i was at the meeting after which the statement was made <e> <s> in that context it was quite clear that in the words he used settlement referred to what we were talking about earlier that is religious education in schools <e> <s> i think i am right in saying that at the time there was no suggestion that a settlement had been reached over opting out or anything else like that <e> <s> i think that should be said in fairness to the secretary of state because it is not accurate to apply his term settlement to the whole range of voluntary schools within the context of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may associate those on these benches with what has been said and assure sir john of our prayers for a speedy recovery <e>", "<cs> with respect i suggest that if the noble lord is going to ask questions that i assume he wishes to be taken seriously he must realise that they are incapable of being given a simple yes or no answer or one of a few words <e> <s> i ask him to show some respect to those who have a religious belief and not to try to rubbish it <e> <s> i shall be perfectly prepared to answer many of the observations that he has made <e> <s> however to subject us to a series of questions of this kind that he knows are impossible to answer i believe is showing disrespect to this committee <e>", "<cs> i am sorry but the noble lord has asked a great many questions already <e> <s> i do not refer to the last two or three but many before that <e> <s> i suggest that the discussion of an amendment at the committee stage of a bill is not the time to have a philosophical discussion <e>", "<cs> the point of a committee stage of a bill is precisely so that people may ask questions to which they expect answers <e> <s> that is precisely what i expect to have to do <e> <s> but these are not the questions which it is either reasonable or necessary to expect to be answered in a debate on this amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may draw the attention of the noble lord to clause which states that the purpose of the bill is to promote <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to those who have taken part in the debate on the amendment <e> <s> i very much appreciate the support that the committee has given to it <e> <s> in view of the time i should like to confine my answers to the four or five <e>", "<cs> i should like to say a few words as the mover of amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i had not appreciated that my amendment would have that effect <e> <s> however i must say that i was in danger of suffering precisely the same effect earlier today <e> <s> if amendment no <e> <s> had been carried i should have been precluded from moving an amendment which i had agreed with the government with the intention of including religious education in the national curriculum <e> <s> i would have been prevented from doing that so those who are affected by my amendment no <e> <s> are therefore not alone in suffering the effects of pre-emption <e>", "<cs> may i point out that in the text of amendment no <e> <s> which was passed the words and other foundation still remain in the text <e> <s> i therefore see no reason why the amendment should not be considered on report because they remain there <e> <s> it is not quite the same with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> however it would certainly be possible for amendment no <e> <s> to be dealt with because those words are still in the revised text <e>", "<cs> as i have already said i have very great sympathy with the amendment proposed by the noble baroness lady cox <e> <s> i have been accused of a good many things in my life but i can immodestly say that i do not think that i have ever been accused of lack of conviction or orthodoxy <e> <s> it may therefore be convenient if i make some response from these benches to this amendment <e>", "<cs> i shall reply to that point <e> <s> i forgot to turn over my notes earlier and there is one point which i think the noble lord lord elton will ask me so perhaps i could anticipate him <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may reply to the noble lord <e> <s> i shall try to give more time for consultation before report than we have had for some documents for consultation in connection with the bill <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment of the noble duke the duke of norfolk <e> <s> i shall be very brief but i hope that the brevity of my remarks will not be taken as being in proportion to my concern which is very considerable <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful first of all for what the noble lord lord morton of shuna has just said <e> <s> i hope in what i have to say that i shall not appear to be in any way unsympathetic to those who wish to ensure that a proper christian education in provided <e> <s> however the issue is not quite as simple as it has been made out to be <e> <s> it is necessary for us to realise that we must strike a balance between compulsion on one side which i think we all agree is not what we are seeking and the comparative religion approach on the other which does not teach anything about religion or religious experience <e> <s> we have to strike a balance between the two <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness said that i gave historical reasons <e> <s> i do not think that that is quite accurate <e> <s> my point would be and i must say this that if we removed this veto does the noble baroness really want the situation where christians are trying to ensure that a good christian agreed syllabus is taught in the schools without the agreement of the authority the teachers and others <e> <s> i feel that this is something i would not wish to contemplate <e>", "<cs> i should like to welcome this amendment on behalf of the churches and also to welcome the eagerness with which the noble baroness sought to put it forward <e> <s> it seems to me that this amendment is not only right in the letter but also reflects the spirit of the dual system which we wish to see continued and which we have been at such pains to maintain <e> <s> i hope this amendment will be accepted <e> <s> it has the support of the churches with whom we have discussed it <e>", "<cs> i speak only as one who has been occupied in working the dual system that we have had over the years in the church of england <e> <s> the church of england has always sought to maintain the principle that we are not there purely for our own denomination but as part of the overall provision of education by the community <e> <s> we have therefore never sought to restrict our admissions in any narrow way <e> <s> certainly we have experienced in recent years the pressure to admit those of other faiths as was mentioned very often on the ground that a church of england school provides certain religious characteristics which cannot always be found in county schools <e>", "<cs> in supporting this amendment i hope that it brings us to face in reality the situation concerning the supply of governors <e> <s> we have heard a great deal this evening about the additional powers which will be laid upon governors both in financial delegation and in other respects in running schools <e> <s> i welcome those without reservation <e> <s> but i have doubts as to whether sufficient attention has been paid to the supply of governors <e>", "<cs> in that case perhaps i may continue to speak to amendment no <e> <s> a <e> <s> when we come to amendment no <e> <s> a i find it quite astonishing that i should have to move this simple and straightforward amendment <e> <s> whatever is the committees view on grant-maintained schools i believe it is agreed on all sides of the committee that this represents a major change in our educational system <e> <s> it introduces a new partner into the whole operation of schools <e> <s> it seems to me quite extraordinary that such a proposal should be allowed <e>", "<cs> it will not come as a surprise to the committee to know that i am very disappointed with the answer which we have just received from the minister <e> <s> i find it extraordinary that on what seems to be such a straightforward matter we should have had such a barrage trying to convince us that we are all wrong <e>", "<cs> as the minister has said the amendments have arisen out of approaches made by the churches to the government <e> <s> we very much appreciate them <e> <s> i entirely agree with the minister that they maintain a link between church and school <e> <s> however from our point of view there is the problem that they do not maintain the link between church school and the authority <e> <s> however in so far as the grant-maintained schools are here we are grateful for the amendments <e> <s> i hope the committee will support them <e>", "<cs> in welcoming these amendments from the point of view of the church of england i think it would be helpful for the subsequent debate in this committee if i indicated why there may appear to be a difference of opinion between ourselves and the peers who were speaking on behalf of the roman catholic church <e> <s> as regards the church of england the word trustees does not mean the same as it means for the roman catholic church <e> <s> in our case trustees are local bodies merely representing the individual schools <e> <s> we are well content and pleased that they should be consulted <e>", "<cs> below pupils a school cannot seek grant-maintained status <e> <s> if for reasons beyond the schools control the numbers steadily decline does the noble lord envisage that we shall have small grant-maintained schools in an area <e> <s>

something else about it <e> <s> i do not see what is provided unless the government are content to have small grant-aided schools because of the position that has arisen <e>", "<cs> i very much appreciate the concern for worship in our schools which the amendments demonstrate <e> <s> the bill covers religious education and one cannot give religious education by instruction only worship is an integral part of it <e> <s> to try to give religious education merely by instruction would be rather like trying to teach science without allowing anyone to go to the laboratory and handle materials

been a matter of dispute so far in any of the discussions we have had <e> <s> the question of how it should be included is the crux of the problem <e>", "<cs> is the noble baroness referring to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> the first one amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> first there is the question of the unity of the school <e> <s> this has to be gone into <e> <s> i am not giving anything away i am simply saying that the problem is how we relate the responsibility for the school worshipping as such to the needs which are met in amendment no <e> <s> for individual worship <e> <s> does one want the school fragmented <e> <s> is that the way to go about it <e> <s> how is it to be organsied <e> <s> these are practical problems <e> <s> if one says only that the worship can be christian one takes no account of a situation that must be taken into account if one is to be able to relate the christian worship to the school in which it takes place <e> <s> let me take that as one example of the kind of problem that has to be faced <e> <s> if we are to include the word christian it must be in a workable way that takes account of those who will be involved <e> <s> that is what we seek to do <e> <s> to insert the word christian by itself not only would not have the result that we expect but would create difficulties in the future and in the long run if it is done without the kind of consideration that i have outlined would not improve the quality of worship in the schools <e>", "<cs> i really feel rather desperate at the moment <e> <s> what i am being told frankly is that i am barely a christian because i will not support one particular way of going about this <e> <s> frankly i find that really appalling <e> <s> life would have been a lot easier for me if i had followed some mishmash if i had not stood out over the years for this that and the other <e> <s> i am still doing so and am very unpopular at times for it <e> <s> life would have been much easier for me <e> <s> i should have avoided much criticism and acquired popularity <e> <s> but i have not done that <e> <s> therefore i think i can take it because i am not somebody who seeks to dilute the christian faith <e> <s> but i am not prepared <e> <s> when i look at our schools i say <e>", "<cs> i must ask the committee not to take heed of that remark <e> <s> at the moment i am much encouraged <e> <s> i have always said that if one takes one action such as this in isolation without looking at all the other aspects together one would feel almost bound to withdraw all the undertakings i have given <e> <s> i feel almost as strongly as that <e>", "<cs> that is why i am made to feel that i am not really a christian <e> <s> i am not standing <e>", "<cs> this is not nonsense it is precisely the issue <e> <s> we are being told that only those who wish to adopt a particular view in this matter can justify the title of standing with the christian faith <e> <s> i believe that that is intolerable <e>", "<cs> i had not intended to speak this afternoon or at least not to speak until later in the debate <e> <s> however i think it might be helpful to the committee if i briefly state one or two points <e> <s> on more than one occasion i have given an undertaking to the committee that at report stage i shall bring back proposals which will deal both with religious instruction and with worship <e> <s> in fact i have gone even further i have said that i shall do my best to ensure that such proposals provide for the word christian to be on the face of the bill both in respect of the teaching and the worship <e> <s> i hold myself wholeheartedly to those undertakings <e>", "<cs> will the noble viscount kindly give way <e> <s> i have made it abundantly clear that the intention behind the proposal that i will bring back on report is that the word christian should be on the face of the bill and should apply to instruction and to worship <e> <s> i have said that repeatedly in this place <e> <s> i do not wish there to be any doubt about that <e>", "<cs> i should just like to make one point <e> <s> it will not take a moment <e> <s> if it were possible which it is not for the committee to lay down a principle which would guide our discussions that would be what we would want <e> <s> that is not what the amendment proposes <e> <s> the amendment is much more precise and much more committed than merely stating a principle which i think we all accept is our guide in our negotiations <e>", "<cs> i should like to welcome the government amendments <e> <s> in large measure they are as a result of correspondence between officials in the department the charity commissioners and legal advisers of the church of england <e> <s> i am sure that the committee will appreciate that the long list of amendments attempts to deal with some complicated matters <e> <s> we are still examining some of the amendments to make certain that they deal with the difficulties which have been experienced particularly amendment no <e> <s> za <e> <s> with regard to amendment no <e> <s> zc which relates to the act i know that some dioceses would like more flexibility in respect of controlled schools <e> <s> we should like to look at the amendments carefully and if necessary come back <e> <s> however in the meantime i welcome these amendments and we are grateful to the government for bringing them forward <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may first welcome the assurances which have been given by the minister <e> <s> i have heard what she has said with encouragement and i mean that <e> <s> however i still have grave reservations about the procedure <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> i shall start now because it is rather an important quotation <e> <s> as i have no doubt the noble and learned lord lord hailsham will remember immediately one of the articles speaks about the infection which doth remain in them that are regenerated <e> <s> that is a very salutary point to have in mind because it reminds us that any system any government has to be operated by fallible people like you and me <e> <s> therefore to rely wholly on voluntary co-operation often does not produce the required results <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for what the noble baroness lady faithfull says but i can assure her that this school uses the service a great deal perhaps too much at the expense of others <e> <s> but certainly it is used if not perhaps as widely as it should be <e>", "<cs> i did not intend to intervene but i really must resist the suggestion which the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter made that the purpose of the amendment so far as i am concerned is to prevent it ever happening <e> <s> that is not true <e> <s> this is not a move to stop ilea being reformed being broken up <e> <s> this is why i do not believe it involves delay <e> <s> i do not accept the noble lords logic on that point <e> <s> if the amendment were to give the retention of ilea as one of the options then i believe his arguments would hold <e> <s> that is not what the amendment says <e> <s> that is why i cannot accept his logic on this point <e> <s> it is not intended so far as i am concerned to say that this is a way of stopping ilea ever being abolished <e>", "<cs> the minister spoke about the reforms which had been produced in an attempt to affect ilea <e> <s> i should like to ask the minister whether he will accept that from to all but one of the relevant reports reports from royal commissions and other bodies such as the one that produced the marshall report advocated a unitary authority quite independently of whether or not ilea should continue to exist <e> <s> the exception was a report produced by mr baker who was then a back-bench mp <e> <s> that report advocated devolution to the boroughs <e> <s> from to all the other reports maintained that a unitary authority should be retained in some form or other <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to express my gratitude to all those who have taken part in this debate and my very warm appreciation of the spirit which has been evident in it <e> <s> there is need for me at this stage to comment on only one matter which is the phrase in the main which clearly has concerned a number of noble lords <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first say that there is one part of this amendment which i welcome wholeheartedly that is subsection which relates to the spirit of tolerance and other matters <e> <s> i should not wish that welcome to be obscured <e> <s> secondly i wish to make the point that i do not think it is fair of the noble lord lord campbell of alloway to say that the reason for our difficulties such as they are is the groupings <e> <s> i think they are simply due to the way we have had to handle this whole thing <e> <s> i ask your lordships to realise that it is perhaps little more than a month since i was asked to perform this operation <e> <s> when one thinks that there was consultation and discussion for nearly three years before the settlement i am astonished that i have actually arrived here with something as coherent as this <e>", "<cs> my lords i really must insist that the noble lord has quite misrepresented what i said in winding up <e> <s> i do not have the text because that is not yet available but i think that if he will look at it it will be made quite clear that i was suggesting nothing of the sort <e> <s> i was simply making the point that under my amendments one will not be in a position to look at every individual place and say that here is x per cent <e> <s> christian and <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be as brief as i can <e> <s> i wish to make a technical point as it were about the actual amendment before us amendment no <e> <s> a <e> <s> the noble lord lord <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to the noble lord it is his amendment that i am talking to <e> <s> that phrase occurs in line and it is in the place which i have just described <e>", "<cs> my lords i am looking at subsection line which is exactly as i have read it if the marshalled list is accurate <e> <s> it has the effect of requiring an act of christian worship in every jewish aided school <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not looking at the wrong clause <e> <s> what i am saying is that this is totally inconsistent <e> <s> if the amendment is passed it will make absolute nonsense of everything else that follows in this part of the bill <e> <s> having said that i am not standing on a technicality <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i can answer this fairly simply <e> <s> the purpose of this the original cooper-temple clause was to prevent what in those days was called denominational teaching in the sense of one particular christian church or denomination at that time <e> <s> the old cry no denominational teaching on the rates was a characteristic of that period <e> <s> that is the intention behind this and that intention still remains <e>", "<cs> my lords i must confess that i am disappointed at the response of the minister <e> <s> i shall not take up your lordships time for very long but i should like to make two points <e> <s> first i think that what the noble baroness said does not reflect the situation on the ground <e> <s> to compare in our case the local education authority the governors and the trustees as if they were all the same is simply not relevant <e> <s> the trustees in some cases can be say a couple of local farmers some distance away whose ancestors happened to give the land <e> <s> this is not remotely comparable to the trustees in the roman catholic sense <e> <s> the comparable body there is the diocesan education committee <e> <s> we have been given many assurances that voluntary schools will not in any way cease to be church schools should they require grant-maintained status and i do not find it easy to reconcile that assurance with the line that is being taken here <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for not being present when the minister was speaking <e> <s> i welcome this amendment which meets our problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i have great sympathy with the noble lord lord renton over the matter of timing <e> <s> as i have said before we would have much preferred the whole question of what one might call the religious settlement to have been worked out before the bill came to the house but that was not to be <e> <s> we have had to do what we can in the circumstances before us <e> <s> we have done our best in very difficult circumstances <e> <s> since last week we have been working extremely hard in our consultations <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to be able to tell the noble lord that i hope to be in a position to do so perhaps i may add after consultation with the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his sympathy <e> <s> indeed i think that i may perhaps deserve it more than he realises in that next tuesday is not only the third reading of the bill but it is also a session of the general synod of the church of england on a particular and constant problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for her assurances in the light of which i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may associate those who sit on these benches with what has already been said and express our appreciation of the arrangements which have been made and of the exhibition which has been provided <e>", "<cs> my lords may i on behalf of these benches express our deep sorrow at this tragic disaster and assure all those who have suffered in any way of our sympathy and our prayers <e> <s> i wish also to express our very great appreciation of those who responded through the emergency services and our admiration of their great courage and skill <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much appreciate the invitation from the noble earl lord halsbury and i am glad to be able to accept <e> <s> i shall if i may first present my case and then speak specifically to the amendment tabled in the noble earls name <e> <s> i shall speak also to amendments nos <e> <s> to and <e> <s> i fear that i shall take a little time but i think that what i have to say falls within the categories of what is proper for third reading as we were reminded by the noble lord the chief whip earlier today <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to say one thing to the noble lord lord glenamara which is simply that it was precisely because of the importance of the teachers that we took particular care in our consultations to consult them <e> <s> it is with their goodwill that these amendments will go forward <e> <s> i do not minimise the difficulties of which the noble lord has spoken but they certainly have the goodwill of the teaching profession <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have already indicated i entirely agree with the sentiments of this amendment <e> <s> i said so in my speech earlier <e> <s> i think that it is merely a matter for the house to decide whether or not it wishes the assurances to be enough and for the matter to be included in a circular or whether it wishes to see it enshrined in the bill itself <e> <s> i do not think that i would wish to say more than that <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the way in which the government have moved in this matter <e> <s> however not all the points made by the supporters of my original amendment have been met as a result of the action taken in another place <e> <s> the question for me is have enough points been met to make it unwise for your lordships house to continue to press the matter <e> <s> i shall identify the main points on which there has been movement <e>", "<cs> my lords as did the noble earl lord limerick i too have to declare an interest as a member of the polytechnics and colleges funding council <e> <s> of course i do not speak in any way in this house on its behalf although i assure him and your lordships that what is said here will be carefully studied by the members of that council <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down perhaps i may ask him whether he is aware that at the last meeting of the polytechnics and colleges funding council it made clear that it was not its role to approve strategic plans that was a matter for the governing body and this fact was made public after that meeting <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to express my appreciation for the opportunity to debate the issue of homelessness especially in central london provided by the noble lord lord ross of newport <e> <s> i shall not spend time emphasising the urgency and gravity of the situation because reference has already been made to that in most eloquent terms <e> <s> however i should just say that this is a problem of which i am particularly aware <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness sits down <e>", "<cs> following what the noble earl has said i should like to make one general point <e> <s> it is true as he says that there are many situations in human life where we are involved in a process <e> <s> the taking of any point in that process is to some extent an arbitrary matter <e> <s> in considering the bill we are not involved in making scientific <e>", "<cs> i suspect that for many members of the committee as well as for myself this is one of the most difficult decisions that we have ever been called upon to make <e> <s> it is certainly one of the most difficult i have been called upon to make during my time as a member of this chamber <e> <s> on the one hand we are moved by compassion and properly so <e> <s> some of us are moved by compassion not through personal experience in our own families but through ministering to many handicapped people throughout our pastoral ministry <e> <s> but on the other hand i hope that we are also moved by a concern for the extension of knowledge as that is a proper human activity <e> <s> yet as regards voting on this amendment i have a profound concern which i must confess was not wholly or largely relieved by the words of the noble and learned lord lord hailsham <e>", "<cs> my fear is that before too long we shall have legislation extending the -day period <e> <s> such developments have been stated in regard to previous legislation <e> <s> i am trying to be realistic <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to express my support for the amendment moved by the noble lord lord jakobovits <e> <s> i also wish to endorse the arguments he put forward <e> <s> unlike the noble lord i voted against the provisions for research while the bill was in committee <e> <s> i did so for precisely the reasons which prevented him from voting at all narnely that the provisions were far too extensive <e> <s> therefore i was told that the right thing to do at that stage was to vote against them <e>", "<cs> i should like to say something regarding amendment no <e> <s> on the role and place of advisory committees without involving the religious element contained in the later amendments <e> <s> perhaps i may be allowed to say a few words on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i am aware that it is a probing amendment <e>", "<cs> under what power does the noble earl lord halsbury suppose that crac could have banned items had it wanted to <e>", "<cs> the noble earl said that i was lured into being chairman of crac for five <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like briefly to comment upon the argument recently set forth by the noble lord lord ennals <e> <s> he suggested that we were debating issues which we had thoroughly debated before which had been decided and passed to another place <e> <s> i suggest that we are looking at a different issue <e> <s> we are looking at an issue which has been brought to our attention and presented to us by the amendments made in another place and which we are considering today <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not raised the question of the mothers health at all <e> <s> i do not want to be anecdotal in any way <e> <s> i could speak at some length of godchildren and friends of mine who are gravely handicapped yet who are doing marvellous work in our society <e> <s> i do not want to be anecdotal <e> <s> i am simply asking where the presumption lies on which side of the issue <e>"]
