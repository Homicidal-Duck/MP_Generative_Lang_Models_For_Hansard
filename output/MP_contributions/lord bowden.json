["<cs> my lords may i too welcome this decision taken by the government and remark that it has been very much welcomed by an enormous number of women <e>", "<cs> is the minister aware of the fact that almost every womens organisation from the womens institute to the inner wheel i could enumerate them but i will not have all earnestly besought the government to keep the hospital in being so as to provide opportunities for women to be treated by <e>", "<cs> my lords the hour is late i must be brief and i should like to confine my remarks to one major topic <e> <s> first of all i must congratulate the noble lord lord miles on his perfectly splendid maiden speech <e> <s> i hope that he produces many more of the same kind that we can all enjoy and that will teach us all so much <e> <s> the point i want to discuss is one which was made by the chancellor in his speech and has not been referred to so far this evening by any one <e> <s> it is that in consultation with the accountancy profession he proposes to try to devise a system of taxation which will make due allowance for inflation <e> <s> in other words he is apparently going <e>", "<cs> my lords in the first place it is true that this matter of borrowing money is important <e> <s> having quoted ici from memory my impression is that in their adjusted accounts the largest single item of profit was due to borrowing money at a time when the rate of inflation was greater than the nominal bank charges <e> <s> it seems to me insane that the largest chemical plant in england <e>", "<cs> my lords it has rarely fallen to any man to have a more difficult task than to follow the noble earl who has just sat down so i think i had better confine my remarks to one particular topic <e> <s> i want to remind your lordships that when we speak of our own nuclear programme and even of the programme of europe we should remember that it is only a pale reflection of the enormously bigger programme in the united states <e> <s> nearly all the worlds nuclear power stations are either in america or were built by americans and sold abroad or have been built in europe to american designs <e> <s> it is extremely important therefore to realise that the industry which was probably the biggest of its kind ever to have existed in the history of the world has suddenly and almost completely collapsed in the last three or four years <e> <s> in i think i am right in saying something like nuclear power stations were ordered <e> <s> last year the scale on my graph is so small i cannot tell whether it was one or two <e> <s> this is a most dramatic collapse and i think it acutely important that we should realise that the troubles which beset us and our commercial opportunities in the nuclear reactor business are all determined by the vast growth and the totally unprecedented collapse of the american industry which we have observed in the last couple of decades <e>", "<cs> it is my lords but normally it is burned in breeders and that is what the breeders are for <e> <s> if one has read dr marshalls paper one will have found that he advocated the use of breeders to get rid of the plutonium which otherwise becomes an embarrassment <e>", "<cs> my lords it has been properly reported in the press that before long cargoes of plutonium will be going on their way from dounreay to windscale <e> <s> the prospect of a disaster due to some marine catastrophe concerning a cargo of plutonium is probably much more dangerous than even the worst oil spillage <e> <s> when the government committee considers this problem could i ask that it makes appropriate arrangements for these ships in their right of passage as well <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government not aware of the fact that there has been neglect not only of the insulation but of what one might call the standards of construction of buildings which is just as important <e> <s> i speak if i may be allowed to as one who has been much concerned with the building of a university and we are always under constant pressure to downgrade the standards of original construction with the result that the cost of the maintenance of the buildings is very dramatically increased <e> <s> this is true of insulation and it is just <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the government simplify their problems enormously if the legislation in the finance act were not so extraordinarily obscure <e> <s> at the moment the two most rapidly growing industries in the country seem to be the increase in accountants who try to discover possibly how to evade or avoid the tax which is imposed by equally clever accountants trying by more and more sophisticated techniques to complicate the whole problem <e> <s> it seems to me that this is a battle in which no one gains and some of the ablest men in the country devote their time to it <e> <s> some of the results have been quite extraordinary <e> <s> perhaps can illustrate very quickly <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble lord heard of a case in which the house of lords sat in its judicial capacity for four or five days debating the meaning of three words in the act <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder if i may change the theme of our discourse for a moment and discuss not so much the problem of curing inflation as the problem of surviving it until we can cure it <e> <s> i should like to begin if i may by commenting briefly on the ambition which was enunciated by the noble lord lord cockfield of reducing public expenditure <e> <s> i believe that great confusion is being caused by failing to distinguish between different types of public expenditure in particular i believe it has not been fully considered that there is a great difference between the gross cost of certain items of public expenditure and their net cost <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord very much for that information i have been looking everywhere for it <e>", "<cs> it is there my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the hour is indeed very late <e> <s> some time ago i went to china and when i was there a chinese sage said to me with great feeling that in his experience the brain could continue to absorb only for as long as the seat can endure <e> <s> with that as a background i shall be very brief indeed <e> <s> this has been an extremely informative most helpful and useful debate <e> <s> the report itself is a very great state document and although it is slightly unusual to say this i believe that the author is within earshot and it is therefore appropriate that i should mention the fact in the hope that he will overhear it <e> <s> i should like to thank the noble lord lord gregson for introducing the subject to us and add my congratulations to our two maiden speakers <e> <s> the noble lord lord scanlon was once a member of my council and i made him negotiate with the trade unions <e> <s> he gave them the worst time that any man ever gave trade unions in history because all the tricks they knew he had taught them for he had learned the counters and they had not <e>", "<cs> my lords before the <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to confess to your lordships that i cannot go along at all with most of the arguments which have been so far presented for fast breeder reactors <e> <s> i have read for example the ford foundations analysis of the fast breeder reactor programme in the united states <e> <s> they analysed the case very thoroughly and pointed out that the case for a fast breeder depends entirely on the economics of the situation <e> <s> no one can be found to deny that a fast breeder reactor will cost very much more than a conventional type <e> <s> the ratio has been variously estimated as five times <e> <s> the germans found their own estimated cost has escalated times since they first started on the work <e> <s> what the ratio is one cannot say <e> <s> the possibility of competing at all with the type of reactor that we have depends entirely on the advantage which is ultimately to be obtained we think if the price of uranium rises dramatically <e>", "<cs> my lords it will be difficult for me to follow that speech by my noble friend lord davies of leek and at the outset i want to return to the original motion <e> <s> we are criticising the government and i wish to criticise them as i have on previous occasions in this house not so much for their failure to cure inflation which will be an extraordinarily difficult thing to do anyway but for their failure to cope with some of what one might call the by-products of inflation which have of themselves been extraordinarily dangerous to the community at large <e> <s> in fact i have often thought that some of the remedies have had effects far worse than the disease <e> <s> i ant reminded that when king charles ii was dying his doctors bled him blistered him gave him purgatives applied leeches to <e>", "<cs> my lords may i add my voice to those who have thanked the noble lord who initiated this debate thus allowing us to discuss this important subject this afternoon <e> <s> there can be few if any men in the world more fitted to introduce a debate such as this <e> <s> he came to this country impoverished with nothing but his genius <e> <s> he created industries and made districts of england which might otherwise have been impoverished at this moment relatively well off <e> <s> i think that the country as a whole is greatly indebted to the noble lord for the work he has done just as this house is indebted to him for allowing us to debate the subject this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i could not understand it and i would be awfully grateful if the noble viscount who is to wind up would say quite simply we are to tax on historic costs or we are to tax on inflation accounting profits <e> <s> it is a simple question and a simple answer <e> <s> i may mention too that the eec has published a complicated document on the nature of <e>", "<cs> my lords if the minister is about to publish figures for the relative price of gas could he similarly include those for electricity <e> <s> the figures that i have recently seen suggest that the cost of electricity in this country is three times as great as it is in any large industrial city in america with the sole exception of new york city itself <e> <s> furthermore will he itemise the differential between the cost to domestic consumers and to commercial consumers <e> <s> in most countries in europe i believe that the price is in favour of industry in this country it is in favour of the domestic consumer <e>", "<cs> my lords despite the ministers disinterest in the law of england is he aware of the fact that the surcharge in england on power is about the same as in the western islands <e> <s> in other words we pay per cent more per kilowatt here than is paid north of the border <e> <s> is it possible that some other members of the government might take an interest in that rather remarkable fact <e>", "<cs> may i follow briefly what has just been said <e> <s> i want to concern myself not only with the serious problem of derelict land in the whole of the north-west but a problem even more alarming and potentially much more expensive the problem of dereliction underground which is always apt to be forgotten <e> <s> i refer to the basic problem of maintaining in something like working order the whole of the infrastructure on which civilised living depends <e> <s> i refer to the roads particularly to the sewers to the water supply and to all the other basic amenities of life <e> <s> the problem of derelict land has become notorious over the years <e> <s> the noble lord who is sitting behind the minister debated this subject with me about or years ago <e> <s> at my request he went to see some of it and was shocked to find how bad it was <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord rises to that bait may i ask him whether he could include in his reply some assessment of the problem of combining the repair of the dereliction underground with the maintenance of the main roads <e> <s> inevitably the two have to be dealt with at the same time <e> <s> on the <e>", "<cs> my lords before we finally withdraw the amendment i should like to ask the minister whether he is in a position to give me any more assurance than he did when we discussed this question of disastrous collapses of main sewers <e> <s> since i spoke a week ago another large hole has appeared in deansgate in manchester <e> <s> the size i should suspect is about half the size of this chamber <e> <s> it is an enormous piece of work <e> <s> the problem is not so much that it is an emergency not so much that the work must be done if the city is to survive but that the total cost of the work may grotesquely exceed any reasonable provision the city may have made to carry it out <e>", "<cs> my lords when considering the problem of reasonably foreseeing surely all these things could be reasonably foreseen but the problem is always one of priorities <e> <s> some works have to be neglected because others have to be done and it is never possible to discover which should be done first until long after the event <e> <s> so i do not believe that the phrase reasonably have been foreseen is a sensible criterion bearing in mind that so much could be foreseen but so much has to be neglected for lack of available resources <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make one small observation <e> <s> i myself was responsible for an organisation which by comparison to those which have been mentioned was very small nevertheless from my own point of view it was a very important part of the university of which i was in control at one time <e> <s> the point which bore itself on me time after time was the appalling complexity involved in making realistic comparisons between costs of work done in different ways <e> <s> if one had a works department one had to carry the overhead costs of it whether it was being employed or not <e> <s> very often it is more important in the interests of the efficiency of the work that the date at which the work begins should be convenient rather than that the actual total cost of the measured work should be low <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord in his list of things which will be done in these areas very significantly excluded what i call the retail trade <e> <s> am i to assume that there will be no normal outlets of that type in any of these establishments <e>", "<cs> my lords without widening too much the scope of the question can the minister tell us the position regarding the balance of payments <e> <s> in other words by how much has the increase in imports from these countries increased and what has been the effect on our balance of payments overseas of the trade with the eec countries <e>", "<cs> my lords the hour is late and much of what i had hoped to say has already been said far more authoritatively and eloquently than i could myself hope to say it <e> <s> i was particularly grateful to the noble lord lord crowther-hunt for introducing this debate to us particularly because parts of his speech i recognised as almost exactly the same as the evidence which i gave to lord robbins committee when it met nearly years ago <e> <s> many parts of this subject we are discussing have hardly changed in a very long time <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i could add a little to what has been said <e> <s> i should like to ask this specific question <e> <s> how are the accounts of the organisation to be presented <e> <s> the reason why i raise this point is that for many years the post office survived and is with us to this day because the accounts were drawn up in what we now realise was a wholly irregular way <e> <s> i think it is perhaps worth while to recount this story for the benefit of those who may not have heard it <e> <s> in the accountant to the post office which was then under the control of the government inserted an item in the accounts to provide half a million pounds towards the maintenance of capital <e> <s> this item was kept in the accounts because accountants are conservative men and two years ago when i heard this story from sir william barlow it amounted to million and was approximately equal to the declared profits of the post office as a whole in that year <e>", "<cs> may i raise a comparable question not about the political refugees but about the kind of migrant worker who is much more common in europe than here <e> <s> it is notorious that mercedes cars are built by turks and that the whole of the swiss building industry is run by italians <e> <s> these people move from place to place in search of work and in search of livelihood <e> <s> they often find themselves deprived of any form of civil rights <e> <s> as i understand it they have no opportunity to become citizens themselves <e> <s> they have no rights under the law except the very crudest and if there is any form of unemployment they will be sent home <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just ask the noble lord the minister whether it is possible to obtain any help from the experience of the armed services <e> <s> on the rare occasions when i have been driven by an official army driver my experience has been that the driver has insisted on the wearing of a seat belt by both himself and the front seat passengers <e> <s> this has been the practice for several years and i wonder whether there are any statistics available relating to accidents involving service vehicles and whether any experience has been gained in the relative merits of seat belt designs <e>", "<cs> may we pause for a moment to remember what i believe to have been the best system of this kind that this country has ever had because i think that we can learn a great deal from its achievements and from its tragic decline <e> <s> i am referring to the extremely elaborate system of training at all levels from the craftsman to the university graduate which used to be at trafford park at metropolitan vickers <e> <s> until about or so it was true to say that almost all the best engineers in england those for example who graduated at lord bakers school in cambridge went if they could to serve their time as apprentices at trafford park <e> <s> they were the topmost echelon <e> <s> we used to have a saying that all the best engineers could be divided into two categories those who worked at metropolitan vickers and those who used to work there <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy that we have this opportunity thanks to the noble baroness to discuss this subject this evening <e> <s> i want to take a rather unfamiliar line and i want to begin by saying i am sure i can say it with great confidence that this country has never yet in its history taken education seriously or done as much for its young people as most of the countries in europe <e>", "<cs> my lords the hour is late and so much has been said that i must confine myself to one or two points only and not attempt to cover the subject as a whole <e> <s> first i should like if i may to follow up a point which was made about the city university namely the great and unknown cost of paying off those staff who are to be made redundant <e> <s> i should like to ask a specific question of the minister who is to reply <e> <s> the cost has always been wrapped in mystery and when the noble baroness who was sitting on the front bench opposite a moment ago replied for the government on a previous occasion she said it could not be disclosed until the courts had decided in more detail how much would be available and how much would be needed <e>", "<cs> my lords the hour is indeed very late <e> <s> the best thing i can do for your lordships is to recount only briefly the way in which the ophthalmic opticians have developed and become professional men in the last years <e> <s> a great deal of the history was made in manchester and not a little of it in my office <e> <s> for many years my institute trained people to go into ophthalmic optics by giving them a two-year course which led to a diploma <e> <s> about or more years ago we decided that the time had come to improve the education of these people <e>", "<cs> my lords as there are nearly half a million unemployed workers in the structural and civil engineering industry may i ask whether the figures which the minister gave for total expenditure have made appropriate allowance for the savings which would flow were those people no longer on the dole but properly in work <e> <s> it seems to me that if the figures were so adjusted they would dramatically decline <e> <s> secondly the minister will recall the last time i discussed in this house the question of the main sewage system in fact the whole infrastructure of the city of manchester which is fast decaying <e> <s> he may recall that when i told him of the enormous expense he said it was a mind-boggling situation <e> <s> does he not realise that to the average motorist <e>", "<cs> i was about to ask the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i was just coming to the question my lords <e> <s> does the noble lord realise that to the average motorist the thought that the ministers mind has been boggled is of itself of no very great importance <e>", "<cs> you were an english peasant <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to begin by thanking the noble lord lord rhodes for initiating this debate and making it possible for us to discuss what is a remarkable and important subject <e> <s> particularly i wish to express my thanks and i am sure the thanks of the whole house to the noble lord lord kadoorie for the wonderful account he gave us of the achievements of hong kong of which he is such an important citizen <e> <s> we in this house are privileged to have him among us <e> <s> we welcome him whenever he cares to come to see us and we realise the enormous influence he has in his home country and the tremendous help he has given to the fostering of trade between hong kong and this country <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord kings norton who was to have spoken next has most unexpectedly had to leave the chamber and has asked me to speak in his stead <e> <s> first i should like to thank the noble earl lord halsbury for initiating this debate which has led to the profoundly important speeches which have already been made in this house <e> <s> i was tremendously impressed by the speech of the noble lord lord hinton of bankside if he will allow me to say so under whose lash the best reactors in this country were built <e> <s> nothing to compare with the achievements of the noble lord lord hinton can be found anywhere in this country <e> <s> we owe him a great deal and it is wonderful to see him restored to health and contributing once more to a debate on this theme <e>", "<cs> my lords the hour is late and there seems to be so little left of lord bellwins bill that i think the best thing i can do is to tell your lordships about the extraordinary urgency of some of the tasks which will have to be undertaken when the bill either this one or some other has been enacted in order to cope with the problems of the collapse of the main streets of some of the northern cities into the sewers which are fast decaying <e> <s> i have discussed this subject in your lordships house before but it is worth reminding the house of the full horror of what has happened in the north-west <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government not aware of the fact that the ophthalmic opticians in this country have a much better education than others are far better trained and have almost unique opportunities not available in any other country i know of for study with medical supervision in an eye hospital <e> <s> is the noble lord further aware that this reform which has been brought about since the war has transformed the profession and it should be a source of pride to this country instead of a matter for carping criticism <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first of all perhaps in my capacity as a sometime head of a university which is much concerned with the education of foreign students say how warmly i welcome this statement and how much good i am sure the programme will do <e> <s> may i remind the house that on one of the first occasions on which this particular topic was discussed many years ago i found myself as it were crossing swords with the noble lord lord gladwyn who was in favour of a similar proposal because i said that it is acutely important that we remember that our first duty is to the education of our own students our own citizens the children of our own people many of whom find themselves unable to attend university these days unless their parents are either very poor or <e>", "<cs> my lords may i begin by saying how very much i welcome the new proposal which has been put forward <e> <s> i should like very briefly to refer to one particular problem which the new system seems likely to pose to the institution over which i once presided <e> <s> in manchester we have always had a very powerful and long-lived tradition of welcoming foreign students <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl sits down may i ask him whether when a plant of this kind is built and is privately owned there is any obligation on the central electricity generating boards distribution circuit in other words the grid to buy power which it generates if it is surplus to requirements and available or is this not to be insisted upon <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been an extremely interesting debate and the house has had the opportunity to hear several of the best informed men in the country who can discuss the subject with authority <e> <s> i find it therefore very hard to know what i myself can profitably say <e> <s> much of what i had intended to say has been said by the last two speakers <e>", "<cs> nevertheless my lords the unfortunate fact is that it was a very good heat and power plant and it is not being used any more to provide that combination <e> <s> i had once to deal on a trivial scale with a combined heat and power plant in manchester which generated a small amount of power and provided heat for the university <e> <s> we had to scrap it for the very same reason that the turbines were getting worn out and it would not have paid to renew them <e> <s> when i discussed this idea with people in this country and abroad we came up with the idea that it is not usually worthwhile to install a combined heat and power plant unless you can build it from the very beginning to cover a very substantial area <e>", "<cs> my lords i find myself very puzzled by what has been said in this debate <e> <s> the point is that i know a great many opticians and i find it incomprehensible that the description i have heard of them as grasping and unscrupulous people can in fact be applied to those men that i know and like <e> <s> i felt that many of lord rugbys strictures were quite incomprehensible <e> <s> i should like to introduce him if he would allow me to do so to some of those opticians particuarly those who are running the eye hospital in manchester to those who are running the ophthalmic optics department in my own institution and who are very dedicated professional men <e> <s> it is most worrying to me because the very first degree course which was ever given to ophthalmic optic students was given in my institution and was given because we were promised the opportunity to expose the students to clinical tests being performed in the manchester eye hospital <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad about that <e> <s> conversely i would not recommend the handing down of false teeth on the grounds that it would not damage your jaws <e> <s> what i am trying to say is that we <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord this question is it not also true that the public accounts committee had to admit that they owed million and if they paid them a bit in excess of the million they then had to repay million of that <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister one very important question <e> <s> has it ever occurred to the government that it is very probable that the cruise missile will not work when it is tried and for a fundamental reason <e> <s> it depends for its navigation on precisely observing the ground beneath it <e> <s> small hillocks and so on are used to check the inertia navigation on which it basically depends <e> <s> if you stand on the malvern hills and look east the first hillock would be the ural mountains <e> <s> in principle even the missile cannot work because there is nothing to guide it <e> <s> in any event the maps have not been prepared and it will take at least two or three years to prepare them <e> <s> they have not yet been started <e> <s> it will cost several hundred million pounds to do that and no funds seem to have been allocated for the purpose <e> <s> i wonder whether there is any purpose at all in talking about cruise as a viable and useful weapon for the time being <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not true that in some countries all teachers are expected to be graduates <e> <s> i am sure that someone could tell us for certain whether that is so <e> <s> is it not true in scotland that all teachers in schools except the most elementary are required to be graduates but that there is no particular connection between the subject in which they graduated and the subject which they are required to teach <e>", "<cs> my lords it is extremely hard to know how i can best make a contribution to this debate when so many authoritative speakers have already been heard this evening <e> <s> but there are at least one or two points that i should like to bring before your lordships and the first of them is this <e> <s> the problem of the infrastructure has been much considered by all sorts of people including in particular the institution of civil engineers which has set up a body called the infrastructure planning group <e> <s> this group has been studying the matter for several years and has attempted to involve successive governments in its discussions <e> <s> but the governments have adamantly refused to have any part of it <e> <s> it seems to me that this is ridiculous <e> <s> the civil engineers after all are the most authoritative and well informed of all learned institutes in this field and i believe that the government should try to collaborate with them <e> <s> i should like to ask the minister whether he can undertake to make sure that this is done in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i shall arrange to go there <e> <s> but i do know ours in manchester <e> <s> they are wonderful places now and they play an absolutely essential role in the maintenance of civilised living <e> <s> we have them and we are going to need more of them in order to make it possible to clean up the rivers which so much befoul the country in which we live <e>", "<cs> my lords so much has already been said this evening that i do not know how best to make my own contribution <e> <s> i should like to begin by thanking the noble earl lord lauderdale and the noble lord lord kearton who spoke so very clearly and went into such detail but i want to make one point which may help <e> <s> i should like to link this debate with a debate that we held in this house about a month ago on the subject of the infrastructure of the community <e> <s> we realised then that the neglect of the infrastructure was causing devastation in many parts of england <e> <s> we talked about the collapse of the sewers in manchester we talked about the risk that the sewers of islington may fall in and we talked about the neglect of some of the secondary road surfaces <e> <s> we realised that this might have an absolutely devastating effect on the whole of our civilised living <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say whether it is true that nearly half the gas put into the mains escapes before it ever gets to the consumer <e> <s> if so can he say whether steps are being or could be taken to mend the pipeline <e>", "<cs> my lords the debate so far has been extremely interesting to me and i should like to add my thanks to the noble lord lord annan for introducing it <e> <s> if i may i should also like without being thought impertinent to add my congratulations to the noble lord lord wilson of rievaulx on his maiden speech <e> <s> i never thought in my wildest dreams that it would fall upon me to do such a thing as that <e>", "<cs> my lords several years ago there was a systematic inquiry into the possibility of a severn barrage <e> <s> ever since then sums of money have been promised or made available or have not been made available for the future development of this scheme <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may be allowed briefly to intervene and explain something of the history of the connection between eye testing and the ability to detect eye diseases because it originated in manchester <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like briefly to intervene because i knew the university at coleraine very well when it was first being established <e> <s> i should like to pay a very warm tribute to the genius of its first vice-chancellor who tackled appalling problems with very great courage and skill and in a manner which to most people was really rather surprisingly untypical of academics <e> <s> he had a curious mixture of the academic distinction which one expects of such a man and an enormous ability in practical affairs <e> <s> i hope very much that his work will be remembered and that the tradition he established of a combination of academic distinction and practicability will be retained in the new institution i am sure it will be <e>"]
