<e>", "<cs> my lords for once i should like to support the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> it was explained to me in february this year that from two big mail order catalogues it was possible to buy various bits of a gun then put them together without having to produce a certificate <e> <s> i know that quite a few friends who are firearms dealers feel that through mail order firms people are able to do things which they themselves would not do <e> <s> that is why i support the amendment <e> <s> there may be drafting problems but that is another matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to take

that i raised this point <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for drawing that to my attention <e> <s> i should like to add two more comments <e> <s> it would be a good thing if water could be metered for two reasons <e> <s> the first is that the householder i am thinking mainly of houses would then pay only for what he used <e> <s> secondly if water is metered it is one of the few ways in which the water undertaker can find out if it is being wasted because there is suddenly a fantastic reading <e> <s> unfortunately and this is one of the facts of life if people are paying a fixed charge for water they tend to waste it appallingly badly indeed they very often do not bother to repair ball-cocks or other such appliances <e> <s> that is one of the reasons i think metering is definitely an advantage <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friends who have supported the amendment <e> <s> i am equally grateful to my noble friend the minister for his reply <e> <s> i am sure that we should all like carefully to read what he said <e> <s> i am reasonably satisfied and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend replies to the amendment i should like to say that i believe there is a need within this legislation for a requirement at least for consultation between the chief fire officer of the area concerned and the water undertaker of the area concerned for example fittings connections and valves change over a period of time <e> <s> they are both responsible people but it would do no harm if the need for consultation were written into the legislation so that they meet and nobody bulldozes somebody else <e> <s> i am grateful that the amendment has been brought to our attention <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble friend for his reply <e> <s> i had missed those last few words <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i have much enjoyed the debate so far <e> <s> i rise to take part in it on two basic points <e> <s> the first is a case where a person in scotland must appoint a lawyer that is and forgive me for quoting a personal case where i had to appoint a solicitor to act as <e>", "<cs> i should like to make one comment on this point <e> <s> we are referring back to clause which concerns the supply of water for non-domestic purposes <e> <s> i must point out in bringing in clause that the people who have been mentioned so far are those who will be involved in water supply for domestic purposes <e> <s> i think that that point is worth making <e>", "<cs> i should like to give a specific example which may be helpful to the committee <e> <s> the environmental health department of a local authority is responsible for many aspects of health <e> <s> i am grateful to my local authority in east lothian in scotland <e> <s> it came to my assistance when i sought to have a full analysis of the water taken from my private supply to houses <e> <s> i did so because until recently none of us thought of aluminium as being poisonous <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may raise one further point on this subject <e> <s> i hope that under the definition of relevant persons in subsection the costs would be evenly divided between the owners and occupiers of all the premises which draw water from that supply <e> <s> then at least the costs would be shared <e> <s> as has already been said many private persons may own the water supply but we have no guarantee that a spring will continue to flow for ever <e>", "<cs> although i accept that one should always use a registered plumber to carry out work inside a house we are also dealing with undertakers works outside a building <e> <s> with regard to work outside a building such as laying new pipes new developments in that field and the new materials being used today require different types of engineering and completely different equipment <e> <s> therefore although i am very much in favour of <e>", "<cs> although i wholeheartedly support this clause in respect of domestic rates because they are being superseded by the community charge to the best of my knowledge there will continue to be business and industrial rates for some years to come <e> <s> i see no reason why those properties should not be charged by the water or sewage undertaker on the basis of their rateable value unless and until those properties are metered <e> <s> it is for this reason that i suggest that the clause should not stand part of the bill <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for that explanation <e> <s> i am sure that it will clear up many misunderstandings in relation to businesses and industries <e> <s> i agree that clause as drafted should stand part of the bill <e>", "<cs> does not clause cover the giving of three samples <e>", "<cs> my lords i am concerned about this amendment <e> <s> i feel that the national rivers authoritys fundamental principle is to deal with water quality objectives and control of pollution <e> <s> the conservation and environmental <e>", "<cs> my lords by all means specify who should be on the committee but i do not think that that should be in primary legislation <e> <s> it should be remembered that primary legislation will be needed to make any alterations <e> <s> i am all for such a provision in guidelines or recommendations because those are much easier to change but i am against specifying the bodies as is proposed in amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> one would restrict a wide choice <e> <s> other bodies will appear and other circumstances will arise <e> <s> the national rivers authority will have all these thoughts very much in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i totally disapprove of this amendment because on my reading of it it would place a farmer who is renting land in an almost impossible position <e> <s> i must draw your lordships attention to the third last line which slates <e>", "<cs> my lords despite what the noble lord lord mcintosh has said i wonder whether his amendment would achieve what he is aiming for <e> <s> i shall briefly go through it <e> <s> it is assumed under subsection that the secretary of state desires to make an order and that under paragraph b the company has given an undertaking that it will not breach its discharge consent level <e> <s> from reading section a in amendment no <e> <s> zd which says <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down perhaps i may ask one further question <e> <s> it appears to me that under clause even if meters are introduced under subsection at the top of page the charging scheme may make different provisions for different cases including different provisions in relation to different circumstances or localities <e> <s> therefore in those circumstances even the meters could vary <e> <s> i am sure that is not what any members of your lordships house desire <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to add a few further words on this point <e> <s> my noble friend the minister stressed that if someone suddenly started to use a lot of water a new agreement could be reached between the supplier and the user <e> <s> however there is nothing that i can see within this clause which clearly states that an agreement exists <e> <s> let us suppose that someone has a half-inch pipe but runs it at full bore on a -hour basis <e> <s> his consumption of water will increase considerably <e> <s> i am concerned that in respect of supply a provision should be put on the face of the bill to state that the user shall not be allowed to use more water than was agreed or if he does use more water than was agreed a new agreement must be drawn up <e> <s> the undertaker should also have the option of changing his mind <e> <s> i feel there is something missing in this clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i have studied this clause carefully because paragraph c of schedule has almost identical words applying to scotland <e> <s> the supply in question could come from a well <e> <s> it might be found by the local authority environmental health department to be unfit to drink <e> <s> in that case the water undertaker or in the case of scotland the water board might be approached to supply water <e> <s> as the clause is worded the local authority may pass on the cost to the person concerned it may bear the cost itself or it may ask the undertaker to carry out a certain amount of the work <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may comment because i am very concerned by what has been said <e> <s> although i sympathise with the principle behind the amendment of the noble lord lord mcintosh and recognise that people who receive water from private supplies need protection it is worth pointing out that under the provisions of this bill local authorities have a distinct responsibility to check private supplies with regard to both wholesomeness and quantity of water <e> <s> that is clearly made out and i feel that in that respect much of the noble lords concern is covered by the functions of the environmental health department of a district council <e> <s> i think that that applies to both england and scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that the national rivers authority was to carry out its survey in <e>", "<cs> my lords i am rather intrigued by this amendment <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend lord arran for giving some explanation of it <e> <s> the proposed new section c appears in schedule at the bottom of page <e> <s> clause has almost identical wording to that of the proposed new section d at the bottom of page <e> <s> if it is necessary for these functions to extend on both sides of the border then i suggest that clause of the bill should be applied to scotland by means of a final clause to the bill <e> <s> if that is not desirable your lordships might wish to look at the end of clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful <e> <s> on question amendment agreed to <e>", "<cs> my lords i am particularly concerned about amendments nos <e> <s> and which leave out the words <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord lord ross sits down i should like the opportunity of asking him to look at the bottom of page clause <e>

<e> <s> in that county there was a very severe flood in <e> <s> one of the main reasons that the flood was far more severe than any we have had either before or since was due to the fact that during the war years none of the streams was cleaned out and no trees that had fallen down across the streams had been pulled out <e> <s> when three inches of rain fell in as many days we literally had a huge flood <e> <s> that flood started to wash away bridges and everything else <e> <s> good management of streams is important <e> <s> sometimes one has to clean out the beds of streams and occasionally cut off tree branches that are hanging over streams <e> <s> i only hope that clause is not too restrictive and that we shall not run the risk of flooding as a result <e>", "<cs> my lords i can give the house the answer <e> <s> twenty cubic metres of water is gallons cubic metres is gallons <e>", "<cs> my lords the river purification authorities of scotland have often restocked fish particularly brown trout which are not normally produced in fish farms <e> <s> they have done a marvellous job when there has been an accident and a lorry has driven off of a road and spilt all sorts

intervene on this amendment because i am a little concerned in one respect <e> <s> the river purification authorities in scotland are financed out of the rates raised by regional councils whereas the national rivers authority is financed by the exchequer <e> <s> i think that the nature conservancy council is also entirely financed out of exchequer funds <e> <s> i am not at all sure that we should

know that those two schedules are being included <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that at this stage we should remember that the reason why it was chosen to add fluoride to water was that water was not protected by the food and drugs acts in the same way as other products which we consume <e>", "<cs> my lords i am a little concerned about this amendment i should briefly like to explain why <e> <s>

have a change of life <e> <s> a man or a woman can be very unstable for a period of up <e>", "<cs> i am somewhat worried about the amendment because if my memory serves me rightly it is some years since i served on a local council in the case of council houses where a husband who is the householder under the council tenancy rules has behaved badly the local authority has a power to evict him and put the family back into the home if he has thrown them out <e> <s> the wording of this group of amendments gives me the impression that they could affect a private landlord <e> <s> however sympathetically i as a private landlord might feel towards the battered wife if the husband were the tenant i might be treading on dangerous legal ground if i attempted to help the wife however badly the husband had behaved <e> <s> that is the point that worries me about these amendments <e>", "<cs> i am concerned by the amendment <e> <s> i recognise what has been said in its favour and i sympathise <e> <s> however the problem is that a private landlord might give a farmworker a house at a very low rent over some considerable time <e> <s> as the tenant becomes older he or she may require care and attention <e> <s> speaking for my own part i should not like to have a house tied up long after the person to whom i had let it had died while the person who had taken care of the

however i am thinking of the case <e>", "<cs> i have a good deal of sympathy with the amendment <e> <s> in many cases the next of kin has been granted power of attorney he has consulted the family and has done the best he can <e> <s> the system of using power of attorney works very well indeed <e> <s> if a person does for want of a better word go bonkers the powers come under the extremely strict rules of no less a person than the accountant of the court of session <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble and learned friend for giving me that explanation <e> <s> i had not appreciated that the court could decide that it either has or has not jurisdiction <e> <s> i thought that the choice was only one way <e> <s> in view of that explanation the amendment would not be helpful <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> i am also a smoker but i see that the amendment includes alcohol <e> <s> i must say that when living in scotland one occasionally needs a little anti-freeze <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may add a few words <e> <s> while i sympathise with the idea behind the amendment certainly in the case of scotland it is only under the mental health acts that a person can be detained in hospital or forced to take treatment <e> <s> as i see it the difficulty in producing legislation at the moment is that in most cases almost irrespective of how ill patients are they have the right to discharge themselves from hospital <e> <s> where do we say that they shall not have that right <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the explanation <e> <s> however i feel that until the various branches of the medical profession get their heads together and decide exactly what they want to do we cannot help with this legislation <e> <s> however my noble friend has raised a very important point <e>", "<cs> the problem is that doctors do not want to know anyone suffering from the effects of drugs or drink <e> <s> it is a serious problem <e> <s> we must remember that except where someone has been held in hospital under a three-day order a person has a right to discharge himself <e> <s> the only way that a person who has become seriously mentally deficient through for example alcohol can be held in custody is under the mental health acts <e> <s> at the end of a period of days the detention requires a court order <e>", "<cs> i hope that i can take this opportunity to ask a question <e> <s> more than one amendment has been tabled to clause <e> <s> therefore this may be as convenient a time as any to refer to it <e> <s> one of the matters that always concerns me when reading legislation is whether it applies to scotland <e> <s> clause provides <e>", "<cs> all i wanted to say is that i am grateful to my noble friend lord henley for his information on whether clause to applies to scotland <e> <s> normally numbers are not changed in a bill but as this is a point that obviously does or does not affect scotland i hope that that point will be confirmed when we reach clause <e> <s> that is all i require <e> <s> i did no mean to interrupt the noble lord lord ennals <e>", "<cs> as we are discussing this group of amendments i should like to refer to the last amendment amendment no <e> <s> ax put forward by the noble lord lord carmichael <e> <s> i feel that at line on page the words <e>", "<cs> my lords this bill removes certain anomalies which have existed in scottish law for some time as my noble friend lady carnegy said <e> <s> section chapter of the removal terms scotland act states that the removal time unless otherwise specified in the tenancy agreement shall be noon on th may for whitsunday and th november for martinmas <e> <s> unfortunately chapter of the removings act states that whitsunday shall be in all time the th day of may <e> <s> candlemas has been nd february and lammas st august <e> <s> that divides the year into uneven quarters <e>", "<cs> i am not altogether happy about the amendments <e> <s> nevertheless it is always worthwhile for a member of this place to question some of the definitions <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> relates to the word medium <e> <s> from my reading of the legislation as it stands it appears to be the governments intention to separate pollution of the air from pollution in other media <e> <s> the control of air pollution is a local function water pollution is the responsibility of the inspectorate the nra or some similar body <e> <s> i am not keen on the word elements <e> <s> to some extent it has a ring of the old definition of fire air earth and water but that is a matter of opinion <e>", "<cs> the trade name for cfcs is freon <e> <s> it is used extensively in refrigerators <e> <s> indeed i do not believe that there is anything better on the market for the ordinary domestic refrigerator <e> <s> it is still being manufactured for use in the ordinary home fridge/freezer <e> <s> the advantage in using freon in refrigerators as opposed to other products is that as a result of its process for making things cold its pressure is below atmospheric pressure <e> <s> therefore if air leaks into the system the freon gas does not leak out <e> <s> on grounds of the cost of manufacturing i do not believe that there is an alternative <e> <s> i admit that other materials can be used in many sprays <e> <s> however we must bear in mind that many of the other materials substituted in hair sprays and so forth are highly inflammable <e> <s> a little care must be taken in that respect <e>", "<cs> i feel that i must join in the debate at this point <e> <s> i do so because at long last this government have done more to encourage us with the introduction of the community charge to do <e>", "<cs> i have one question here to begin with <e> <s> can a member of the committee tell me what the difference is between a primary and a secondary or some other kind of pollutant <e> <s> i do not know what the difference is <e> <s> further i feel that quite a lot has been achieved in this field <e> <s> british rails east and west coast routes to scotland will be completely electrified within about six months from now <e> <s> this government have introduced lead free petrol <e> <s> i think it is worth bearing in mind that with the improvement in the efficiency of engines assuming the same weight of car a cc engine is usually much more economical than say a cc

stressed <e> <s> clause refers to the <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful <e> <s> that is all i want to say <e>", "<cs> under those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel that it would be a great pity if the amendment were accepted <e> <s> first let us not forget the definition of a horse <e> <s> a horse is an animal of more than hands if my memory serves me right <e> <s> i admit that to me most horses or ponies tend to be somewhat uncomfortable in the middle and highly dangerous at both ends <e> <s> i usually find that with dogs and horses the smaller the animal the harder it is to control <e> <s> a tiny pony is much harder for a child to ride <e> <s> i have the feeling that if we alter the wording to nine hands we shall do a great deal of harm to those children who wish to learn to ride <e>", "<cs> perhaps members of the committee would be good enough to turn to page of the bill clause describing the meaning of waste <e> <s> the provision specifically excludes from commercial waste waste from any mine or quarry and so on <e> <s> i feel that there is a slight conflict of interest on both sides of the committee over this <e>", "<cs> i am very concerned about the amendment <e> <s> members of the committee may not realise why <e> <s> the first line of the amendment reads <e>", "<cs> nevertheless the amendment refers to waste which is not controlled waste <e>", "<cs> i am not happy about these amendments particularly amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> clause applies to scotland <e> <s> as far as i can see the provision would certainly not accord with the scottish provisions <e> <s> equally to leave out subsection as provided for in amendment no <e> <s> would be to bring back together the functions of various authorities so

closing words when speaking to amendment no <e> <s> she referred to the lord advocate <e> <s> if so my point is that the last line on page of the bill states <e>", "<cs> my lords i am worried about one or two points contained in the amendment <e> <s> first on the whole i prefer the words on the face of the bill to those of the amendment <e> <s> if a shepherd is taking sheep along a road i assume for the moment that the amendment is accepted and the sheep make a mess on the road that does not matter <e> <s> if his dog leaves excreta on the road the shepherd will commit an offence <e> <s> i do not see why dogs should be distinguished and separated from horses sheep cattle or anything else that uses the road <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for interrupting but does not clause cover this point <e> <s> it covers all animals not just dogs although it includes dogs <e>", "<cs> my lords i have some sympathy with the amendment <e> <s> i am becoming very fed up with local authority officials walking all over my property without even bothering to ask me about it or to let me know that they are coming <e> <s> very often legislation does not fully take account of the private landlord who in many cases is up against many difficulties with regard to litter or other problems <e> <s> there is some force in what the noble lord lord meston says <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may raise one further point which might be helpful to the amendment <e> <s> normally there are no trespassing laws in scotland <e> <s> however under scots law it is a serious offence to trespass on railway or aircraft property <e> <s> the legislation was placed on the statute book many years ago <e> <s> i cannot quote chapter and verse but the trespassing laws were written into scottish legislation with l view to protecting the life of the trespasser and for no other reason <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful for that explanation <e> <s> i now have a much clearer picture and understanding of the situation all round the british isles <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend the minister considers the amendment i should say that i believe it needs to be reworded <e> <s> if my memory serves me right the water act used the words coastal defence <e> <s> although i support what my noble friend lord crickhowell said that concept would need to be introduced too <e>", "<cs> my lords i wondered about that when i read these amendments <e> <s> at the time i almost put it as a question to the house whether schedule or act was meant <e> <s> i emphasised at that time that if it was to be act it should at least mention part vii <e> <s> i have no real objections to amendment no <e> <s> but with its acceptance the bill will read <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may explain one of the problems in scotland <e> <s> we have no equivalent to the drainage legislation in england <e> <s> a problem that may arise with regard to the nitrate issue is this <e> <s> a farmer owns nice flat agricultural land at a high level <e> <s> someone else owns a field below that level <e> <s> the farmers nitrates drain down through the second persons field into a stream <e> <s> so far as i know there is no protection for the second landowner between the higher farmland and the stream <e> <s> we do not have such legislation in scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords i have taken a keen interest in this matter <e> <s> much of what my noble friend lord stanley and the noble lord lord mackie of benshie have done has been of great help <e>", "<cs> my lords if i have missed that point then noble lords must forgive me <e> <s> it is a little late <e> <s> i had very much hoped that if my amendments were not accepted then at least they could be incorporated into the regulations <e> <s> however after carefully reading this clause along with most of the amendments that were moved before this one and <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very happy with that answer and accordingly i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may draw one or two points to the attention of the house <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> appears to try to group part vii of the bill with part ii <e> <s> clause refers to schedule <e> <s> i am especially concerned with paragraph which deals with the transfer of staff <e> <s> we do not necessarily need to link the transfer of staffs in waste disposal provisions with the transfer of staffs which may be involved in part vii <e> <s> i do not think that any of the amendments will improve the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am always interested in the amendments that my noble friend lord renton puts down and i feel that he gives a great deal of thought to them <e> <s> i should be interested to hear what my noble friend the minister says in respect of the amendments <e> <s> if they are acceptable would it be possible to include the river purification boards of scotland as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel some concern about this amendment because clause states <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord lucas of chilworth has gone a long way towards meeting one of the defects that he had pointed out <e> <s> i hope that the government will look upon the amendment with some sympathy <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether a procedure could be introduced into scots law so that a case involving a child as a major witness could be given precedence over others in order to bring the case forward <e> <s> what worries me as a justice of the peace is that on average it takes nine months or a year for a case to come to court <e> <s> in cases involving children is there any way in which the diet of trial can be fixed more quickly <e> <s> what has been said in the house tonight is very important <e> <s> it is difficult to judge what kind of evidence a child will give <e> <s> some children are very good and some are appalling regardless of age <e> <s> i wonder whether laying the matter down in primary legislation is the best way of doing it <e>", "<cs> my lords surely the courts should be above parliament <e> <s> has that not been our tradition <e>"]
