["<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for that correction although i must repeat in fairness to myself that i was of the opinion that the house had given me leave to proceed as i have done <e> <s> however if the house now wishes that i should proceed differently i am of course at the disposal of your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords it is i think inevitable given the way our interesting constitution works that from time to time this house should entertain feelings of inferiority to another place <e> <s> but i must say that i do not think we need do so this afternoon because we have introduced this bill into this house and i think that however interesting the second reading debate in another place may be when it gets there it will be very unlikely to include contributions from somebody so expert in mining engineering as the noble lord lord energlyn who has just spoken or somebody who is so involved in the practical logistics of the exploitation of mineral wealth of this kind as my noble friend lord erroll or indeed somebody who has spent such time and studied so closely issues connected with the law of the sea as the noble lord lord kennet and may i take this opportunity to welcome him back to the labour front bench which he used to adorn both as a labour minister and as an opposition spokesman <e> <s> in the latter capacity certainly i hope he remains in his present position <e>", "<cs> my lords beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i can comment to the extent that it is certainly an interesting notion <e> <s> of course we in this country are very fortunate in our institute of occupational medicine and if it can give a lead or become the model for european procedures that would be excellent <e> <s> what one would not want is that at high cost to us all we duplicate the procedures needlessly <e>", "<cs> my lords the house has covered a very great deal of ground perhaps more expeditiously than we are used to <e> <s> i think that may be a reasonable justification for taking these orders separately so that next week in the same concentrated rather precise way we can focus on what in the jargon of the trade are called northern ireland office affairs as against northern ireland affairs <e> <s> i appreciate that this can cause individual noble lords some difficulty <e> <s> i am glad that the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge a distinguished predecessor in my present office was today able to get some things off his chest <e> <s> he will i think understand if i do not reply to them in detail <e> <s> the noble lord said that he could not be with us next week because he is playing golf on the south downs <e> <s> could i urge him to come and play golf with us in ulster where we have some admirable golf courses which will be ready to welcome him at any hour of the day <e>", "<cs> the difficulty my lords is that the circumstances in which riots occur tend very often to be rather different in northern ireland from <e>", "<cs> my lords as my original reply indicated i am anxious to reassure my noble friend that that is absolutely the position <e>", "<cs> i certainly welcome that suggestion my lords and the security forces in northern ireland depend very heavily and i would say in general successfully on the co-operation of local people in the province <e> <s> the fact is however that the security forces have very dangerous tasks to do and they cannot be disallowed from performing those tasks by rioting crowds often organised cynically by terrorists <e> <s> at the end of the day as i say they have to protect themselves in performing those tasks <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord beswick <e> <s> again i must repeat that i <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the response of the two noble lords <e> <s> may i start by saying to the noble lord the leader of the opposition that <e> <s> no we did not introduce voluntary registration precisely to bring the figures down <e> <s> i think i could possibly emphasise that with some authority because i was the sponsoring minister when this decision was taken and as a spokesman from those benches in opposition i also urged upon the then government of which the noble lord was a distinguished member that we should alter our ways of looking at unemployment statistics <e>", "<cs> my lords the conservative partys manifesto is never far from my thoughts and i am glad to say that a number of improvements to the tax incentives available to individuals and companies in respect of the arts have been introduced during the life of this government <e> <s> there was a vat concession in respect of disposals from historic houses and a guide to general systems of tax reliefs available to private owners of works of art of museum quality importance was published by my office in july <e> <s> i am anxious to take this further step by step <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i am too old a hand to be drawn into debating amended regulations during question time <e> <s> the fact is that the noble lord lord mccarthy was perfectly at liberty to invite the house to throw out the amended regulations <e> <s> he did not do so and therefore they went through <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not the case that the government do not take into account the views expressed in this house <e> <s> they take them most seriously <e> <s> the government also take into account the fact that all this legislation is subject to scrutiny by statute by the equal opportunities commission <e> <s> our job was to try to get our law into line with the european directive <e> <s> the job of the equal opportunities commission by statute is to keep equal pay legislation under review <e> <s> i am sure that the commission and indeed also the house and people outside the house will want to get this working as soon as possible and see that we are in conformity <e>", "<cs> my lords it is indeed the case that i was involved in the negotiations with the trade unions following the announcement of the decision on gchq <e> <s> that does not prevent what the noble lord lord annan said from being correct <e> <s> on the contrary it was a consideration that we bore very much in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree with my noble friend that it is important in combating this horrendous crime to have a flexible response from all arms of the service uniformed the investigative units and the rest <e> <s> on technology hm customs and excise are collaborating with the laboratory of the government chemist and an industrial company in the united kingdom on the development of a device such as the noble lord describes <e> <s> when its sensitivity <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that any government would contemplate that <e> <s> it would be very difficult to ring fence the arts culture or music from a general demand to be removed from a tax which whatever one thinks of it is needed and is very efficient to gather <e>"]
