["<cs> my lords i want to make a rather fundamental criticism of both defence and foreign policy <e> <s> i know i am not alone in feeling that there is far too much emphasis on maintaining a balance of military power against the soviet union <e> <s> in the short run a balance of military power may be the only way to preserve peace <e> <s> in the long run it becomes increasingly dangerous <e> <s> the western powers build up military strength to defend themselves against the risk of a soviet attack <e> <s> the soviet leaders see this build-up as something to which they have to respond <e> <s> the result is an arms race with increasing danger of war <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not claim to be any sort of expert on local government but <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter for giving us the opportunity to discuss this very important issue <e> <s> it is interesting that a little over a century ago karl marx described the united kingdom as a country in large measure without a bureaucracy <e> <s> now the growth of the bureaucracy has changed the nature of british society <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join other noble lords in congratulating the foreign office on the very great skill with which they have conducted these negotiations over the future of hong hong <e> <s> likewise we should be very grateful for the goodwill and reasonableness shown by the representatives of the peoples republic of china <e> <s> when my wife and i were in hong kong in august last year we found that local opinion made an unfavourable comparison between the legalistic approach of the prime minister and the action of the portuguese authorities who were all ready to move out of macao when the chinese asked them to stay on <e>", "<cs> when i was in hong kong last year i discovered wide mistrust as regards the courage of the governor in standing up to demands from peking <e> <s> i have read statements from peking which are critical about the whole process of granting british citizenship to a large number of hong kong citizens <e> <s> it is perfectly possible that the governor may face a demand from peking that classes of technically qualified people whom peking wants should not be given british citizenship <e> <s> the governor when faced with such a demand would be in a vastly stronger position if he could say that the matter of british citizenship was not purely his decision and that he could not give in to pekings demands unless he obtained the approval of the authorities in london <e>"]
