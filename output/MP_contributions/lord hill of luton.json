["<cs> my lords i will occupy your lordships time only very briefly <e> <s> i want to underline if i may one point <e> <s> before i do so may i join in the congratulations to the noble lord lord adrian upon his magnificent maiden speech today <e> <s> inevitably he reminded me of the gentle extraordinarily able man who was my director of studies some years ago lord adrian <e> <s> we welcome the noble lord we enjoyed his speech greatly <e>", "<cs> my lords already in this debate opened so strongly and so vigorously by the noble lord lord buxton there has been a severe condemnation of the proposal to make cuts of the order of which we have read <e> <s> we have no firm indication of what has been planned but i should be surprised if there had not been a spreading of some guidance or some information which gave quite accurately the indications that we have read in the press <e> <s> we cannot help remembering that almost exactly two years ago we were discussing the proposals of the think tank and your lordships will remember that the underlying principle was that the best form of persuasion was economic success and if you were not being economically successful then cut down the persuasive effort <e>", "<cs> my lords we must each choose our own words <e> <s> i have been trying to be a good boy tonight and not use unseemly words but i would not demur at the suggestion that the word disgrace would not be inappropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord allow me to interrupt him in order that the record may be put straight <e> <s> the white paper to which he refers which he might have re-read in order to approach accuracy was published years ago <e> <s> it moved some strength from one country to another but it increased the amount of money available to the bbc and the british council and each change during my four years of responsibility for overseas information services revealed an increase not a decrease <e> <s> a shifting of resources which involved scandinavia and portugal and those only plus an increase in the amount of money available to those services is hardly comparable to the minor massacre to which the noble lord is now referring <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord really must allow me to intervene once more <e> <s> this debate is about reducing the financial resources to the bbcs overseas services <e> <s> on the occasion to which he refers and on any other occasion during my four years the change was one of increased resources and never one of decreased resources <e>", "<cs> my lords may i join with other noble lords in expressing sympathy to the noble lord lord ballantrae on the sudden and tragic event which is responsible for his not being here tonight <e> <s> the noble lord lord hatch to whom we are indebted for this debate described in considerable detail the effect of the cut of rather more than per cent <e> <s> which the government have decided upon <e> <s> it really is a substantial cut as noble lords will recall in the teaching of english trade promotion activities the supply of books to council libraries there is a cut of per cent <e> <s> incidentally professional and academic exchanges and the promotion of the arts <e> <s> that per cent <e> <s> cut has already involved a reduction in the london-based staff of persons and in the locally-engaged staff of <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not rise in any way to pursue the analogy of beer <e> <s> the thirst is so growing on me that i want no further reference to it <e> <s> but will the noble lord lord belstead look at this from the angle of what means to the corporation <e> <s> the angle of a reduction or a postponement of million worth of capital development a reduction of million in current expenditure a loss of jobs and what is very serious a movement of trained staff at an increasing pace from the bbc to independent television because their rates of pay are per cent <e> <s> and per cent <e> <s> higher something with which the corporation cannot compete <e> <s> those are the facts of the reality of the application of the governments decision not the contemplation of total amounts that are being given <e> <s> it is a question of the amounts that are not being given and the results that flow from that <e>", "<cs> i shall be brief <e> <s> in responding to the amendment moved by the noble earl the noble lord lord bellwin said that the noble earl was pushing at an open door <e> <s> is the noble earl saying the same sort of thing now <e> <s> for it was on that understanding that the noble earl withdrew his amendment <e> <s> i hope that the noble earl will be able to use similar language and will not put those who support this amendment in the position of having to withdraw now with greater difficulty because a statement by the government is to follow which will cover both england and scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords when the government decided to allot the fourth channel to independent television and to require that on that channel should be ensured a suitable proportion of programmes to appeal to tastes not generally catered for by independent television and so on their first task was to create the legislative basis for the channel including those assurances and subsequently to ensure in other ways that this original prospectus lasts <e> <s> there will be some noble lords who will recall the original prospectus of bbc <e> <s> all i will say is that there have been great changes frankly changes that i have welcomed <e> <s> but my point is that there have <e>", "<cs> my lords it will be evident in the first phase of this <e>", "<cs> i wholly agree with what the noble lord lord donaldson said about the vast tech <e>", "<cs> in supporting the noble lord lord ferrier i think it would be useful to say that this may not be the service that is ideal for this purpose <e> <s> some might argue that breakfast television might be the right service and so on <e> <s> however i think that its significance is to activate discussion and decision on the issue of the televising of parliament and that must take place in the first instance in the other place along the corridor <e> <s> this question has gone to sleep for too long <e>", "<cs> has the noble lord forgotten that it is an instruction to the bbc to broadcast a summary of the proceedings of parliament <e> <s> that is an illustration of government instruction and this is an illustration of a proposed government instruction <e>", "<cs> will the minister comment on the following point <e> <s> clearly the first step in the progress towards the televising of parliament must be a resolution by the other house <e> <s> it is as simple as that it must start there <e> <s> can not the minister offer some hope that in so far as he is able he will secure that this matter is discussed in the other house no doubt on a free vote as it was last time <e> <s> that is all that is being asked <e> <s> of course we know that this amendment is not the appropriate vehicle for raising this issue <e> <s> we use this amendment to raise a general issue and textual criticism of the amendment seems to me to be irrelevant <e> <s> it is a question of the contemplation of a principle <e> <s> cannot the minister offer to pass to his colleagues responsible the suggestion that this matter should be discussed on the floor of the house of commons <e> <s> that must be the starting point not discussions about its cost with the iba or the companies <e> <s> parliament must decide and the house of commons must be the first to do it <e> <s> all i am seeking is that there should be arranged a discussion so that the house of commons can look again at this question and decide it one way or another <e>", "<cs> it would be idle to deny that there is a problem of the kind described by my noble friend lord nugent of guildford <e> <s> the first question which arises in my mind on this specific proposal about complaints in relation to taste if i may use that word to cover all the kinds of criticism that lord nugent referred to is whether the complaints commission is the right body to which to refer such complaints <e> <s> i think the noble lord lord hooson quoted from the annan report <e> <s> i will quote just a little more extensively <e>", "<cs> it may be indelicate to press the minister further <e> <s> however i should like an assurance on the document issued by the department of trade <e> <s> it asks by the way for bids <e>", "<cs> before any other questions are asked in case the treasury is too awkward in the re-consideration as promised and hoping that the fruits of this further thinking will be available before the report stage i seek permission to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> in replying to the last debate the noble lord lord belstead said that this complaints commission was broadly on the lines of the existing non-statutory complaints commission which was founded by the bbc indeed it was during my chairmanship that that was done <e> <s> the point i want to <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord belstead may be right in saying that since my day the system has been changed <e> <s> i described it as it was founded in my day <e> <s> i have not heard of the change and i doubt whether the british public knows anything about the <e>", "<cs> i confess that i am worried about this one because of the experience that a proportion possibly a substantial proportion of the letters in which complaints are embedded are written in such scurrilous terms making personal attacks on people <e> <s> indeed it has always proved a matter of wonder to me that those who complain of say indecency on television can express their complaints in language that would do justice to but had better not describe the occupation in which such language is customary <e> <s> it worries me lest the free press has too good a time in the description of the allegations and so makes matters worse rather than better <e>", "<cs> lawyers always did puzzle me <e> <s> as i understand it the hearing is going to be in public but there is to be no publication of the allegation upon which the hearing is based <e> <s> i do not understand this <e> <s> i can understand the whole business of the allegation the reply the discussion and the decision being published but i do not see how you can sensibly publish the proceedings without exposing the allegations <e> <s> i am bound to say i think that publicity would have the reverse effect to the one which the noble lord intends when i recall dear me <e>", "<cs> may i suggest to the noble lord lord hooson whom i found dangerously persuasive that the suggestion made by the noble lord lord donaldson is the right one that there should be discussion yes discussion between those who have shown an interest <e> <s> discussion indeed with the minister to try to get this right for one has the feeling that in the details of this proposal we are coming up against some very important principles and i think it would not be wise for the noble lord to lose his amendment here <e> <s> it is far better that we should think about it get together and seek to resolve the matter at the report stage <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord allow me to intervene <e> <s> the circular of the department of trade which was issued to airport authorities between two and three weeks ago expressly stated that none of the allocation could be used for increased car parking or for sound insulation <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps with leave i may make three points <e>", "<cs> my lords am i not allowed to make three quick points <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may now make those three points <e> <s> the noble lord lord bellwin was at his best today arguing an impossible case <e> <s> it was one that he knew was impossible and which drew out of him all his persuasive powers <e> <s> but noble lords will recall that he said that when profits were made the proper place for those was the rates <e> <s> luton is well aware of that <e> <s> in the current year luton is making million it is giving million to the rates and that involves a p reduction and million to the reserve fund for the building of the airport <e> <s> so in that respect we have done even better than the noble lord lord bellwin expected <e>", "<cs> my lords at committee stage i supported the noble lord who moved an amendment because it seemed to me that it was an opportunity to raise a basic issue which put simply is that the people of this country are entitled to know what happens in parliament and they are also entitled to have <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord nugent in his opening statement met an obvious criticism that the complaints commission as now constructed or proposed to be constructed was not a body that could properly be required to pronounce on matters of taste so it is not necessary to repeat that point <e> <s> however i think that when an amendment is proposed to an act of parliament it is appropriate to criticise and to examine with some care the significance as well as the words of that amendment <e> <s> your lordships will notice that the amendment deals with <e>", "<cs> and the killings of hamlet <e> <s> surely the noble lord cannot mean that there are no exceptions in relation to the mode of presentation <e> <s> if there are to be no exceptions the people who so advocate seem to me to live in a world which is quite different from that in which the rest of us lead our fallible lives <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say a word of warm appreciation to the minister for the amendment that he has moved which will give very considerable satisfaction to many local authorities <e> <s> i think i am right in saying that concealed in this amendment is an acceptance of the point made in a debate in this house <e> <s> if i am correct may i say to him that to the very high parliamentary reputation that he has built up can be added a capacity for persuading his colleagues of the wisdom of a sound argument widely supported in this house <e> <s> we very much appreciate his attitude and its accomplishment in that direction <e>", "<cs> may i add a word in support of what my noble friend has just said <e> <s> lord beaumont of whitley seemed to assume that research for the advancement of knowledge could have and would have no relationship to the treatment of disease <e> <s> that seems to me to be nonsense and dangerous nonsense <e> <s> although i did not intend to speak as i listened to him my mind went back to my undergraduate days and three men lord adrian whose research on nerve transmission was research as a physiologist in no way intended or related in his mind to the treatment of any particular disease <e> <s> it was research of a fundamental character which has revolutionised neurology over the years <e> <s> a physicist named aston discovered some isotope qualities <e> <s> he had no thought of the use of isotopes in his mind <e> <s> they have proved of profound importance in the years that have followed <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that although it makes sense from time to time to review the overseas broadcasting services in the light <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the foreign secretary has argued that it is the governments prerogative which of the bbcs external services they wish to cut or increase <e> <s> may i say at the outset that i unreservedly accept that position <e> <s> the government do have that authority but i am bound to say at the same time as someone ignorant of the diplomatic niceties that i hope we are not going to have another turkey in somalia when by our protests we saved our government from the folly of cutting the turkey service despite the fact that within a year the government wanted that service increased <e> <s> i hope the government are confident that in the horn of africa it will not be necessary to re-establish that service because if that happens it is likely that the skilled personnel would no longer be available <e> <s> i hope too that there is not too much resentment in brazil at the fact that brazil has been denied broadcasts in her own language while spanish continues to be broadcast in the vast countries which are its neighbours <e> <s> we can only hope <e>", "<cs> fine my lords but i can speak with some experience of broadcasting as such having spent years as a broadcaster and administrator and having been for four years responsible for the coordination of our overseas information services <e> <s> it is in that capacity that i make my brief submission to your lordships house <e> <s> i know from my own experience of the tremendous importance of the external services the acceptance of their integrity their capacity to tell the truth even in awkward circumstances <e> <s> i will not proceed with what i intended to say in the interests of brevity and also because all this seems to be generally accepted in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords it will i know sound pedestrian after so powerful a speech as the one to which we have just listened and in a debate so admirably opened by the noble lord lord evans of claughton which led inevitably and properly to an emphasis on the electoral system aspect of the subject which he raised but i want to follow one point which i shall do briefly that he raised in the first half of his speech in relation to needed local government reform <e> <s> let me say at once that i hope that whenever a useful reform is under consideration we shall not for years ahead be confronted by the argument that we cannot afford it <e> <s> however there is one aspect of the changes which came into operation in that i think demands early attention the decision to destroy county boroughs in the medium sized towns in other words to depart from a unitary system to a divided system <e> <s> i believe that over the years the evidence has accumulated that that system is not working well is not serving the community well indeed is proving confusing and difficult and is tending to be destructive of the confidence of ordinary people in the local government machine <e>", "<cs> my lords as has been said already the house is doubly indebted to the noble lord lord byers first for raising the matter as he did at the end of july and secondly for convincing the house to pass his motion with a two to one majority and again today in trenchant terms he has dealt with the modified cuts that remain <e> <s> i do not propose to follow him in that for i think it was superbly done and does not need repetition or support <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all grateful to the noble lord lord wells-pestell for provoking the very useful discussion that we have had today <e> <s> i am particularly grateful to him for having provoked that superb speech from the noble lord lord richardson which brought to us a wealth of experience and judgment and so raised the level of the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords without difficulty i shall resist the temptation to follow many trails laid by the noble lord lord cledwyn and confine myself to the subject raised by the noble earl <e> <s> indeed there is only one aspect of it on which i feel strongly <e> <s> i do not <e>", "<cs> i am too my lords but i forgot to mention it perhaps my noble friend world put in a word for me <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord jenkins began his studiously moderate speech by raising a point of general difficulty which we must all accept exists <e> <s> the broadcasting licence fee standing now at and inevitably bound to rise with inflation i suppose presents very great difficulty to a proportion of the population who are to put it simply too poor to contribute such a sum even by the instalment system which has been introduced in recent years <e> <s> i agree there is a problem which needs a solution but i submit to your lordships that this bill is not the solution <e>", "<cs> my lords let us look at it <e> <s> the licence fee used to be considered every five years <e> <s> it is likely now to be every three years <e> <s> yes my lords there is an argument about the size of the licence fee every three years <e> <s> this bill ensures a bigger argument every year and a bigger opportunity for control of the licence system as we have known it <e> <s> of course it does <e> <s> this is the beginning of the end of what has proved to be a reasonably satisfactory system <e> <s> by all means let us solve the problem of many people who by reason of poverty cannot afford the licence <e> <s> but there are other ways of solving such problems particularly for a section of the community which probably relies on broadcasting more than any other <e> <s> there is the problem and let us solve that <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may i will submit to your lordships two points one general and the other specific which stem from the consideration of this bill <e> <s> two years ago when we were discussing the no <e> <s> bill the noble lord lord bellwin again and again assured us of his faith in local government and asserted that nothing was then occurring in any way to damage its autonomy <e> <s> i suspect that many of your lordships as i did accepted those assurances <e> <s> his colleague mr toni king perhaps went a little further when he said in another place <e>", "<cs> if i may help to bring the discussion down to earth at second reading i urged upon the minister that he should make absolutely clear whether the relevant clauses in this matter were retrospective or not <e> <s> as your lordships would expect he has carried out that undertaking to the full <e> <s> this is clearly like it or not retrospective <e>", "<cs> is the noble baroness suggesting that the money that has been legally extracted from the pockets of the ratepayers of luton should not go back to them <e>", "<cs> for clarification i would refer the minister to subsection of the proposed new clause which says <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is giving the explanation which i sought in my amendment <e> <s> in due course at the appropriate time i propose to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mottistone has raised some very important issues <e> <s> this house welcomed earlier today the detailed protection for the certified patient in respect of the issue for his or her consent and that protection is absolutely right <e> <s> but for a voluntary patient such a patient might just as well in many conditions go to the national hospital for nervous diseases in queens square or the neurological department of any teaching hospital or other hospital where this proviso would not obtain <e> <s> it really is illogical it seems to me to bring normal people into the same category as certified people for the purpose of this testing of the power to consent <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join other noble lords in expressing the warmest thanks to the noble lord lord orr-ewing for opening this debate and congratulations to the maiden speakers who have contributed today <e> <s> i propose to confine my remarks to the effect of the proposed cable development upon the existing broadcasting services <e> <s> first i take leave to doubt whether anybody can calculate even the noble lord lord hunt and his colleagues what will be the advertising income five or years ahead <e> <s> one of the elements in their calculation is the size of the gross national product in <e> <s> how in heavens name can they engage in a calculation of that kind <e> <s> of course they have the report the advice and the estimates of the advertisers own organisation who say that there will be adequate money available in the future for all services <e> <s> but then they would would they not <e> <s> after all they want this <e>", "<cs> my lords those of us who in another place were colleagues of the noble viscount who opened the debate will recall his vigour his ability his good humour and indeed indirectly the help that he afforded to those members whose hearing <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the relevant part of the regulations which he has quoted is so obscure as to suggest that only the draftsman can understand it <e> <s> secondly is the noble lord aware that neither of the ministers who in this house and the other place put these regulations to parliament for approval made the slightest reference to the power which they apparently give to reduce the incomes of some elderly and infirm persons who need <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister deny that there are some ageing and infirm people who have lost nearly a week as a result of the approval of these regulations <e> <s> secondly will he ask for his right honourable friend to arrange that housing authorities who are aware of old people needing more than the common level of heating provided for others should notify the names of those people to the local office of the dhss so that the position can be remedied <e> <s> finally is the minister aware of the case which i brought to the notice of the department that an old lady of nearly blind suffered that reduction of just under in fact as a result of the application of these regulations <e> <s> no amount of debate will persuade one that that is right in modern conditions and modern circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the first time in years in this house that i have had the privilege of following and congratulating a maiden speaker and i am particularly pleased to do so as he is an old friend from another place whose vigour shown over those years still remains alive within him <e> <s> indeed in wishing for many more contributions from him i hope that i shall be able to agree with some of them as i hear them <e>", "<cs> my lords we are indebted to the noble baroness <e> <s> lady burton of coventry not for the first time for raising a very important issue affecting ordinary people <e> <s> i want to base what i say on a physiological fact <e> <s> it is that the regulatory system of some people usually young or old is very much less capable of resisting coldness than that of normally healthy people of middle years <e> <s> the result of that failure to react as the remainder of healthy people do may well be hypothermia a relatively new word that has been used in the medical press to describe this condition only over the last or years <e> <s> the sufferers from hypothermia are likely to be those on low incomes and living alone <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl lord avon allow me to intervene because i wish to get this point quite clear <e> <s> am i to understand from what he has said that no increases in the prices of fuel are contemplated in the foreseeable future <e>", "<cs> my lords i join other noble lords in the warmest congratulations to the noble lord lord hanson on his maiden speech particularly as he could bring his own relevant experience to bear on the subject <e> <s> but for the rest i confess i may show a little less enthusiasm than some of your lordships have shown for the advent of cable <e> <s> as the noble baroness was speaking i could not help recalling that it was at about the beginning of the century that research revealed that messages in sight and sound could be transmitted through the ether and on that basis there have been many developments including sound radio and television <e> <s> secondly with the satellite we are on the verge of an immense new development in the character the nature and extent of our broadcasting <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept the noble lords point <e> <s> from what has been said today i see no hope of defeating this bill <e> <s> this accommodating attitude that is being shown on all sides of the house suggests that we shall do no more than make some modest amendments <e>", "<cs> if i may speak on a point of elaboration was it not during the noble lords chairmanship of the ita that regulations were issued which laid down the precise figures i quoted to the committee <e>", "<cs> it is difficult to resist the charm and eloquence of the noble lord who replied to the debate but i am going to <e> <s> he has not yielded a point <e> <s> it was beautifully done but he has not yielded one inch from the position set out in the bill and previous statements on the subject <e> <s> i have no doubt in my mind that there should be a specific reference to the proportions of imported and home material from the outset <e> <s> that is the one hope of achieving the maintenance and strengthening of the british industry involved and the maintenance of the quality of programmes in this country including those from the competitors of cable independent television and the bbc <e> <s> for those reasons although finding it difficult to resist the noble lords blandishments i feel i must formally put this to the vote and i formally move <e>", "<cs> my lords on previous occasions when this subject has been debated i have taken the consistent line that failure to have a restriction on overseas material would mean poor quality cable and much worse would help to degrade the standards of the two existing services <e> <s> no one could have gone through the experience as the member of the government responsible for sponsoring broadcasting at the time of the arrival of independent television without realising that that is an accurate statement of what would result from the unqualified and uncontrolled admission of foreign material <e> <s> the noble lord lord mottistone has sought to make our hearts bleed about the commonwealth <e> <s> on the last occasion i moved that the formula that had been evolved by independent television should be applied to this service <e> <s> the noble lord spoke against it and voted against it <e> <s> in fact that formual evolved by independent television kept a place for the commonwealth <e> <s> it actually achieved what the noble lord now seeks <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the noble lord one question <e> <s> if the authority have no unqualified power to secure that a licensed diffusion service broadcasts the services of others who has the power <e> <s> where can it be secured that this thing is done <e> <s> for this thing is of the greatest importance to the existing services <e>", "<cs> my lords unconvinced but weary i beg leave to withdraw this amendment in the hope <e>", "<cs> my lords in the hope that the <e>", "<cs> my lords i realise that the noble lords briefing has been as swift as it has been incomplete and i gladly accept his suggestion that he will look into this matter <e> <s> it is a matter of real concern with a large number of people today <e> <s> their areas may never get cable <e> <s> they may live in so remote a part of the country that the cable people are not interested and they may never get it <e> <s> it is a poor poor thing <e> <s> now with this great enthusiasm for this great new development of information technology the one result that has been seen by a large number of people is that their picture has become well nigh unrecognisable <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord mishcon has said this is the third attempt to secure something more precise than proper proportions <e> <s> the first attempt if i may add this to his history was an attempt to apply to the newcomer the restrictions that have applied since october of last year to independent television <e> <s> if i may refresh your lordships memories as to what that meant it did not mean an automatic application of a per cent <e> <s> limit on imported material <e> <s> in october independent television in the light of experience issued this set of regulations covering certain exemptions <e> <s> they exempt all material originating in the eec per cent <e> <s> extra for commonwealth material all information news sport and educational material subject to iba consideration material of outstanding quality material of cultural or educational value and any programme originating in countries from which substantial ethnic minorities have come <e>", "<cs> my lords it is years since this house passed a resolution in favour of an inquiry as to whether television should be used here <e> <s> it is a year since the noble lord lord soames introduced his motion with the result that his inquiry by a select committee was set up <e> <s> in my view it has done a remarkably thorough and efficient job <e> <s> as i listened to the noble lord lord chalfont moving his amendment as he went on it became perfectly obvious what was his view <e> <s> he does not want the televising of parliament at any time or at any cost <e> <s> that was his view and i suppose it is fair to say that he does not want the inquiry lest it be a success <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness accept first that in the past years there have been nine cuts in the operating expenditure of the bbc as distinct from the capital expenditure and secondly that those cuts have resulted in a loss of income of over million of operating expenditure plus million due inevitably to the fall in the value of the pound <e> <s> now that we are presented with the proposal for a tenth cut in operating expenditure the tenth cut in years is it not time that we recognised the immense value of the bbc to this country and its standing in the world <e> <s> why should we have year after year these cuts in operating expenditure <e> <s> this years proposal i think that the noble baroness will agree happens to coincide with the decision by the americans to increase their expenditure on overseas services <e>", "<cs> finally has the time not come unwelcome though it may be to say it to end this annual reduction in operating expenditure bearing in mind the immense services that are rendered by the bbc external services in terms of the life culture and democracy of this country <e>", "<cs> my lords it is inevitable that this debate should concentrate on the arts but broadcasting and its financing are mentioned in the motion on the order paper and so i should be grateful if your lordships will allow me to deal with two points one of detail but important detail <e> <s> when i said in this house recently that there had been nine cuts in the operating income for the external services nine cuts in ten years i was told that on the contrary there had been an increase certainly over the last few years <e> <s> there was less money given for operating services but it is dubbed an increase because apparently the capital costs and there are capital costs in regard to the repair of transmitters and the like some of it long overdue are regarded as contributions for the operating expenditure on external services <e>", "<cs> my lords may i put one simple but important question to the noble lord <e> <s> will the terms of reference of the proposed committee require it to study the level of broadcasting in other countries in particular in those where broadcasting is provided by two commercial services competing for the limited amount of advertising <e> <s> such a study would enable the committee to see the extraordinary difference between the quality of broadcasting in such countries as compared with a country in which a public service competes with a commercial service with great success <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure whether a former chairman of a building society and a modest current investor needs to declare an interest but if so then i do <e> <s> i propose to concentrate my few remarks on one point and it is a point which may prove to be of crucial importance <e>"]
