["<cs> my lords i am amazed that at this time of salt ii and the taking of the next step to salt iii thus leading to the possibilities of disarmament our new tory government put down a motion asking for a welcome for its intention to spend more on arms <e> <s> to use such a word shows how out of touch this government and this house are with the people of britain and with the whole spirit of the salt agreement <e> <s> the british people did not vote in the present tory government because they wanted more to be spent on arms <e> <s> they would dissociate themselves from the word welcome <e> <s> in the general election it was a tragedy for labour that they did not raise the issue of peace and more negotiations for disarmament which the british people really would have welcomed <e> <s> the increasing growth of the cnd and the peace movements in the countries of europe indicates this fact <e> <s> i am surprised that the noble lord lord strathcona and mount royal did not have more intuition and taste he might have introduced this motion on some such lines as this house deeply regrets that in spite of cuts in all the social services it finds that because of its view of a threat to the capitalist west from the socialist countries it must increase expenditure on arms <e> <s> he would at least have been more honest and more down to earth <e>", "<cs> my lords like many other people i am bewildered by this sudden hurry and i gather that even president kaunda said there was no need for hurry <e> <s> will it not immediately create suspicion among other nations in africa as to the intent of the british government and are we now going to make it possible this is a question to which i do not know the answer for any country to trade with the muzorewa rgime which forms only one side in the present negotiations <e> <s> i can see the dilemma of this present tory government <e> <s> fundamentally economically and strategically they must want a neo-colonial puppet government in zimbabwe allied to south africa and they thus want to block every conceivable chance of the patriotic front coming to power <e> <s> all the patriotic fronts arguments and criticisms must be brushed aside <e> <s> yet our tory government also must realise that no political settlement or peace can be achieved without the patriotic front <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to express my disagreement with the military intervention which the soviet union has carried out in the internal affairs of afghanistan <e> <s> that also happened to be the verdict of the british communist party <e> <s> but i am equally strongly against the efforts of the british and american governments to exploit the developments in afghanistan in order to increase international tension step up the arms race and create new obstacles in the path of dtente <e> <s> i am extremely worried by the danger created by the hysteria of certain cold war warriors and our prime minister is one of them having loudly boasted of it immediately she took office <e>", "<cs> i think that noble lords are showing immoral behaviour in the way that they are treating this matter they can laugh until they are blue <e> <s> president carter and mrs thatcher want to destroy that wonderful moment for their own politics <e> <s> i have been told but you are against sport with south africa on political grounds <e> <s> yes i am my lords because south africa rules <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i must admit that i am very surprised by the definite answer that the noble viscount the minister has given <e> <s> most people in the post office think that the rural post offices will be closed <e> <s> are the government going forward with altering the payments of social security to the people in the villages and putting it on a fortnightly basis or a banking or giro basis <e>", "<cs> my lords when i read the motion put down for debate by the noble earl lord cathcart i understood and agreed with the first part of it dealing with the security of this country but i was very puzzled when the noble earl went on to add and abroad <e> <s> by this does he mean that we have to stand up against any liberation movements that might be going on in the world <e> <s> should we stand beside south africa and its <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble earl <e> <s> our present prime minister has consistently declared that socialism and communism are enemy no <e> <s> and must at all costs be pushed back <e> <s> one of her chief aims is to build up british influence among any who are hostile to the soviet union and thus start a counter-offensive to d tente <e> <s> but she showed herself per cent <e> <s> anti-soviet before afghanistan <e>", "<cs> no my lords of course it does not <e> <s> dtente means both sides trying to get together <e>", "<cs> my lords following the supplementary question put by my noble friend on the stopping of recruitment of mercenaries could not the governments of the european community get together and make it illegal for any mercenaries to go anywhere <e> <s> so to stop these thugs who have no ideology and who only want to kill people and make money <e> <s> can they not be stopped <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to thank the noble lord lord noel-baker for his speech which to me was one of the most constructive speeches we have heard this afternoon <e> <s> he has given me great hope about the united nations <e> <s> he showed what the united nations could do for humanity and for peace if it was allowed to do it and if it was approached in the right way <e> <s> again i thank the noble lord lord noel-baker <e>", "<cs> my lords that is no excuse for britain doing so <e> <s> only when we got back home and heard the radio and television reports of events in parliament and read the leading captions and articles in the press did we realise what an appalling abyss we were on the edge of <e> <s> naturally we bought the newspapers as soon as we could when we arrived and this is the sort of thing we read we fight and no deal said the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to ask this question but from the questions and answers that have taken place i am not clear about this matter <e> <s> are the government not going to face negotiations or peace talks until there has been unconditional surrender from the argentines <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord not agree that the mass media is not playing a fair part in this dispute <e> <s> would not there be less embitterment all round if the aslef point of view was put fairly at a mass meeting as well as the publics point of view <e>", "<cs> my lords i am told that this is only a discussion paper but it is a very very cunning one <e> <s> its aim is not more union democracy it is an election ploy to exploit and encourage anti-union prejudice <e> <s> it seems so reasonable to the non-political person <e> <s> it brings up no facts or evidence of any malpractice <e> <s> but it is sinisterly vicious in innuendoes aimed at the non-unionists leading them to believe that perhaps there are malpractices <e>", "<cs> my lords why look for the answer in mozambique in maputo <e> <s> is it not much more likely to find the answer here in england <e> <s> are the government not aware that in a south african self-confessed spy gave details of accredited diplomats at the south african embassy who were in fact operatives of the south african national intelligence service and were producing files on individuals and organisations opposed to apartheid <e> <s> is the minister aware that the report specifically mentioned a bulging file on ruth first <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister not agree that it might be a good idea to vet south african people coming here as diplomats and if they have a suspicious past to withhold their visas <e>", "<cs> my lords first of all <e> <s> i should like to thank the noble lord lord jenkins of putney for giving this opportunity for us to ask the government several very important questions <e> <s> with the smears of the secretary of state for defence flying about i shall <e>", "<cs> my lords may i repeat the question i asked <e> <s> why are french and british arms not counted in trying to get parity in geneva <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> years ago president allende of chile was murdered because he was trying to bring in a new society with more democratic grass roots <e> <s> two weeks ago mr bishop was murdered for trying to bring in the same things in grenada <e> <s> i have just returned from rome where i attended a very high-powered big symposium held on the th anniversary of the assassination of president allende of chile <e> <s> it was called by rome and its provincial councils <e> <s> the mayor of rome was in the chair all day during its two days of sitting <e> <s> it took place in a parliamentary chamber <e> <s> the aim of the symposium was to examine the thoughts tactics and aims of allende in his effort to create a new more democratic socialist society in chile <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord including the cia in this subversion work <e>", "<cs> my lords i am going to he very brief <e> <s> i am not going to make a speech i am taking pity on your lordships who may sit so late tonight <e> <s> i will just ask the government one or two questions which i hope the debate may answer <e>", "<cs> my lords when i first read the motion of the noble lord lord jenkins on this debate the word approach simply struck me with terror <e> <s> so many people do not realise what position humanity is in <e> <s> i wish that many outside people could have seen that phrase of the noble lord lord jenkins i think that it might have woken them up to the reality of what is happening <e> <s> but i am sure that the holocaust can be avoided but not by the arms race deterrent or by any increases in more and more accurate and sophisticated weapons it can be avoided by politics <e> <s> politics is the real answer to stopping this holocaust <e> <s> we must find a political solution not a solution with weapons to what is happening in the world today and it rests with the british government and with the american government as much as with the soviet union or perhaps more to find a political situation <e> <s> that is the task that our government should be holding as priority no <e> <s> <e> <s> meanwhile they should stop playing second fiddle to president reagan allowing us to be the launching pad for his missiles in any war that he may start <e> <s> let the british government cease to underwrite every reagan speech planning the cold war even more and more <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a great many questions which are niggling in my head <e> <s> why has this bill come about at this moment <e> <s> where are we going <e> <s> why is there this attack on the welfare state now <e> <s> why are the government prepared to alienate the thousands of welfare workers many working in voluntary organisations <e> <s> for the recent mail of so many of your lordships indicates their fear and their worry that they will not be able to carry on if this bill becomes law <e>", "<cs> my lords we have just had a summit of all the leaders of the western world and america and the only declaration upon which they all seemed to agree was the declaration of their loyalty to the <e>", "<cs> my lords we are discussing human beings and from the last speech there was no sign of any humanity at all <e> <s> the people who have been trodden down by a terrible dictatorship for years are now striving to throw off the past and striving to lift themselves up <e> <s> we are asking the noble baroness tonight are the british government trying to help them in their efforts <e>"]
