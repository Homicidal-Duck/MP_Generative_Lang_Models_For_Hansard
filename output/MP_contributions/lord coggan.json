["<cs> my lords i take part in the debate as one who has seen a fair sample if fair is the right word of the films we are discussing <e> <s> i do not believe in condemning what i have not seen or in condemning a book or even a report which i have not read <e> <s> it has been the duty of a good many of us to see these films before commenting upon them <e> <s> as a result of seeing them it is clear to me that a stream of material is coming into our country which has a big potential for damaging personality for inciting to crime and for denigrating sex and particularly womanhood <e> <s> these things cannot be proved in the way that we can prove that two plus two equals four <e> <s> however let me read one sentence it is a long sentence and then get your lordships to guess the origin of it <e>"]
