["<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his reply but as it is vital to make sure that the hospital is built in the right place would he allow me through him to urge the secretary of state to visit the two alternative sites particularly as the previous secretary of state decided against <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the noble earl on this amendment <e> <s> one knows that so often opportunities arise for trustees and there are inevitable delays during which one has to ask permission from a minister and those opportunities may be lost <e> <s> sometimes the trustees themselves are difficult to reach <e> <s> meetings have to be arranged and there will in any event be delays <e> <s> i should like to support the amendment <e>", "<cs> having listened to this short debate with interest i am encouraged by what has been said <e> <s> in view of what the noble lord lord renton said i would say that it is really human predators we are trying to stop more than bird predators <e> <s> it is because of the human predators in this case in the wildlife preserve that all the rare birds have disappeared <e> <s> having said that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords i welcome the opportunity given to us by my noble friend lord perth to discuss some of the various proposals which have been made by the williams committee as part of their valuable work <e> <s> the part of the report to which i want to refer is where it deals with problems arising from shortage of accommodation <e> <s> these problems affect in particular the national museum of antiquities of scotland and the scottish national gallery of modern art and solutions to these two problems are urgently needed <e>", "<cs> my lords this short debate initiated by my noble friend lady elliot of harwood is very welcome at this time of stagnation in the rural areas of the highlands and the borders <e> <s> the noble baroness and other noble lords have mentioned the urgent need for farmers and for foresters to be able to increase their profits so that production can grow <e> <s> in this way the rural economies will grow the local contractors and tradesmen will find trade the number of unemployed will decrease and the rural communities will start to flourish again <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like first to explain that because of legion commitments in scotland i was absent when these matters were discussed previously <e> <s> on those occasions great concern and interest was shown in the welfare of ex-servicemen and it was because of the strong support given to an amendment moved by my noble friend lord kinross that the noble earl lord avon on behalf of the government agreed to bring forward an amendment in similar terms at third reading <e> <s> it is the government amendment which has our support today rather than that under the name of my noble friend lord sandford <e> <s> i hope my noble friend lord sandford will understand our position which has been taken up in spite of his support for our previous amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my thanks to the noble lord lord wells-pestell for enabling us to discuss the disablement problem <e> <s> certainly for me it has been a most moving debate thanks quite largely to the contributions made by the noble viscount and the noble baronesses in wheelchairs <e> <s> all of us know of the wonderful courage shown by the handicapped and of their will to overcome their disabilities and it is up to us to provide all the aids that we can think up <e> <s> this debate will certainly help towards finding some new way in which to assist them <e>", "<cs> i must oppose the amendment proposed by my noble friend lord eccles since as i see it it would change the nature of the board from a board of trustees to a board of management <e> <s> trustees directors and staff are all vital components of our great museums and galleries <e> <s> each has a role to fulfil but one cannot carry on without the other <e> <s> surely a director cannot be a trustee of himself <e> <s> the time for directors to become trustees is different <e> <s> reference was made to the noble lord lord clark <e> <s> he served as a trustee of the national gallery of scotland after his time as a distinguished director of the national gallery in london <e>", "<cs> my lords having served for years as a member of the board of trustees of the national gallery of scotland i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> at one time i was attending meetings a year <e> <s> they were days away from home <e> <s> i am also a practising artist so that was a very big sacrifice <e> <s> i admit however that i had a private income which enabled me to make that sacrifice <e> <s> taking into consideration present circumstances i am sure that artists would be of the greatest benefit to everybody if they could be involved in these jobs and they should be encouraged to become involved by the help of some form of remuneration <e> <s> as the noble lord lord hutchinson of lullington has suggested perhaps there could be some form of loss-of-earnings scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to support this amendment particularly when one realises the large number of items which are hidden in museums and galleries in the metropolitan area <e> <s> i am no expert in the various laws which governed this situation <e>", "<cs> my lords first i must apologise to the minister for joining the chorus against clause of the bill but i do so firmly wearing my non-political british legion hat <e> <s> this generation has seen advances in the provision of houses but the advances have not been in the sphere of rented accommodation accommodation which as many noble lords have said is badly needed by poorer people in particular in the inner city areas <e> <s> charitable housing associations have done much good work to provide for this need and their work of funding rented accommodation deserves every encouragement <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend accept that in my part of the world on the river tweed the situation is getting so serious that the netting industry is about to go out of business or is getting near to that stage <e>", "<cs> my lords this is st andrews day and in my six minutes i shall try in my remarks to concentrate upon scotland <e> <s> as a past member of the scottish arts council during the palmier days of i have watched with interest the development of enterprises that were begun in that period <e> <s> let us hope that they will continue to flourish in the harsher climate of today <e> <s> the scottish arts council deserves all the support and encouragement that it can be given <e> <s> this is no time for criticism <e> <s> indeed it deserves congratulations for the way in which it carries out its function in difficult times <e> <s> like its sister arts councils it faces changes in the system of local authority funding and it is to be hoped that local authority support will be maintained despite the tendency to give arts a low priority particularly when the local authorities are under pressure <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my thanks to the noble lord lord henderson for initiating this debate which has been so well worth while and deeply moving <e> <s> the noble lord as a result of war service has a particular experience of disability <e> <s> i come into the same category of war disablement in a minor way a mere per cent <e> <s> but i can understand the difficultues of having to cope with life with a really serious disablement <e> <s> and the way that people cope has my constant admiration <e>", "<cs> my lords first i declare an interest in that i derive a benefit from salmon nets on the tweed and secondly i speak as a member of the river tweed commission <e> <s> i should like to add my welcome to this order to help salmon conservation <e> <s> although in terms of the nasco convention the new organisation is responsible for areas outside the -mile limit its work in regard to the united kingdom is very much linked with salmon along the shores and in our rivers <e> <s> the banning of northumbrian drift netting with monofilament nets is a priority need for east of scotland rivers where a ban already exists which are affected by netting off the coast of northumberland <e> <s> police work at the mouth of the tweed is increasingly successful and as a result catches are improving <e>", "<cs> my lords i add my congratulations to my noble friend lord biddulph on his maiden speech <e> <s> he is my close neighbour and my distant cousin <e> <s> i am sure that his knowledge and experience of fishing matters has contributed to this debate <e> <s> thank goodness that in the autumn he is otherwise engaged in dealing with his shoot so that the fish have some chance of getting past him and up to my water <e> <s> i also congratulate my noble friend lord gray of contin on the way he has prepared this bill <e>", "<cs> with the leave of the committee i should like to raise one or two points on which i should have put down an amendment but unfortunately the amendments that i posted by express post from scotland failed to materialise here <e> <s> as i shall not be able to be here at the report stage i should like if your lordships will allow me to raise these two points which concern the powers of the secretary of state to control the extraction of sand and gravel and the powers of the secretary of state to control the extraction of water <e>", "<cs> i was not actually moving any amendment <e> <s> i was simply airing my views in the hope that these might be considered in st andrews house before report stage <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> amendment by leave withdrawn <e>", "<cs> before the question is put may i put my amendment no <e> <s> a <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment in my name <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down may i ask him whether he will take on board for the record the point raised about sufficient salmon <e> <s> i think it would be fair to say that in the tweed we have sufficient salmon in the autumn but the time when we do not have sufficient salmon is in the spring and summer which are the times of year when people come to fish in nice weather come to hotels and come to spend money in our part of the world <e> <s> it is vital to try to improve the fishing in the spring and summer <e>", "<cs> my lords i too welcome this bill and thank my noble friend the minister for her explanation <e> <s> as she said this bill ensures the disposal of surplus funds in the irish sailors and soldiers land trust <e> <s> it proposes that per cent <e> <s> of the whole be distributed through an agency for the benefit of irish ex-servicemen and women their families and dependants <e>", "<cs> my lords i add my thanks to my noble friend lord moran for enabling us to discuss the results of the salmon act <e> <s> first of all i should declare an interest <e> <s> salmon fishing has helped my familys finances through the centuries <e> <s> it is as a riparian owner and a tweed commissioner that i should like to make a few points this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to add my thanks to the noble lord lord fanshawe of richmond for promoting this debate on the safeguarding and conservation of our national heritage <e> <s> it has given us the chance to hear the views of a number of noble lords who have done so much to preserve the heritage in this country <e> <s> it is a debate which is most timely when more and more people from all walks of life are visiting our galleries to see and to absorb works of art and when more and more children come to learn from the work which covers the walls of our museums <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to add my support to my noble friend lord mottistone and to the bill which sets out to deal with very serious problems <e> <s> the problems which we are discussing are aggravated by the closures of so many psychiatric hospitals thereby scattering many pitifully mentally ill patients into all kinds of homes and hostels and even on to the streets without proper care <e> <s> resources are urgently needed to provide the after-care treatment which schizophrenics require <e> <s> many of them need care from psychiatric nurses many of them need basic warmth food and clothing quite apart from accommodation in hostels and sheltered workshops <e>", "<cs> clause is vital to the bill since it recommends a set of procedures for assessment before a patient leaves hospital <e> <s> it seems sensible to me that a psychiatrist or whoever has been responsible for looking after the patient in hospital should have the chance to point out to the health authority making the assessment the kind of requirements which may be needed for some <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a pleasure to be able to say a few words in this short debate initiated by my noble friend lord perth <e> <s> as a past chairman of the reviewing committee he is an authority on the export of works of art <e> <s> decisions on these matters are geared to current values which then affect what a gallery or a museum can afford to buy <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to add my congratulations to the noble baroness who will answer the prayer of my noble friend lord mottistone <e> <s> he has enabled us to debate the matter this evening and i support his motion for this code of practice to be withdrawn in order that it may be reworded <e> <s> doctors need to be given stronger and clearer powers to enable them to make sure that patients remain in hospital until reasonable time has been given both for diagnosis and for treatment <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel diffident about speaking in a debate with so many fine speeches delivered by distinguished academics <e> <s> i am no authority on education <e> <s> however i was moved by the speech of the noble lord lord addington <e> <s> he spoke interestingly about the realities of student life today <e> <s> i believe that most lords will agree with the points he made particularly in relation to scotland <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for his undertakings and explanation <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment which is designed to make sure that arrangements and agreements made with current students are adhered to and that provisions made for their support are not changed while in midsteam <e> <s> unless previous commitments are adhered to there could be grave problems of financial adjustment for students from low income families who will be unable to make ends meet and will thus have grounds for resentment <e> <s> we should not impose new regulations upon students who were already enrolled and who were unaware of the scope of the new regulations <e> <s> their positions would be safeguarded by exemption from the provisions of the bill and the regulations <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for his reply <e> <s> however i think that members of the committee from all sides must be rather disappointed in his response <e> <s> i cannot see that there is any indication that there will be any change or flexibility in regard to the problems which i mentioned <e> <s> i hope that before the bill returns to another place there will be more thinking on the matter <e> <s> as the noble lord lord peston said it raises crucial problems which produce among students the feeling of disquiet about a certain divisive situation which i think led to some of those noises about which we heard earlier today <e> <s> however it is now pointless to put the amendment to the question <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for reassurance and for clarification <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>"]
