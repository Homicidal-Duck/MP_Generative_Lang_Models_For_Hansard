["<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble duke the duke of atholl for introducing this most interesting subject and to add my congratulations to the noble earl on his most interesting maiden speech <e> <s> it is clearly a subject about which he knows a great deal and indeed he has done very thorough and interesting homework particularly in his attempts to cost the value of salmon to scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords i too welcome this order and the most expeditious way in which the government have moved to meet an abuse that might have arisen and offended a great many people in the near future apart from causing great suffering to deer <e> <s> however for those interested in the welfare of deer this is really not even half a loaf it is a mere crumb of what we need at any rate south of the scottish border <e> <s> discussion of a much needed comprehensive deer bill has been an almost annual feature of parliament for some years now <e> <s> the noble earl and i well remember several previous sessions concerned with this matter and there is at present a bill before a select committee of the other place <e>", "<cs> my lords like most other noble lords taking part in this debate tonight i have become something of a veteran speaker on second readings of deer bills <e> <s> but in common with everyone else who has spoken i should like to congratulate the noble lord lord northfield on appearing yet again on a third occasion with a deer bill albeit a rather shrunken version of the ones which we have considered here previously <e>", "<cs> i too want to support this amendment on the great black-backed gull <e> <s> we seem to be taking them both together <e> <s> on the stock dove i have a pretty open mind <e> <s> the greater denotes to me not only greater size but far greater voracious capacity <e> <s> it is a really ruthless creature and if the lesser black-backed deserves a place on this list the great one does more so <e> <s> anyone who has watched these birds coming up a river valley in the spring in april and march to kill all the young ducks and any other small water fowl they can find will know what i mean <e> <s> they are a really voracious predator <e> <s> i can give one quick example <e> <s> we owe quite a debt to iceland for looking after all the many migratory ducks and geese that go there for the summer <e> <s> the icelanders get very little benefit from them because they all return here in the winter to take their chance on these shores <e> <s> but the icelanders look after them well and one of the ways they look after them at least until very recently when i was last there was to put quite a large bounty on the head of all great black-backed gulls which they see as the greatest threat to the breeding of the ducks in their country <e>", "<cs> my lords in spite of what the noble lord the minister said i should like to support the noble lord lord swansea in his amendment <e> <s> it is a serious matter or reasonably so because although i hate to give personal examples having had a semiautomatic for about the last five years i wonder how i ever dealt with vermin before <e> <s> it is a very effective weapon and as the noble lord lord swansea has pointed out it is not in any way an indiscriminatory weapon <e> <s> there is also and i hope that this will commend itself to all parts of the house a humane element here in that it is quite frequent that no matter how good a shot someone is creatures are from time to time wounded <e> <s> with a semi-automatic rifle it is possible to fire a second shot very quickly indeed and thereby put the creature out of its agony it can be fired almost in under a second <e> <s> therefore i hope that the minister will think again about this <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the noble lord lord burton on this amendment <e> <s> as the noble earl lord onslow said the sea is a very big area <e> <s> the feeder streams of rivers are very small and that is where these birds when they come up the rivers do their damage <e> <s> the noble lord lord melchett disagrees with this amendment and i am afraid that i must say to him that the freshwater fisheries have a lot of trouble from these birds <e> <s> he said that there was too little evidence of what damage they did or did not do <e> <s> he then said that therefore it would be best to leave matters as they stand <e> <s> i wish he meant what i understand by that which is to leave them on the list where they can be shot rather than to put them on when there is better evidence <e>", "<cs> i do not want to prolong this debate but i find that sub-paragraph <e>", "<cs> to return to sub-paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords i will be very brief but may slightly surprise your lordships in that if we do divide on this amendment i may find myself in the same lobby as the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby <e> <s> having been extremely keen on shooting all my life i have thought long and hard about these two birds and i have never shot them although i would probably be the only person in the lobby supporting lord chelwood who has almost certainly shot every other bird on schedule parts i and ii quite a lot of other things i should not have done besides <e> <s> these two birds i think are very well worth preserving and i see no call to put them on the shootable list <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble earl lord radnor for clearly introducing this bill he did it in a very nice clear low-key way <e> <s> i think if i had been in his shoes i would have stressed the urgency a little more but then i look at it more from a fisheries point of view than from that of a trout farmer <e> <s> i will come back to that later but all is not always particularly peaceful between the fish farmers of the country and those who look after the river systems in which the fish farms operate <e> <s> however i am delighted at the news we had from the government chief whip that this bill still has a very sporting chance of survival and becoming an act before the end of this session <e>", "<cs> i stand corrected my lords but i believe i may paraphrase <e> <s> what he said in effect was that everyone apart from the gill netters themselves now seemed to be agreed that gill nets were thoroughly undesirable in every possible way and that it was time something was done about it <e> <s> i could not agree more with that and i pass on that remark <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord lord alport for introducing this question <e> <s> i do not think any of us was surprised to find it on the order paper when we came back after the recess <e> <s> as most of us sat there watching the smoke blackening the sky we realised that it was only a matter of whose name such a question might be under and how it was phrased <e> <s> it is not surprising that we are debating the matter but my thanks to the noble lord lord alport for putting down the question <e>", "<cs> my lords before we pass this measure and i am certainly not opposing it i should like to sound a word of warning about the possibility of the overdevelopment of fish farming in fresh water and in river valleys in particular in the south of england where it is most prevalent <e> <s> many of the water authorities and millions of people who fish for pleasure are becoming increasingly worried about the relatively uncontrolled development of table fish farms which often take out a large part of the water from a river and put it back at a different point as well as about some of the pollution that is caused below them in some cases <e> <s> i spoke about all of this during the second reading of the diseases of fish bill last year and i shall not go over it again <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i should like to thank him for answering two of my six questions <e> <s> i am sorry that i bowled him over as regards the other four <e> <s> i suspect that one of the problems here is that this is one of those matters that fall between the ministry of agriculture and the department of the environment <e> <s> however i will be happy to talk to the minister about this matter outside the house <e>", "<cs> my lords it is good to see this reunion of some of the veterans of the wildlife and countryside act <e> <s> it hardly seems like four years since we sat here late one night at the end of a long and contentious process saying kind things about each other on the motion that the bill do now pass <e> <s> however i hope that this little bill unlike what lord melchett calls its parent will have a much speedier and less contentious passage <e> <s> i see it as a good little bill which should in general commend itself to almost anyone who is not a badger digger a deliberate despoiler of the countryside or a believer in big ugly blocks of conifer forest <e> <s> fortunately these three species are so out of tune with public opinion that i hope we can disregard that in the general interest <e> <s> i have a few words to say on the four clauses but i shall be brief because i have no doubt that many noble lords like myself wish to go to enjoy the beauties of the countryside in may on a very fine day <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be very brief as i see people looking around and looking forward to other business <e> <s> i do not hesitate to intervene in a scottish matter particularly being a veteran of a number of lord northfields debates on deer in the past when the noble viscount lord thurso in particular had no hesitation in coming down here and telling us how to run deer matters in england <e> <s> i should like to support everything that the noble lord lord northfield has said other than that i have no experience of his defective draft that made him cross <e>", "<cs> may i suggest that the question is put again <e>", "<cs> i sense we are moving into the possibly procedural end of the discussions <e> <s> i have made no contribution so far having missed the second reading debate because i was abroad when i should have had quite a lot to say <e> <s> i do not intend to give your lordships a second reading speech now <e> <s> the only noises i have made so far were to try and keep this debate alive which has been quite difficult at times because knowing what to say was never all that easy and i noticed that several people on a slightly tactical note were trying to do the same thing <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord the minister sits down can he give us any more encouragement than that as to when we might hear something more from the government on this subject <e> <s> people ask this <e>", "<cs> my lords the day before yesterday i was showing an american friend round salisbury cathedral and i paused to look at a copy of magna carta that they have there <e> <s> there was a great catalogue of far-sighted improvements to human rights and to my delight among all this i discovered what was probably the first salmon conservation order <e> <s> there in the great charter is a provision for the removal of fish weirs on the rivers thames and medway and as an afterthought all other rivers in england <e> <s> clearly at that time they were worried about migratory fish <e> <s> only migratory fish are caught in a fish weir and of those there are only three of any importance the salmon the sea trout and eels which go in the opposite direction <e> <s> there has never been any problem with eel stocks so they must have been worrying about salmon <e> <s> it could be that the weirs on the lower parts of rivers were catching all the fish so that those farther up were not having a fair go but i like to think that even then in they were worried about sufficient numbers of salmon reaching the spawning grounds at the heads of rivers <e> <s> they seem to me to have been even more farsighted in than governments in recent years because again we have a salmon conservation problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to give a cautious welcome to this bill <e> <s> after clamouring for some time for salmon legislation and particularly drawing attention to the poaching menace the last time that salmon were discussed in this house it would be churlish not to say a warm word of thanks to the government and to the noble lord lord gray of contin for now bringing these measures forward <e> <s> but i have to say that after asking for a loaf of bread <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> while i too support this amendment i should not like the impression to go out that the introduction of salmon into rivers which are very short of them is necessarily a bad thing <e> <s> there are not great numbers of salmon in the thames but there are some and if this were carried to too great an extreme and if it was generally appreciated that salmon should not be moved from one river to another there would be no salmon in the thames <e> <s> there are a lot of rivers that will have to be stocked from other rivers because they are very short of fish at the moment <e>", "<cs> i have probably attacked drift netting as often as anybody over the past three or four years on at least every opportunity that the subject has been raised in your lordships house <e> <s> certainly i had plenty to say about the matter when we were debating the second reading <e> <s> i shall try not to repeat what i said on that occasion <e> <s> i have also crossed out the vast majority of the points that i had intended to make tonight because the noble marquess lord lansdowne has made them all <e>", "<cs> my lords it was indeed a major part of my second reading speech <e> <s> it was dismissed at that stage by the noble lord lord gray of contin on the grounds that it was rather complicated and would muddle up english and scottish law <e> <s> but the matter was indeed raised <e>", "<cs> my lords as i suppose one of the greatest hawks against drift netting this amendment seems to be all i am going to get <e> <s> i cannot say a very loud thank you for it but i strongly believe that when we come to talk about this again in three years time and if the government do not find time we will scream for time to talk about it in three years time attitudes may have changed and circumstances may be different <e> <s> thus before i slink away defeated on <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i should properly start as a number of other noble lords have done by declaring an interest in the bill <e> <s> most other noble lords who have done this are so distinguished and well-known that it was hardly necessary <e> <s> i am less so so i must do it <e> <s> i was for years working in a major merchant bank and finished up as a director in charge of investment management activities <e> <s> i am now something of a jack-of-all-trades but several of these are deeply into the investment world <e> <s> i am a director of seven different companies in the city and chairman of a small investment management company which very much comes under the ambit of this bill <e> <s> however i hope your lordships will see all this as a qualification arising from years of practical experience in this field and not as something that will lead me later in my speech into any special pleading <e>", "<cs> preferably in writing i hear my lords <e> <s> truly independent advice on a variety of financial alternatives open to people is going to be harder to find <e> <s> financial intermediaries like insurance brokers unless operating on a huge scale capable of monitoring the whole field of investments available to people are going to find themselves having to ally with one life assurance company or one investment manager <e> <s> the noble lord lord graham commented on that aspect <e> <s> independent advice must be a major part of investment protection but i cannot see that as being anything but stifled in the bill which encourages what i believe is called polarisation <e>", "<cs> i must quickly add my voice to this debate <e> <s> this amendment has a very large element of overkill in it <e> <s> it is fascinating to discuss this matter but if the amendment were to be carried the effects would make so-called big bang look like a very small squib indeed <e> <s> it is tremendously radical <e> <s> i think that the noble lord lord williams admitted that <e>", "<cs> it would be a great help to the committee and certainly to me if the minister could at a fairly early stage tell us what an open-ended investment company is <e> <s> despite my experience in the city i am completely lost <e> <s> i do not believe that it can include an investment trust because otherwise there are many other points as the noble lord lord williams of elvel has pointed out which do not add up to the rules governing an investment trust <e> <s> perhaps the minister can answer that point <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down may i ask a question <e> <s> does a united kingdom-registered quoted investment trust company come within the scope of this clause or not <e> <s> the noble lord lord williams suggested that it might well do so <e> <s> if that is so <e> <s> then i do not think half the rest of the clause makes any sense at all because different laws would apply to such companies <e> <s> could we have an answer to that please <e>", "<cs> i too am neither a lawyer nor an accountant <e> <s> indeed when i first saw this amendment i started off somewhat suspicious of it and almost prejudiced against it prejudiced because i so dislike the letter that company directors usually have to sign at the end of the financial year nowadays whitewashing accountants from virtually any responsibility at all in order to get them to produce the accounts <e> <s> i thought that this was a continuation of the same sort of theme <e> <s> but having talked around various practitioners i am convinced that it is a sensible amendment and i shall support it <e>", "<cs> i too should like to pay tribute to the noble lord lord lucas and to the noble and learned lord the lord advocate for the way in which they have dealt with this bill which has been a very difficult one pushed through at great speed and late in the session <e> <s> i have not said as much as i thought i was going to say during this committee stage because there have been so many amendments new clauses and so on and for the humble cross-bencher with very little support it has been very hard to keep up <e>", "<cs> my lords i support most of the amendments of the noble lord lord hacking <e> <s> i have some difficulty with this group largely because the immunities mean that the attack on the sro or sib is difficult <e> <s> the courts are there for those who feel that they have not been properly dealt with <e> <s> but the nod and the wink is still important <e> <s> it has been immensely important in the city over a great many years <e> <s> i do not believe that it should be done away with totally and utterly so arriving at a situation where people have to spell out in the greatest detail why they do not think that someone is a fit and proper person to be doing whatever he is supposed to be doing <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot support the noble lord lord williams on amendment no <e> <s> a <e> <s> for many years i was a director of an accepting house and <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord did me the credit of looking at me several times while making that speech <e> <s> i did not support him at committee stage on this point and i am afraid that i cannot do so tonight <e> <s> it may well be that we shall have to come back to this chinese wall point at some time in the future but i think at the moment that if we carried this amendment it would cause undue confusion at too early a stage <e>", "<cs> my lords as one who was highly critical of clause during the early stages of the bill perhaps i may be allowed to say a quick word on this amendment <e> <s> on second reading i said that i felt clause as drafted was totally unworkable and i am <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord decides what to do with the amendment i wonder whether he can help me when he replies <e> <s> if i understand it correctly the amendment will apply to such matters as the purchase of unit trusts <e> <s> i should have great difficulty in supporting it if it does and if it were to apply anywhere where moving markets are involved <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord can help us on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to start by declaring an interest which i may have done earlier <e> <s> i am a director of i think five quoted investment trusts at the present time and therefore know a little about them <e> <s> i too await with great interest the noble lords answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i have been listening carefully and i hope with almost a totally open mind and for once i do not think that i have to declare any special interest on this particular amendment to what noble lords on all sides have said <e> <s> the whole debate on this has seemed something like hamlet without the prince because the whole time we have been trying to guess what the sib might do what their rules might be <e> <s> we do not know yet <e> <s> there are still enormous parts of the sib rules to be promulgated in one form or another <e> <s> they are still in draft form <e> <s> i have a note here about matters on which they have yet to produce any draft rules at all <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not going to speak to this amendment but with respect to the noble lord lord ezra i think he is off the point <e> <s> i believe we are putting responsibilities upon the secretary of state <e> <s> perhaps they are not even responsibilities <e> <s> we are giving him the opportunity of looking into these matters and the sib is not mentioned in this particular amendment <e> <s> had it been i should have agreed with him wholeheartedly <e>", "<cs> my lords what i have to say may go slightly wide of this amendment but it is highly germane to this clause and to the future <e> <s> also i reassure your lordships that this is probably my last planned intervention on this bill though it is not a trappist vow if somebody causes me to rise to my feet later <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i shall be briefer than most of the previous speakers and i do not wish to steal any thunder from the very senior bankers and others who will speak after me tonight but i took some interest in this topic when we last discussed it on th october <e>", "<cs> my lords i start by apologising to the minister for not having been in my place when he stood up <e> <s> i think i was not more than seconds behind him and i hope that i did not miss anything vital <e> <s> i see the minister shaking his head <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether we should be here today had not one man run amok last year <e> <s> with equal seriousness i wonder whether we should be here today if the police had been as rigorous as they might have been in applying the existing rules to him <e> <s> frankly i was totally astonished that ryan could possess such an arsenal <e>", "<cs> my lords i declared an interest at an early stage of consideration of the bill <e> <s> i repeat it i am director of a firm of london gunmakers <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that i am chairman of the appeal for salisbury cathedral which has already raised million of the million target that we set <e> <s> will he accept from me that the most difficult question which i have had to ask as regards this appeal is why do not the government help with this <e> <s> will he accept that continental governments almost invariably help <e> <s> will he also accept that there is no doubt whatever that some sort of match-you scheme such as that suggested by the noble lord lord st john of fawsley would have made the job infinitely easier and certainly would have preserved the cathedral for the next several hundred years <e>", "<cs> i have not intervened before on this bill and i was not able to be present for the whole of the second reading but i intervene now because i was at one time what one could call a private miner <e> <s> i was a director of a company that had four small private licensed mines of the type we are now discussing <e> <s> that was about years ago <e> <s> i am no longer a director of that company so i produce that information as a qualification rather than as a declaration of interest <e>"]
