["<cs> my lords perhaps i may first join with the noble and learned lord lord silkin in expressing my gratitude to the house for its generosity and its welcome and then go on to crave still further indulgence if i make a few maiden observations on the green papers under discussion <e>", "<cs> i have attempted to keep out of this debate but i should just like to reiterate the arguments that we on the committee used to allow the surrogate herself to be exempt from any criminal charge <e> <s> we did not like the idea of any child being born as a result of a criminal act and i think that is what really lay behind our arguments <e> <s> the other point is one that has been made before that the urgent purpose of the bill before your lordships is to eliminate the agencies which i fear unless this bill goes through will proliferate <e>", "<cs> my lords i must add my expression of gratitude to the noble earl lord stockton and my admiration for his vision in initiating this debate <e> <s> i must also offer my apologies for not being able to stay to the end of the debate because of an immovable commitment elsewhere <e> <s> much as i should like to hear the noble lord lord young reply to the generous and imaginative offer of the other noble lord i cannot do that <e> <s> i hope that both noble lords will forgive me for not staying to hear them or all the others who are going to speak later in this debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join other noble lords in congratulating the right reverend prelate the bishop of blackburn on his admirable maiden speech and also in expressing my thanks to the noble lord lord annan for initiating this debate and initiating it with a characteristically punchy and thought-provoking speech <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall start by expressing my gratitude for the chance to have a preliminary debate among your lordships on the white paper <e> <s> this is a great opportunity <e> <s> i shall try not to take up too much of your lordships time and therefore i shall confine myself entirely to the questions that are raised in paragraph of the white paper about research using human embryos <e> <s> those have been rightly recognised by the government as far and away the most difficult and controversial issues <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not altogether satisfied with that reply <e> <s> it seems to me that this is a very good chance for an amendment to be introduced to reduce the folly of that part of the act which inhibits the education of a considerable number of children particularly perhaps children who essentially need speech therapy and for whom language is inaccessible without it <e> <s> if language is inaccessible then communication is inaccessible and education is nothing and cannot start <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish at this stage of the evening to waste the time of the house by adding to the general threnody on the hatchet job that is being done on the iba on the almost certain disappearance of the itv companies and on i think this is the saddest point of all the absence of control of scheduling <e> <s> it is almost two years to the day since your lordships debated the peacock report <e> <s> on that occasion i spoke about radio and i want to say a few words about radio this evening <e> <s> however before doing so i should like to say a word in support of what the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe has just said about cable and the beginnings of the delivery of the cable service <e>", "<cs> my lords as the house has heard the issues are complicated and several separate threads have been discussed <e> <s> those threads were lucidly and fairly analysed by the report of the noble lord lord windlesham <e> <s> however i do not want directly to consider the report <e> <s> i want instead simply to restate some of the facts some of which have become a little confused in so far as they have a hearing on the conduct of the iba and its chairman my noble friend lord thomson of monifieth who cannot be present for the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships house has already heard many arguments that have been propounded with great passion feeling and enormous sincerity and doubtless will hear many more before the issue is concluded <e> <s> i hope that noble lords will not be so carried away as to forget to make <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am grateful to the noble earl lord longford for initiating this debate which is extremely timely <e> <s> i say that because hardly had the two new funding councils taken up their tasks than the funds which they have to distribute were radically diminished <e> <s> that has made a difference to their status <e> <s> much of the money which the government forward to the polytechnics colleges and universities will now come indirectly through student fees <e> <s> whether that is a good change is not i think the point at issue today <e> <s> however it means that what the two funding councils have to do is to distribute the remainder of the funds to institutions according to two criteria one is cost-effectiveness and the other is quality <e>", "<cs> my lords i should first like to join in the expressions of congratulation and gratitude to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for his most masterly introduction to this bill which i think has saved many of us much trouble <e> <s> i must then say that i regard it as a privilege to welcome this bill even in a rather faint and faltering voice for which i apologise to your lordships <e> <s> in my view it is a most excellent bill and i do not regard it as too long delayed <e> <s> i very much hope that the sincere but doubtedless protracted expressions of opinion which noble lords will hear today and later with regard to clause will not altogether overshadow other very important clauses in this bill <e>", "<cs> there is often confusion in discussions on the different kinds of surrogacy which exist <e> <s> one kind is the result of artificial insemination by a man to a woman who is not his wife but who is to carry the baby on behalf of the couple <e> <s> the child born of that arrangement is a child genetically connected with the husband but also with the woman <e> <s> in some sense that has been referred to as the flip side of aid <e> <s> the child is partly the child of the commissioning couple but partly the child of another woman <e>", "<cs> the committee that considered the point spent a great deal of time on whether to ask for consent in writing <e> <s> in the end it seemed that if consent in writing were required especially in the case of artificial insemination that might cause a great deal of hardship and a certain amount of confusion <e> <s> the committee received a considerable body of evidence on the subject and the evidence that finally weighed with us was that there were a number of women for whom not having a child was a ground for divorce <e> <s> most of those women were asian <e> <s> many women from that community wrote to us <e> <s> in that community it is presumed that infertility is the womans problem <e> <s> it is not recognised that there is such a thing as male infertility and so those women have to seek artificial insemination with the knowledge of their husbands <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment in whatever words it was put forward would be difficult to enforce <e> <s> i oppose it because amendment no <e> <s> moved by the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor has already taken care of the true issue which is the good of the child which must be considered and taken into account <e> <s> there is to be discussion and counselling is to be given to anyone who attends for treatment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt <e> <s> that word was not used in the warnock report <e> <s> we certainly did not use the word pre-embryo <e>", "<cs> i strongly support the amendment <e> <s> clause deals with quality conditions which have been variously described as bechers brook or the last part of the <e>", "<cs> i wish to speak briefly in favour of the amendment <e> <s> there are two points which are sometimes confused <e> <s> one is the point about overbidding <e> <s> if companies have overbid as the noble lord lord thomson said they will have to make up their money by cheap programming <e> <s> that programming will be of a low quality <e> <s> however there is a further point <e> <s> it may be said that if viewers and listeners are as keen on quality programmes as the noble baroness lady birk has said the market will look after them <e> <s> they will demand quality programmes and such programmes will be made <e> <s> however one must remember that advertisers generally assume that peoples taste is low <e> <s> they will on the whole take up advertising space only where they believe that the great british public will watch it <e>", "<cs> i am far from reassured although i hear what is said and am grateful for it <e> <s> i am not so reassured by the supposition that it is possible that in future the map may be differently drawn and perhaps with more dual regions than before because of the non-viability of the constituent parts <e> <s> that seems to make it all the more important that some of the programmes should emanate from each of the constituent regions <e> <s> i can understand that there could be difficulties about what counts as a constituent region <e> <s> however i believe that those might be more easily dispelled than the fear raised in my mind by a failure to distinguish between a programme that is made for a particular region and one that comes from that region <e> <s> there is a very important distinction <e> <s> i hope that at report stage we may learn more about the plans for the map <e> <s> however i shall not undertake not to raise the matter again at that stage <e> <s> at the moment i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the house is being led along a path which to me at any rate is new it may not be at all new to the medical profession namely the path which follows a distinction between abortion and termination of pregnancy <e> <s> i certainly assumed that the two meant the same <e> <s> but it is very dangerous to make the assumption that in the case of terminations under paragraphs a b and c there is not generally a very strong desire on the part of both the mother and the doctors to save the child if possible <e> <s> we should take that for granted even though people may be able to cite evidence where the opposite is true <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether we are in danger of forgetting the purpose of this amendment <e> <s> as i understand it it is concerned with a very small number of women who seek a late abortion because of the severity and handicap of the child which they are carrying <e> <s> to be in that situation must be a very painful experience <e> <s> however i believe it would be even worse if it were known to the woman that the child was going to be if at all possible born alive <e> <s> i say that because the woman with the consultation help and support of the doctor is actually seeking a termination <e> <s> in such a case this means seeking not to have the child which is so severely handicapped <e>"]
