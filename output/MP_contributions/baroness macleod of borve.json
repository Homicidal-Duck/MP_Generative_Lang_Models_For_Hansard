["<cs> my lords i too am deeply indebted to the noble lord lord soper for introducing this debate this evening <e> <s> i am unhappy if i may say so that i have not the privilege of following the noble earl lord longford who is in a committee upstairs and therefore has taken his name off the list but i am delighted to be able to follow the noble baroness lady faithfull because she has said so many of the things i would like to say and probably will <e> <s> i listened to the noble lord lord soper and one of the things that struck me very forcibly about his speech was the fact that he never once mentioned the victims the aggrieved the people who have had harm done to them though it is because people are aggrieved that people are in prison <e> <s> i think that at all times more of us should think of those people who have been hurt <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i should declare an interest in this debate or perhaps i should declare qualifications <e> <s> i have been a magistrate <e> <s> and therefore i have had the onerous duty of sending people to prison <e> <s> i have been a magistrate for years <e> <s> i have also been chairman of one of the most difficult juvenile courts in this country for the last eight years <e> <s> i am now also a member of the parole board <e> <s> so i hope i have not a bias but i think perhaps i have more than a passing interest in this debate this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that all noble lords in the house will be most grateful to the noble earl lord denbigh for instituting this debate this afternoon <e> <s> those of us who have to deal with young people have realised for some time that drug abuse is an escalating problem and i fear that it will continue to be so in the future <e> <s> i personally am most grateful to the noble earl for bringing this question to the notice of the house <e> <s> however he highlights only half of the problem and i believe that unless members of the house have personal experience of people who are suffering from the results of drug abuse it is very difficult for them to realise the degradation in which people become involved due to the misuse of drugs <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very pleased indeed to be able to follow the most eloquent speech of the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> he speaks so eloquently on so many subjects that it is indeed a privilege to follow him this evening <e> <s> i am also grateful to the noble earl lord longford for introducing the may report to us even at this late hour at which i am on my feet <e> <s> i should also like to pay a very great tribute to the chairman of the committee mr justice may <e> <s> i have the privilege of knowing him fairly well as one of the reasons i am able to speak tonight and i shall be only a very short time is that i am and have been for the last two years a member of the parole board apart from the fact that i have also been for years a magistrate <e> <s> i am inhibited tonight in speaking at all after the noble lord lord hunt who was the first and very worthy chairman of the parole board but it is in the context of my membership of the parole board and of the dossiers that i am able to read more or less fortnightly that i have gained some knowledge of the prisoners views of problems <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords i should like to thank my noble friend lady sharples for introducing a very important debate <e> <s> that is already apparent <e> <s> i for one am sorry that it is only a short debate because in such a short time it is difficult to draw attention to more than one or two of the problems which arise for a small shopkeeper <e> <s> there are two distinct categories of small shopkeepers the one which struggles to keep going in a town where every year more of the big stores are expanding and taking business and customers <e> <s> his main worry is competition the increased costs of employing a few staff the increase in rates the increase in national insurance contributions and often the failure of wholesalers to deliver the goods <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord for clarification on this <e> <s> does he envisage that all detainees in every police station should have all their conversations taped whether at the end of the conversation that man is allowed to go free or whether he is charged <e> <s> furthermore what would happen if the detainee did not speak the language and somebody had to take it all down in greek or cypriot and then translate it <e> <s> further if the detainee was then allowed to go without being charged would the noble lord envisage that tape being destroyed <e>", "<cs> it was whether in the noble lords view if the detainee is then released and the conversation has been taped that tape should be destroyed <e>", "<cs> having heard the noble lord lord wheatley as a judge in scotland i hardly dare rise to my feet for he has said so eloquently what i as a humble magistrate outside london feel very deeply namely that the possibility of being found in possession of an offensive weapon might ultimately deter those who carry them <e> <s> as we all know offensive weapons can be anything from a razor blade to a penknife a flick knife a kitchen knife to a piece of tubing steel or rubber practically anything that can hurt somebody else <e> <s> in scotland as well as in england i am aware that many young people commit crimes because they have in their possession those offensive weapons which give them the courage to go out and hurt maim and sometimes murder other young people <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that answer but is he aware that it is on the suspicion of the local insurance officer that a widows pension is withdrawn if she is thought to be cohabiting <e> <s> may i ask the noble lord in view of the figure that he has given of the widows who are appealing whether he is aware that even pending the appeal the widows pension is still withdrawn and she is not allowed even supplementary benefits <e>", "<cs> my lords considering the obvious interest in your lordships house as regards this matter and in view of the fact that my figures vary completely from those given by the noble lord this afternoon and that it takes up to months for a commissioner to hear the appeals thereby causing a great deal of distress to the woman concerned may i ask the noble lord whether he will please ask his right honourable friend to consider this matter in depth and with urgency <e>", "<cs> as unfortunately i was not able to take part in the second reading may i make one suggestion <e> <s> this follows the statement that this country has been fortunate since to have the butler education act <e> <s> however since then we have had the welfare state and a great many other alterations in the whole way that society and our children are brought up today <e> <s> i support the governments suggestions <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to express agreement with my noble friend lord derwent on the subject of educational qualifications <e> <s> would a person covered by the amendment be required to have attended university <e> <s> that may be relevant in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that many noble lords would entirely agree with the noble lord lord parry <e> <s> however i agree with the minister because we cannot specify all the different categories that there could be as regards members of governing bodies <e> <s> to specify them in legislation and to include them in the bill would in my view be absolutely wrong <e> <s> i had it in mind to table an amendment specifying that an old girl or an old boy of the said school should be a member of the governing body <e> <s> however i felt that that was wrong because it would make the whole bill too specific <e> <s> if noble lords are going to say that the people who appoint governors have no common sense have no knowledge of what is right for their school then i am sorry to say that they have no respect for the heads of those schools and i entirely agree with my noble friend the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords may i add my voice very briefly from the point of view of the courts because i have had to deal with rather young very immature people who go out at my request to make social services reports <e> <s> if i had had mature people who were able <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords i also found this bill very complicated but at the same time very important <e> <s> those who have <e>", "<cs> is my noble friend the minister aware that it is my knowledge perhaps it is not of very great value that when our country is not in a state of great prosperity the pensioners would not wish to be cushioned against its problems any more than any other section of the population <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the very worrying escalation of the carrying of offensive weapons by people of all ages but mostly by the young i wonder whether my noble friend the minister can tell the house how many of those arrested carried offensive weapons <e>", "<cs> my lords i take rather a different view of this bill because for many years in fact since when my late husband was secretary of state for the colonies i have known many of our friends who are the subject of this bill <e> <s> i have met them in their countries of origin <e> <s> i have also met them since they decided to come to live amongst us <e> <s> this bill refers to them all as ethnic groups which like the noble lord lord boston of faversham i dislike as a term but it is a term that perhaps we have to use tonight <e> <s> this term ethnic groups <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble and learned friend for that very helpful reply may i ask whether he would think it right that a man who was completely <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble and learned friend to consider whether members of the jury should take the oath in public and individually <e> <s> it could then be seen <e>", "<cs> my lords after his very helpful replies may i point out that the question also asked what happened to the furniture and carpets in ministerial and presumably official houses <e> <s> i wonder whether the minister could help us on that <e>", "<cs> my lords so much has been said this eveningand the noble lord lord underhill certainly waived right across the whole gamut of this billthat i intend to be very brief <e> <s> i know that there is a lot to be done during this evenings business <e> <s> first i should like to thank the noble baroness for explaining this bill to the house <e> <s> i think i might be right in thinking that neither she nor any member of the government really want this bill <e> <s> it is only forced upon us and the members of our country by the very serious economic situation with which we have been faced since we came into power <e> <s> nobody can say that we were not warned about this before the last general election <e> <s> i remember my right honourable friend the prime minister warned this country before the genera <e> <s> election that she could see that we were going to have a very hard time of it indeed <e> <s> i am certain that it would be right to think that it should not be just one section of the population that should have the very hard time <e> <s> i think that we all expected this <e> <s> the severity of this bill is something which is going to hit us all but maybe that is correct <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that throughout the country magistrates are used to sitting on saturdays in an emergency but that bank holidays are rather different because bank holidays are a holiday for court staffs <e> <s> magistrates being unpaid would of course always be willing to come into a court at any time and on any day but court staffs are entitled to their holidays as well as anybody else <e>", "<cs> my lords the hour is late and i shall be brief <e> <s> i should like to congratulate the minister if i may on the very helpful way in which he presented this bill this afternoon <e> <s> it is an extremely complicated bill and seems to allow for every housing need and every contingency <e> <s> all the is are carefully dotted and all the ts are laboriously crossed <e> <s> but of all the many bills which come before parliament none seems to have fulfilled the old adage of never use one word when will do as much as this one and yet a very important section of the population is hardly mentioned at all <e> <s> i refer of course to those who are without homes of any sort those whose only home is hostel accommodation <e> <s> other noble lords have referred to the many voluntary organisations which provide invaluable service in sheltering the homeless but far too often local authorities give inadequate help <e> <s> those members of this house who are not aware of the problem would i am afraid be deeply shocked by the conditions of squalor in which many people live <e> <s> those of us who are aware of the situation feel that it is incumbent upon the government to direct more resources for the provision of those in housing need in this category <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether he is also aware that there are mothers with children who travel by air that there are also disabled people and that there are also very elderly people <e> <s> none of those categories can possibly manage to use the tube if in fact as is usual they have any luggage as well <e> <s> if you have small children it is absolutely essential to have a bus service <e> <s> is my noble friend also aware that the use of a taxi service or a private car hire service is really beyond the financial means of most people <e>", "<cs> i wonder if i might intervene here <e> <s> several times the noble lord has said that the government are seeking to reduce benefits <e> <s> i do not think that is correct <e> <s> what the government are seeking to do as i understand it is to reduce the increase from per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> not reducing the benefits reducing the increase <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for what he has said about widows being a special case <e> <s> when widows are mentioned having been twice widowed i am apt to plead <e>", "<cs> my lords it falls to me and indeed it is my great pleasure to thank the noble baroness for her maiden speech and to congratulate her on it <e> <s> rarely do we have the pleasure of listening to somebody who has so much knowledge of the subject of the speech that she has given us this afternoon <e> <s> as a professor holding the first chair in nursing she is a very rare person <e> <s> she is also a very rare person in that i am told that she is the first nurse who has been made a peer of this house <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall intervene for only a short time and first i should like to congratulate the noble lord lord hutchinson on catching the chief whips eye at long last <e> <s> i think he has been on the list for some time but now he has caught the chief whips eye <e> <s> i should like also to congratulate very sincerely the noble lord lord hunt and to thank him for a most inspiring speech <e> <s> few people in this house know as much about the prison system and prison inmates as he does and we have been privileged to hear of his own personal knowledge this evening <e> <s> i should like also to congratulate mr justice may <e> <s> i happen to have the privilege of knowing him on the parole board and he is a very hard-working person <e> <s> to produce such a very adequate report in what is a reasonable time took i know a great deal of very hard work on the part of he and his committee and i should like to thank him <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise to the noble lord <e> <s> i thought i was listening to every word he said but i did not realise that and i am sorry <e> <s> such persons obviously add to the overcrowding and the difficult conditions in prisons if they are sent either on remand or to prison following conviction <e> <s> i would make a plea for bail hostels to my noble friend the minister <e> <s> i have a feeling that this will come out loud and clear from the debate this evening <e> <s> it is a half-way house it is somewhere people could be sent without suffering the indignity of being in prison <e> <s> in such a place one hopes they could be kept securely but not in prison surroundings and one would hope that they would be there for only a short time while awaiting trial <e>", "<cs> i too should like to support this amendment as one who for a very short time of the year tries to help those who have not got homes <e> <s> very recently we have had some terrible tragedies where people have been burned and i gather it is now abundantly obvious that there should have been many more fire precautions in those cases but they were not able to be provided because of the lack of finance either statutory finance or voluntary finance <e> <s> people in fact lost their lives in those cases <e> <s> the government have <e>", "<cs> i agree of course with the principle of the amendment and i am sure the committee will agree to it but a few points about it worry me <e> <s> in these days of not only shortage of accommodation but difficulties that young people and others find in getting accommodation at all i am worried least in certain areas local authorities might even evict parts of families <e> <s> i am thinking in particular of the first and second generation of people coming into our country who may have large families <e> <s> it is possible i can <e>", "<cs> i must apologise to the committee for not being in my place when the noble lord lord wallace of coslany started to speak <e> <s> i must tell him that the annunciators in the dining-room were not working and as i was having my first meal of the day i had no means of knowing that he was speaking <e>", "<cs> i am the national chairman <e>", "<cs> may i ask my noble friend to specifically tell us that the minister will also issue guidelines to authorities asking them specifically to consult all the voluntary bodies when they are asking for local money <e>", "<cs> i hope i did not quite say that <e> <s> what i did say was that chairmen of large hospitals are asking for large sums to keep their hospitals going <e> <s> they have not been given them yet but with this bill they will have the power to do so which they have not had so far <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the fact that the noble lord has given the date of december when everyone knows it is likely to be rather cold in this country can he answer two questions <e> <s> first how many people are at present housed in the old hospital <e> <s> secondly can he assure the house that the old hospital will not be closed if alternative accommodation is not ready at the time mentioned bearing in mind that the weather then will be bound to be inclement <e>", "<cs> my lords the hour is late so i shall be brief in discussing this private members bill which comes to us from another place <e> <s> it is significant that although there were members on the committee only were present when this very important bill was discussed in another place for only minutes as has been pointed out <e> <s> i am deeply unhappy about the bill one reason being that as a very long-term motorist who has tried to do as much as i can for safety i read the bill and discovered that the only place the word safety occurred was in clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> in actual fact if you have to change down at a hump you create more noise <e>", "<cs> my lords as one who did not like the first clause i warmly welcome this new clause that we are about to pass <e> <s> it will be welcomed by all spouses whether male or female and any relatives who are enabled because of their qualifications to help doctors in their practice <e> <s> i warmly welcome this new clause that my noble friend has brought to this house today <e>", "<cs> may i intervene very briefly <e> <s> unfortunately i was not able to take part in the second reading of the bill although i was particularly interested in it having been for five years a member of the independent broadcasting authority up until about four years ago <e> <s> i should like to say a word in support of my noble friend lord drumalbyn <e> <s> as i see it this bill is aimed at <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether he could draw to the attention of the post office that members of unions are not necessarily anti-charities <e> <s> i am quite certain they are not <e> <s> would he bring it to the attention of the unions of the post office that it is charities who suffer very seriously indeed because most of them now have christmas cards which are in aid of their charity and they will suffer considerably <e> <s> may i ask the noble lord whether he will bring this to their attention <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell us whether these buses are one-man buses or whether there will be somebody to help with the luggage <e>", "<cs> as i read the long title of the bill this is specifically an artificial hump or depression <e> <s> so it is one or the other and if this bill is passed one gathers that local authorities will be empowered to build either a hump or a depression or indeed <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl concludes he did say that all the people who used these humps are in agreement with them <e> <s> i understood him to say that <e>", "<cs> is the noble earl aware that in abbotshury road in kensington they were laid down and swiftly taken up again <e>", "<cs> i briefly support my noble friend lord lucas of chilworth and lord airedale <e> <s> the regulations as printed are extremely loose <e> <s> for instance clause d empowers the minister to make regulations to <e>", "<cs> as is fairly well known from the one or two temporary road humps that have been put in towns the flow of traffic down those roads is considerably reduced because they are there and therefore the traffic <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord monson drew attention to a country road down which children rode and he thought there should be some means of preventing traffic from going too fast <e> <s> we are discussing a bill under which it w ill be possible for the government to authorise through local authorities the building of humps and depressions <e> <s> i have been riding for most of my life and if i come to a big depression in the road my horse would probably break its fetlock <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister mentioned experiments <e> <s> precisely what experiments have <e>", "<cs> my lords may i very briefly say something about one word in this amendment of which i approve <e> <s> it is the word violence <e> <s> some noble lords have referred to it <e> <s> from my experience as chairman of a very large and very difficult juvenile court i can tell your lordships that over the past few years the number of young people who have committed crimes of violence and who have come before me and have admitted that they have been led on by what they have seen on television has escalated <e>", "<cs> my lords as one who took a small part on this bill in very difficult circumstances in the royal gallery and who was not informed at all though i specially stayed overnight in london last friday in order to take part i should like to support all that was said earlier by noble lords <e> <s> i shall not say what i should have liked to say in a bigger debate but i want to make the point that as drafted this bill is defective in very many ways <e> <s> it leaves so very much to the minister and to regulations that he might make that i could certainly never support it <e> <s> but i should like to know why as the minister said the bill could not go through the other place <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down he has not answered the specific question posed by my noble friend lord lucas as to exactly how much these humps would cost <e> <s> it must be known to the department because abbotsbury road within a borough of london already has i will not say the benefit of humps therefore the department must know <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may interrupt the noble earl for one moment can he tell us how much it would cost to take them down again <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> for the reasons i have given once this afternoon i think this <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether he agrees that socialist-controlled councils and conservative-controlled councils both have long waiting lists of people who want to buy their council houses <e>", "<cs> my lords it is my privilege once again to follow the noble baroness <e> <s> we always come into the chamber to listen to her with rapt attention and she has not disappointed us today for she has got a commercial in as usual and she has made a speech of great courage <e> <s> it was an excellent speech and a delight to hear <e> <s> i was also grateful to my noble friend lord alport for introducing this very difficult discussion this afternoon but there is a long list of speakers so i will intervene only very briefly <e> <s> like other members of this house i wear many hats outside this chamber <e> <s> my hats are all non-political but during my speeches and afterwards when questioned i am invariably asked about my views on the future of this house <e> <s> unlike the noble lord lord reigate i find that all groups of people are not only intensely interested but also want information <e> <s> i must admit that at these times i put forward my own views and although as your lordships will know i am by no means a persuasive speaker i do find that most audiences agree with what i say <e>", "<cs> my lords could the noble lord tell us how many prisoners are detained at present in police cells <e>", "<cs> my lords after the right reverend prelate it is difficult for me to speak because of his well-known eloquence in this house as well as in the pulpit but after years of clean licence the noble and learned lord lord gardiner has outdone me i think by years but perhaps we will argue that one out somewhere else during which i have driven all kinds of vehicles including green line buses when they were used as ambulances during the war i feel i know something about driving vehicles <e> <s> this is my tenth intervention on this contentious issue in your lordships house and for this reason i am perhaps bored with my views on this subject and am interested in hearing other peoples views <e> <s> and i will be brief because i think that up to now all the points that i would wish to make have already been covered <e> <s> so i hope to take less than two minutes <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord lord stone <e> <s> i would be most grateful if i could have <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down will he agree with me that it is possible for the other side to be put forward of families which have suffered a bereavement when somebody has been killed because he or she was wearing a seat belt <e> <s> that is not unknown is it <e> <s> will he agree that that case is equally apposite <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the consumer councils attached to the nationalised industries are of vital importance <e> <s> having been a member of one i know that the main way in which consumers of nationalised industry products can make their position felt is through those consumer councils <e> <s> is my noble friend aware therefore how vital it is that these councils should be kept in being and will he take note of this point <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend give the house any reassuring figures <e> <s> it is within my knowledge that the amount of drugs coming into this country has escalated enormously possibly since the figures referred to were given <e> <s> does my noble friend agree that it is vitally important through both the dhss and voluntary organisations to encourage the setting up of as many drug assessment centres and rehabilitation centres as possible <e> <s> does my noble friend also agree that some young people take to drugs more than they take to smoking or to drink and this is harmful to their future <e> <s> will he <e>", "<cs> my lords will places be reserved for women as well as men and will these units be spread around the country <e> <s> i understand that one is shortly to be opened in wakefield but may we have an assurance that there will be others throughout the country <e>", "<cs> my lords this bill is short but it is very important <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend for explaining it so succinctly but so adequately <e> <s> those of us who have had the privilege though at times and often it is an onerous one of judging cases before us in the magistrates courts will welcome this bill so long as when it is applied in the future it is proved to go far enough <e> <s> i think that only time will tell <e> <s> the problem of judging whether a defendant when seen to be loitering was waiting for the next bus or for his girlfriend or was waiting for the opportunity to snatch a handbag has always been a difficult one <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether he is aware that in the months up to january british gas referred potential cases to the various social services and that out of that number received financial help <e>", "<cs> my lords we are discussing children tonight and before starting my few remarks i feel that i must say how delighted and indeed relieved i am and i am sure all your lordships are that the five children on dartmoor have been found safe and well <e> <s> some of us perhaps have had sleepless nights on their behalf <e> <s> i am delighted to thank my noble friend lord vaux for his speech and for bringing this subject to the attention of the house tonight and also for repeating once again the childrens rights the charter for children so ably put forward during the year of the child <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend not agree that the people from the west indies are part of our society now and that we should in opposition to the question do all in our power to make it possible for them to have the carnival in the carnival spirit that they have always enjoyed in their own country and which if we could guarantee fine weather they would have now in our country <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very pleased to be able to follow the noble baroness lady stedman although i should like to say that i am sorry she is not within arms length of the dispatch box any more <e> <s> i am not going to talk about alcoholism or drinking and driving but i will say just this <e> <s> i was first a magistrate years ago before all these laws were in force and when it was part of the law of the country that anyone found to have more than the permitted amount of alcohol in their blood when they were driving though it was not established what the permitted amount was was automatically sent to prison and i remember very well several people having to go downstairs without being able to go home again <e> <s> having said that i welcome this bill and i am most grateful to the minister for putting such a very difficult bill so briefly and in such an interesting way that we could all understand <e>", "<cs> my lords yes but it did not get very far <e> <s> it was two to one on second reading was it <e>", "<cs> my lords i stand corrected <e> <s> well four times instead of five times we have thrown it out of this house <e> <s> but i welcome in a way the intention to restrain children in cars although personally i think it would be very much better if as the noble baroness lady denington said one kept children under in the back of cars <e> <s> children cannot visualise an accident coming because they have no knowledge whereas adults can do so <e> <s> that is one of the reasons why consistently i have voted for no compulsion over seat belts for adults <e> <s> i think that perhaps if the government still think children under could be in a front seat of a car although i do not think i have ever known of any certainly not in my own family they should be restrained <e> <s> i take the point that with many children going on school runs there might be difficulties in the country districts where they might have to go at vast expense with petrol as it is and therefore they take as many children as they can <e> <s> it is difficult then to retain empty seats in the front of the vehicle <e> <s> i shall be interested to see the ministers new clause on this <e>", "<cs> provided retailers in scotland do not exceed a six-day week they are free to open and close as and when they like <e> <s> they can sell alcohol and they can open banks if they have them in their stores <e> <s> the small shopkeeper who runs his own business often staffed by members of his family can trade when he thinks fit and when it is most profitable for him to do so <e> <s> the result of this flexibility seems to be that in edinburgh and glasgow city centre there are two vast sunday markets <e> <s> it is estimated that one of these attracts to customers every sunday during the height of the season <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend assure the house that if when the deliberations of the working party are completed the government are asked to spend money on anything at all to do with helping the police they will make that money available <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my support to the comments that have been made <e> <s> may i draw attention to the fact that as we all know the blind make up a very large proportion of the people with disability in our country <e> <s> i should like to ask the minister to be quite certain that if officers are to be appointed wherever they are appointed they should know every facet and there are so many of disability including blindness <e> <s> we have here today so many excellent speakers but i should like to speak up on behalf of the blind <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be as brief as possible at the end of what has been a long and trying week in your lordships house <e> <s> i wish at the outset to thank my noble friend lady masham for introducing the bill <e> <s> with her great knowledge she presented it with the customary clarity she brings to anything she does in this house <e> <s> in one of my capacities outside i am national chairman of all the leagues of hospital friends different leagues and in that capacity i have the privilege of working with and trying to help some of those people suffering from disabilities and i mean disabilities in the widest possible sense physical and mental those of us who can get around and those who are bedridden <e> <s> i wish the bill could have helped the bedridden but unfortunately it must aim at trying to implement the act so it deals more or less exclusively with those who are able to get around <e> <s> indeed <e> <s> i wish the bill were not necessary but those of us with problems realise that something must be done and that is why we are so grateful to my noble friend lady masham <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord lucas of chilworth referred to the point about people knowingly travelling in a stolen motor vehicle <e> <s> so far as my own experience goes it refers only to people who are carried in a motor vehicle in furtherance of theft people who should know that the car is stolen <e> <s> that has always been an offence and there is no reason why it should not continue to be an offence in the future <e>", "<cs> i am against the principle of this amendment and i have been against it since when the noble lord lord avebury introduced it as an amendment to the road traffic bill <e> <s> he was defeated i think on that occasion not by me but by your lordships <e> <s> first i am against compulsion <e> <s> all cars but practically no lorries are fitted with belts of varying designs <e> <s> some work some do not <e> <s> but in no case as far as i can ascertain can belts be released from the doorposts <e> <s> it is absolutely essential that they should be to enable the occupant to be rescued following an accident <e> <s> some noble lords this afternoon have thrown out the advice of professor adams of london university <e> <s> why do we not throw out his advice and take that of the transport and road research laboratory <e> <s> i am afraid i am not able to know that <e> <s> it is one of those matters where politicians can make statistics prove whatever they want them to prove <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble friend for all that he has said and indeed to the noble lord lord bellwin and to the noble lord opposite <e> <s> it was my uncle a former lord hampton who introduced into this house the compulsory wearing of helmets for motor-cyclists many years ago <e> <s> he felt that by that he had saved the lives of many young people who were riding motor-cycles <e> <s> one hundred and fifty thousand new motor-cyclists are coming on to the road every year <e> <s> those motor-cyclists are young people and the only reason why i introduced this amendment was to try to save some of their lives <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness sits down i wonder whether she could advise us whether the department of transport also takes into consideration the very important point of prams <e> <s> i doubt whether they do but certainly a pram being pushed along is very similar to a disabled persons wheelchair <e> <s> perhaps the noble baroness could say whether or not the department does take notice of pram-pushers <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness sits down can she tell us what is meant by properly protected <e> <s> a blind person cannot see gates that are put around either a pothole or any other kind of hole <e> <s> i wonder how such places can be properly protected for a blind person <e>", "<cs> i warmly welcome what my noble friend lady young has put forward this evening <e> <s> what worries me very much indeed is this <e> <s> as she implied by the words many local authorities it is the undoubted fact that many other local authorities do not at all consider parking for the disabled <e> <s> my local town is one of them although they have plenty of room <e> <s> i am wondering whether the government perhaps during the course of this review could possibly make it mandatory for all local authorities to provide some parking places for disabled peoples cars <e> <s> it seems to me to be very unfair that some towns are helpful while others are not <e>", "<cs> before the minister sits down i should like to ask whether the government could possibly persuade as well as encourage all local authorities outside greater london to provide parking spaces for disabled people <e> <s> they do not do so at present and it would be helpful if all local authorities could possibly be persuaded to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble baroness for that answer may i draw her attention to the fact that the death grant has not been increased since that during those years inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to tell only briefly of my own experience <e> <s> in years as a magistrate i have only had two cases of indecent pornography in large windows both brought about by private citizens for the reason that my noble friend lord nugent gave <e> <s> both felt that not only they but their friends children were being harmed by these two particular window displays <e> <s> the matter was brought to court and i am happy to say that the magistrates felt overwhelmingly that there was a case and the offender was fined <e> <s> without the private prosecution it might have gone by default <e>", "<cs> my lords may i briefly intervene with a warning <e> <s> there is no reason why sealink should not perhaps become a monopoly in the foreseeable future and once there is a monopoly in transport then the people who run that monopoly business can withdraw their service whether it be on the land or on the sea <e> <s> as i know very well in parts of scotland a firm having taken everything over has withdrawn its bus monopoly with consequent great deprivation to people living in that part of scotland <e> <s> this is only a warning <e> <s> agreeing entirely with my noble friend lord mottistones reasons underlying this amendment i should have thought it helpful if reserve powers even for an independent company were put into this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not agree at all with points discretion <e>", "<cs> i should like to support my noble friend in this amendment <e> <s> i have knowledge of a family where the eldest child is autistic and the result of him being kept at home is that the other children in the family aremaking noisesand <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry but i cannot agree with the statement that my noble friend has made today <e> <s> i was the first chairman of the national gas consumer council <e> <s> i was chairman for five years <e> <s> in that time i was able to assess what british gas does for the consumers <e> <s> it is only on the subject of safety that i am worried this afternoon primarily because to my certain knowledge the people who give after-sales help to those who buy gas appliances from british gas or any other outside outlets and those who service these appliances have to be highly trained <e> <s> one cannot take somebody off the street a plumber or anyone like that and say go and service this piece of equipment <e> <s> i hope that the minister will agree with me that safety for the consumer is paramount and that wherever the gas appliance is sold there must be back-up sales staff who are highly qualified <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister very much for what he has said and to thank those who have contributed to this debate <e> <s> may i say to the noble lord lord porritt that pregnancy is a fact of life and as he rightly said it is one of those things to which perhaps one looks forward but i can assure him that it is a jolly uncomfortable nine months <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords as a result of what the noble lord has said i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i too support the amendment though not the sort of device my noble friend lord cork and orrery has in mind a string loop or something of that sort though i agree it must be possible to release the seat belt not only from a position on the floor of the car but at the door post as well <e> <s> what i have in mind is an ability to unhook the seat belt at the door post at three points <e> <s> i would therefore have three hooks at different levels down the door post <e> <s> if then people must wear seat belts which i am against but your lordships have decided <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord could tell us how on earth anyone could enforce this <e> <s> which motorist is going to stop the vehicle and say move over <e> <s> i should like to know <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may intervene briefly in speaking against this amendment <e> <s> i run across a lot of children with very great difficulties which are the subject of amendments today and it seems to me that those in charge must have the means to restrict guide or in any way deal with those in their care without inhibitions of the law <e> <s> some noble lords may not have had the perhaps doubtful privilege of themselves trying to cope with children who are not like other children <e> <s> nobody wants to lose his temper with the children and it is very rarely done <e> <s> but if we put this amendment into the bill making it possible that anybody who for example slaps a child can be taken to court for that in these particularly difficult circumstances it will be restricting those who are doing their very best to look after the children in the best possible way <e> <s> with my noble friend i hope that the noble lord will withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness sits down may i point out if she thinks that everybody is so worried and so anxious about the whole situation that surely they can make up their minds within five years <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend give us the figures for the same quarter of businesses that have started as opposed to those that have failed <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether he is aware that the answer he has given to this question will not only please all those of us who have had the benefit of being at carnivals in the west indies and indeed notting hill but also all the people within our islands who express their joy once a year at carnival time <e> <s> i am sure that they will have enormous happiness from the answer he has given <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend to ask the departments concerned to expedite the payments to widows because they have been in very great trouble especially those who are bringing up children and suffering real hardship <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that there is disquiet in the country among the able-bodied people <e> <s> in fact will the badge also carry an expiry date <e> <s> because that would catch a great number of people who are using the badges illegally <e>", "<cs> my lords before i start on my few words this afternoon i should like to add my voice to those in your lordships house who have paid tribute to the right reverend prelate the bishop of worcester <e> <s> i have long admired him and i know a great deal about his work as he represents in worcester the see in which i was born and brought up <e> <s> therefore i know a great deal about him and we shall miss him very much indeed and also his words of wisdom <e> <s> i should like also to congratulate the noble lord the canny scot from over the border who addressed us this afternoon in his maiden speech <e> <s> i am sure we shall all look forward to all the wisdom he has to give us in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords through research and personal knowledge i have built up a picture of these young people which is this <e> <s> a young person leaves school with high hopes but often with the prospect of time on his or her hands instead of the routine to which they have become accustomed in school <e> <s> they apply for jobs perhaps or even up to one hundred jobs and they get no reply <e> <s> they get depressed and bored and think that nobody wants them <e> <s> they start frequenting the pubs the discos and street corners <e> <s> a boy then finds a girl who wants him and they live together either at his home or at hers or in a squat <e> <s> within a year a baby is born they apply to the council for accommodation which they can rarely afford because neither is earning <e> <s> he is encouraged by his common law wife they are both <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble baroness give way for a second <e> <s> i have been chairman of a very large juvenile court in a difficult area for many years <e> <s> unless the father was at work and could not get time off i never heard a case and i was chairman without both parents being present if they were living together <e> <s> if they were separated then as the noble baroness knows sometimes problems arose <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all indeed grateful to the noble earl lord longford for raising this problem in his unstarred question this evening <e> <s> may i at once assure him that all of us in your lordships house and a vast number of people outside are very disturbed at the conditions in some of the prisons today which are mostly caused by overcrowding but of course in some cases by old buildings <e> <s> although the subject of the question is specifically wormwood scrubs and the governors letter we all know of other major prisons which are suffering some at least of the same problems outlined in the governors letter <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will be most surprised to hear that i am just coming to that <e> <s> i know that some people will say that given these powers some magistrates may abuse them but especially if we have guidance from on high and being well aware of the prison problems i personally feel confident that this will not happen <e> <s> there will inevitably be a quicker turnover of inmates in some prisons which might necessitate more staff in these prisons to do the paperwork because i believe that there will be a great deal more paperwork <e> <s> but we must try something and i believe that as it is possible to implement this almost straight away and if the home secretary agrees and this is his thinking then i for one realising that these are his thoughts and his thoughts are on the right course will certainly support it <e>", "<cs> my lords will not the noble lord agree that until it is tried we do not know <e>", "<cs> i said will not the noble lord agree that if we do not try it we do not know <e> <s> it has not been tried <e>", "<cs> may i briefly say that it is obvious to all of us with any knowledge of what goes on in psychiatric hospitals or those who deal with those afflicted with these illnesses that in many cases they are not able to understand what are supposed to be their rights as envisaged in this bill <e> <s> but i think we will find that in this bill there will be a guardian a social worker the next of kin or a relative involved and i would suggest that people who will be in one of those four categories should in their <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment because over many years although not over very many cases we in the magistrates courts have had occasion to refer somebody who has been before us to a psychiatric hospital <e> <s> the result of that has been that we have been told there are no places and that the beds are full in fact that they will not be admitted <e> <s> the result has been that the offender has had to go to prison for a psychiatric assessment which the prisons are able to do but in my submission it is not done as well as it would be done at a psychiatric hospital <e> <s> therefore this amendment from the way it is worded will i am sure help the courts a very great deal <e> <s> the minister is to make the appropriate arrangements and this will underline and perhaps bring out into the open the difficulties courts have had for many years <e> <s> i for one am certainly very much in favour of this amendment <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend the minister sits down i should like to raise a point of clarification <e> <s> we are at least i am but perhaps it is only me talking about assessment which is one of the pivots of the bill <e> <s> if two doctors say that an offender should be assessed as to whether he can benefit from treatment in a hospital are we then still to say that unless they agree in court to take that offender under their wing for the days assessment and perhaps short-term treatment that offender would still have to go to prison to get the assessment <e> <s> it is the days assessment that is the problem <e> <s> it is in that connection that we have not been able to get places in hospital <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that answer <e> <s> would he agree with the figures that have been issued which state that during last year motor-cyclists were killed on the roads of this country of them being aged between <e>", "<cs> my lords finally on this matter of lights being on during the daytime will the minister agree that the cc <e> <s> cycles which are used by the young are unable to carry the daytime running lights nor indeed are they able to have a light on throughout the daytime <e> <s> will my noble friend ask the motor cycle association which is particularly involved with motor-cycles and the problems that arise therefrom to set up a study into redesigning the front of the cc <e> <s> motor-cycles thus enabling them to carry lights which could be put on during the day <e>", "<cs> i wish warmly to thank my noble friend for taking this suggestion on board <e> <s> i am certain that no magistrates court would hear a case without such legal representation but as we are trying to make this as good a bill as possible i am grateful to the minister for making this amendment <e>", "<cs> i support my noble friend lady faithfull <e> <s> as chairman of the leagues of hospital friends some of whom are connected with psychiatric hospitals i know that when some patients are discharged they are completely lost <e> <s> we in our organisation try to prevent that by putting them in half-way houses which we rent at a peppercorn rent from the local authorities who are sending their patients to the particular hospitals <e> <s> a great deal of work is done by the voluntary services but i would support entirely what my noble friend has said because a statutory authority is perhaps more able in some cases anyway to help some patients who have been in hospital for a long time and who have completely lost touch with the outside world <e> <s> it is the health and security of knowing that there is somebody in the statutory services who will help them that i believe is very important <e> <s> i should like to support the amendment <e>", "<cs> in my experience which perhaps is not universal there are excellent welfare officers attached to the hospitals who could give advice <e> <s> would they not be the people to ask in that context <e>", "<cs> i agree with bits of all three amendments for the reason that this will put the case across to the public <e> <s> if reports are made annually to both houses of parliament which is what i should like then the public will know far more than they do now what goes on in the mental health hospitals <e> <s> i have considerable experience of this <e> <s> the mental health aspect is surely the cinderella of the whole of the national health service <e> <s> very often it is i am afraid a fact of which people do not want to know <e> <s> if annual reports were published and one would hope discussed by both houses of parliament then the public would <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble baroness lady faithfull can help us <e> <s> it does not seem to me that we can review something upon which we do not have a report <e> <s> we must have reports <e> <s> i do not think that my noble friend lord harmar-nicholls was in the chamber when we had a long discussion on this and i think we all came to the conclusion that a report must be forthcoming <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> it was when i read lord wallaces second reading speech that i thought that this was absolutely vital although i had given it some thought myself <e> <s> the word approved is the one that sticks i am afraid because although one can have approved by somebody or approved for something we are not told that it is necessarily approved for this particular purpose <e> <s> indeed as i understand it the social services as constituted now do not have special departments which are staffed by people approved qualified or trained for any particular part of the social services <e> <s> this might well work but personally i do not think it works for this particularly very difficult area in psychiatric medicine <e>", "<cs> is it not a fact that all our vast psychiatric hospitals have catchment areas which usually include about seven boroughs certainly within the london groupings <e> <s> surely that would make it possible for the seven boroughs to send any representatives to the big hospitals within the catchment area <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords i would like as a very junior back bencher to congratulate very sincerely the noble and learned lord lord scarman on his brilliant report <e> <s> to me it was brilliantly written and brilliantly put together <e> <s> as the noble and learned lord lord rawlinson said most lucidly the report was so helpful and covered so much ground <e> <s> i am very grateful to lord scarman because it was in that my late husband was made secretary of state for colonies and in the ensuing two years i had the opportunity of meeting people not only in london when they came over to conferences but also people whom we are calling tonight the black ethnic minority in their own homes <e> <s> i learnt then to have a great affection for them and to be completely colour blind and i also wished with all my heart that when they came over here to live they would be well and truly absorbed into and be part of our community <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether he is aware that the save the children fund through a sub-committee of the stop polio campaign is doing a very great deal to help save children in africa from getting polio <e> <s> they are having a big campaign in three countries to immunise children against polio and are therefore probably saving the lives of many children <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether he can encourage the ministry to let the local radio stations put out advance notice of repairs taking place <e> <s> some of us like my noble friend go up and down the m a very great deal and it sometimes takes well over one hour longer <e> <s> if we had notice that certain sections were to be repaired at certain times we could allow for that in our schedules <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my voice to those of other noble lords who have congratulated my noble friend lord mackintosh on his maiden speech <e> <s> i had to leave the bench once or twice one reason being that i needed to go down and ask his former headmaster whether he was happy with his pupils success this afternoon <e> <s> his headmaster is sitting below the bar and i am delighted to say that like noble lords he would like to congratulate my noble friend lord mackintosh <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the fact that every other speaker in this debate is a professional person who is qualified in the law it is with a great deal of temerity that i rise shortly this afternoon <e> <s> your lordships may quite rightly ask me why <e> <s> it is entirely because as the noble lord lord hooson mentioned that i read in <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add just one point i have a terrible cold which is why i have not spoken earlier because i have always understood that prisoners have not had a legal right to vote for a very long time <e> <s> a great number of the people we are talking about under one of these two sections are actually prisoners within the law <e> <s> therefore they would not in any case have the vote <e> <s> but as regards the other people those who have not come from the courts under either section that may be a matter for the other house as my noble friend says <e>", "<cs> my lords what worries me is the composition of this panel <e> <s> it seems to me that anyone who faces the possibility of undergoing this sort of treatment will if he is not able to consent himself be the subject of consent by the panel <e> <s> the constitution of the panel is therefore vitally important <e> <s> obviously a different panel must be constituted for each patient and it seems to me that a member of the family should be a member of this panel <e> <s> however in many cases no member of the family will be available <e> <s> it seems that we have to consider how many years the patient has been in hospital <e> <s> if for instance he has been in hospital for seven years or more then he will probably have lost contact with his family and no member of the family will be available <e> <s> in reaching these decisions it is important that we should have on the panel people who know the patient best <e> <s> if a member of the family is not available then i suggest the nursing staff about whom we have heard nothing in this debate but who are the people who really know the patient even better i suggest than the psychiatrist <e> <s> but i would have thought that a top medical panel comprising top psychiatrists were the best people to advise on this very difficult subject <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say how grateful i personally am <e> <s> i was very worried about the word approved and i mentioned that fact at committee stage <e> <s> the noble lord lord elton has adequately explained that things are moving afoot and i am grateful for what he has said <e>", "<cs> my lords i would like to support the line that my noble friend lady faithfull has taken <e> <s> i of course support as other noble lords do the idea that there must be after-care but my noble friend the minister did tell us in categorical terms at the previous stage that there is a provision in the five acts for after-care <e> <s> therefore i do not at this time think it is necessary to dot all these is and cross all these ts once again <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i should like to say i am sure that he would not wish to mislead your lordships or anyone else about the cases at rampton that he has just mentioned <e> <s> i have a certain knowledge as i am sure does the noble lord <e> <s> cases have been brought but only one charge has been found proved <e> <s> having a knowledge of the subject it seemed to me that perhaps the noble lords reference to outrageous i think that that was the word he used goings on at rampton might have misled not only your lordships but people outside the house into believing that charges had been proved in the courts <e> <s> in actual fact they have not been proved and i should like to make that perfectly clear <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether when the government are able to spend this further amount of money on education they will ensure that more subjects at a city and guilds level will be able to be taken by those who are within her majestys prisons <e> <s> would my noble friend agree that a great number of prisoners already come up to that standard and indeed that some other prisoners take and pass open university courses <e>", "<cs> as one who has had the benefit of presiding in court with the help of duty solicitors for very many years i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> i should like to support in particular the words a juvenile court <e> <s> but before it are the words at a magistrates or a juvenile court and i should like to have and a juvenile court <e> <s> that would help the magistrates enormously if for instance there was a not-too-difficult case and they could perhaps put back the case in a juvenile court to the afternoon where the duty solicitors could be consulted by the parents for instance in a care case <e> <s> if we were able to have consultations with a duty solicitor at that time it would save the costs of the court and the courts time <e> <s> then the case would not have to be remanded for perhaps a parent to be represented <e> <s> in that spirit i welcome this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords it is with very great humility that i venture to say a few words in your lordships house this evening following some of the most brilliant speeches to which i have ever had the privilege of listening in the house over the past years <e> <s> it is certainly not for me to congratulate the noble and learned lord the lord chief justice although i personally would like to do so <e> <s> it has been a memorable occasion for me to hear him when i have heard such a very great deal about this great man <e> <s> so this afternoon having had the privilege of listening to him it has made even the slighty long wait to get up on my feet certainly well worth while <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble and learned triend if it is envisaged that the other people whom he will nominate will have court experience in other words that they will be magistrates clerks or people like that <e> <s> i believe it would be helpful to have such people rather than those who are completely outside the legal system <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like very briefly to support my noble friend <e> <s> unfortunately this is the first time that i have been able to do so on what i regard as a very important bill <e> <s> i want to take this opportunity to congratulate my noble friend on piloting the bill through the house <e> <s> i believe that my noble friend lady trumpington has completely and sufficiently covered the point about the conscience clause certainly from my point of view <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with the spirit of this amendment but i do not agree with the amendment itself <e> <s> during the passage of this bill and during the discussion on this particular amendment my latent conscience has been very much awoken because i fear that during the many years when a clerk would come to me and ask whether such and such a person should or should not be granted legal aid because of the facts before me possibly i may have made a wrong decision <e> <s> that is why i should like the possibility of an appeal against a decision although perhaps not put into the act itself <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords i am very grateful to my noble friend lord lucas of chilworth for initiating this debate this evening and congratulate the noble lord lord cayzer on his expert maiden speech <e> <s> the debate has been wide-ranging and indeed noble lords who have already spoken have covered practically all the points upon which initially i had thought of speaking <e> <s> so i shall concentrate tonight on only two small aspects <e> <s> we have heard of the m roads the big roads the rails and the autobahns <e> <s> i do not think your lordships will mind if i lead you down a little country lane <e>", "<cs> unfortunately i was unable to make my contribution at second reading but i want to say one or two words about this clause <e> <s> it is in the nature of your lordshops house and i hope other noble lords will agree that we do not always have to agree with everything that is said especially from my side of the house <e> <s> so it is with a certain amount of trepidation that i agree with every single word that has been said from the other side of the house this afternoon <e> <s> i speak with a certain amount of knowledge in that i was appointed the first ever gas consumer council chairman in and served in that capacity as an offshoot perhaps of british gas or as part of it sometimes <e> <s> we tried to make the safety of gas paramount in its supply to the whole of the country <e> <s> it was a particularly fascinating five years <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend the minister aware that despite the figures that he has given a great number of voluntary organisations of one of which i happen to be the head organise playgrounds for disabled children to play with able-bodied children and do so entirely voluntarily without any funding from the government at all <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord ross of marnock always holds this house enthralled i think that is the expression and we always listen to him very carefully but i cannot believe my ears when i hear him query the fact that planning permission for a pipe-line would have to be obtained from either the ministry or bgc <e> <s> if it is not then anybody would be able to put a pipeline through the noble lords property perhaps without consent <e>", "<cs> my lords we now return to the perhaps slightly mundane debate that we are having following my noble friends report this afternoon <e> <s> however we are in the middle of the debate and it is my turn to continue with thanks to the noble baroness lady stedman for initiating the debate on what i think is an excellent report produced by the department of transport <e> <s> i should also like to congratulate them very much on the work that they have done <e> <s> it has not been my pleasure many times before to congratulate them but certainly it is so this afternoon despite the fact that unfortunately i was unable to go to the conference that has been referred to previously <e>", "<cs> my lords i should very much like to thank my noble friend lord elton for introducing what i think everyone will realise is a very complicated bill <e> <s> he did it so succinctly and i now know much more than i did at the weekend with a wet towel round my head trying to understand it <e> <s> to me this is an important bill <e> <s> i do not pour on it the cold water that some other noble lords have done <e> <s> that may be because it was i think years ago that i was appointed a magistrate and i have served in juvenile courts adult courts and i have sat with a judge in the crown court and also on the parole board <e> <s> therefore perhaps i have a little caring knowledge of the problems with which we are faced today <e>", "<cs> my lords what am i to say to two such noble and learned lords <e> <s> i was delighted to hear that the secretary of state has said <e>", "<cs> my lords i meant to say and feel very strongly that offending children should not be in the same homes with those whose parents have just gone away or something of that sort <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend give way <e> <s> i did not relate a case that i had although i meant to do so but may i now relate <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend the minister whether the lump sum is taxable <e>", "<cs> my lords at this stage having listened to everything that has been said i am slightly surprised that so many noble lords seem to have encompassed in one speech many of the amendments which we are debating this evening <e> <s> the noble baroness lady fisher very ably moved amendment no <e> <s> a in committee and on that occasion the house agreed with her <e> <s> she very ably put forward the primary problem which we were all facing about consumers and safety <e> <s> very soon after this amendment was carried the parliamentary draftsman told me and perhaps he told the noble baroness that this amendment was in the wrong place <e>", "<cs> my lords i was about to say that i have seen the secretary of state and it was he who told me that this amendment was in the wrong place <e> <s> apparently he must have been told this by the parliamentary draftsman which is perfectly in order and perfectly correct <e> <s> no i do not have knowledge of who these people are <e> <s> but apparently noble lords and noble baronesses on all sides of the house were trying to put the provision in the wrong place <e> <s> i accepted that i think quite rightly because i am no lawyer <e> <s> this is why the same words as have already been put forward this evening are to be included in an amendment which i shall move to clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i have heard amendment no <e> <s> a mentioned <e> <s> i have a copy of the marshalled list which i picked up earlier this afternoon and there is no mention of amendment no <e> <s> a <e> <s> if the noble baroness can tell me what it is about it would be helpful <e>", "<cs> my lords at report stage i am not allowed to address the house again as the noble baroness will be aware <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like if i may to thank my noble friend very briefly but very sincerely indeed for agreeing to this amendment as i understand he has <e> <s> certainly it has been part of the governments philosophy to put into this bill the safety angle <e> <s> i have been very grateful to my noble friend and his colleagues for all that has been done to help me over the drafting of this amendment and i should like that to be recorded <e> <s> i gather that my noble friend is agreeing to this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend the minister for accepting this

short and there is more business to do <e> <s> i am grateful for the sympathy of the noble baroness lady fisher she made her point very well in a wide-ranging speech <e> <s> since amendment no <e> <s> a to clause we have come quite a long way in that as noble lords opposite will agree we have not only put safety first which we all agreed was most important but we have put it in the right place in the bill it now appears in clause and that must be read in conjuction with the whole of clause which is a most important provision in that it gives power to go into homes to see that all appliances are satisfactorily installed whether they have been put in by british gas or by private people <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend the minister whether he is aware that the parliamentary information technology committee is arranging an exhibition for the telecommunication engineering and manufacturing association in the upper waiting hall of the palace of westminster between th and th july <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may very briefly support my noble friend <e> <s> we are dealing here with young people under the age of <e> <s> that incorporates those who come before the juvenile benches and also the young people who come before the adult benches <e> <s> therefore one has to see where one can send the worst of the possible offenders on remand <e> <s> i have had the privilege of being in an area psd where we had two very good remand homes <e> <s> the noble baroness lady birk referred to holloway where they are all girls and women and although i am well aware that there are unfortunately an increasing number of girls who are getting into trouble with the law i suppose that we are really thinking of young men <e>", "<cs> i should like briefly to intervene <e> <s> the noble lord lord elystan-morgan drew our attention to the possibility of a youth custody scheme <e> <s> it seems to me from what he and the noble lord lord donaldson have said that it would be at the direction not of the courts but of the home office as to where any of the juveniles that is the under-s we are still talking about should go <e> <s> if the direction of their destination should be left in the care of what we must call civil servants instead of the magistracy instead of the law then i am sure that that would be wrong <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend sits down may i ask whether he would agree that the boy who has been in detention has to have had re-offended before we can get any figures at all <e>", "<cs> is it not correct and the detention centre short sharp shock treatment started in april that the person who has left the detention centre has to re-offend before one can get any figures <e>", "<cs> i should like very briefly to support my noble friend lady faithfull for the reasons given by the noble baroness lady birk who as a very experienced magistrate has put the side of the magistracy <e> <s> i also agree with the reasons given by the noble baroness lady faithfull <e> <s> i think that uniformity would be brought about by these words being put into the bill and i warmly support the amendments <e>", "<cs> i wanted to say something and it seems to me that this is the right part of the bill at which to do so in view of the noble baronesss amendment <e> <s> last weekend i was sitting next to the former lord mayor deputy now of birmingham who was the chairman of the committee of social services <e> <s> i was fascinated by what he had to tell me in that large and difficult city <e> <s> he as chairman had been round to all the establishments run by the social services <e> <s> he had found that those establish <e>", "<cs> very briefly may i say i believe this should be absolutely mandatory <e> <s> i would agree with the noble lord who said that in the majority of courts that would obtain and they would have a medical and especially if the magistrates concerned had been to a detention centre themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend tell the house how many young people are actually taking part at this time <e>", "<cs> i wish to support this amendment for the reason that one knows that not only children cannot express themselves but that sometimes parents are almost illiterate and this is an important factor <e> <s> i should like to inquire into one other point <e> <s> the noble lord seems to think perhaps rightly and maybe i am wrong that because a child is subject to a care order and is therefore removed from home it will be automatic that the child will go into some custodial setting <e> <s> what i have in mind and i should like the noble lord to tell me if i am wrong is that foster parents should be included in this <e> <s> i personally feel this is far more important than any other kind of non-custodial treatment for a child <e>", "<cs> may i instance one type of case with which we are dealing namely juvenile arsonists <e> <s> for juvenile arsonists you simply must have secure accommodation <e> <s> if you do not have it in the region you must have it in a local prison <e> <s> these might well have and in many cases they do have a boys section it is very important that magistrates should be able to remand in custody cases of that kind <e>", "<cs> i personally do not think that this amendment is necessary <e> <s> it seems to me that in this bill we are trying to dot every i and cross every t <e> <s> we are not giving any powers even to magistrates to use their imagination in facing cases as they come before their courts <e> <s> i have always maintained and indeed i have operated it that one should have the ability to make the parents pay any fine or compensation <e> <s> it has always seemed to me that the problem with this bill is that we are legislating for children up to the age of <e> <s> i have always thought that any child who reaches adulthood in law at the age of should after that age be responsible for his own fines <e> <s> with respect to the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones i believe that this amendment crosses too many i s and dots too many ts or <e>", "<cs> i shall be very brief <e> <s> as the noble and learned lord said we have at last reached a part of the bill which might be of some help on the matter of the prison population <e> <s> the first part was obviously of no help as we decided that no young person under the age of should go to prison <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend a question <e> <s> the words ever <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether my noble friend can help the house <e> <s> as i think my noble friend told the house that these drugs <e>", "<cs> having sat on life panels many times i must correct the noble earl and i assure him that what i say is correct <e> <s> i query his premise of putting time limits on anything because as he knows prisoners vary and their sentences vary and even life sentences vary <e> <s> i remember the four years during which i was a member of a panel that was instrumental in letting out within five years somebody who had been sentenced to life <e> <s> with the greatest respect i consider that if we stipulate years or even within a period of years that would not be a good thing to do <e> <s> i would have nothing to do with putting any period of time on anything including the months or the months <e> <s> i say that because to do so would perhaps wrongly make the inmate aware that his case might be reviewed at either months or months <e> <s> that would not give enough time for him to improve or for his rehabilitation to be effective <e> <s> also <e>", "<cs> i was moving on to a further point which is as follows <e> <s> each time a prisoners case is reviewed the whole processs has to be gone through again <e> <s> there have to be all the probation officers reports the home office reports the prisoners personal reports and the reports from the prison staff <e> <s> if that is done every months or months i do not think that any member of a panel be it a lrc or the parole board would glean much information <e> <s> i would go along with what in my view is the very well-drafted clause in the bill and for the reasons that i hope i have adequately explained i would not support the amendment <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness sits down may i say that the parole board do not release people they make recommendations to the home secretary <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord to clarify a point <e> <s> he referred to the joint committee of which he was until yesterday chairman <e> <s> i was referring in my few words to the lifer panels <e> <s> the noble earl lord longford was referring also to the joint committee but i presumed -and perhaps i was wrong that he was referring to the lifer panels which take the case further along the road <e> <s> if i am wrong in thinking he was referring to the lifer panel i apologise to the noble earl <e>", "<cs> i would like to support this amendment and first pay tribute <e>", "<cs> i must apologise to the noble viscount lord ingleby <e> <s> before saying my very few words i would like to pay tribute to the noble lord lord harris of greenwich who has led what i am quite certain he does not think of as a quango <e>", "<cs> if only a quango had worked as hard as we have worked and as hard as the noble lord lord harris of greenwich has worked for the past four years <e> <s> the noble lord worked considerably longer hours than i did <e> <s> each panel before i sat on it worked for at least hours <e> <s> that is not a quango <e> <s> i doubt also whether the noble lord lord harris of greenwich would agree that we sat behind locked doors <e>", "<cs> in theory but only in theory this amendment might be a good idea to give prisoners reasons for the decisions of the parole board <e> <s> but i doubt whether in practice it would help the inmates concerned because the inmates would be able to query the decisions <e>", "<cs> once that is allowed then one has to set up an appeal procedure <e> <s> under an appeal procedure it is quite possible that the appeal would not be heard until after the next possible release date of the inmate concerned <e> <s> when querying the reasons on appealing information about that inmate might be given which could be prejudicial to him <e> <s> if reasons were given either by the lrcs or by the parole board the effect might be to lengthen the inmates term in prison rather than shorten it <e>", "<cs> i was not a member of a local review committee but practically every time i sat on a panel a member of the local review committee at his behest was invited to sit in on a parole panel <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down may i ask whether it includes squatting <e> <s> is it about squatting <e>", "<cs> i was driving along the a last autumn <e> <s> a very bad farmer had lit his stubble on a wind which was obviously travelling very fast <e> <s> it came right across the ai and caused a car pile-up

bill which are given to fixed penalties and having listened to mn noble friend the minister the fog i am in is even thicker than it was before <e> <s> before he sits down may <e>", "<cs> i am sorry but the noble lord lord mishcon gave the committee to understand that he is always very good and carries his licence <e> <s> most people do not <e> <s> then what happens <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend sits down i wonder whether he could tell the committee if in the past there has been written into an act anything like the mph limit because i have felt that though it was generally accepted

be written into an act <e> <s> can my noble friend help <e>", "<cs> may i express the hope that the lord advocate will be here next week to help us on these clauses because it does seem that the united kingdom is by no means united when we are discussing this bill <e> <s> it seems to me having read these three clauses clauses and that if one were on holiday in scotland and one infringed a part of the scottish law one would have to go back to england and come back to scotland to hand in ones licence <e> <s> i am very much hoping that the fog around these clauses will be clearer than a scottish mist when the lord advocate comes next week <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord underhill for drawing these figures to our attention <e> <s> uniformity is vital <e> <s> as a magistrate i know that throughout the country there is not uniformity of penalty for all sorts of motoring offences <e> <s> this causes a lot of trouble to people who come before the court <e> <s> if we could start by saying that the fixed penalty notice must be administered in exactly the same way throughout the country i certainly agree with the noble lord that that would be helpful <e>", "<cs> following those comments of the noble lord lord mishcon may i ask my noble friend whether it is a fact that nowhere in the bill is it laid down that the forms themselves shall be uniform throughout the country <e> <s> if not i feel very strongly that ensuring they are uniform must be part of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether the aid is being given in financial terms or in actual goods which they can use <e>", "<cs> i should like to agree with the noble lord lord underhill on this matter <e> <s> it is wrong that somebody who has not had any correct training should do this <e> <s> i have looked at clause which i feel covers this point <e> <s> i wonder whether my noble friend will be able to assure me on this <e>", "<cs> may i make a comment on this clause because i understand this is the last clause which deals with fixed penalty notices <e> <s> i should like to ask my noble friend if he will take on board that in future when this bill is implemented there should be a great deal of publicity given about fixed penalty notices <e> <s> those of us who have discussed it perhaps now understand it better than we did previously but the general public have not had the opportunity of listening to our debate nor perhaps have they had the opportunity of reading a great deal about them <e> <s> would it be possible to draw public attention to the fixed penalty notices fairly vehemently <e> <s> because they will not understand it unless the government take a hand <e>", "<cs> i agree but it was a pity that the department did not let anybody except perhaps the opposition front bench have the list <e>", "<cs> any noble lord who believes that greater london is in any way helpful towards disabled people really needs himself to be disabled to find out that that is not so <e> <s> the situation is absolutely impossible for disabled people <e> <s> the orange badge is never recognised and now the minister has told us that the other badges for westminster camden fulham and chelsea will not be recognised either <e> <s> so for disabled people life will be even more difficult than it has been in the past and it has been bad enough <e>", "<cs> my noble friend has just said that the holder of a hgv licence is not necessary <e> <s> if the vehicle is a lorry and the lorry then has to be moved before being clamped in probably another dangerous position the lorry mover must have an hgv licence <e>", "<cs> may i intervene briefly <e> <s> i am aware that the hour is getting late <e> <s> but i have not declared as i was unable to be here at the second reading my deep-rooted objection to the whole of this clause <e> <s> i will not be long but it is important <e> <s> the noble lord lord mishcon directed us as did the noble lord lord lucas to make your lordships aware that the other place did not consider this point at all <e> <s> in fact this discussion this evening would have been an eye-opener to the other place as to the ways in which it is very likely that this clause if it is implemented will not work <e> <s> the aa and the rac as many noble lords will be aware are deeply against the implementation of clause <e>", "<cs> if you are not going to move a vehicle when it is in a place that might be dangerous or might be an obstruction what on earth is the point of clamping it down in that place <e>", "<cs> will the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> say how many cars are taken each year in greater london <e>", "<cs> my lords may i rise briefly to disagree with the noble and learned lord lord eiwyn-jones and others who have supported him <e> <s> the government are now trying so far as i can see to have a new structure for trying to persuade young people not to re-offend <e> <s> it is not necessarily punishment sometimes it is rehabilitation sometimes trying to persuade them not to re-offend <e> <s> the young people in our country today are re-offending at a great rate and they are committing as we all know very violent crimes <e> <s> dealing with the detention centre the children sent to a detention centre would be there for a minimum of days and a maximum of four months from which is deducted remission <e> <s> they have remission automatically <e> <s> the length of time they stay at the detention centre is governed by the warden of that centre <e> <s> he decides on their behaviour within the detention centre how long they shall stay <e> <s> when we move on to the youth custody centres which are almost in place of borstal which will now be taken out of the system children then will be encouraged to be rehabilitated they cannot be within three months which is the amount of time they will be in with remission <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord sits down if he wishes to do away with the detention centres may i ask him whether he envisages that children will be sent to up to months across the board and not have the opportunity of going for days <e>", "<cs> my lords this is rather a long-winded amendment <e> <s> can we not just say and give their reasons in open court <e> <s> that would be enough and is usual <e> <s> it seems to me that it is inferring that the chairman of a juvenile court is somebody of perhaps very little experience <e> <s> i can assure the house that they are people of wide experience who will be able to put the reasons before the parents the children and the social workers in perhaps better language than this <e>", "<cs> my lords may i briefly support this amendment <e> <s> the noble baroness lady bacon with her wide knowledge from the home office side has hit on a very great problem in that when we try to send somebody into medical care a different department is concerned <e> <s> this has been the problem for a very long time <e> <s> not only is it a different department but it is also a problem to try to get psychiatrists to take the children involved from a court <e> <s> this has been a real problem <e> <s> i shall be most interested to know what my noble friend is going to say <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i wonder whether recently he has visited many childrens custodial establishments <e> <s> at those that i have visited although they have been <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very sorry this evening to have to disagree with my noble friend the minister for the reasons that other noble lords in particular the noble lord lord wigoder have given <e> <s> we are in danger of putting into a bill something which a child will know is not enforceable <e> <s> he will see to it that it is not enforceable because as other noble lords have said a child or the parents will agree to anything in court whether they are told to agree or are just persuaded because they are given the problem of deciding what is to be done <e>", "<cs> my lords i would like to support my noble friend <e> <s> we are making a very long bill of this <e> <s> it has to be put into paperback if i may say so for clerks and even magistrates to understand it <e> <s> to add something that is already in the bill is as my noble friend has said quite unnecessary <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord wigoder said and this is to my certain knowledge too that if you impose a suspended sentence on one defendant and a fine on another the man who is given a fine thinks that he is very hard done by while the man who receives a suspended sentence thinks that he has got off <e> <s> it is very important that if a person receives a suspended sentence he should realise that it will be activated and that there will be no two ways about it if he breaches his suspended sentence <e> <s> therefore i should have thought that the judge who tries the second offence ought to have the opportunity to use his mitigating powers if he so wishes and to take into consideration the fact that there is a suspended sentence <e> <s> it would be very unwise for any court to give the impression to a defendant that a suspended sentence is not going to be implemented <e> <s> it would be seen to be undermining the opportunity to impose suspended sentences <e> <s> therefore i come down against this amendment because it is very important that suspended sentences should be not only taken into consideration but always activated <e>", "<cs> my lords may i agree entirely with this amendment speaking from the few years experience i had as a member of the parole board <e> <s> it is very obvious not only from the figures the noble lord lord harris has quoted but also from ones own knowledge that trafficking in these very serious class a drugs is increasing far more quickly than perhaps some of us within this house realise <e> <s> as the noble lord lord harris said it kills people a very small amount can kill a great number of people <e> <s> i wholeheartedly agree that it should be added to the list the noble lord is proposing <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend the minister whether from his expert knowledge of

more than some of us can take in the morning and in the evening <e>", "<cs> my lords i and many thousands of people in this country had hoped that this day would never come for over the years we have been told <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend rises to answer questions i wonder if i may ask him this <e> <s> this amendment states <e>", "<cs> i disagree with this series of amendments my lords because they attempt to dot the is and cross ts rather too much <e> <s> after long experience i feel that every case and every child parent and guardian is different and that one must do the best one can to judge each case on its merits and act accordingly <e> <s> i have always been led to suppose that if one fines a child the parents are responsible not only for the actions of the child but for any financial commitment that that child might fall into up to the age of discretion which is or <e> <s> for that reason i do not consider the amendments necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords may i briefly make one or two points about which i feel very strongly <e> <s> first our prisons are overcrowded because there is a violent increase in crime <e> <s> secondly i should like to ask the judges concerned not to send people to prison for what we call relatively minor cases in other words i should never send anyone to prison on a drunken charge <e> <s> perhaps i would do so if the charge was one of being drunk and disorderly and the accused had been guilty of it several times but never just for drunkenness <e> <s> i know that there are many people in prison for that offence <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to add my words of welcome to these new amendments <e> <s> i should like to ask my noble friend the minister whether he will see to it either through regulations or through whatever other means the minister has that speed of decision is made possible within these regulations <e> <s> i am informed by several psychiatrists that they worry that if they have to ask for several people to give their consent even perhaps outside the hospital as i think the noble lord lord winstanley suggested the speed of the decision might be slowed down <e> <s> i understand from the people who have spoken to me that speed is very often of the essence <e> <s> i hope that that will be made quite plain when the regulations are laid <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords i am indeed grateful to the noble lord lord wells-pestell for once again treating us to his wisdom as always on this particular subject <e> <s> i am going to speak for only a very short time on a very narrow point which has not been touched on so far <e> <s> i am going to speak about prevention and in particular about poliomyelitis <e>", "<cs> my lords after four weeks absence from your lordships house because i was careless enough to trap a nerve in my back i am unhappy that i should feel it vital to come here tonight and in the light of my experience in the last years of dealing with the probation service speak

govenment for the last years <e> <s> indeed when mr jenkins was home secretary from to in the last labour government nothing effective was done to alleviate the worsening situation worsening because the level of crime was already escalating <e> <s> mr rees followed him as home secretary and in although warned then of the total breakdown in the prison service he established an inquiry under mr justice may instead of starting the lengthy process of building new prisons <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister in view of his last answer if he can tell us who is responsible for implementing everything that the department in very good faith tells the schools to do <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend the minister whether he can confirm that due to the governments order recently those young people who are out of work and who also have no home to go to can in the future give a hostel as their home address bearing in mind that a person cannot get a job unless they have a home address <e> <s> can the minister tell me if that is now the case and if it is for how long each young person would have to be in a hostel before that address may be used as a home address <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like very briefly to intervene <e> <s> i have had quite a lot of experience of dealing with young people and i realise only too well that both north and south of the border this addiction is becoming far more prevalent than i think most of us are aware of <e> <s> it is high time that such a measure was brought before both houses <e> <s> so i should like to welcome this measure and congratulate the noble lord lord ross of marnock who has introduced it <e>", "<cs> my lords the hour is getting very late and i hope therefore to be brief <e> <s> however i should like to mention some of the young people of this country <e> <s> let me begin with education <e> <s> i had planned to deal with that matter in a certain amount of depth but my noble friend lord beloff has made such a very interesting speech on that subject that i shall make only one comment on it <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say that it is government policy that eventually the coin will take the place of the note <e> <s> i ask this specifically because i can foresee a time when charities will suffer considerably <e> <s> people now put or if they are generous in an envelope but they cannot put coins in an envelope <e> <s> can my noble friend tell me how long the note will be part of the currency <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend what percentage of the doctors in each of the services are women <e>", "<cs> my lords although i agree with the principle of this question does my noble friend really think that given all the power that would be given to local authorities in this bill if it comes about it would in actual fact be enforceable <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend how many of these cars either as a percentage or in numbers have been exported <e>", "<cs> my lords ever since and the appointed day of st april i have been not only interested in but have had something to do at various levels with the national health service <e> <s> so to me it was especially interesting to hear the very valuable contribution made by the former minister of health the noble lord lord ennals this afternoon <e> <s> i very sincerely congratulate him on his speech <e> <s> as he will know but perhaps other members of your lordships house will not know he did not succeed my late husband because he was secretary of state from to but they both held the same job <e> <s> indeed perhaps it was during those four years that i learnt the most about the health service <e> <s> certainly since then i have been as the noble baroness lady robson would have said at the coal face <e> <s> therefore my contribution this evening is very basic very down to earth and i am afraid that my speech will not be on the high ministerial level of the speeches that we have heard throughout the afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to follow the noble lord lord hatch because i agree with him that this is not just a legal bill it is a human bill <e> <s> indeed that is what i think the noble lord said <e> <s> i am most grateful to my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor for introducing the bill <e> <s> for many years i in company with many other people have been worried about the financial strictures of the the and other acts and have felt that much more flexibility should be given to those who adjudicate on separation orders and on divorce proceedings <e>", "<cs> my lords in reference to the answer given by my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor can he confirm that it is now policy to replace police court staff with civilian staff in magistrates courts <e>", "<cs> may i very briefly add a word <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord denning was very persuasive about trying to make the scottish law the same as the english law <e> <s> i was married to a scotsman but i am a sassenach and half french <e> <s> therefore i do not feel i can go all the way with him on those grounds only and i am afraid i do not go very far with his argument either <e> <s> as i tried to say very inadequately on second reading i have done a lot of homework <e> <s> during this last weekend i have seen young people of ones childrens ages not necessarily very young still but they know what is happening in the world and i asked them how they feel <e> <s> every single one said that he or she thought it would debase marriage still further if we allowed young people or newly-weds of whatever age to take divorce proceedings at any time that they so wished <e> <s> they all felt oddly enough as i very much older also felt and tried v to say on second reading that a couple should not enter marriage knowing that if they had quarrels or if there were problems they need not necessarily fight on to try to make the marriage work but could go round the corner to the divorce court within a year <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank my noble friend the minister very sincerely for giving us a very helpful and encouraging reply to the question posed by the noble lord lord boothby <e> <s> may i ask him whether the million which will be enormously helpful to all those who are trying to help in this field is likely to be given to helping via hostels those people who are now drug addicts <e> <s> if so that would be of great assistance <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we are all most grateful to the noble lord lord molloy for asking her majestys government <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords i am grateful to the noble baroness lady burton of coventry for drawing our attention to some of the problems relating to fuel in this country today <e> <s> the noble baroness as we know is an absolute expert in your lordships house on consumer affairs <e> <s> the hard-hitting speech to which we have listened this evening was one that we are used to hearing <e> <s> the noble baroness never minces her words she is always on target <e> <s> i personally always enjoy what she says although i do not always agree with it <e>", "<cs> my lords the few remarks that i wish to make this evening and they will be few are made in my capacity some years ago as the first chairman of the gas consumers council <e> <s> i hope that noble lords will forgive me if i cannot allude to the electricity council although i was aware in those years of what it was doing <e> <s> however i obviously had more knowledge of what the gas consumers council and british gas in particular were thinking <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is entitled to his opinion <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say when the orders to which he has referred this afternoon will come into practice <e>", "<cs> my lords it falls to me to have the honour of congratulating the right reverend prelate the lord bishop of bristol on his maiden speech this afternoon <e> <s> the bishops on these benches are of a very very high order as we all know <e> <s> the right reverend prelate the bishop of bristol is certainly no exception and we have listened very sincerely to all that he has said in his great wisdom about this particular bill this afternoon <e> <s> i feel personally that if the bishops give it a warm welcome and indeed if the noble lord lord avebury also gives it a warm welcome then the bill must be a good one <e> <s> i should like to congratulate my noble friend the minister lord elton on his very succinct speech <e> <s> i do not agree with his words when he said that he did not <e>", "<cs> my lords we are talking are we not <e> <s> about people who have been sentenced to a considerable number of years of imprisonment for having in their possession drugs with a street value of probably from to <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend the minister ask the road research laboratory to look into the possibility of putting hooks on drivers doors so that a seat belt can be unhooked rather than always having to be cut away by those trying to extricate passengers who have been in an accident <e>", "<cs> my lords with other noble lords i should like to thank my noble friend lord cockfield for the particularly succinct way in which he introduced this very complicated and difficult bill <e> <s> we have heard a lot of brilliant speeches this afternoon but i shall not follow any of them except that i am going down the road of the noble earl lord longford <e> <s> i certainly could not follow the noble lord lord molloy who i think said that vandals are more likely to vandalise telephone boxes if they are in a private enterprise than if they are in a public enterprise <e> <s> i cannot follow him on that one <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend the minister tell the house what are the ages of childbearing for women <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend the minister whether the operators of long heavy vehicles coming from the continent will be asked whether they will also abide by the standard when they bring such vehicles into this country <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether she is aware that under this scheme widows are for the first time able to claim sickness benefit and that that is of enormous help to them <e>", "<cs> my lords i was one who did not agree with my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor over this matter in committee <e> <s> like the noble lord opposite i wanted to try to get a longer period <e> <s> at that time i was not convinced by my noble and learned friend with all his wisdom <e> <s> as i recollect he tried to convince a rather sparse committee <e> <s> however i should like to put on record that today i am convinced by all that he has said and i shall be voting with him this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say a few words since i fear that i cannot agree with the amendment <e> <s> those of us in this country who try to follow the matrimonial law and indeed some of the very sad divorce cases that we are told about are conscious of the divorce judges and registrars who have always been gentle perhaps in the rather old-fashioned sense in that the wife has usually been given the benefit of the doubt <e> <s> the judges have felt that they had to look after the woman and the husband had to pay <e> <s> i am glad to say that the divorce judges still behave like gentlemen even though during the last years the social and matrimonial scene has changed considerably <e> <s> the change has occurred partly as a result of the sex discrimination act and partly because many more women have had premarriage jobs are now working and can support themselves <e> <s> to my certain knowledge the result of that situation is that by their behaviour wives are increasingly breaking up the family <e> <s> this is happening far more often than it did years ago and in some cases wives are leaving their husbands and children to fend for themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like very briefly to welcome these regulations and congratulate my noble friend on bringing them before the house tonight <e> <s> i will not go through the regulations again because my noble friend has cogently and expertly presented them to the house and has provided full details <e> <s> i welcome these regulations because as a very keen motorist i am well aware of the fact that not only are many more children riding bicycles on the roads of this country today but many more adults also <e> <s> if bicycles have to conform to a standard in the future that will be of great benefit not only to cyclists but also to other road users <e>", "<cs> my lords i should also like not only to thank the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs for an excellent speech but to congratulate her on being so clever on being lucky in the ballot to choose this motion coming as it does so close behind the matrimonial bill and during the discussions on the housing bill <e> <s> that is particulary apt <e> <s> i should also like to congratulate the noble lord lord mulley <e> <s> i listened as did the whole house to all that he had to say to us this afternoon <e> <s> i hope we shall hear a great deal more from him <e>", "<cs> i agree with the principle of the amendment because i believe that this job is too big for one man to assume <e> <s> the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe alluded to the independent broadcasting authority of which i was a member for five years <e> <s> he was absolutely correct as far as i know in saying that many other organisations were appointed when the local radio stations for instance came into being <e> <s> they were completely separate but there was still the authority which was appointed by the secretary of state <e> <s> nevertheless the independent radio stations were very independent and i doubt very much whether the secretary of state had much to do with the running of the independent broadcasting authority <e>", "<cs> i should like to follow the noble lord lord somers down the road that he was taking <e> <s> as we know the government have said they will give an assurance the problem is that it is not in the bill that rural areas will not face higher charges than urban and suburban areas <e> <s> perhaps the government are therefore able to accept this amendment dealing with charging rates which i would have thought is the same thing <e> <s> i agree with the noble <e>", "<cs> i also should like to support this amendment <e> <s> there are hospitals with telephones going from bed to bed as i know very well where they have not got telephone books <e> <s> there are also unfortunately very many in our society who are still completely illiterate on leaving school <e> <s> there are also those who come to our country and cannot speak or read our language adequately enough <e> <s> they simply must have the directory services <e> <s> i hope the government will accept this amendment <e>", "<cs> may i intervene <e> <s> i wonder where the noble lord gets the figure of millions of people <e> <s> it has been established in your lordships house during the course of this bill that per cent <e> <s> of all households in this country have a telephone <e>", "<cs> i shall speak very briefly because i do not want to intervene at this late hour <e> <s> although i should have thought everyone in the committee would support the principle of the amendment surely it is covered in subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords may ask my noble friend whether he is aware that until this scheme started widows were unable to claim sickness benefit at all because of the overlapping benefit rule and that throughout the country they are most indebted to the government for bringing in the scheme <e>", "<cs> before withdrawing the amendment may i thank my noble friend the minister for so graciously helping us in this regard <e> <s> it will be widely appreciated throughout the country by those people affected now and in the future <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> yes with the leave of the committee i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend the minister whether he will take into <e>", "<cs> my lords knowing the area very well may i ask my noble friend very briefly where the inquiries are held <e> <s> it does seem to me that if the inquiries are held where people can be apprehended for bad order then it would be more beneficial and it would help all round if the inquiries could be held in a slightly more judicial atmosphere than they are at present <e> <s> i should like to know where exactly the inquiries are held now <e>", "<cs> may i ask my noble friend this question <e> <s> it has occurred to me that we are talking about the secretary of state taking the initiative <e> <s> could it be that the prisoner himself i am asking for guidance on this because it is important could ask to be transferred and put his reasons to the secretary of state <e> <s> i cannot find it in the bill but presumably it is there <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank my noble friend lord mottistone for bringing this bill to the house <e> <s> i was very impressed to hear that it passed all its stages in the house of commons on th january <e> <s> that shows that the government feel that this bill is long overdue <e> <s> i am a driver of considerable years and perhaps i may also say of experience and i have felt for a very long time that the younger people who are now on our roads need a better quality of tuition than they have had in the past <e> <s> that is not to say that the instruction by most of the driving schools in this country is below standard <e> <s> on the other hand there is so much traffic on the roads and people are driving so fast that as the noble lord lord tordoff quite rightly said the quality needs to be heightened as much as possible and the whole law needs to be tightened up <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank my noble friend the minister most sincerely for that encouraging and helpful reply <e> <s> i know that the minister in another place has been actively engaged on this subject since last july <e> <s> i am very pleased as i am sure is the whole house to hear that there has been such an encouraging response <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran is trying as usual to be very persuasive <e> <s> the noble lord usually persuades me but i fear that he has not done so this afternoon <e> <s> as he rightly says the question of whether or not there should be a council was defeated in committee by four votes <e> <s> today the noble lord has called the body by many different names <e> <s> in fact i became rather lost <e> <s> sometimes it was described as an advisory body sometimes a council and sometimes an advisory council <e>", "<cs> my lords i too was one of those who voted against the government last time but i submit that this amendment now put before us by my noble friend the minister covers everything that we wanted <e> <s> indeed i think he has gone even further <e> <s> he is not only dotting the is but crossing the ts and i would vote for the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords very briefly i wonder whether my noble friend lord mottistone is having so much difficulty which i certainly have not had because he lives in the isle of wight <e> <s> am i right in suggesting that it is the piece of water between us that is responsible <e> <s> i am afraid that i cannot agree with him and i agree with other noble lords who think that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for what my noble friend the minister has said <e> <s> i wonder whether when he speaks again he could answer this question <e> <s> if british telecom wishes in the future to charge for the information and if it abides by the licence which i understand will have included in it that it should not charge disabled people or people who cannot see the written word how are people who suffer from these ailments to know <e>", "<cs> my lords though the question is specifically about the north sea can my noble friend the minister say whether there are finds of gas in other seas around our islands <e>", "<cs> my lords does not my noble friend the minister agree that there are many other routes of access to the houses of parliament besides the mall marlborough gate and constitution hill <e> <s> does he also not agree that on this occasion plenty of warning was given over the radio and in the press that the demonstration was to take place and that if one wanted to circumnavigate those particular roads there were other roads which could be taken <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend lord massereene and ferrard for initiating this debate this afternoon <e> <s> i should also like to congratulate him on his interesting and well-informed speech <e>", "<cs> my lords having received much correspondence as i am sure many other noble lords have done from the royal national institute for the blind i thank the minister most warmly for inserting amendment no <e> <s> to clause <e> <s> i am sure that it will be warmly received by the blind not only those who earn their living but also those blind people who have so many problems in their own homes <e>", "<cs> my lords as i was mentioned by my noble friend lord cockfield i should like to thank him and the whole of his team very sincerely and not only to thank them but to congratulate them on getting this splendid and important bill through your lordships house <e> <s> the noble lord lord molloy mentioned the disabled but i should like to mention those in rural areas the disabled the blind and those of pensionable age to all of whom the government have given way perhaps due to persuasion from all sides of the house and have acceded to our requests on amendments <e> <s> i should like to thank my noble friend for mentioning me and for all the work he has done on our behalf <e>", "<cs> may i ask the minister whether he would ask the minister of state to incorp-orate the words in clause <e>", "<cs> my lords equally before the noble lord sits down can he tell us when he last saw these video nasty films <e> <s> i think the house would be interested to know <e>", "<cs> my lords as usual i am very pleased to follow the noble baroness because she always speaks such common sense <e> <s> i should also like to thank the noble lord lord nugent the noble viscount lord ingleby and the noble lord lord swinfen for initiating this very important report <e> <s> when i tell your lordships that on the working party were four highly qualified members of the academic <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down can he give any quotations <e> <s> i know of many instances where discrimination has been in favour of disabled people <e> <s> people will take in a blind person or someone on crutches perhaps because as the noble earl lord longford says they are christian people <e> <s> however the noble lord also said that he had many instances of those who discri-minated against <e> <s> is the noble lord lord stallard able to give the house instances of discrimination against the disabled <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend the minister whether she and the secretary of state are aware of the enormous increase in funeral costs <e> <s> they are now quite prohibitive <e> <s> further in spite of the ribaldry in your lordships house may i ask my noble friend to draw the secretary of states attention to what i have said in this house <e> <s> will she ask him when this review is taking place to try to find out the reasons for the enormous cost of burying somebody who is perhaps fairly close <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend the minister whether it is envisaged that the centre of excellence in great portland street should be concentrated as seems reasonable at stanmore and that all the surgeons who are now performing wonderful operations should be transferred to stanmore <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether he is aware that the national organisation of which i happen to be national chairman the leagues of hospital friends is an entirely voluntary organisation and during each year it has collected million to million a great deal of which is spent on lasers and scanners to help the dhss <e> <s> i hope the minister will take that on board <e> <s> i know that the secretary of state knows the work that is done but this is entirely voluntary and is helping cancer patients <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to rise but i would have put my name down on the list <e>",

withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether the figures he has just given which the whole house welcomes include export orders <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend ask his right honourable friend whether it would be possible to have a drug abuse centre in every regional hospital board area because people would then know where to go <e>", "<cs> my lords before my few remarks this evening and they will be few because i know that time is getting on i wish to apologise to the whole house for my absence at the beginning of this debate <e> <s> i should like especially to apologise to my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor <e> <s> i know i missed a big speech of his one that i have heard he presented absolutely brilliantly <e> <s> the reason

wished to go to the funeral <e> <s> he was a very great man in many ways and the navy law and order and youth were just some of the many things he was interested in <e> <s> we had a wonderful and

informed that during the past two years a considerable amount has been done in helping the single homeless to find homes <e> <s> indeed since rowton houses were closed many other much more suitable premises have been taken over and are now being used by local authorities and the dhss <e> <s> is he aware of that <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support what has been stated by the noble lord

forward this one amendment the government have brought forward a wonderfully imaginative proposal <e> <s> i should like them to know to what extent the lives of many people will be enhanced by it <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend the minister agree that so far as smoking and glue sniffing are concerned young people are more likely to indulge in both of these to the extent that it might become a habit if the government tell them that they should not <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend lady gardner and with the reasons that she gave <e> <s> some time ago i had to deal with gas when people wanted to get stamps for gas through the post office <e> <s> they were not able to afford it it was so expensive <e> <s> it is not a small sum at all that the post office will charge <e> <s> as the noble baroness said they might charge increasing amounts for giving out these passes <e> <s> as she rightly said if it is open-ended and left to the local council they will know what their local people want and the most convenient place for the people concerned <e> <s> i would rather leave it to them <e>", "<cs> my lords surely as my noble friend the minister has said it is left to each individual court and each individual case <e> <s> when things which are highly obnoxious have been put before me on my desk things like long sheath knives which have done a great deal of damage to young people i order them to be confiscated and destroyed <e> <s> that is within the power of the court and i do not think it should be written into the bill <e> <s> i do not think that that is a necessary part of it <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to intervene very briefly <e> <s> i agree with what the noble lord lord renton has said about the confidence of the public and not only of the public but of the defendant <e> <s> it is very important that he should know that he is being tried by a jury of people who are otherwise blameless or anyway have not been caught <e> <s> as everybody knows statistics can be made to prove any case that anybody cares to make therefore i am not going into that <e> <s> but i do say that anybody who has been before any court of law and has been put on probation has already been found guilty of an offence <e> <s> for that reason i think that they should not sit on a jury <e>", "<cs> i shall be brief because i am not well versed in the law i am only a common citizen who might be stopped <e> <s> i would prefer to be stopped by an officer in uniform <e> <s> an officer in uniform carries more weight and much more authority not perhaps to somebody of my great age but i am thinking specifically of the young <e> <s> they need to have confidence in the people who might in the future stop and search them <e> <s> it is important that the young person involved should be able to see the number and know because of the uniform that there was a perfect right to stop and search them <e> <s> that is followed by confidence and in turn will be followed by communication between the two <e> <s> that will do both sides a very great deal of good and i would be with the movers of the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am very pleased to be able to follow the noble lord lord harris of greenwich <e> <s> i served under him as a member of the parole board but it is perhaps my experience of years adjudicating as a magistrate on which i draw and i am particularly keen that this series of three amendments should not go forward <e> <s> for years and years i have wanted this part of the bill to be enacted because as all noble lords know from the press if not from their own experience more and more young people are carrying offensive weapons and more and more older people are carrying offensive weapons with <e>", "<cs> it seems from the speeches we have heard already that both sides of the committee are as aware as i am that this code of practice is vitally important not only for the police but certainly for the younger people in society <e> <s> they must know where they stand as well as the police knowing where they stand <e> <s> it will breed confidence in the young people about whom we are worried today <e> <s> the noble lord lord gifford made an allusion to a form <e> <s> it seems to me that his idea that there should be one form for one lot of people and another form asking for details of birth and address for another lot of people is not really a practical idea <e> <s> with respect it seems to me that everybody should have the same form and that every police officer should have the same form to fill in <e> <s> but i agree also that the code of practice as such must be as concise as it is possible for it to be <e>", "<cs> i am sure we are all aware that up to now road checks have been completely unrestricted <e> <s> this bill is trying to make them more restricted so that they cause less nuisance to the public at large <e> <s> but we have to make it possible for the police to apprehend criminals whether they are intending to commit a crime or whether they have already done so <e> <s> my reading of the bill is that if a robbery has been committed in a district the witness who has taken part in the robbery must be able to be apprehended in a road check if and when one is put up with the authority of the police <e> <s> these amendments are very important because the police must have flexibility to be able to apprehend anybody who they think is in breach of the law <e>", "<cs> may i suggest to the noble lord that he is being completely unreasonable <e>", "<cs> i wanted to say a word or two but before my noble friend replies let me say only this <e> <s> may i ask him please not to refer to ordinary magistrates as other members of the committee have done <e> <s> we are not ordinary <e>", "<cs> we are not unusual either <e> <s> we are hard-working unpaid people who have very many years of experience behind us <e>", "<cs> may i intervene briefly to say that i agree entirely with what my noble friend has said <e> <s> with my perhaps limited experience over years of trying to judge juvenile crime such crime as my noble friend has said is increasing enormously <e> <s> juveniles are led by the adults they are pushed through windows by adults <e> <s> these are young people whom we have to arrest <e> <s> we have to bring them before the courts in their own interests and in the interests of the country <e> <s> if we do not stop them from committing crimes and we do not try to deter them perhaps by some suitable punishment we shall be laying ourselves open to more and more adult crime <e> <s> so i entirely agree with my noble friend <e>", "<cs> on the other hand surely it is almost impossible i would have thought perhaps those words are too strong to convict anybody for instance of robbery or of taking a car without the fingerprints matching <e> <s> one must take the fingerprints first <e>", "<cs> my lords following the question of the noble lord lord hooson may i <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble minister for his reply <e> <s> may i ask whether he agrees with me that the people who are mentioned in this particular question about the maternity allowance are very few <e> <s> these people are young women who have not had their first baby but are pregnant and whose husbands have been killed or who have died from other causes <e> <s> would he agree with me that no woman under is able to claim a widows pension and that no woman who is pregnant with her first baby is able to claim maternity allowance until the baby is born <e>", "<cs> my lords as president of the national association of widows may i thank my noble friend for his sympathetic answers today <e> <s> may i also ask whether he would take a message back to his right honourable friend to ensure as i think he said he would that this particular very small group of women should be considered in the future <e>", "<cs> very briefly i should like to say that on this bill we are all worried about the citizen who is detained <e> <s> we are worried also about the police powers <e> <s> it seems to me that we are in danger here of crossing every i and trying to dot every t or vice versa to such an extent that i shall be as muddled as i have just been and the police officer might be also <e> <s> it is wrong to give the police so little flexibility that they will be endlessly time watching watch stopping etc <e> <s> i think we have gone too far and certainly i would resist this amendment <e>", "<cs> the circumstances have changed a very great deal in that some of the children that i have in mind would run away <e> <s> they would not be seen from here to the other end of southend <e> <s> they could not be held even if they were put in a remand centre in the charge of a very responsible local authority <e> <s> they would walk out and would not be seen again until they were apprehended many hundreds of miles away <e> <s> it is very important that the police should be able to follow the offence through and that is very difficult if they have to let the child go because they are unable to keep him for more than six hours <e> <s> to impose a time limit would be wrong and restricting to the police <e>", "<cs> i agree entirely with the amendment of the noble lord lord plant <e> <s> it is a wider amendment than the one proposed by the noble baroness lady masham of ilton <e> <s> on the other hand she has covered perhaps a different but equally important point <e> <s> as a former member for quite some time of the parole board i know that a great many drugs besides large quantities of jewellery and other articles are brought into this country illegally in this way <e> <s> something has to be done to deter and it is to be hoped to stop this method of bringing drugs into the country <e> <s> with the escalation in the use of drugs i hope that the government will accept these amendments <e> <s> they might go some way towards deterring those who are using this method of bringing drugs into the country <e> <s> even the small amount of drugs that by <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the leaders nearly always claim divinity and that they treat the people who come within their ambit to psychologically-based techniques which soften the mind and very often the brain <e> <s> the description of such treatment is mental mugging and assassination of the free will <e> <s> that is over and above the absolute disaster that is caused to many families in this country and throughout the world <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say whether mr dikko has regained his health and if he has whether he is now at large <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend the minister replies i feel that i must comment although i am sure that my shoulders should be weighed down with all the learned comments we have heard from those who are learned in the law in this house <e> <s> as noble lords will know i am not learned in the law but i have been a magistrate for a very long time <e> <s> that is why i feel that we should leave this bill as it is <e>", "<cs> my lords we are as i understand it discussing amendment no <e> <s> a which is to clause where a person is arrested for an offence without a warrant or under a warrant not endorsed for bail <e> <s> i feel very stongly that the rights of <e>", "<cs> my lords section is mentioned in this amendment where the word impracticable is used <e> <s> my noble friend lady faithfull has asked me to ask my noble friend whether or not these words are too wide <e> <s> will a juvenile be able to be held in custody instead of being put into the care of the social services which i know everybody wishes to happen including the government if no place can be found for that juvenile <e> <s> on behalf of my noble friend may i ask for elucidation of that word <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i am sure he would want to be fair and acquaint the house with the fact that this is the first time as far as i am aware i think it came out during second reading that there has been a limit <e> <s> there has never been a limit before and it has now been settled at hours <e> <s> the noble lord has been a lawyer a barrister and a judge for many years and he will be aware that an upper limit has to be set under which one can operate from tines right through to terms of imprisonment <e> <s> someone may be able to he imprisoned by law for years and they might be able to be fined but that is the top limit <e> <s> the government think that hours is the top limit but it is by no means likely that a man will be kept in custody for the whole of that time <e> <s> it is only fair to make it clear to the house that that is the operation of this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like briefly to associate myself with everything that has been said tonight <e> <s> i think that we have approached this grave subject practically and that is the way that it must be approached today in this country <e> <s> as we all know there is a tremendous escalation of the problem <e> <s> ten days ago i was speaking at a local hospital in a certain part of the country <e> <s> a magistrate came up to me and asked me about drugs <e> <s> i said what about them <e> <s> she said that she would like me to know that on their bench they had had a survey done of only robberies in the past year <e> <s> it was a large and busy psd and per cent <e> <s> of the robberries in that one area were connected with drugs <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble baroness said it is very important that the search should be under clinical conditions those do not often exist in a police station <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my few words on this <e> <s> i agree with everything that has been said <e> <s> i think that society in general owe it to the police to pay them compensation if they are acquitted of any complaint <e> <s> i agree entirely with my noble friend lord renton that this provision would help the morale of the police <e> <s> by that i do not imply that the morale of the police is low i am certain it is not but on occasions of this kind any individual police officers morale must be low and he must wonder what financial difficulty it will land him in <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always a great privilege to follow the noble and learned lord lord diplock <e> <s> i think that it is the first time that i have had this privilege <e> <s> i can only assume that i was put in this place on the list between the noble and learned lords who are speaking this afternoon on the assumption that your lordships would all be out at tea <e> <s> but as the noble and learned lord lord diplock has said things have gone slightly awry today and i find myself speaking with other noble lords in their places <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend answers i should like to take up one or two of the matters that have been raised <e> <s> i may have misheard the noble lord lord irving but he seemed to imply i hope i am wrong that the prosecuting authority as he called it would be elected <e> <s> surely it would be appointed not elected by the local authorities <e> <s> i should like very much to know whether or not that is correct <e> <s> it alters the whole situation <e>", "<cs> as one who for many years has been chairman of a large and difficult juvenile court i should like to support all noble lords who have spoken in favour of this amendment this afternoon <e> <s> i am certain that in the future we shall need not only people of wisdom and ability but people who also have direct knowledge of children and their problems the problems of those children who have allegedly gone astray who might be brought before the courts <e> <s> it is important that we have qualified people who will be able to decide whether those children shall be brought before the courts indeed whether the many other ways of dealing with these children are not going to have any avail and whether a court appearance is the only way of dealing with them <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down i hope that i did not give him the impression <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may briefly take up a point on this very lengthy clause which extends to lines in the bill <e> <s> it is only because i am worried and should like the assurance of my noble friend the minister that the premises which are to be occupied by the prosecution service shall in no way be seen to be part of either local authority premises or police authority premises <e> <s> it is very important that as this is to be a completely independent service it should be seen by the general public to be independent <e> <s> from my knowledge the general public in a local borough are aware of the premises from which a service such as this operates <e> <s> they feel that the service should not be connected with any other services <e> <s> i ask my noble friend for his assurance on this point <e>", "<cs> i should like to try to assure my noble friend the minister that my basic problem is really perhaps a political one in that one does not want this service which i think is going to help the course of justice enormously i am enormously for this bill to be seen to be either near the police or near the local authority which the people on the ground will see as being political <e>", "<cs> i should like to support everything that has been said so far in the debate this afternoon <e> <s> it seems to me that this clause is a result of a few reports in the press of a few serious cases in which it is thought that a judge has given too lenient a sentence <e> <s> i hope that journalists do not think i am inferring that they misrepresent any of the cases but within my knowledge all reports of cases before our courts are incomplete because they have to be condensed pressure of space and time of course being one of the reasons <e>", "<cs> my lords it is quite impossible to cover this vitally important and escalating subject in the very short time that each of us has available this afternoon <e> <s> however i seek to show as briefly as i can certainly within the five minutes that the government and the voluntary bodies care and are doing something about it but i shall take only two examples both of which i personally know about <e> <s> the first is a statutory centre to which the noble lord lord harris referred and the second is a voluntary centre <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord the minister for his helpful reply <e> <s> the figures he has given are encouraging <e> <s> is he aware that despite what he has said and despite the fact that installers are trained for the work they are supposed to carry out there are a great number of people who not only instal their own appliances but also change their appliances thereby perhaps causing explosions <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend the minister what publicity will be given to the regulations which i understand are coming into force this month <e>", "<cs> my lords first of all i want to start by apologising to the noble baroness lady jeger and also to my noble friend the minister for not being here during most of the debate <e> <s> i had to leave the chamber because i was almost suffering from hypothermia at the beginning and i also had a very important meeting which is really part of this debate this afternoon <e> <s> i thank the noble baroness for introducing this debate which most of us would think could have taken two days as it is really in two separate parts <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend the minister assure the house that if patients are sent out of hospitals into care in the community they will not be put into only bed and breakfast accommodation where during the day they <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister use his good offices to encourage british telecom to keep to the red telephone boxes of whatever design because in very thick fog which we still get in this country red can be seen whereas other colours cannot <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall try to be very brief because it seems that we are going to be here for some time yet again tonight <e> <s> i support the principle of this bill <e> <s> i think that some of the figures may have to be changed during the course of the bill but i should like to congratulate my noble friend lord mottistone on bringing it forward to this house <e>", "<cs> my lords may i briefly thank my noble friend the minister for repeating the statement <e> <s> he has mentioned that these orders are likely to come into force on th april and that we are to have the privilege of debating them before that date <e> <s> there are very few days left because we shall soon be in recess for easter and i know that we have a very heavy programme immediately afterwards <e> <s> can he assure us that we are to have this debate <e> <s> a lot of us are very worried not only about the statement but about the state of board and lodgings in london <e> <s> the present situation has been brought about by the enormous increase in unemployment and the fact that many people are coming to this city to try to find employment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend the minister whether the recipients and users of luncheon vouchers have to pay income tax on them <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the invaluable work done by the london street agencies is likely to come to a close <e> <s> although it has been funded as the minister said for the past three years local hospital authorities are now supposed to be funding the agencies and have stated that they can fund only one-eighth of the amount that was given previously <e> <s> will she look into the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not the custom as we know to oppose regulations in this house <e> <s> otherwise i for one feel that the chamber would have been rather fuller than it is <e> <s> i should like to express my concern <e> <s> before doing so perhaps i may say that i am grateful to the noble baroness the minister for explaining the regulations as succinctly as she has done <e> <s> i should however like to align myself with the two members who have preceded me <e> <s> by way perhaps of an olive branch i should like to express my delight that hospices are now coming into the thoughts of the government <e> <s> but this whole situation seems to me to be characterised by an im all right jack syndrome <e> <s> i have a feeling that those who have their own home their own roof their own job and their own way of life do not understand the problems at grass roots level of those who have none of those things <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that in certain london boroughs there is a great deal of empty accommodation which could be utilised by those boroughs for the people we are discussing today <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend the minister aware that it is not necessarily a request to be treated by a woman doctor since in some religions which are prolific in the southern part of this city many people hold to religious beliefs and are unable to be treated by men <e> <s> can the minister put pressure to bear on the local dha to ensure that there are plenty of beds for those people <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> i have the honour to put this small but very important measure before your lordships this morning because my honourable friend in the other place mr neville trotter the member for tynemouth won a private members allocation a few weeks ago and managed through his skills and his powers of persuasion to get this bill as it stands through the other place not only in record time but without dissension or amendment <e> <s> therefore i feel that i am fortunate to be asked to bring the bill before your lordships house this morning <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to everybody who has given this bill such a warm welcome <e> <s> i think i got your lordships with me which was lucky on a friday morning or afternoon <e> <s> after yesterday i thought that we should all be too exhausted to bother with this bill <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> he mentioned hallucinations <e> <s> i failed to mention them but they are certainly one of the end products of glue sniffing or indeed taking by aerosol <e> <s> i am glad that he agrees that the local magistrates court is the place to have these people when they are found and brought to justice <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that on saturday of last weekend i went up the m which was cordoned off with cones on one lane and came down on sunday and that there was hardly a hiccup in the traffic flow <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor for his very helpful reply <e> <s> will he consider increasing the fines and the length of imprisonment which the magistrates courts are able to impose thereby possibly avoiding the necessity of some of the defendants in the magistrates courts having to go to crown courts for sentence <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble and learned friend tell us the number of crown courts built since <e> <s> perhaps he can confirm that there were in and there are now <e> <s> surely that will minimise one would hope the delay in cases coming to trial at the crown court <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend the minister for that encouraging reply <e> <s> does she agree that it is likely that an amount in the region of a year might be saved <e> <s> if that is so on what will that amount i am sorry i should have said million be spent <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e> <s> therefore unless any noble lord objects i beg to move that the order of commitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> my lords while i entirely agree with the question put down by my noble <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may be allowed to thank the noble lord for his kind remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords i am so involved having spent years as a magistrate in one of the areas about which we are talking that i do not quite know how to begin except to say first of all that i agree with almost all that the noble and learned lord has said <e> <s> i do not quite know how it happened but i should also like to say that i am grateful that these amendments were not taken at committee stage because i have since then been able to talk to a number of my magistrate colleagues in the middlesex area in the interim period <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend the minister leaves this particular point in view of the fact that the original courthouse was closed by the right honourable roy jenkins when he was home secretary in the labour government and we have not had a courthouse since can my noble friend the minister say whether it is envisaged that the state will pay for the new courthouse or will it have to be paid for by the ratepayers <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble and learned lord will not think that i was criticising him <e> <s> in fact i was thanking him for not bringing forward this matter in committee because it gave me more time to talk to my colleagues <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like warmly to congratulate my noble friend lord rodney on the excellent way in which he has brought forward this bill <e> <s> i certainly welcome it very sincerely <e> <s> i feel it should be stated that the government are well aware of the escalating problem of drug addiction in this country <e> <s> i was very pleased to see today that extra specialist investigators have been taken on by the customs and excise <e> <s> i hope that they will help to stop some of the drugs coming to this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i intervene very briefly with two queries <e> <s> like other noble lords i agree with the spirit of this amendment but i very much wonder why it is necessary <e> <s> from the very beginning of discussions on this bill we have paid lip service and we have hoped that local authorities will be able to carry out the work that we are now giving to them <e> <s> in this amendment especially i feel that it is difficult suddenly to say i dont think that they will be capable of finding out what other voluntary organisations need help <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend the minister whether in the area of which the noble baroness lady masham has been speaking there are sufficient bail hostels <e> <s> from experience i can say that it is possible to send a young person to a bail hostel rather than to remand in custody if there are sufficient bail hostels <e>", "<cs> my lords as the minister has said that guidelines have been sent out to the national gas consumers council would it be possible to have a copy of those guidelines put in the library so that those of us who are interested may see them <e>", "<cs> i should like briefly to add my few remarks to those of the two noble lords <e> <s> as a former member of the parole board i should like to correct if i may a statement made by the noble lord lord monson <e> <s> he implied that it might be possible to keep a prisoner in prison for quite a long time if he were given years <e> <s> in actual fact the earliest date of release is after one-third of the sentence has been served <e> <s> if he comes up in front of the parole board and asks for release at edr that in my calculation would be years <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend the minister not agree from his own knowledge that if property marking schemes are allied to good neighbourhood schemes which are now escalating all over the country this would be even more of a deterrent to burglars <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord the minister give the house an estimate of how much all these questions have cost the country <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether he is aware that private cars are now being parked in a great number of bus lanes thereby making it very difficult not only for buses and pedal cyclists to get along them but also forcing the buses to go into the lanes reserved for cars <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend sits down i wonder whether for the sake of the people in the country not only in england and wales but also in scotland he will agree that all this information which is so vital to the people in the country miles away from everywhere and certainly a long way from town halls should be put into the local post office <e> <s> in scotland that is very often the local grocers shop too <e> <s> it must be at the very basic level <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise to all noble lords for not having put my name down on the list of speakers <e> <s> i was not sure what time this debate would come on this evening and so perhaps noble lords will forgive me for intervening for what will be much less than five minutes <e> <s> one of my late husbands favourite quotations was set the people free <e> <s> it is that phrase around which i want to build a few words tonight <e>", "<cs> my lords before the experiment that we have had in our chamber for the last six months i asked myself three questions <e> <s> like other noble lords i wanted to reason with myself as to why we should have televising of our house <e> <s> i now have the answers <e> <s> the first question was why televise <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend the minister whether in view of the statement she has made the secretary of state is happy about the constitution and the membership of the dha <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend the minister whether he is able to give the house any figures for jobs which are advertised at jobcentres that is job vacancies at jobcentres throughout the country <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like very briefly to add my voice to that of my noble friend lord mountgarret and that of the noble lord lord morris <e> <s> like everyone else in your lordships house and outside it i regret apartheid <e> <s> we should like to abolish it overnight but it is not possible <e> <s> like the noble viscount lord mountgarret i know from my knowledge of africa that we must go slowly <e> <s> i am not an economist but i hope that i have common sense <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord beaumont that south africa needs the west financially because south africa must be a strong south africa <e>", "<cs> my lords i have nobody jealous of me this afternoon for i think i have the most difficult job of all in endeavouring adequately to congratulate the noble lord lord mellish on his <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be very brief because as your lordships know we have a very long list of speakers this evening <e> <s> i start by congratulating and thanking the noble lord lord ennals on his speech this afternoon <e> <s> i am glad that he is looking so much better because he is in great difficulty <e> <s> last year i was on precisely the same two instruments as he is now on and i know how very difficult they are <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend the minister whether he will try to involve the parents through the parent-teacher associations in the studies that are being made in the schools <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend the minister whether there is a memorial to those who died at sea <e> <s> if not is it envisaged by the government that there should be <e>", "<cs> my lords i am trying to slim but i did not know that i was invisible <e> <s> like other noble lords i should like to thank my noble friend lord mottistone for raising this very important issue at this time <e> <s> i say that it is very important not only from the point of view of the patient but also from the point of view of people on the ground <e> <s> as we know the government are quite rightly urging hospitals to encourage their patients to live in the community <e> <s> that is right <e> <s> i agree entirely with it <e> <s> but as we also know i hope that this is the reason for the noble lord bringing it to our attention the people in whose community the patients are likely to live are full of concern full of anxiety and are being thoroughly tiresome and obnoxious <e> <s> i hope that this debate if it is given enough publicity will go some way to quench their fears <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister confirm that a great number of people go out from these shores to help under this particular organisation and that the quality of the people going out is remarkably high <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend the minister the shortfall of man/woman power in the fire service <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel that it is very difficult to follow the right reverend prelate because he knows so much about the moral side as well as the problems of people and he has made a brilliant speech if i may be allowed to say so <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend the minister whether he said that these particular signs were temporary <e> <s> if they are temporary how long does he expect them to last <e>", "<cs> my lord like other noble lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord seebohm for bringing to our attention today something which plays a vital part in our lives in this country namely housing <e> <s> this is an enormously comprehensive and interesting report which has considerably enlightened me <e> <s> i am one of the few people in your lordships house who have never been a member of a local authority <e> <s> however i do a certain amount of work outside this house on matters which are pertinent to housing <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the many thousands of magistrates who operate in the magistrates courts throughout the country treat every single case individually <e> <s> is he aware that every case is completely different although to the outsider who is not in court it may seem that cases are the same <e> <s> the background to every case is different and that is perhaps why to the outsider it seems that there are differences in sentencing <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend to tell us if she knows whether there are many children on the waiting list for these beds <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend the minister say whether he is satisfied that children leaving school are encouraged by staff within those schools to take this training <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i wonder whether because of what he said about communications he thinks that we should ask our universities to teach chinese in view of the close proximity that we might have through trading in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords have the metropolitan police intimated how many hard-pressed traffic police and others will be needed to enforce these bus lanes when they become operative <e>", "<cs> my lords at this late hour it is very difficult for me to follow three such very eloquent speeches and i have been looking forward with trepidation to my own rather humble few words <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while i thank my noble friend the minister for that very encouraging reply may i ask him whether he has drawn the attention through the press of motorists who still drive with blurred front and rear lights which cannot be seen in adverse conditions <e> <s> furthermore may i ask my noble friend whether it has ever been suggested that hazard lights which draw everybodys attention could or should be used in adverse circumstances on the roads <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend the minister whether he knows how many people per year take and pass the advanced driving test <e> <s> if that number proves to be few will he encourage more motorists to take it <e>", "<cs> my lords once again this very important matter has been brought to your lordships house and i for one am grateful to the noble lord lord harris for doing so <e> <s> however the question that he has put before us this afternoon is couched in such broad terms that when i sat down to look at it my thoughts amounted almost to a five-hour speech like that of our friend mr gorbachev yesterday <e> <s> but i felt that your lordships would not want to hear more than the maximum of minutes from me <e>", "<cs> my lords while i welcome the extra money that the government are to give will my noble friend the minister tell the house what proportion of that money will go towards rented accommodation rather than new building <e>", "<cs> my lords this afternoon i am so very pleased to be placed at the end of the list and to follow my noble friend lord rodney who has done a very great deal behind the scenes to draw to the attention of your lordships and another place the problems of drugs and drug trafficking <e> <s> this is a very important bill <e> <s> it has been called draconian quite rightly in my view because it should be draconian <e> <s> we face a very serious problem within our country today <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the increase in the use of post codes throughout the country but if they are used nationwide will that prevent as one hopes the obnoxious habit of people putting berks hefts bucks and other awful shortened forms of shires on the envelope <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend the minister whether aids is a notifiable disease <e> <s> if it is not do the government think that it should be <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord the minister for his reply <e> <s> may i ask him whether he is aware that within the metropolitan district there are set aside two special units for reception of those who have been raped one at hendon and one at brentford <e> <s> furthermore two more units one at barkingside and one at shooters hill are to be opened this year and four more are to be opened next year within the metropolitan area <e> <s> all women who go to the special units will be seen if possible almost exclusively by women from detectives and police officers to doctors <e> <s> if the rape victims know this perhaps they will be more willing to report to the local police station <e>", "<cs> my lords may i further ask my noble friend the minister whether he can confirm that attached to every police station which has a special unit there could be a voluntary support scheme and young volunteers having been trained could go and give help to the victims after they have been through the police station and possibly the courts <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble lord i am most grateful to my noble friend lord montgomery for raising this subject once more <e> <s> as he said th july was when we last discussed the subject in this chamber and we then had a long and informed debate <e> <s> he has helped us this afternoon by telling us about the scottish experiment which seems to have been more successful than even the scottish people envisaged at the time <e>", "<cs> my lords the hour is getting late and there is some further business after we have finished this second reading so i intend to be as brief as possible bearing in mind that this is a very lengthy and particularly complicated bill certainly from my reading of it <e> <s> other noble lords will perhaps feel the same <e> <s> but i certainly welcome the bill as do others on this side of the house <e> <s> before i start my few remarks on the bill i too should like to pay my tribute to the noble lord lord gray for the way in which he introduced the bill so succinctly and so helpfully to the house <e>", "<cs> i hate to interrupt the noble lords second reading speech but i wonder whether he is aware that british gas sent an inspection team to america to see exactly what the americans were doing and that team returned with a completely opposite view from the one put forward by the noble lord to the committee this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my

down i wonder whether he can clarify something <e>", "<cs> my lords as a former member of the parole board may i ask the minister to confirm that if a life prisoner is released and then commits a further offence he is brought back to prison forthwith <e>", "<cs> i find myself in a certain amount of difficulty this evening because the learned deputy chairman of the committee has ruled that my amendment cannot be taken if amendment <e>", "<cs> just for clarification may i ask my noble friend the minister whether now that the employees are to be civil servants the department of trade and industry will be their employers <e> <s> if not will it be the department of energy as it was in my time <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend the minister give us any idea of the number of people from these islands who are helping voluntarily or on a voluntary basis overseas <e>", "<cs> my lords i count myself lucky this morning to be asked to speak a few words after the noble lord lord kadoorie who i am sure we all welcome to this house this morning especially in view of what he has said from his intimate knowledge of hong kong <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down i wonder whether he could confirm that at present bgc is divided not at board level perhaps but under board level into twelve regions <e> <s> if he agrees with that can he tell noble lords whether he would hope that after privatisation those twelve regions would still exist <e>", "<cs> my lords is it legal for representatives of those cults to seek money on the streets by begging to keep the cults going <e> <s> if it is not legal will he ask his friends in the home office whether they will make the police more aware of what is going on and tell them that the public are being asked for money on the streets of this country <e>", "<cs> my lords the time is late <e> <s> some of us say that at five oclock some afternoons but as one of the also rans one of the first back-benchers speaking i hope to

personally and i think also other members of the committee feel is a very important part of this bill <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down perhaps i may briefly put forward a suggestion <e> <s> members on all sides of the committee are worried about the safety of gas otherwise we would not be here this afternoon <e> <s> we are so far as i can

noble friend the minister referred to a good woman <e> <s> just for clarification can he tell us what is his definition of a good woman <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that a councillor from the london borough of southwark recently admitted that over dwellings were ready for occupation but were empty <e> <s> if my noble friend is aware of that fact will he draw the attention of the housing minister to it <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that this is a very important clause <e> <s> as i read it it should cover all rented accommodation whether it be a bed-sitting room a furnished house or an unfurnished house not actually owned by the person inhabiting it <e> <s> i think this is very important <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down may i say i have listened with great interest to the stories he has told us tonight <e> <s> would he take it from me as one who lives in one of the home counties where there are a great number of rights of way that the majority of ramblers have no idea of the difference between a bull and a cow <e>", "<cs> if i may i shall briefly ask one question on a subject that has not been mentioned tonight as far as i know and that is the problem of widows who have worked most of their lives and have then lost their husbands <e> <s> often they take quite a long time to readjust to a life where they have to go back to work without the support of the man in their life <e> <s> i am wondering what view the government take about this problem <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend the minister confirm that not only do we supply financial aid

"<cs> the noble and learned lord said that appeals had been heard in a certain number of years <e> <s> does he by any chance have figures for how long each appeal took <e> <s> that would be helpful to the committee <e>", "<cs> can the noble lord as an expert give us any idea at all of how many days weeks or months it takes from the initiation of the appeal to the hearing and the appellant being satisfied <e>", "<cs> in his wisdom the noble lord lord ennals thought that the majority of people would be elderly <e> <s> i want to put forward another section of our community that i know a tiny

in the noble lords name <e> <s> i think there are or more <e> <s> was he talking to them all <e>", "<cs> hear hear <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i thank my noble friends lady gardner and lord sanderson very much indeed for their support and i also thank noble lords on the other side of the house despite the fact that quite rightly the noble lord lord williams did not go along with all the wording of the amendment <e> <s> he might have done better with the drafting but i did my best <e>", "<cs> my lords in my view as an ardent motorist as obviously is the noble earl following caravans doing more than miles per hour is a frightening experience because one becomes mesmerised by them going from one side of the carriageway to the other <e> <s> they do not do it intentionally <e> <s> it seems that if they are not locked solidly behind the car and if they have any leeway at all they swing from side to side <e> <s> i imagine although i am not particularly worried about it that the crockery and everything else inside must also be thrown about <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask my noble friend one more question <e> <s> is it the law that every car driver who tows for example a horse-box or a caravan must have extended wing mirrors on his vehicle <e> <s> because unless they do in my view they cannot see the trailer moving from side to side on the road <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not certain how many amendments we are now speaking to <e> <s> from my list i thought it was amendments nos <e> <s> a b and <e> <s> i hope that that is correct <e>

british gas as it is now is particularly good to my certain knowledge at looking after people in that particular circumstance i am quite certain that we should like to see in the bill that the ensuing authorities for gas should also be enjoined in the bill to look after these particular people <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt for one second <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will refer to those persons as being of pensionable age and not the infirm <e> <s> those of age to age are not always infirm <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether in future my noble friend the minister will for the benefit of all of us throughout the country issue the unemployment figures and the employment figures at the same time side by side <e>", "<cs> my lords i am wondering whether the noble lord realises that we are at the report stage <e> <s> i think that he may have asked the leave of the house but instead of asking a question i think that he is going a little beyond the rules of the house in making another speech <e>", "<cs> i have always thought with regard to somebody going out to make a riot that if he were given a deterrent in the shape of a very severe sentence it might possibly deter him

talking perhaps slightly off the cuff and my mathematics were wrong <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may be permitted to keep the minister for a moment or two <e> <s> i should like to thank my noble friends lord stanley lord montagu and lord radnor for bringing forward these two amendments <e> <s> i have a feeling that this might well be one of the opportunities that we have to draw the attention

correct in which case i shall say a few brief words <e> <s> the noble lord lord diamond has already paid a tribute and all parts of the house are enormously in debt to my noble friend the minister <e>

the bill well <e> <s> i have had the advantage i call it that of working not only with the gas consumers council for <e>", "<cs> my lords is it envisaged that when the cycle of new prisons has been completed any of the very old ones will be closed <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend the minister say whether the amounts we are talking about are to be grants or loans <e>", "<cs> my lords i also congratulate my noble friend on his appointment and wish him well <e>", "<cs> i shall be brief because it is late but i have one or two words to say <e> <s> may i start by saying how much i welcome not only all the work that has been put into this amendment but also the amendment itself <e> <s> i think it is high time from various views that this matter was taken on board by the government <e> <s> i shall not speak at all about the peace convoys <e> <s> i want to talk about a smaller sphere coming <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend the minister whether she will encourage this aspect <e> <s> will the minister issue an instruction that women under the age of should also be screened <e> <s> the medical profession is aware that younger women also need to be screened <e> <s> if the noble baroness accepts this will she also ensure that the medical profession will be paid for the screening of women under the age of which does not happen at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend the minister what steps the government themselves are taking to update health education in schools <e>", "<cs> my lords it is as usual a privilege to follow the noble earl lord longford especially on what may perhaps be described as his hobby-horse <e> <s> it is born of his great interest not only in the prison service and the work of the parole board but also those within our prisons <e> <s> i congratulate the noble earl on being a member of the government as he told us that introduced the parole system <e> <s> that system has been extremely effective and helpful <e> <s> i congratulate the noble earl on the part that he played at that time <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i can say this categorically never having been a member of the local review committee <e> <s> my information is that the parole board have the papers that are brought before us by people within the prison because they obviously have more up-to-date knowledge than the people on the local review committee can possibly have <e> <s> so far as i know all the papers are gathered by the prison officials in which the prisoners are serving <e> <s> i think that information is correct <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may intervene <e> <s> all life sentence prisoners go before the home secretary <e> <s> the parole board will have discussed the cases first but they always go before the home secretary individually <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend the minister tell the house how much each hip replacement operation costs the national health service <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords i am most grateful for the usual brilliant and lucid way that my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor has explained this bill to us <e> <s> like the right reverend prelate i could not quite understand clause so i am glad to have a friend and i shall not go into that again <e>", "<cs> thank you very much <e> <s> my lords i speak in sorrow about this matter with

steps to be divorced within one year of marriage <e> <s> i think that was a retrograde step <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend the minister for that very encouraging reply <e> <s> i wonder whether he can tell us if in the last three years more units have been formed throughout the country and if so in what parts of the country they have been formed <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his remarks about the disabled the elderly and all the other people who cannot walk very far and therefore cannot take advantage of these pedestrian precincts <e> <s> is he aware that they are having great trouble in some of our inner cities at this time <e> <s> i am glad to hear that he is bearing them in mind and perhaps he will let me know how much further the matter can be taken <e>", "<cs> hear hear <e>", "<cs> my lord i hope to be as brief as all the other speakers who have been commendably brief so late at night <e> <s> we are discussing a part of a bill which was introduced over years ago <e> <s> change has occurred in this country as i am sure all noble lords will agree

our ally and we must march forward and change with the times <e>", "<cs> my lords as usual it is a great privilege for me to follow the noble and learned lord lord denning <e> <s> i happen to know what he is talking about because i have had the privilege of sitting on a committee about the cults for some years <e> <s> he has gone into this problem in great depth and i hope your lordships have learnt a lot about the problems of these cults from him this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful as i am sure are other noble lords to have the opportunity to discuss this important subject which is led in the usual brilliant manner of the noble lord lord hams of high cross <e> <s> i wish that i could emulate his brilliance <e> <s> i shall not take very long and therefore will not bore your lordships for too long <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend the minister whether he is completely satisfied that all those who might be entitled to these payments know that they are so entitled <e> <s> will he agree that many old people are in their homes that they do not go out and that they may not hear that they can benefit from the entitlement that the government are able to give to them <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend the minister tell the house the latest figure for deaths from aids in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords in a certain type of case where the defendant is alleged to have committed a particularly violent crime does the minister agree that if the names and addresses are known not only in court but perhaps through a photocopy to friends outside the lives of some people who have served on the jury may be put in danger <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend the minister also consider paying tribute to the many voluntary organisations which helped at that particular time <e>", "<cs> my lords while also congratulating my noble friend is he aware that a great number of the public do not seem to be aware that one can easily very easily indeed get a temporary passport <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble baroness lady stedman for bringing this subject forward especially just now <e> <s> as my noble friend said disability is not confined to people in wheelchairs <e> <s> disability covers those who are blind and i feel that they might be in great difficulties <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble baroness

disabled people to be especially looked after under these regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords the hour is late <e> <s> unfortunately i was not able to take part in the first of the second readings of the bill <e> <s> perhaps i may begin and i shall be brief by thanking my noble friend lord caithness for so lucidly explaining the bill to us <e> <s> it is one of the most difficult and wide-ranging bills

i shall not be treading on anybodys toes <e>", "<cs> my lords as i am the only woman who has had the temerity among all the people who know much more about this subject than i do to put my name down to speak i shall speak from a slightly different angle <e> <s> i must first of all most importantly say that the noble lord lord monkswell has his facts completely wrong <e> <s> does he really think that any owner of any horse or mouse or anything that could be put to racing would be doing it seven days a week <e> <s> he ought to go round some of our well known racing stables as i have and see how well the horses are looked after <e>", "<cs> my lords returning to the coning off of parts of the motorways perhaps i may ask my noble friend whether it would be possible to put the signs which appear on the motorways regarding the coning off very much <e>", "<cs> i agree wholeheartedly with the noble lord lord renton <e> <s> although the court of appeal is mentioned in actual fact the first trial always takes place in the magistrates court <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may very briefly thank my noble and learned friend lord hailsham for giving us such a wonderful example of his brilliant knowledge not only of the law but also of people <e> <s> i go along wholeheartedly with what he said and also with what other members of your lordships committee have said <e> <s> i hope that the government will either throw this out or take it away <e>", "<cs> in the years that i have been privileged to be a member of this place i have always tried to stand up and be counted on something about which i feel strongly <e> <s> i feel strongly against these amendments principally because the prosecution service as it is now called at the end of a trial should not be able to go behind the judges back and say that the judge imposed an insufficient penalty in the case <e> <s> that is precisely what would happen <e> <s> i am absolutely certain that that is wrong <e>", "<cs> that the people of this country trust the judges <e> <s> i have had so many letters saying we trust the judiciary <e> <s> they are the people who have been trained to judge and who are we that is the people of the country to say that a trained judge is incorrect <e> <s> if one were so to state then this clause might be necessary but i do not think that it is <e> <s> as i have said it would give the executive undue power to interfere with the judiciary and that is not what the public wants <e> <s> that the accused person should be tried only once is one of the fundamental principles upon which the criminal law of this country is founded <e> <s> suspended jeopardy was mentioned and i would agree that that might be a way of looking at it <e>", "<cs> more consistency throughout the country <e>

taken to the crown court will be given to the local authority who have charge of expenditure in the magistrates court <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord give way <e> <s> is he talking about the magistrates courts <e> <s> if he is perhaps i may say that there is considerable discussion between magistrates courts that march one with another around a very wide area <e> <s> that is to my certain knowledge <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the committee for being late <e> <s> i should like to add a word about secure accommodation <e> <s> it is obviously impossible for every borough in london for

hostels for no more than three weeks <e> <s> we are talking about a remand in custody for three weeks <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl sits down may i point out that we are spending a great deal of time on what in my youth were considered to be young children <e> <s> does not the noble earl agree that the latest statistics show that it is a predominance of boys of years of age who are committing most crimes in this country <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down can he tell us the date of that letter <e>", "<cs> i should like to draw the attention of the noble lord lord graham of edmonton to the words at the top of the bill <e> <s> he will see that the hour of noon is mentioned <e> <s> i do not think that this has anything to do with betting offices but rather with the starting of events <e> <s> i thought that the noble lord had said that the time was not mentioned <e>", "<cs> may i very briefly say what i said at second reading <e> <s> as a magistrate i have been very worried

knowledge it is always the practice that somebody who is legally qualified should represent a child of any age <e> <s> as members of the committee will know it can be a child of any age from birth to age <e> <s> it is certainly the practice but i warmly welcome this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with all noble lords that this is a grave matter <e> <s> all noble lords have taken on board

wished to go to their own homes for christmas <e> <s> that was why crisis at christmas was started and that is why it continues <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend referred to single persons <e> <s> is he aware that a single mother bringing up a child has considerable help from the government but that a widowed mother receives practically no help at all until she is of a much older age <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that on this occasion i am unable to agree with my noble friend about the community service order because after all that will cost money <e> <s> what we are trying to get is money from the people who owe it <e> <s> in years of trying to administer justice in the courts including cases involving debtors as humanely as i can i have always found that the possibility of being sent to prison is a great deterrent <e> <s> for example if i said to a person you will go to prison for five six or seven days the money was always forthcoming <e> <s> when i say always i mean perhaps not per cent <e> <s> but at least per cent <e> <s> if on the other hand someone i knew had trouble in paying i would say to that person you will serve one day <e> <s> they would then be placed in a cell in the police station until the court rose on that day <e> <s> that of course means that the debt is wiped out <e> <s> but as the noble lord said and as pointed out by the noble baroness lady faithfull there will be people who will be in difficulties in paying the charge <e> <s> nevertheless so far as i can make out from the bill they will be able to ask for a rebate <e> <s> that provision certainly applies to <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that elderly people living on a pension can with confidence go out at night if they have a personal alarm system in their hands <e> <s> i have personal experience of this and i understand the system is now working throughout the country <e> <s> the personal alarm is held in the hand and it emits a very loud shriek thereby giving confidence to the person who owns it <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend tell the house how many of the accidents happened at night <e> <s> does he agree that the height of the barrier is most important because it prevents the lights of the oncoming cars from being a nuisance when they meet cars coming in the opposite direction <e>", "<cs> i agree with all members of the committee who have spoken except the noble lord who has just spoken <e> <s> i thought that the intention of the bill was to help people who did not have homes of their own <e> <s> that is why the government want to make far more accommodation available for rent <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether my noble friend would answer a question <e> <s> i have not discussed it previously with him and it might be outside his knowledge at this time <e> <s> in that case perhaps he could kindly write to me <e> <s> he has just mentioned that the people who rent from housing associations can take in lodgers <e> <s> we have a very great problem so far as concerns widows they are not allowed to take in male lodgers <e> <s> if they do there is a great possibility that they will lose their rent book because someone will accuse them of cohabiting <e> <s> this is quite a serious problem <e> <s> i do not expect an answer from my noble friend today but perhaps he could very kindly write to me <e> <s> widows find that there is discrimination against them when it is supposed that lodgers means both sexes <e>", "<cs> may i welcome the hats <e>", "<cs> i am so sorry <e>", "<cs> i warmly welcome the idea of hats <e> <s> as we all know from visits to various cities there are far too many rundown areas which need to be made habitable <e> <s> they are an eyesore often unhygienic and dirty and lead to unhappiness <e> <s> i ask my noble friend to take note of what those of us who have knowledge of people with disabilities have to say about the amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a recommendation in the report that a great number of managers should be put in place <e> <s> if the report is implemented will the noble earl ensure that those managers are trained and qualified unlike the ones now serving in the nhs <e>", "<cs> my lords further to the question put by the noble lord lord molloy will the government initiate throughout the world a task force based on the united nations as a result of which perhaps more countries will liaise and be able <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend the minister for introducing the order although i am afraid that i cannot welcome it <e> <s> very little of the north report was welcomed by anyone <e> <s> much of it met with wide opposition throughout the country <e> <s> the order was ordered to be printed only last tuesday <e> <s> i agree with other noble lords who have said that the intervening two sitting days did not provide enough time for those of us who are interested to contact outside organisations to hear their views so that we can perhaps speak for them in your lordships chamber as we are entitled to do <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down did i understand him to say that we are to discuss more of these points in the new year <e> <s> i should like to know that because perhaps the noble lord would then agree that we should discuss them all together this order and other orders in the new year <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend how much in percentage terms are the government putting into the funding of these hospices bearing in mind that a great many of them are run by charities but that the area health authorities disburse the government money <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very lucky to have the opportunity to follow the right reverend prelate the bishop of chester <e> <s> he is known as one of the most humane and caring of all the bishops whom we have the privilege of welcoming into this house <e> <s> i should also like to thank the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale for initiating the debate <e> <s> with his wisdom and knowledge he is always worth a guinea a minute <e> <s> that was the phrase we used to use so perhaps it is two guineas now <e>", "<cs> my lords in my view the bill has been touched with the wisdom of solomon <e> <s> we have heard from my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor with his perspicacity and powers of prognosis what we are to expect from the bill <e> <s> i listened with tremendous interest during the minutes that he took to explain this vital bill <e> <s> it is a milestone in child care and there has been a need for it to be brought before the country for a long time <e> <s> it changes a great deal but it does not change the fundamental care that we have should have and hope to have for all our children <e> <s> it states that the child is paramount and that the childs wishes are also paramount <e> <s> that is vital <e>", "<cs> my lords is it correct that the lead in the ordinary petrol that most of us still have to use is being reduced gradually and that ordinary petrol now has very much less lead in it than was the case two years ago <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always a pleasure to follow my noble friend lord teviot <e> <s> i should like to congratulate the minister on so ably guiding the house through the bill <e> <s> he explained <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may ask is it the view that the child should be represented <e> <s> i know that in most courts the child will be represented separately from either of the parents but if the childs view is to be known to the court surely the committee does not intend that the child should be asked in court what he wants to do <e> <s> it is important that the child be represented <e> <s> i believe that separate representation is dealt with later in the bill <e> <s> i hope that we do not decide upon the amendment intending that the child himself or herself would have to say what he or she wants in open court <e>", "<cs> i wish to ask the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale for clarification <e> <s> when he is talking about paramount and the child we are presuming that there is only one child <e> <s> if there are three children is he saying that the eldest is paramount <e> <s> or are we going to put in the bill that the eldest should be paramount or first <e> <s> i wonder whether somebody can help me this is rather important <e> <s> it happens very often that more than one child is being discussed by the court <e>", "<cs> before the noble and learned lord sits down perhaps i could just conclude this point by asking for clarification on a situation that i experienced in which the boy was and the girl was years old <e> <s> they did not marry although they were the father and mother of a child <e> <s> the parental responsibility was taken over by the mother and father of the year-old boy the fathers parents <e> <s> i do not think it was done legitimately by adoption <e> <s> would that come within the ambit of the noble and learned lords explanation <e>", "<cs> i should like to say that i think the amendment is an important one in that it is not binding <e> <s> it will be on the face of the bill and therefore it will be taken notice of by anyone representing the parents and the children but as it is not binding it gives them a certain inkling of how parliament believes things should be done <e> <s> therefore i must support the amendment <e>", "<cs> i agree very sincerely with my noble friend lord renton <e> <s> i have knowledge of several cases which come in this category <e> <s> the rules of court are made by the hearing judges or magistrates <e> <s> this amendment has to be in force and is in force already with many of the families that i know of <e>", "<cs> i agree with the amendment <e> <s> it puts succinctly what we all realise needs to be included in the bill <e> <s> the bill as drafted dots the is and crosses the ts too much and would leave out some of those whom we are endeavouring to help <e> <s> i hope that the noble and learned lord in the great wisdom which he has shown today will consider the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords these new machines will soon be coming into operation <e> <s> what percentage of business and private customers use the post code at present <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment as strongly as i can <e> <s> we all know that when young people leave care they can get into trouble because there is so much trouble around <e> <s> there is nobody to turn to <e> <s> the figures given by the noble baroness lady david have shocked me as i am sure they have shocked the rest of the committee <e> <s> the support that should be given to young people is not being given <e> <s> with this amendment perhaps it will be given in the future <e> <s> i warmly support it <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may make a short intervention <e> <s> most noble lords are practised in the law <e> <s> the people who will put this act as it will be into court are not practised in the law <e> <s> they are practical people <e> <s> i hope through the noble and learned lord that this bill will go out in such a way that people can understand it that it will be in ordinary english that it will be sufficient to help a court to decide what to do and that as the noble and learned lord said it will not be the case that everything must be very precise to use his words <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may add a few words to what my noble friend lady gardner of parkes said <e> <s> for many years as a magistrate in my <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down i wonder whether i might ask him if his department believes that drivers tell the truth both when being tested and on paper <e> <s> i do not believe that they do <e> <s> i think that if you give people a questionnaire they will fill it in as they wish to fill it in and they are by no means honest <e>", "<cs> hope my noble friend the minister can help me and the committee as regards the tests which i understand the police have been asking people to undertake completely voluntarily <e> <s> the police have done this as a result of their concern <e> <s> they have been asking people who drive into the membury service station on a motorway out of london to take these tests <e> <s> i understand it is that service station but i am open to correction <e> <s> i know those tests have occurred at one of the service stations on one of the motorways leading out of london <e> <s> when the minister replies will he tell us what conclusions the police have come to as a result of these voluntary tests and indeed what kind of test the police administered <e> <s> that would be most helpful <e>", "<cs> before the minister sits down perhaps i may press the point further <e> <s> he has again referred to research can he tell us what research has been done <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down he has mentioned the bbc <e> <s> would he also pay tribute to the work done by all the companies covered by the independent broadcasting authority <e>", "<cs> my lords with leave of the house can my noble and learned friend help me about one word which he and my noble friend lord mottistone used in this connection and which is not as far as i can make out in subsection <e> <s> he used the word improvement <e> <s> that is not contained in the three lines that the house is considering <e> <s> they read <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend lord mottistone and the noble baroness lady saltoun <e> <s> they are right <e> <s> if a local authority in its wisdom gives a precious child into the care of someone who might beat or hurt the child that is the local authoritys fault but in my view it does not mean that parliament should lay down as and when any chastisement takes place <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not talking about the family <e> <s> i was talking implicitly about children who might be part of a family and who should therefore be treated in the same way as those in a normal family <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i might add one or two words <e> <s> the word assist is in the first three lines of clause and there is a provision for the local authorities to assist both when the children are in their care and when they have left it <e> <s> however i should like to underline the fact that these amendments in addition to the first three lines are important also for the reasons <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel strongly on this issue but am unable to speak as passionately as the right reverend prelate the bishop of manchester <e> <s> i wish that i could but perhaps the passion is better coming from a man than from a woman <e> <s> i was most impressed by and absolutely terrified of having to follow the right reverend prelate <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment moved by my noble friend lord lucas of chilworth <e> <s> unfortunately i was not sent all the memoranda which he received and therefore he has the advantage of me <e> <s> however i remember that at committee stage there was a general feeling in the chamber that the government should initiate some research into the problem of driving with impaired eyesight <e> <s> i asked the minister at that time whether he could find out the results of the research which i read about in the press which the police had carried out at the membury service station where people volunteered to have their eyesight tested <e> <s> perhaps the minister can tell us today what the results of that research were <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down perhaps i may quickly say that the membury service station survey was reported in all the press <e>", "<cs> my lords we are on report <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that we are now in an age where plastic bottles and not glass are creating difficulties in the countryside and they cannot be recycled <e> <s> can he assure the house that in future the government will <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that the prisoner would have been released as a result of his case being considered at least twice by the parole board and then being adjudicated upon by the home secretary himself <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords i am most grateful to my noble friend lord reay for initiating this debate this afternoon for the enormous amount of research that he has done and for having given us the benefit of it with the up-to-date figures on crime of all kinds in our country <e> <s> i also wish to thank my noble friend lord ferrers for telling us of some of the research that the home office has been doing and what it has found <e> <s> i believe that some of the figures he has given have been worrying and perhaps eye-opening to most of us here in your lordships chamber <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that i am first on the list <e> <s> i should like to thank my noble friend lord brougham and vaux for introducing the government review of the north report <e> <s> i should like to congratulate all three ministries on the review <e> <s> it does not implement in full the north report <e> <s> however when i first read the report i considered that we were going down many roads much too quickly and were almost a danger to the public <e> <s> therefore i should like to congratulate the government on the white paper before us today <e> <s> i can also say with its authority that the magistrates association extends a warm welcome to the review as it is now <e> <s> in my view it is both comprehensive and complicated <e> <s> it does much good in many of the spheres we are debating <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always a very great privilege to speak following the noble and learned lord lord wilberforce <e> <s> i am not learned in the law but as a magistrate for about years i had the duty of implementing most parts of the criminal law <e> <s> it was therefore with mixed feelings of surprise and relief that i read the headline in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i also congratulate my noble friend lord mottistone on introducing this excellent and necessary bill <e> <s> i am grateful to follow the noble lord lord rea because he has expert knowledge in very difficult areas <e> <s> i know that the noble lord lord pitt also has that expert knowledge <e> <s> i know a little of the excellent and exceptional work that the noble lords perform <e> <s> it has been said that the large mental hospitals are pretty awful places <e> <s> in many cases they are vast victorian mausoleums and they are gradually being run down <e> <s> in that process it is incorrectly presumed that there will be care in the community of all the people who are leaving such hospitals <e> <s> up to the present moment that is not so <e> <s> a number of people are leaving these hospitals and becoming homeless <e> <s> if they are lucky they go to hostels if they are luckier still they return to live with their families <e> <s> that is often very difficult for all of them <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord has a much greater knowledge of this subject than i i have a large number of letters in my hand <e> <s> in all of them the families say that they are frightened of their sons who are often or years of age and they are frightened of living with them <e> <s> that is one of the problems <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord and i will agree to differ on this point <e>", "<cs> my lords is there any other noble lord who wishes to interrupt me <e> <s> i shall be very willing to sit down because the hour is late <e> <s> as other noble lords have said when these people have left hospital it is absolutely vital that <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that encouraging answer <e> <s> is he aware that in a nose-to-bumper situation which occurs frequently on all our roads including the motorways the conspicuity value of lights in the rear window will be of enormous help to all drivers <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his excellent replies <e> <s> is he aware that in the united states all cars must be fitted with such brake lights <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord howie of troon appears to have the impression that the amendments concern only access <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> instead of taking into account any effect which the proposals would have on the beauty or amenity of any rural or urban area inserts the words prevent any deleterious impact <e> <s> will the noble lord lord mcintosh say whether i am right in believing that it is not about access but about the impact of an event which may happen in the area on the various aspects of the area <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a very important bill and we are all indebted to my noble friend lord henley for introducing it to us so helpfully <e> <s> i have a pressing engagement later on this afternoon and i therefore hope that like me other noble lords will take only a short time to speak on a few clauses as is my intention <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend make representations to british telecom about the weight of these new books which have been published within the london area <e> <s> some of us do not have very large or strong hands <e> <s> i believe that the per cent <e> <s> who were dissatisfied could well have been women who do not have very strong hands and who find the weight of the books enormous <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all indebted to the noble baroness lady turner for her excellent speech <e> <s> we are all accustomed to hearing very well-informed speeches from the noble baroness and she has certainly not disappointed us today <e> <s> indeed she has perhaps overstepped the mark in that she has said everything that i wanted to say <e> <s> however i shall do my best to take perhaps a different line <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend the minister has suggested that the government are introducing research <e> <s> as i have suffered both from salmonella and botulism can she assure me that the government are going forward at a great rate to try to find out what causes both salmonella and botulism <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may add a few brief words on the amendment <e> <s> it is difficult for members of the committee unless they have actually been to some of these hotels as they are called to understand the situation <e> <s> these are nowhere near what any of your lordships think of as a hotel they are dosshouses/hostels where people live several to a room <e> <s> they have a roof over their <e>", "<cs> my lords as the whole house is aware of the problems of the homeless will the minister set up a survey to find out how many homeless there are within our city now if he does not already know this figure <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish briefly to add a word or two because at infrequent times i try to help the people with whom we are dealing today <e> <s> i agree with my noble friend lady faithfull in asking people of like mind in other words all members of your lordships house to <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend the minister assist us on the interim period before a runway is operational <e> <s> can he tell us what is happening about stansted <e> <s> when will it be completely operational <e> <s> how many more people will it be able to take in the future <e>", "<cs> i also should like briefly to support the amendment <e> <s> i believe that it is fairly well known that those who are building houses from scratch now very rarely take into account the people who are disabled or who have any problems with living in the houses being built <e> <s> i very much doubt whether the builders take the trouble to ask any disabled people or organisations representing disabled people what they would like and what would be convenient for them <e> <s> the amendment is very helpful and logical and i hope that the government will see their way to agreeing with it <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may suggest to the minister than one solution would be if we all brought our postcards back with us and posted them in europe <e>", "<cs> i should like to add a word of support to the remarks so cogently made by the noble baroness who moved the amendment <e> <s> this is an important matter and it should be included in the bill <e> <s> it must be the most ghastly shock to anyone to be told that he is suffering from hiv and that this may lead to full-blown aids <e> <s> moreover on top of this to be unable to obtain a job and to find that one is not acceptable to an employer must be the end <e> <s> such people must wish that the end would come sooner rather than later <e> <s> i have seen people who have acquired this ghastly ailment <e> <s> in my view if this provision is not made part of the bill then the employer is under no obligation to give that person a job or to let such a person keep an existing job <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend the minister for his encouraging reply <e> <s> however can he specify the quantities of food that have been sent by this country and by the other european countries to what we understand as that very beleaguered country which is part of europe <e> <s> we owe poland and her people a great debt of gratitude for all that they did for us during the last war <e>", "<cs> my lords if one is a parent whose child is missing and wants to try to find the child is there anywhere one can apply now before the ministers right honourable friend makes up his mind <e>", "<cs> my lords further to the question put by the noble lord lord grimond does the minister believe that it would be a good idea if he consulted london transport and indeed so far as he could insisted that all its members travel to work by underground <e>", "<cs> my lords mention has been made that some local authorities devise their own guidelines in such cases <e> <s> i wonder whether my noble and learned friend would think it appropriate in future to ensure that most local authorities should be guided in the same way <e> <s> alternatively perhaps in his wisdom he thinks that there is no necessity for such a safeguard <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask whether it is envisaged that the provision should apply to any particular age group <e>", "<cs> my lords i have the privilege of following the very exellent speech of the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs <e> <s> i should like to congratulate her on her speech and for introducing this vitally important subject <e> <s> from the list of speakers it is very obvious that all in the house today and many who would like to have been here are very worried about the turn of events that has taken place in our country with regard to the family in recent years <e>", "<cs> i am upset no i am amazed that so many men on my side of the house should laugh about me being upset about fathers <e> <s> i am upset because i sincerely believe that fathers receive a very raw deal <e> <s> fathers have helped to create their child unless the child was created by this awful aid process and have had some say in it <e> <s> fathers and mothers are responsible for their children being born <e> <s> when a separation occurs in a family so often the courts give custody of the children to the mother

great deal of money <e> <s> she had said i will give you this money if you promise never to see your children again nor ever want to <e> <s> that goes against human nature and parental caring <e> <s> it is absolutely wrong to believe that the children will not want to see their father <e> <s> it is also completely unrealistic because the more that the parent who has custody tries to keep the children away from the other parent the more the children will want to see that parent and always will <e> <s> i do not know of a single child who does not want to see the separated parent <e> <s> it is unrealistic for a mother to believe that because she has fallen out with the father the children will not want to see him <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a great privilege to follow the noble and learned lord lord brightman and i was very interested in his story of mr brown as i am sure the charity commissioners will be <e> <s> if we can relate that story throughout the charity world then i

minister say whether the police when they apprehend people for drunken driving of motor vehicles at any time of day or night also test eyesight or have reason to ask the drivers to have their eyesight tested <e> <s> many of us on this side of the house and i think the whole house know that defective eyesight is a cause of accidents <e>", "<cs> i also wish to support the noble lord lord hutchinson <e> <s> i feel strongly that in this particular case of bail after having for many years tried to solve the problem myself it is vital for the man or woman concerned that he or she should have legally qualified representatives especially in the case of the judge in chambers where as the noble lord has said no members of the public are admitted and very few notes are kept <e> <s> those two factors together make it vitally important that this amendment should be added to the bill <e>", "<cs> a few lay people have the opportunity of addressing noble lords in this committee stage of this very important bill <e> <s> before starting i should like to pay a very deep tribute to all the people who have taken part in the proceedings on the bill <e> <s> i have learnt a great deal but i listened

about this <e> <s> unfortunately the noble lord lord ennals seems to be on the wrong foot <e> <s> he gives great credit to the mother and of course it is the mothers who give birth to the children but

that position is serious at this moment <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the figures that the noble earl has given us about the extra number of places in our prisons is he satisfied that the prison service is taking on and encouraging a sufficient number of prison officers to staff the prisons <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend sits down i wonder whether she can help those of us who are concerned with the homeless <e> <s> i am very worried as i am sure we all are about the variety of people who are unable to be on a gps list <e> <s> can she tell us how such people can get on a list

who work for the organisations act out of love and care for people in those unfortunate circumstances <e>", "<cs> at this late hour i shall be brief <e> <s> i gave notice of my intention to oppose the question that clause should stand part of the bill because it was not fit and proper when only two amendments had been tabled <e> <s> since then we have had a reasonable debate which will continue at length on report <e> <s> i thank the minister for a most helpful and comprehensive letter which i received today <e>", "<cs> i should like to congratulate the government upon what they have done so

this afternoon whether she will take the amendment away and see what can be done <e> <s> i know that that is difficult and that many people are worried about those people who are in my estimation the most vulnerable in society for the reason given by the noble earl lord russell <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a privilege to follow the noble lord lord rees-mogg as he is chairman of the broadcasting
