["<cs> my lords it is a pleasure to follow my noble friend lord hunt with whose views about comprehensive schools i find find myself in complete agreement <e> <s> this education bill reflects the determination of the conservative government to deprive thousands of young people of education beyond the age of or <e> <s> it is true as has said in this house and as has also been said by dr boyson in another place that if certain areas wish to retain their comprehensive schools they may do so <e> <s> if certain areas wish to change to comprehensive education they may do so <e> <s> but the main purpose of the bill is to establish a selective system of education in which the brightest children of secondary school age will be educated in grammar schools while the rest will attend schools staffed and equipped for pupils who are assumed to lack academic ability and who are not expected to remain at school beyond the age of or <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a special interest in this education bill as a governor of a large comprehensive school and an evening institute in inner london and i have listened with very great interest to the speeches today and have learned much from them <e> <s> it is my belief shared i think by some if not all members of this house that education is the most important of all our social services <e> <s> a democratic society depends for its survival on the active participation in national and local affairs not only of the privileged few but of all its members and to achieve this end it is necessary to provide a system of education which will meet the needs of young people of widely different cultural backgrounds and levels of ability <e>", "<cs> i gave much thought to that and decided that it meant that the course should not be longer than four hours minutes <e>", "<cs> if this amendment became law would the school always be compelled to take the younger children in a family if the older one attended <e> <s> i am not a lawyer and i do not know <e>", "<cs> from what the noble baroness has said it seems to me that it is still wholly to the advantage of both the school and the parents that where possible the children should attend the local school <e> <s> i can see no objection to that <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first congratulate the right reverend prelate on his maiden speech which was of exceptional interest to us all <e> <s> we hope we shall have many further opportunities of hearing him <e> <s> many of your lordships will agree that the provision of adequate housing accommodation for those with urgent housing needs is one of the most important duties undertaken by local authorities <e> <s> we know of the misery and tragedies that may be associated with homelessness of the countless problems associated with overcrowding and insecurity of tenure and the suffering of tenants who live in high-rise buildings <e> <s> i first visited tenants in this type of building as a student many years ago <e> <s> what struck me then and has done often since is the loneliness of life in these buildings <e> <s> unlike the residents of council houses and flats which are only a few storeys high the residents of high-rise flats are usually unaware even of the names of their next door neighbours <e> <s> the need to travel or more storeys by lifts which not infrequently break down does not encourage high-rise residents to go out to visit friends or attend meetings or go for walks in the local park <e> <s> the views from the windows of some of these high-rise buildings may be of interest to visitors but there is created a great feeling of loneliness and isolation in the minds of the residents <e> <s> residents in modern council flats which may be only three or four storeys high will usually know their neighbours while when they look out of the window they will see children at play and will almost certainly participate in group activities <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say first <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like first to thank my noble friend for giving us the opportunity of debating this subject which i regard as a highly important one <e> <s> clearly there is a growing need for greater sex equality in the united kingdom than is available today <e> <s> although the equal opportunities commission established in is an important body in itself it has achieved little to date and one need only consider the composition of the other place and of the cabinet in order to realise the high degree of sex inequality which predominates in this country <e> <s> apart from the prime minister all the remaining members of the cabinet are male all but one of the senior ministers who are not in the cabinet are male and all but one of the junior ministers are male <e> <s> since the total num <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say first how much i appreciated the speech of the noble baroness lady platt of writtle and hope we have many further opportunities to hear her i am sure we shall <e> <s> as a governor of an institute of adult education and of a large comprehensive school i am convinced that we should give the highest possible priority to the educational needs of our community at every age and intelligence level <e> <s> our aim should be to ensure that all members of the community reach their full educational potential <e> <s> when we achieve this end there will be i am convinced a transformation in our society <e> <s> it would be i am sure in the interests of our population as a whole if more financial aid and encouragement were given to the institutes of adult education as well as the universities <e> <s> their achievements are in many fields outstanding <e>", "<cs> my lords i take part in this debate as a governor of an evening institute which like many other such institutes in this country undertakes work of great educational and social <e>", "<cs> i should like to suggest that one word should be added to this amendment in the first line so that it reads <e>", "<cs> my lords as a former chairman of governors at a london teaching hospital i welcome the opportunity my noble friends bill has given us to consider the heavy responsibilities and long hours of work of junior hospital doctors <e> <s> i do not recall when i was in the hospital any complaints being made by them but i am sure that their exacting duties which were of such great importance to their patients left many of them worn out at the end of many working days <e> <s> i am sure too that the majority of hospital patients are deeply grateful to the hospital doctors and to their nurses for the treatment they receive <e> <s> when considering my noble friends bill we must bear in mind that fatigue can be a dangerous symptom and it may affect a doctors judgment relating to his patients needs <e> <s> doctors of course are aware of this and will normally avoid snap decisions <e>", "<cs> my lords may i suggest that we consult her majestys mistress for the robes the duchess of grafton who is herself a justice of the peace and a magistrate of very wide experience at every level <e> <s> she has been with her majesty for many years and i believe that she could be most useful with suggestions <e>", "<cs> my lords as the governor of a large comprehensive school i am very glad to be here this afternoon to hear and will read later the views of those who are also governors or who have much to do with schools <e> <s> i welcome this debate and the opportunity for learning and considering the problems through the eyes and ears of many different people <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the fact that the last paper issued by the department of education cost may i ask whether parents pupils and teachers will be able to obtain reports from the department without having to pay for them <e>"]
