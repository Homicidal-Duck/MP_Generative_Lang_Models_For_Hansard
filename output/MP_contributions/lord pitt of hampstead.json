["<cs> my lords i must begin by apologising for not being here at the beginning of this debate <e> <s> as usual my professional duties made that difficult <e> <s> from what i heard when i came here i realised that i had missed a great deal in not being able to hear the whole of the speech of the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor <e> <s> i can assure him that tomorrow morning i shall read <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to point out to the noble lord lord wolverton that of course we shall have more houses if we build more houses <e> <s> the only proposal that we have before us is to sell those that we have <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord leaves that point i specifically asked him about the governments intention in relation to the bill which was lost as a result of dissolution which aimed at enabling local authorities to receive grants from central government to enable them to fight against racial disadvantage <e> <s> the noble lord has not answered that <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord not agree that in fact it is a case of sex discrimination <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of the right reverend prelate the bishop of newcastle who has not yet made his maiden speech may i ask the minister whether he is aware that at a recent meeting of the anglican bishops of scotland england and wales a unanimous resolution was passed asking the government to note their support for this fund and expressing their concern at the possible consequences if it is cut back <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord lord davies of leek that we ought to spend more time thinking about the consequences of the new technology in terms of its effects on not just the family but on the whole of our civilised life <e> <s> however i shall not today follow him in quite that vein <e> <s> i shall speak as is my custom on a few matters which worry me <e> <s> i wish to begin my remarks by congratulating the three maiden speakers the noble lord lord brooks of tremorfa the noble lord lord underhill i cannot call him that i shall call him reg as i have always called him and the noble lord lord galpern who have made three very good maiden speeches which means that in future we shall hear many good speeches in your lordships house <e> <s> i hope that they will attend and give us regularly the type of speeches which they have given today <e>", "<cs> my lords i said that their policy will restrict the development of nursery education <e> <s> the noble baroness has merely confirmed that and i thank her <e> <s> that is not all <e> <s> there is also a danger that there will be an increase in the cost of school meals and perhaps even the loss of school milk <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware of the fact that because of the suggestion to charge a smaller fee to people from the eec it will be possible for a student from martinique to come here and be educated at a cheaper rate than a student from st lucia whereas in fact the martinique <e>", "<cs> my lords will not the foreign secretary in doing what is really a balancing act accept that perhaps too short a period could be as dangerous as too long a period if not more dangerous <e> <s> in other words does he not think that an extension of the period by a month or two may provide a more balanced election which would be seen to be fair and which would be accepted as fair whereas an election that has been forced through in a short period may be regarded as a rigged election and therefore the rebellion does not end or the problem which that area now faces may in fact continue <e>", "<cs> my lords am i to understand the noble lord properly <e> <s> is he saying that because there is at this moment the war between the forces of zimbabwe-rhodesia and people from zimbabwe-rhodesia who are in fact trying to overthrow the government of the country of which they were members in other words the forces of mr nkomo and mr mugabe it is right for the forces from zimbabwe-rhodesia to take action such as the bombing of the tanzam railway which in fact invites retaliation from the zambian forces <e> <s> is that what the noble lord is suggesting <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry the noble lord is not answering the question <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has not answered my question because what i am asking him is is he aware that the bombing of the tanzam railway invites retaliation from the forces of zambia and therefore in fact could cause an escalation and an enlargement of the war <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord and all members of your lordships house will know that i do not agree that firm immigration controls in fact are an aid to good race relations <e> <s> you have often heard me say hat they do the direct opposite <e> <s> how <e>", "<cs> my lords may i be the first to congratulate the noble earl on his maiden speech which i found very interesting and also to thank him for what he said because his speech will fit in very well with mine <e> <s> i say that because he was speaking for a rural area while i of course am speaking as a gp in a very deprived inner city area but i am a single-handed practitioner <e> <s> i started this practice in and saw it grow <e> <s> i saw the first patient come in <e> <s> before that i worked as an assistant in a general practice in chiswick and prior to that i was <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord allow me to intervene <e> <s> when i started my practice for the first five years i did night service for a doctor who lived down the road so having a deputising service is not as new as all that <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble and learned lord to tell me how he arrives at the figure of million or million <e>", "<cs> if the noble and learned lord is talking about my lords then that could not have been so even then because india and pakistan were already independent <e>", "<cs> but they were not colonies <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say how honoured i am to be following the noble and learned lord lord scarman and how grateful i am sure we all are for his clear exposition of the legal position <e> <s> i like him would like to congratulate the government for producing the white paper before bringing out the final rules and thus giving a chance to see if we can prevent them making bad errors <e> <s> i should like to thank the noble lord lord avebury for giving us the opportunity to have this debate and also i should like to congratulate and to thank the right reverend prelate the bishop of bradford for his very positive contribution to this debate <e> <s> i hope he will give us many more opportunities like this to listen to him although i hope it will not be on this subject <e>", "<cs> but not if someone is coming in <e> <s> what is the defence for such an attitude <e> <s> having dealt with that point i want to make a comment on the general attitude of immigration officers <e> <s> your lordships will know that last year i chaired a commission which was investigating the bermuda riots of december <e> <s> there were four members of the commission from bermuda and three of them were black <e> <s> one of the conditions that i made on accepting the appointment was that the report would be written in this country <e> <s> i had my reasons and they were very firm ones <e> <s> when the commission was told that one of the members said is that essential <e> <s> i hate going into that place <e> <s> the immigration officers always treat me badly <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble baroness will allow me to intervene i am sorry to disturb her and i thank her for her courtesy <e> <s> i know that a very small percentage of the people who have been deported were in fact black <e> <s> the point however was that the intro <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to delay the house but before the noble lord sits down will he comment on a point which i hold very strongly about children the question of sole responsibility <e> <s> i have raised the point with umpteen previous ministers so it will not matter if the noble lord is in difficulty over answering me tonight <e> <s> all i hope is that he will undertake to ask his right honourable friend to look at whether the word sole can be changed to main <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise for not putting my name down on the list of speakers <e> <s> however as three noble lords whose names were down have been scratched from the list i think that i can safely take some of the minutes that they would have taken <e> <s> i wish to support my noble friend lord hatch of lusby in his plea to the government on behalf of the british council <e> <s> the council is a goodwill organisation but it has a quite open selfish motive <e> <s> it is in british interests to promote personal exchanges with other countries and that is something that we should face <e> <s> it is partly a matter of getting a showing overseas for british achievements but even more a way of assisting harmonious relations and that is in the interests of world peace which must be a major british interest <e> <s> in addition it creates an atmosphere which is sympathetic to british trade <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down would he clarify the governments attitude on the question of local authorities continuing to have responsibility for film censorship <e> <s> because that was the one part of the report of the williams committee which i welcomed having experienced the problem in the past <e> <s> is the noble lord suggesting that it is not a good thing that local authorities should be relieved of this terrible burden of having to decide whether or not films should be shown in their areas of having to use in fact other laws and other powers in order to censor films in their areas <e> <s> does he not think that the suggestion that that should stop and that there should be a straightforward board which carries out the censoring would be a great improvement <e> <s> i was a little disappointed in his comment on that particular point because it sounded to me as though he was suggesting that things should stay as they are <e> <s> i hope that is not so <e>", "<cs> the reds do <e>", "<cs> my lords was not the lancaster house agreement one in which the security forces were to return to barracks while the guerrillas went to assembly areas <e> <s> does not a great deal of the trouble result from the fact that the security forces were not made to go to barracks <e> <s> on the contrary auxiliaries are allowed to roam <e> <s> mr garfield todd said in a radio broadcast it was the day be was arrested that one of the reasons why he was arrested was because he was pointing out that the only way one can get guerrillas to come to the assembly areas is also to make the auxiliary forces go to barracks <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect the minister has not answered my question <e> <s> the question i am asking is this <e> <s> is not the basic cause of all the trouble the failure to observe the lancaster house agreement under which the security forces would return to barracks while the guerrillas went to assembly points <e>", "<cs> my lords i must begin with two apologies <e> <s> the first is to the noble lord lord kaldor because i was not in time to hear his speech <e> <s> i know that he was aware that i would not be present and i have no doubt as to the kind of speech he made <e> <s> i shall certainly read it in hansard with great interest <e> <s> i heard all the other speakers including the minister <e> <s> my second apology is to the noble lord lord harris of high cross <e> <s> i earlier looked around and did not see anyone rising to speak so i thought that i had better get to my feet <e> <s> this is the explanation of why i rose to speak before the noble lord <e> <s> i cannot follow him in his very interesting speech because i want to deal with something quite specific <e> <s> the noble lord lord cockfield said that the proportion we spend on public services must bear a certain relationship to our wealth that if in fact we are not as wealthy as some other countries then we cannot spend as high a proportion of our wealth on public services as those other countries do <e> <s> i want to start to challenge the noble lord there because it is characteristic of the poor that they have to spend a higher percentage of their income on the basic necessities <e> <s> i am sorry that the noble lords logic was not sound on this occasion <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> all that i am saying is that when you reduce the taxation as mr heath did they do not spend it on manufacturing industry <e> <s> they do not invest in manufacturing industry but in other things from which they think they can get profit <e> <s> that is why i mentioned gold <e>", "<cs> my lords i must begin as i normally do by apologising for not hearing the opening speech <e> <s> on this occasion i did not hear the first four speeches <e> <s> i am sorry about that and i hope your lordships will as usual forgive me <e> <s> it is particularly unfortunate on this occasion in view of what i now intend to say <e> <s> some of your lordships will remember that on a previous occasion i said that stansted would become londons third airport by stealth <e> <s> now we are well on our way to achieving that and whatever may be said to the contrary the practical effect of the governments statement on airports policy on th december is to designate stansted as a major international airport with a potential eventual capacity nearly double that of heathrow today that is <e>", "<cs> my lords what the noble viscount has said is that the million comes after you have cut million <e> <s> therefore in effect you ought to be saying that you have given million <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl sits down will be he kind enough to tell me how much this particular scheme is estimated to cost <e> <s> he must have some idea <e>", "<cs> my lords may i begin by thanking my noble friend lord listowel for introducing this debate <e> <s> i apologise to him for not being in my place to hear his speech <e> <s> i received a call just before coming here and had to visit a patient <e> <s> that explains the apology i need to give the noble lord lord vernon because i had to get the patient into hospital and had to slip out during lord vernons speech to make the appropriate arrangements <e> <s> i hope they will forgive me <e> <s> i can assure both the noble earl lord listowel and the noble lord lord vernon that i will read their speeches in <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord seems to be moving away from the point i raised <e> <s> i have the impression that in effect the government or probably on this occasion the noble lord have not given enough information to the house about the part that we as a developed country would play in accepting manufactured goods from the developing countries <e> <s> the noble lord did not seem to deal with that point which i thought was important <e> <s> as the noble lord seems to be moving towards the political aspect of this matter perhaps he can give us some assurance on my point <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to interrupt the noble lord too much but are not the government missing the point that investment in overseas development should be regarded as an investment and therefore it is not a question of eating the seedcornit is a question of using it in order to produce more corn <e>", "<cs> it is not a question of any objection to the capping of the pool i think that that has been generally agreed by the local authorities by the teachers and by all concerned but that it was regarded as part of a package deal that in addition to the capping of the pool there would be this commission which would make sure that the maintained sector of further education did not deteriorate <e> <s> that is the real point <e> <s> it should by a body much like the ugc which would do for the maintained sector what the ugc does for the universities <e> <s> that is all that is being asked no more <e> <s> i cannot see why the government cannot accept the amendment <e> <s> if they cannot accept it today perhaps they can undertake to look at it again during the report stage <e> <s> it seems to me that there is not a big gap between us <e> <s> we have accepted that the pool must be capped but we are saying that there should be this body to look at this particular sector and ensure that as a consequence of the capping it does not deteriorate <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness is usually straightforward in the way she replies to debates but she was not really quite straightforward on this occasion because the debate is not about whether or not there will be charges for meals <e> <s> that has been settled <e> <s> it is about whether or not in addition to the local authorities being required to provide meals at midday for people on supplementary benefit they should be required to provide it for others as well <e> <s> that is the difference <e> <s> this million which she flashed in the air is not really true <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the noble baroness lady macleod of borve is opposed to the bill because she takes a very progressive view on most matters particularly social matters and often i tend to agree with her <e> <s> i am sorry that on this occasion not only do i not agree with her but i doubt whether her late husband would have agreed with her either <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt the noble baroness <e> <s> there was a survey carried out not so very long ago i am sorry the noble baroness has not read it in which several local authorities were in fact questioned about their housing policies and it was discovered that quite a few of them were discriminating <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord go on reading the document <e> <s> there is another sentence or another paragraph just after that which says something else <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not take part in the previous debate because i wanted to speak on this motion and i wanted to speak in different terms and in a different tone from the way in which the previous debate was taking place <e> <s> therefore with your lordships permission i should like to welcome this order and to say a few things that i want to say because this is the last time that we shall debate zimbabwe in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not delay your lordships very long but i feel the need to stand up and be counted this afternoon and to indicate my detestation of this mean bill <e> <s> i would also wish to express my sorrow that the government have felt the need <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord banks answered that question and i agreed with him <e> <s> if that is the view of the government then in the bill that we are debating tomorrow in committee they should put an obligation on the unions to pay strike pay <e> <s> they would fight it as they will fight all the clauses in the employment bill but i can assure the noble lord and other members of your lordships house that that would have a better effect than what is now being proposed <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that it is in the context of the countrys very difficult housing situation that this bill should be examined <e> <s> it is in terms of its contribution in helping to solve the housing problem that like my noble friend lady birk i have examined this bill <e> <s> the bill proposes to give security of tenure and the right to buy their homes to tenants of local authorities and other bodies to make provision with respect to those and other tenants to amend the law about housing finance in the public sector and to make other provisions with respect to housing <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness sits down will she be kind enough to tell me how if in fact taxes on cigarettes and alcohol were increased slightly in order to cover this expenditure it would in fact have disturbed the governments strategy <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness realises that she has not answered my question i hope <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear that i am prepared to give lom ii only a guarded welcome <e> <s> we are having this debate today only one day after the announcement of the largest unemployment figure in this country since the war <e> <s> it may well he that britains journey in the field of increasing unemployment is faster than that of her partners in the community but the fact remains that this increase in unemployment is part of a pattern <e> <s> therefore it seemed to me that the lom agreement as we now have it is a missed opportunity <e> <s> there was an opportunity to have transferred much larger resources to the acp countries <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord hylton decides whether or not to withdraw this amendment may i draw your lordships attention to one of the losses that are likely to be incurred through this bill <e> <s> the greater london council builds a lot of seaside bungalows for old people <e> <s> there is not the slightest doubt that they are very attractive and in fact they will be sold <e> <s> i cannot see the glc going on building those bungalows merely for people to sell them <e>", "<cs> admittedly you do not have to replace every house but you will have to replace a certain number of them <e> <s> therefore the fewer houses there are in an area like the area about which the noble lord lord hylton was speaking the more difficulty there will be <e> <s> the argument that you do not have to replace all the houses is not the argument <e> <s> the argument is that if there are only a few houses and they are sold then the replacement which will be necessary may be very difficult <e>", "<cs> it certainly does <e>", "<cs> may i remind the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i accept that of course <e>", "<cs> in order not to have to intervene when the minister is speaking again may i take the opportunity of explaining to him how i see the situation <e> <s> he and i have obviously had different experiences <e> <s> in london a percentage of dwellings has always become available for reletting <e>", "<cs> i should like to say to the noble duke that i hope later on when we are discussing finance i shall get his support <e>", "<cs> i have listened to the debate and have not intervened but i cannot refrain from intervening any more <e> <s> i am very sorry to hear the answer the government have given on this amendment <e> <s> there is no reason why a local authority cannot go to court and get an order <e> <s> all that is being asked for is that instead of proceeding high-handedly and seizing goods and local authorities are the only people who can do it there is no reason why they cannot go to court like everybody else <e> <s> i cannot see any reason why there should be any excuse given for local authorities insisting that they should have the right to be so high-handed <e>", "<cs> that is not relevant <e>", "<cs> i shall not delay the committee much longer but did the government take seriously the account which the noble lord lord gifford has just given <e> <s> peoples goods a large amount were levied in order to pay a rent of a process which in the end produced <e>", "<cs> i would support the noble lord lord sandford on that <e> <s> i was going to make a suggestion along those lines because i feel that the base amount is as important as the reckonable expenditure or local contribution and i think consultations should be obligatory on all three <e> <s> i hope the government will accept the suggestion made by the noble lord lord sandford <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is certainly not able to withdraw the amendment and certainly will not do so <e> <s> on second reading i indicated that i thought that the least the government could do was to agree to pay per cent <e> <s> on this occasion i am demanding that they pay the whole lot because my own view is that that is the equitable arrangement <e> <s> it is all very well to say but if there is a loss then it would be met by subsidy <e> <s> i am talking about the government deliberately depriving local authorities of what might be a profit <e> <s> if i have an equity a house and it is worth then it is worth to me <e> <s> therefore if the local authority has such a house it is worth to them <e> <s> if the government say to them as they are saying you must sell that <e>", "<cs> yes i recognised the difficulty of this amendment when i put it down <e> <s> i merely hoped that the government would recognise the spirit of the amendment and accept its spirit <e> <s> in the circumstances i will withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> again i am not going to press the amendment <e> <s> on this occasion i do not agree with the noble lord <e> <s> we do not seem to have narrowed the gap but there is no point in pressing the amendment <e>", "<cs> although i probably shall withdraw the amendment i wish to point out to the noble lord that i am fully aware of this point <e> <s> i do not know what is his authority but the one that i used to be on invariably insisted on two things first that the building societies had turned you down and secondly that the borough council had turned you down <e> <s> it was only if you were turned down by the building societies and the london borough council that you got a mortgage from the glc <e> <s> so we were very much a lender of last resort <e> <s> but there are other amendments that may meet the noble lords ideas better than this one and i beg leave to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that the noble lord who has been in local government so long has such a poor opinion of local authorities that he thinks that they need to be told that they must change the rate every so often <e> <s> they will know if it is in terms of their own financial position whether it is necessary to put the rate up at that time <e>", "<cs> i regret that the government are taking a negative <e>", "<cs> i must say to the noble baroness that there is already a ceiling <e> <s> the regulations say that you can employ the equivalent of two-full time people <e> <s> that is a ceiling <e> <s> the ceiling is there and whether or not one of them is the doctorswife is irrelevant <e> <s> therefore the argument that there is no ceiling really does not hold water <e>", "<cs> may i again say to the noble baroness that there is a fallacy in this argument about increased expenditure <e> <s> as things are every doctor is entitled to employ up to the equivalent of two people <e> <s> if one of them is his wife then he employs somebody else <e> <s> if she is a nurse that means that he can employ only one other person <e> <s> if the noble baroness agrees that if she is a secretary she can be accepted then he can still employ only one other person <e> <s> so the argument about increased expenditure is a hollow one <e>", "<cs> the noble earl is probably right <e> <s> on the other hand in most parts of the country there are majority and minority parties <e> <s> what my <e>", "<cs> i shall not delay the committee very long but i was so disappointed at the speech of the minister that i felt i had to intervene <e> <s> we discussed the brandt report some time ago and the majority of us said that the government would not be able to do what is required unless it could carry public opinion <e> <s> it is quite clear that public opinion does not yet understand the issues <e> <s> we have been told how well television has been doing in the international sphere <e> <s> as i talk to people i find very few people understand what has happened in unctad and even fewer understand anything about the lom convention and its importance to us <e> <s> therefore i am not in agreement that so far we have been well served by the existing channels <e> <s> what the existing <e>", "<cs> in inviting your lordships to reject the transitional arrangements and particularly clause i want to challenge the governments objective criteria <e> <s> i will start with the claw-back in so far as london is concerned <e> <s> your lordships heard me comment before on the harm and unfairness to london through this claw-back in the rate support grant <e> <s> it is not without some interest that of the authorities to be penalised are london authorities <e> <s> they are london authorities because what happens all the time is that the social needs of london are ignored <e>", "<cs> would the minister indicate to what extent in arriving at these objective criteria the government have consulted the local authorities and their associations and to what extent there has been an agreement <e>", "<cs> my concern was with the claw-back <e> <s> has there been an agreement with say the london boroughs association about that <e>", "<cs> i think that this is the right time for me to ask the minister to explain and i do not expect him to take very long exactly the criteria that we use for determining relevant expenditure <e> <s> i want the criteria that are used <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> i really want to know the criteria that the noble lord used for determining it <e> <s> he has not told me that <e>", "<cs> i want to know exactly what the noble lord will accept as relevant expenditure for purposes of the rate poundage and expenditure <e> <s> perhaps i could illustrate this <e> <s> will the secretary of state say that it is only expenditure which in fact they have agreed to be related to certain specific activities that would be regarded as relevant expenditure <e> <s> if so what are those activities <e> <s> that is what i am after <e>", "<cs> but before determining it it will be discussed with the relevant associations will it not <e> <s> if the noble lord tells me that i shall be satisfied <e> <s> i have raised the subject because i should not like it to be thought and i know that it is thought in some quarters that in fact central government will merely dictate what shall be relevant expenditure for purposes of the rate support grant <e>", "<cs> as members of your lordships committee may guess i have some worries about multipliers and the way that they are used knowing what has happened to london in the past <e> <s> i wonder whether in the use of this multiplier we would not in effect be back where we started so far as london is concerned in this awful clawback situation <e> <s> i have heard it mentioned several times <e> <s> i wonder whether the minister can give me a little reassurance about the attitude that will be adopted towards london in all this <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord decides whether he is going to withdraw there is still the possibility and the minister can see the point that after the udc has been abandoned you will have this hotch-potch if in fact the udc decides to use the national form rather than the london regulations <e> <s> therefore i would have thought you needed this situation to be tightened <e> <s> i think this is one occasion when you really cannot have the flexibility which the minister is suggesting <e> <s> i wonder whether he will look at it again <e>", "<cs> but in view of the way in which the minister is explaining it if in fact the udc decides to use the national rather than the london regulations at the end of the day you can have a hotch-potch <e> <s> that is why flexibility is really not as useful as the minister is suggesting <e>", "<cs> the minister ought to have tried to convince us that the udc needs to have housing powers that is the thing about clause <e> <s> i know something about docklands <e> <s> there was in existence and still is a joint committee of the glc and the boroughs working to develop the area <e> <s> at this stage i am not arguing whether or not they should be replaced by a udc <e> <s> all right we have decided they should be replaced by a udc <e> <s> the argument now however is whether the udc needs to have housing powers in order to do the job <e> <s> i do not know about other members of the committee but certainly the minister has not convinced me that it needs to have housing powers in order to do the job <e> <s> in the area we are talking about there are already nine housing authorities <e> <s> the minister is indicating that he is going to add a tenth housing authority <e>", "<cs> is the minister saying that there does not appear to the government to be any need to be doing anything about the people who will in fact be thrown out of work say in the docklands area as a result of the setting up of the new urban development corporation <e> <s> i would have thought that at least some provision would be made for taking care of these matters <e>", "<cs> i am sorry but you do wind up <e> <s> there is a joint dockland development organisation at this moment <e> <s> as a consequence of the setting up of the urban development corporation it has to be wound up <e>", "<cs> already there are people who are thrown out of work <e> <s> the chief officer of the ddo will be out of a job because in effect the designated udc has appointed a chief officer so that you already have an example of what will happen <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way to me for one second <e>", "<cs> my lords am i to understand from what the noble lord is saying that no government should change their course even though they have found from the development of events that the course seems to be wrong <e> <s> must one merely accept that because the government are sincere and are sticking to their course they ought to be given credit for doing so <e>", "<cs> they are asking <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord confirm or deny that when the conference between the government of st kitts-nevis-anguilla and the british government was held there was an agreement that after independence in fact three months after independence there should be a referendum in nevis as to whether they should have separation from st kitts <e>", "<cs> my lords i must begin by apologising to the noble lord lord gisborough for missing most of his speech <e> <s> i am sorry about that because from what i have heard from other speakers i have obviously missed a great deal <e> <s> i shall study <e>", "<cs> my lords what i said must be taken in the context of my opening and closing remarks <e> <s> i said that the question of privatisation or otherwise must be judged in the context of efficiency <e> <s> what the noble viscount is saying is not really relevant to the point i was making <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to follow the noble baroness because she has raised the question of overseas doctors and this order seems to me to be another example of the discrimination which overseas doctors experience as opposed to doctors from the eec <e> <s> an overseas doctor who wants to practise here has to pass a language test that is settled <e> <s> personally i think it is right that that should be so but we now have this new arrangement under which doctors from the eec can come here <e> <s> they do not have to pass a language test and they are registered because of their qualification in the

strict in observing them <e>", "<cs> my lords may i apologise for not putting my name down to speak <e> <s> however i thought that i ought to add my pennyworth to this <e>", "<cs> my lords as one of the members of your lordships house who in december tried to get section of the act repealed on the basis of a bill introduced by the noble lord lord avebury i want to welcome this bill in so far as clause is concerned <e> <s> i do not think that there is any need for anybody to dilate on the difficulties and dangers that existed in this particular section this law which made it possible for people to be convicted and even go to prison without having committed any offence <e> <s> that was the danger of sus <e> <s> in effect it was possible under the law for somebody to be convicted and imprisoned without ever having actually committed an offence <e> <s> therefore i am glad that that is to be out of the way <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to delay the house unduly <e> <s> what i said was that there are certain features of this new law which will allow for the same feeling of not having been justly dealt with as existed on sus <e> <s> this was my point <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise that you have to accept me instead of the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos <e> <s> apparently the whips office made a mistake and when the noble lord withdrew his name they thought

particular clause <e> <s> may i ask the government whether they would look at it again and see whether it can be tightened <e> <s> i am still worried about the possible consequences that will flow from our passing this clause <e> <s> i am not asking for anything more than that i would like the government to look at it again to see in what way it can be tightened <e>", "<cs> my lords there can be two interpretations of a per cent <e> <s> overspend <e> <s> one is that local authorities are spending to the extent of per cent <e> <s> more than they should <e> <s> the other is that the basic grant-related element that is the basic expenditure which the central government are laying down is too low <e> <s> therefore in their consultations with the local authorities will the government bear that point in mind and see whether there can be a negotiated agreement <e> <s> it seems to me i am expressing an opinion that what has happened is that central government have laid down a level of expenditure which in fact is too low and which local authorities are finding it extremely difficult to meet <e> <s> there is a meeting point which for the last two years or months we have been talking about and which seems to me to be the problem that central government have laid down a level of expenditure that that level of expenditure is very difficult for local authorities to meet and that central government are insisting upon their level of expenditure being met and are using a particular weapon which in fact does not help <e> <s> all it does is to cause the ratepayers to pay more <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with what has been said by the two speakers who have preceded me but in my case i want to deal with the lom convention <e> <s> first because i have a personal interest in it in that i was an observer of the first meeting in brussels and i know some of the problems and some of the battles which took place behind the scenes to mould the acp together into one group <e> <s> in fact it was taken for granted that the french would be able to deal with it in the way that they had dealt with all previous conferences by leading the francophone countries in one direction and leaving the others to battle for themselves <e> <s> but in effect it was only because of the work of the present secretary general of the commonwealth shridath ramphal that the acp countries were brought together and moulded into the group they are now <e> <s> therefore i have a strong personal interest in the success of lom <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we are all grateful to the noble baroness for giving us this opportunity to debate this very important subject and for the clarity of her speech in introducing the debate <e> <s> it is always a great pleasure to listen to the noble baroness and today was no exception <e> <s> i wish to congratulate the right reverend prelate the bishop of lichfield and the noble lord lord beloff on their maiden speeches <e> <s> they both made very good and interesting speeches touching on the subject of our debate <e> <s> i am sure that your lordships will look forward to hearing them both on many other occasions in debates in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords as the minister knows the first thing about section is that it is only for staff and therefore it has a very limited value <e> <s> i am glad that he is touching on this question of the rate support grant complement relating to racial disadvantage <e> <s> i should like to hear something about that <e> <s> i should like him to dilate on that because what has happened is that the rate support grant has been redistributed away from the inner cities to the shire counties <e> <s> when that has been done how can you say that you have taken account of racial disadvantage <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble and learned lord and i do not mind if he does it publicly here indicate a single occasion on which he has known of racketeers from the west indies arranging illegal immigration <e>", "<cs> we are told that we are legislating for change <e> <s> that is perfectly true <e> <s> we are changing a code of practice that has existed for seven centuries

as to why there should be a change <e> <s> the closest we have come to it was the speech by the noble duke the duke of norfolk in which he said that because we are now in europe it is likely that a lot of europeans will be here and their children will be born here and we would not want them to be british <e> <s> i am paraphrasing him <e>", "<cs> i have always indicated that i would not press this amendment to a division <e> <s> having listened to the minister i was almost tempted to do so but i shall withdraw it and come back to it on report <e> <s> i hope that the government will give careful thought to what i have said <e> <s> it is all very well to be guided by deportation procedures but there are things that are more important than deportation procedures and i should have thought that what happens to a child and his whole life is important enough to warrant even a certain amount of flexibility about deportation procedures <e> <s> if the government are going to make the concession that they have obviously indicated they will make the choice of five years is just about right in terms of being the best time to do it with the minimum amount of difficulty <e> <s> i know only too well that children often go to school before they have actually reached five years of age <e> <s> but if the head teacher knows that a child is to register at five then the head teacher will ensure that the parent does so <e> <s> this is one of the reasons why i have suggested that we use the age of five <e> <s> i have said that i will withdraw the amendment so i beg leave to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to be able to follow the noble baroness because like her i am glad that belize is about to become independent and also like her i am worried that we are leading belize into independence in the way we are <e> <s> i am glad that we are not following the other place and having the belize bill going through all its stages in one sitting because i intend and i told the minister when i spoke to him a couple of days ago to try to amend the bill in two specific respects which may have the effect of delaying the date of independence but i believe it would be a right and proper thing to do <e> <s> first i support the noble baroness in saying that there should be a referendum not merely on whether or not they agree to the treaty with guatemala but whether or not they want independence either with the treaty or without it <e> <s> in other words i think in effect that in the case of belize it is necessary for the people to be invited to speak clearly and unequivocally as to what they want <e>", "<cs> my lords do i understand this correctly that the guatemalans therefore will not be able to protect the pipelines by stationing troops around them <e> <s> that is a point you know <e>", "<cs> my lords what i was asking was whether the government would undertake to make sure that people who are citizens of the united kingdom and colonies because of coming from belize will know of this change in status <e> <s> that is what i wanted so that those people will know that they need now to register as united kingdom citizens if they want to stay here <e>", "<cs> my lords the kind of thing i was talking about was that all these islands have organisations <e> <s> surely there will be a belizean society in britain and if the foreign office would just let the belizean society in britain know that this is the situation that would help <e>", "<cs> my lords i was referring to sending a letter to a society <e>", "<cs> my lords may i welcome this order

bill now stands if somebody is applying for naturalisation he has to prove he is of good character as i read it what my amendment suggests is that if the home secretary thinks that the man is of bad character the onus of proof should be on him <e> <s> he should have to say this man is of bad character and therefore cannot be naturalised rather than the other way round <e> <s> the reason for putting it that way is that if there are facts about this persons character they would be known to the home secretary and his officers <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the noble baroness in this amendment <e> <s> i am in general practice and i have patients who have been living here long enough to be able in fact to register or be naturalised but who in fact do not speak english <e> <s> their

kingdom and colonies and i had an english passport <e> <s> my english passport the last one before i needed to register was in <e> <s> it was a -year passport <e> <s> when grenada became independent in it was reckoned that there was no need to do anything about it because i had an english passport and i could travel with it <e> <s> in the passport lapsed and therefore i had to do something <e> <s> it was not until then that i registered as a citizen of the united kingdom and colonies the point being that i did not have to register before february because until february i was a citizen of the united and colonies by birth <e> <s> that is the point <e>", "<cs> why <e>", "<cs> i should just like to join my noble and learned friend in thanking the minister <e> <s> he has done a good deed today <e>", "<cs> i was not expecting the minister to accept the amendment <e> <s> i wanted him merely to give an undertaking <e>", "<cs> all i was trying to get out of the minister was an undertaking that in effect the grudging undertaking which he gave to his noble friend lord boyd-carpenter would be more generously given to me <e> <s> however in the same way as the government will exercise some discretion over the six years they will in fact do it over the five <e> <s> that was the point of my throwing it into the pool <e> <s> i had hoped that the minister would see it in that light and find that this was an opportunity to say that the government will look at both issues <e> <s> i see the point about the six years being allowed to become eight <e> <s> i sec also several points as to why the five years should become <e> <s> i merely hoped that the minister would say that he could foresee that there would be difficulties and that the government were prepared to look at it all <e> <s> in the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> before i make up my mind whether or not to press this amendment i wonder whether the noble lord the minister can tell me how many of those people are in line for the voucher scheme <e> <s> it would help me in making up my mind to know how many people are left after that <e>", "<cs> but are the whole entitled to apply for vouchers <e> <s> i do not think that they are <e> <s> after one has deducted the number of people who are entitled to apply for the voucher how many people will be left from the original figure <e>", "<cs> the point is that at the moment these people are citizens of the united kingdom and colonies <e> <s> a passport saying that one is a citizen of the united kingdom and colonies has some meaning <e> <s> we are now going to create a new british overseas citizenship and that class of citizenship will only have the status that any foreign country chooses to give to it <e> <s> at present if one of these people turns up in france holding a united kingdom and colonies passport which he obtained in say kenya the french will respect it <e> <s> there is no question about that <e> <s> the only problem that person has at the moment is that he is not allowed to enter freely into this country <e> <s> apart from that his existing passport is of full value to him <e>", "<cs> but how many people are left after that <e> <s> if all the people in the categories to which i am referring are capable of applying for vouchers that is one thing because i do not agree with the noble lord the minister that permitting entry to people who are in need and who are in difficulties in favour of those who are in the queue is so wrong <e> <s> those of us who have served in local government have followed that principle for years <e> <s> we have waiting lists of people for housing but people who become homeless are given priority over people on the waiting list because they are in greater need <e>", "<cs> the minister says that of them are living in malaysia that they are of indian descent and would not want to come here so the noble lord tripped himself up <e> <s> the point i am trying to get the government to take on board is that if by this legislation we are creating a group of citizens who as a consequence will have no settled home no place of abode then we should consider ourselves responsible for providing them with one and in the final ayalysis they should be able to come here <e> <s> that is the principle i want established <e> <s> the wording of my amendment is not the point <e> <s> what is at stake is the principle and the minister has not so far satisfied me that he accepts the principle <e>", "<cs> that is not the point <e> <s> either the foreign office has not really read my amendment or i have been putting the case very badly <e> <s> the amendment refers to anybody who does not have a right of abode <e> <s> the minister said that most of these people in malaysia are malaysian citizens <e> <s> therefore they do not come within the purview of my amendment because under clause i if they were living here they would be settled here while i am referring in the amendment to people who <e>", "<cs> i would like to press this to a division <e> <s> i will test the committee <e>", "<cs> i have been thinking long and hard <e> <s> i was listening in the hope that the minister would give me an assurance <e> <s> i pointed to the number of letters i have received <e> <s> it shows that many people are worried that naturalisation and registration is subject to the discretion of the secretary of state and there is no appeal <e> <s> they feel there should be some machinery which would enable them to appeal against the decisions <e> <s> i was hoping the minister would say that at least they were going to contemplate some form of appeal machinery <e> <s> the minister answered me without at any stage saying that <e> <s> i regard that as of the utmost importance <e> <s> we need to reassure the people who are worried <e> <s> one of the ways we can do that is by saying that there is some form of review machinery which would enable anyone who is refused naturalisation or registration to have his case reviewed <e>", "<cs> i said it was not moved <e>", "<cs> i was going to ask the minister whether he would like to have another try at defining it but it seems that the government do not think ordinarily resident should be defined <e> <s> i think it ought to be defined i think people ought to know what ordinarily resident means because it is of such importance in terms of clause of this bill <e> <s> however we shall not get anywhere this evening <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the minister is not more accommodating on this <e> <s> i feel strongly about this <e> <s> i shall have to take it to a division <e> <s> seven years of continuous residence in this country is proof of close and continuing connection <e> <s> it is not necessary that it should be years <e> <s> the point about seven rather than is that years will affect children attending junior school <e> <s> i cannot believe that the government can be so insensitive to this point <e> <s> it is a most important point <e>", "<cs> my lords i ought to begin by apologising for not being in my place when the amendment was called <e> <s> i thank my noble friend lord elystan-morgan for moving it on my behalf <e> <s> this clause is really intended to take care of a particular situation which has existed for the past years but which is not really satisfactory <e> <s> i can best illustrate it by merely quoting myself <e> <s> i came to this country as a citizen of the united kingdom and colonies by birth because i was born in a colony <e> <s> i lived here for years before that colony became independent <e> <s> i suddenly found that i was no longer a citizen of the united kingdom and colonies but was a citizen of another country and had to go through the process of registering as a united kingdom and colonies citizen <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will allow me it is wrong to argue the matter in this way <e> <s> the very point of putting the st january is that the act gave the people who were settled here before st january a right to register <e> <s> they are in a different position from anybody who comes here after that <e> <s> it is a different situation <e> <s> that is really why the date st january is in this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords there are not that is the whole argument <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister not agree that in fact the answer to the noble dukes question is that pre-war this country had large unemployment and therefore was not an attractive place to which anyone would migrate that in fact there were other places for example the united states of america which under the new deal was expanding and was therefore more attractive as a place to which people might go that the war changed all this because during the war many people from the commonwealth came here not only in the forces but also to assist in <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not intended to intervene because i want to move my next amendment and i do intend to press it <e> <s> the point is that although the government are going a long way to meet us this does not really meet the point <e> <s> i was sorry the minister accepted my amendment no <e> <s> a but has missed the point <e> <s> if this bill becomes law and is effective from st january then any child who was born after will lose its right to register <e> <s> therefore that eight years cannot be discretionary it has to be a right <e> <s> therefore in effect what we need is not a change from five to eight years provided that certain conditions are met but a change from five to eight years <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether when he replies the minister will give an undertaking to consider deleting the words after commencement in line four to the end of the paragraph <e> <s> if those words are removed then the secretary of state will in effect have a discretion to register anybody up to eight years <e> <s> then there would be included the minors i am speaking of <e> <s> if however those words are retained those minors are excluded <e> <s> i should like him to give some thought as to whether those words cannot be deleted <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i shall have to divide the house again even though i may be defeated <e> <s> i still cannot understand why the government will not accept this amendment <e> <s> i may be misinterpreting clause of the immigration act but it seems to me that the implication of clause gives the secretary of state power to make rules under which people can be admitted and there is also a sentence which says shall not be taken to require uniform provision to be made <e> <s> in other words there can be different provision for different groups of people <e> <s> therefore i find it difficult to see why the government cannot accept the secretary of states rules under which these people can be attached to the voucher scheme <e> <s> at the moment of the people which the government admit are likely to be british overseas citizens of them are already due to be admitted through the voucher scheme <e> <s> there are only left after that <e> <s> of those most of them are living in malaysia and so far as i can see they have the right of abode there <e> <s> therefore only a small number of people are likely to be affected and all one is saying is that the secretary of state should make provision for that small number to be admitted <e> <s> the truth is that he can do it by requiring them to make an application so that they can be placed at the end of the voucher scheme <e> <s> there is nothing to prevent that being done <e> <s> that is all i am asking and i cannot see why the government should find it so difficult to make this concession <e> <s> my lords i shall have to divide the house <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord sits down it is obvious that he and i have interpreted this clause differently <e> <s> as i read the clause the secretary of state also has the power to withdraw citizenship on grounds of fraud false representation or concealment of material facts <e> <s> it is not only on the ground that the person has in fact committed the offences in paragraphs <e>", "<cs> my lords we are obviously at loggerheads on this <e> <s> my interpretation is different <e> <s> i should be glad if the noble and learned lord would write to me about this because i do not intend to divide the house <e> <s> but as i see it the secretary of state has the power to deprive people of their citizenship not only on the grounds mentioned in subsection but on the grounds mentioned in subsection <e> <s> the grounds mentioned in subsection would in fact result in people being stateless <e> <s> it was because of subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope it will be convenient to the house if we deal with the two amendments together <e> <s> i shall speak to no <e> <s> and formally move it at the right time <e> <s>

moreover we have a new system under which people are required to pay on application and not when they have received their citizenship <e> <s> as the noble lord lord avebury has already explained it means that the government are extracting an interest-free loan from these people and receiving money from them <e> <s> i cannot imagine that nothing is done with the money and therefore since the money must have been used in some way or other it does constitute a loan to the government for two years <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not delay your lordships for long because i wish to comment only on part ii of the bill <e> <s> my understanding is that million people will be affected by the proposals on housing benefits and that million or more than half will be affected adversely <e> <s> however strongly one wishes to support the principle of the bill those consequences cannot be accepted <e> <s> because the governments insistence on there being no increase in public expenditure is responsible for the fact that million of the million people affected will be adversely affected it is up to the government to face up to that fact and try to do justice to those people <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the minister aware that the statement he has just made was made in and that it is still not true <e> <s> it is true only in an aggregate form <e> <s> the question of distribution and the question of the areas in which houses are required is much more important than the aggregate <e>", "<cs> my lords the bill we are now passing would have one effect which has worried me all along but which has not received the attention it deserves <e> <s> until now local authorities in this country could never become bankrupt <e> <s> they were expected to balance their books year after year but if their expenditure exceeded the income anticipated they had the power to levy a supplementary rate in order to cover that <e> <s> what this bill does is to take away that power then empowers local authorities to borrow money and gives the creditors priority over their assets <e> <s> i remember when new york became bankrupt that a number of people asked me whether london could ever suffer the same fate <e> <s> i always said not but in truth i cannot say that any more <e>", "<cs> would the noble viscount give way would he tell me what is the average percentage of voting in general elections <e>", "<cs> my lords i had intended to wait until the minister had spoken before intervening but i cannot wait any longer <e> <s> the very arguments which the noble lord lord campbell of alloway has used for supporting the additional award because of people being dismissed for conscientious objection to belonging to a union hold equally true for people dismissed because of their colour or their sex <e> <s> the truth of the matter is that it is common knowledge that people do have difficulty in getting employment because of the colour of their skin <e> <s> if therefore they are deprived of such employment as they have managed to secure because of the colour of their skin they are in a very serious plight <e> <s> so it is an even stronger argument for them than for people who are deprived of their employment because of conscientious objections to being members of a trade union <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all grateful to the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale for introducing this debate <e> <s> i apologise that i missed the first couple of minutes of his speech because i did not think the debate would come on as quickly as it did <e> <s> i am personally grateful to the right reverend prelate the bishop of southwark for his speech which was very good <e> <s> i want particularly to underline the point he made about expectations <e> <s> it is possible for us to delude ourselves about that <e> <s> what has happened is the problem which confronted us last year was successfully defused by the noble and learned lord lord scarman <e> <s> the country should be very grateful to him for that <e> <s> the consequence of that is that there have been expectations and if these expectations are not fulfilled then the reaction may be something that we shall all regret <e> <s> i think it is fair that we ought to recognise this <e> <s> i am grateful again to the right reverend prelate for pointing out the importance of action because it is action that is required it is action that will deal with these expectations <e>", "<cs> my lords the hour is late and i do not intend to delay your lordships for very long <e> <s> may i begin by complimenting the noble baroness lady carnegy of lour on her maiden speech <e> <s> while she was speaking i remembered that when i was a student in edinburgh there was a chap called alfred carnegy who was extremely brilliant he won all the medals that were going <e> <s> it is nice to think that i am now being joined in this house by a female counterpart of alfred <e> <s> i look forward to hearing the noble baroness again <e>", "<cs> i want to make a few comments on the schedule even though i do not wish to make any amendments to it <e> <s> i am worried by a few points in this schedule <e> <s> i will not delay your lordships too long because it is late <e> <s> first there is the whole question of the family practitioner committee and its control on new medical entrants <e> <s> in order to explain my worries i will describe my own experiences <e> <s> in having been an assistant in a general practice in chiswick i decided to open a practice far away from my previous boss <e> <s> i discovered the area in euston where i now practise <e> <s> i was able to start a practice which i built up from scratch <e> <s> it was not until i built it up that i went to the committee and eventually secured from the committee the initial practice allowance <e> <s> as i see the present regulations and as i know from colleagues it seems almost impossible for anybody to do today what i did in <e> <s> in i started a practice from scratch and built it up <e>", "<cs> i support this amendment <e> <s> some of your lordships will remember that on a previous occasion when we had a debate on the national health service i instanced the haemophilia unit at the royal free <e> <s> the government need to look at this question of central funding of some services <e> <s> for example the issue about kidneys that i raised earlier in my other speech on birmingham illustrates the point <e> <s> the government need to look at this <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am very grateful to my noble friend lord oram for introducing this unstarred question <e> <s> at the moment the world is divided between rich and poor and also between black and white and the two are intertwined <e> <s> how to bridge the gap between rich and poor is one of the biggest problems confronting the world today <e> <s> the solution of this problem is one of the ways in which the world can be brought out of the present dark tunnel in which we are travelling to the rich sunlit uplands of which we all dream <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i disagree with the noble baroness lady trumpington <e> <s> the minister has given no real reason for this different approach to the fpcs from the approach to the health authorities <e> <s> the question of balance has been spoken to already by other speakers <e> <s> in fact the fpcs have always preserved that balance although they now elect both their chairman and vice-chairman <e> <s> you do not need the secretary of state in order to get balance <e> <s> as for the point about potential chairmen that i think is really the wrong way of using the appointment of a vice-chairman <e> <s> far from being a strong point for agreeing to this it is a very <e>", "<cs> this is a small point <e> <s> are we not being a little sexist in subsection or do we take it that his includes her in paragraphs <e>", "<cs> is the minister not being less than ingenuous <e> <s> if in effect local authorities are given guidance as to what are to be regarded as benefits how can the minister then say that they can reply in their plan including the things that they were told to exclude and that they will be considered by the minister <e>", "<cs> if in effect the executive is expected to prepare a plan in the preparation of which it has to take guidance from the minister then obviously the plan is being prepared between the secretary of state and the executive <e> <s> then at that stage the authority gets it <e> <s> but let us face it the authority gets a plan which the ministry and the executive have prepared together <e> <s> what powers does the authority really have <e> <s> it can override the minister and the executive and then finally the minister can say but that is the level beyond which you cannot go <e> <s> in other words the authority is being put in the middle <e> <s> the ministry and the executive are preparing plans which the ministry finally approves <e> <s> then if the authority does not happen to agree with the ministry it can be set up as the proverbial target to be shot at because in effect at all material times the executive and the ministry have discussed these matters <e> <s> when the matters actually come to the authority they come to the authority having been agreed between the executive and the ministry <e>", "<cs> i know that the minister does not have a closed mind and will therefore listen to the points that i put to him <e> <s> the scenario we have at the moment is that under this bill the transport executive in consultation with the ministry prepares a plan which the authority sees and then considers <e> <s> the authority also receives advice from the minister <e> <s> it is at that stage that the plan is finally decided by the authority and goes to the ministry <e> <s> i think i am right <e> <s> but in view of the fact that the minister has himself admitted that many of the considerations which are necessary to draw up a proper plan are not things that the executive can in fact consider or is competent to consider would it not be better for the scenario to be the other way round <e> <s> the government and the authority could discuss the matter first and the authority then give instructions to the transport executive so that the executive prepares a plan under the direction of the authority and that plan is eventually agreed upon and submitted to the ministry <e> <s> would that not be a better scenario <e>", "<cs> i am one of the noble lords who feel very strongly about the clause <e> <s> up until now we have committed ourselves to a procedure under which the ministry and the transport executive prepare a plan which will then go to the authority <e> <s> the authority might modify the plan if it wishes but it has to take into account guidance from the minister <e> <s> they then make a determination which goes to the minister <e> <s> if the determination is below or at the level at which the minister has suggested that subsidies are satisfactory that is all right <e> <s> but if it is above that level then in effect if we are to follow the white paper the authority run the risk of being surcharged <e>", "<cs> if the minister requires a review then he should meet the cost of that review <e> <s> the minister can meet that cost through the transport supplementary grant <e> <s> that is all that is required <e> <s> it is in effect a review demanded by central government and its cost should be met by central government through the grant that central government normally make to the transport authorities <e>", "<cs> might i try to see whether i can get the minister to look at this again <e> <s> we have been through all the provisions about the planning process culminating in the pel <e> <s> as noble lords know i do not quite agree with what has been decided so far but leaving that aside what is required by clause is that the whole of this process will wait but that the minister will in fact give guidance as to a level without the plan without any of the previous processes <e> <s> i do not know whether he will pick the sum out of a hat or out of the air <e> <s> there is not time for him to do the work which is required to make a proper guidance <e> <s> i cannot see what the government will lose by having the bill come into effect on st april while having the planning process start in april so that in the government can give proper guidance having had the proper planning process <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has failed to show in what way it is necessary for the information held by the immigration department to be exempt from this bill <e> <s> what we are talking about is allowing unregulated third party access to information collected for one purpose but which is designed for another <e> <s> this is the serious matter <e>", "<cs> but my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i had hoped that the minister would have improved on his performance in committee but i am afraid he has not he has simply read out his brief again <e> <s> he has missed the point <e> <s> we are trying to safeguard childrens fares <e> <s> if there is a certain amount of money available and it is spent on x it cannot be spent on y and therefore if childrens fares are included in the pel some authorities will feel that the answer is to subsidise other services rather than provide cheap fares for children <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that there is real value in this amendment which seems to have been ignored <e> <s> in fact it could be part of the planning of the programme that for the first year a deficit is incurred because for example you deliberately expect that over three years a certain level of fares will bring a certain level of passengers and that therefore you will cover your expenditure <e> <s> the way in which the government want it to be done is that you incur a deficit this year you are allowed to incur it the following year but you are not allowed to plan it over the three years which it seems to me you could do if this amendment were allowed <e>", "<cs> my lords the government ought to accept this amendment <e> <s> when the noble lord lord bellwin replied to amendment no <e> <s> he said that the government wanted the executive to submit a series of plans and a series of suggestions about the grants which it should receive from the authority <e> <s> i do not know how they can do that without consulting the authority and taking its advice <e> <s> in view of what the noble lord lord bellwin said on amendment no <e> <s> it seems to me that the government ought to accept the amendment <e> <s> it is also right in principle that they should do so <e> <s> the executive is asked to prepare a plan <e> <s> the plan requires that part of it should be the determination by the authority of what grant the authority is going to make to the executive <e> <s> it seems to me that before they can prepare the plan the executive must discuss with the authority what is likely to be the proposed grant just as much as they must discuss with the secretary of state what level of grant he is likely to accept <e> <s> in preparing the plan therefore advice must be taken from both <e> <s> i do not see how the government can refuse to accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the government will accept this amendment <e> <s> we are passing the bill this week probably today <e> <s> clause will then come into effect <e> <s> the government and the authorities will not have gone through the planning process in time for a proper estimate to be made of the payments that will start on friday <e> <s> the amendment provides a safeguard that would be useful to the government to the authorities and to the executives <e> <s> it allows for the government to continue their planning process while allowing the executives in the meantime to receive payments from the authorities without the proper determination incumbent upon them under clause <e> <s> the amendment is merely a safeguard in fact a sort of long stop which i consider given the circumstances in which we are passing the bill should be acceptable to the government <e> <s> i hope they will accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords this will be a very historic moment for your lordships house <e> <s> i hope that your lordships realise it <e> <s> although much history has been seen here with the independence of st kitts/nevis we are seeing what is virtually the end of the british empire <e> <s> st kitts/nevis has the

ask the noble lord that my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords this is the whole point that has angered me <e> <s> british west indian airways is owned by the trinidad government but every west indian government except jamaica has so far asked that british west indian airways should be made the regional carrier and on each occasion the british government because british airways objected has obstructed that <e> <s> it is no use any british minister saying that it is a matter for discussion between this government or that government <e> <s> in effect when the government come to make a decision they obstruct <e> <s> that is what has been happening with british west indian airways <e>", "<cs> my lords does the leader of the house not agree that our becoming a member of the european monetary system will do more than anything else to convince the europeans that we really are part of the community <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to refer briefly to five items in the gracious speech <e> <s> the first is the statement that <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord gives me this nice propaganda but that is not the issue i raised at all <e> <s> i raised the question of central funding of certain national health services and that is what i was concerned about <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while i thank the minister for that reply it is obviously intended to indicate that the government have no policy on mortgage interest rates <e> <s> am i right in assuming that <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the minister agree that in fact the right to buy by increasing the demand for mortgages per cent <e> <s> of which are handled by building societies has put greater pressure on the building societies <e>

at all my lords <e> <s> it is quite relevant <e>", "<cs> my lords we have heard a very interesting debate and i join with other noble lords in thanking the noble lord lord seebohm for giving us this opportunity <e> <s> i must also congratulate the noble lord on the way in which he introduced this debate <e> <s> i agree with him that the subject we are discussing tonight is of the utmost importance <e> <s> in fact i would put it on the same level as that which my noble friend lord brockway put it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that i was not here earlier to hear the minister and therefore i will not delay the house very long <e> <s> i shall merely say that there is always joy in heaven for a sinner that repenteth <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord <e> <s> lord mayhew appreciate that it is grenada and not granada <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the question that has been asked i wonder whether the minister can tell us how many grenadians were killed or wounded when the peoples revolutionary army turned its guns on the populace prior to killing the prime minister three cabinet ministers and two trade union leaders <e>", "<cs> my lords i am really disappointed by the speech of the minister <e> <s> the government continue to be complacent about this issue <e> <s> it is not that houses have deteriorated because you are not spending enough money now <e> <s> they are <e>", "<cs> my lords we are very grateful to the noble viscount for giving us this oportunity to look at the situation of ethnic and religious minorities in this country <e> <s> this is a very important subject and i am glad that we have had a <e>", "<cs> my lords i am lucky in terms of time but i shall not inflict another speech on your lordships <e> <s> i merely thank all noble lords who have taken part and supported me in this motion <e> <s> i want to congratulate the right reverend prelate on his maiden speech and say how sorry i am to hear that we shall not be hearing him as often as we would like <e> <s> like the noble lord lord ennals i hope we shall hear a few more speeches from him before he takes up his new appointment <e>", "<cs> i am not happy about this <e> <s> the rest of the clause does not make sense if the words in the amendment are removed <e> <s> can anybody enlighten me <e>", "<cs> i did not intend to intervene but i have been listening to speeches here this morning which remind me very much of the period we went through before we got the first race relations act <e> <s> i remember a lot of the arguments being made about the need to educate rather than to legislate and also that we did not have clear enough evidence of discrimination to act on it <e> <s> we seem to be travelling along that road again on this question of dealing with disability <e> <s> i may therefore remind your lordships of some of the consequences of legislating against discrimination on the grounds of race <e>", "<cs> it is my view that what the minister has said strengthens the case for an annual review <e> <s> for example he mentioned camden of which i know something <e> <s> the camden council thinks that if it is to cope with the level at which it will be rate-capped it will have to cut services <e> <s> i have received a <e>", "<cs> may i just ask the minister whether he has had any representations from the commission for racial equality <e> <s> as i listened to this debate my mind went back to the days when we were establishing the community relations councils and the committee will know i had a major hand in that <e> <s> we had a lot of trouble getting the local authorities to play their part and to make the contributions that they should make <e> <s> in fact to this day the contribution varies considerably from my borough of camden which is the one being criticised so regularly which makes a good contribution regularly to boroughs that make no contribution at all and some that give as little as a year <e>", "<cs> when all is said and done this amendment provides the government with an opportunity to have the co-operation of the local authority associations in determining the principles on which the expenditure of individual local authorities will in fact be determined <e> <s> unless the government believe that they must dictate and that nobody else must interfere i find it difficult to understand why the minister is not prepared to accept this particular amendment which will allow for co-operation <e> <s> when local authorities have been consulted the principles on which action is to be taken about the expenditure of any individual authority will have been determined not only by central government but by central government in agreement with local government <e> <s> therefore i find the attitude of the government difficult to understand <e>", "<cs> i am a little disappointed that the government are still stonewalling on this amendment <e> <s> before a rate is levied by a local authority the finance committee meets <e> <s> the committee is advised by officers and it cross-examines the officers <e> <s> it is the finance committee which recommends to the council what rate should be levied <e> <s> the government are proposing that parliament should take over that responsibility and say what the rate levy should be <e> <s> therefore <e> <s> parliament should have a comparable procedure <e> <s> the only comparable procedure is a select committee to carry out the same responsibilities as those carried out by the finance committee <e> <s> in this case it would make recommen-dations to the minister <e>", "<cs> i hope that your lordships committee will accept the amendment <e> <s> i have been listening to the debate and i have read the bill <e> <s> certain points occur to me as a consequence of this bill <e> <s> the government have admitted that they omitted the <e>", "<cs> the minister has just illustrated my point <e> <s> what the government are proposing for london regional transport is that there will be a separate accounting system for the tube and a separate accounting system for the buses and that the financial objective of lrt shall be the paramount objective <e> <s> he says that i misled him <e> <s> he himself pointed out that the national bus company can become an independent competitor by getting a licence from the traffic commissioners <e> <s> he pointed that out on a previous amendment <e> <s> i listened carefully and drew my conclusions <e> <s> i want the committee to draw the same conclusions that in passing the bill as it stands we are in fact giving the government the right to break up london transport <e>", "<cs> i cannot understand where we are going <e> <s> here we are the government have taken power to make the london ratepayers pay two thirds of the subsidy of london transport <e> <s> we have had a legal ruling that the party making the subsidy which was at that time the greater london council should have some regard for the balance between the duties to and the burdens of the ratepayers and the transport users <e> <s> the government are taking over the power to make this new levy <e> <s> i should have thought that the same considerations hold good <e> <s> what this amendment would do is make sure that since in effect this is being done through the lrt that authority is obliged to bear that in mind <e> <s> that is all that this amendment does <e> <s> what it says is that if the authority does not do that the court may decide against it <e> <s> why is there so <e>", "<cs> i have listened to both the minister and the noble baroness lady gardner <e> <s> we established the present scheme because of the <e>", "<cs> i can never understand why the government are so reluctant to have proper consultation with local authorities <e> <s> a power is being taken to levy a rate on the people of london <e> <s> if the greater london council is abolished local authorities in london will have to be consulted <e> <s> i cannot believe that it is so difficult for the minister to have proper consultation with them in order that they may point out to him what the effect of the levy could be in terms of other services <e> <s> the boroughs have to spend money on roads as well as transport <e> <s> if a penny is spent on x it is not available to be spent on y <e> <s> in effect therefore the secretary of state should be willing to sit down and discuss with the local authorities whether or not the levy he is going to demand will be a burden and whether or not it will cause the local authorities to carry out another service in not quite so efficient a way as they would otherwise perform it <e> <s> this kind of discussion ought to take place so that an agreed levy can be achieved <e> <s> i cannot understand why the government should be reluctant to have such consultation <e>", "<cs> it is no use the minister saying that it will not affect the revenue of local authorities <e> <s> it must <e> <s> if an additional p rate is levied one has to decide whether in order to accommodate that additional p rate it will be necessary to reduce services because one has to keep in mind the ratepayers <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter did not intend it but his argument is in support of this amendment <e> <s> if it is a larger number of the people in this country who are concerned and need london transport and need it to be efficient then more should be paid towards it than suggested by the government <e> <s> the government have suggested that london ratepayers should pay per cent <e> <s> this amendment suggests that they should pay per cent <e> <s> and that the rest of the country who are <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the advantages of speaking late is that much that you

perhaps for a little longer on part ii <e> <s> all the sections i shall comment on have been commented on by other people <e>", "<cs> i am not very happy about the ministers answer <e> <s> when all is said and done no requirement is being imposed on local authorities <e> <s> this power is being given to them if they wish to exercise it <e> <s> unless that power is given to them it cannot be exercised at the moment <e> <s> the amendment gives to local authorities the power to make these concessions to the unemployed if they so wish <e>", "<cs> but a self-financing basis would involve the authority having control of the transport <e> <s> in other words lrt could offer this concession but the boroughs could not <e> <s> if london transport were to remain under the power of the greater london council then the point which the noble earl has made would probably hold good <e> <s> but once the transport set-up which is envisaged in this bill has been established the boroughs will be able to grant only those concessions which they are permitted to grant <e>", "<cs> i despair <e> <s> it seems impossible to get the government to take a proper view of these issues <e> <s> of course we are talking about the basic scheme <e> <s> of course the basic scheme will provide for the elderly i hope with the amendments i shall <e>", "<cs> of course the present scheme permits of travel from

left the council found there was this conflict and decided just to extend the scheme <e> <s> what happened orginally was that the council extended the scheme to the underground <e> <s> when it extended the scheme to the underground it did not impose anything other than the morning peak restriction <e> <s> in other words the concession on the underground was from until midnight <e> <s> then it was obviously sensible to do the same thing with the buses <e> <s> when that was done there was found in fact to be no problem <e> <s> if you ask london transport now they will say that there is no problem <e>", "<cs> i should be grateful if the minister could investigate the matter <e> <s> they will continue for example if the glc agrees to continue them <e> <s> but the glc may not agree to

conclude it is law and act accordingly and that from the day of the publication of this bill the glc should cease to make any capital commitments <e> <s> if you say that the moment a bill is published eveyone must take it that it is the law of the land i think you are belittling parliament to a terrible extent <e> <s> no one is entitled to assume that anything is law until it has been passed by

given it six times more <e> <s> that is all that i am saying <e>", "<cs> my lords i recall that some years ago mr kwesi armah was ghanaian high commissioner here was subsequently charged with an offence that the ghanaian government wanted him charged with and was tried at the central criminal court <e> <s> i remember that it was the noble lord lord hutchinson who defended him <e> <s> cannot the nigerian governments attention be drawn to that so that they can take similar action over mr dikko <e>", "<cs> i am not so sure about all this <e> <s> we are saying that we are agreeing that

of that that i said there is a need for a meeting between the flexibility that the government are advocating and the tighter approach of the amendment <e> <s> rather than merely be so happy that lambeth has worked the noble lord should try to consider whether we can get more lambeths <e>", "<cs> what is required is that the final action of the secretary of state should be firmer <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure it is not surprising to your lordships house that i oppose both amendments <e> <s> i have said before that i regard this attempt to humiliate people in detention as something obnoxious <e> <s> i wish your lordships to ask yourselves what you hope to achieve by subjecting people to these searches <e> <s> all right my lords people may have some dangerous drugs on them <e>

searching them in the way suggested <e> <s> speaking personally i believe that it is not <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that but i do not believe that what we are talking about can catch dealers <e>

few addicts who carry the drugs themselves <e> <s> admittedly they would be classed as dealers because in order to pay for their addiction they are willing to sell to other people <e> <s> but it is just a few addicts who will be caught by this sort of treatment <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> if i thought that the humiliation and i regard is as a humiliation to which people would be subjected would catch dealers i would be for it <e> <s> but i do not think that that is what will happen <e> <s> all that will happen as a consequence of this is that anybody who is regarded as a drug addict will be subjected to this humiliation in order to see whether he has a couple of ounces of a dangerous drug on him <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness very much for the correction but i do not accept it <e> <s> the fact that you are going to restrict this action not to general drugs but to a few drugs is another point to mention because once it is restricted to a few drugs then in a general way you have allowed what i am talking about to happen <e> <s> it will not happen in a general way but it will happen when there is a suspicion that certain dangerous drugs are involved <e> <s> i am aware as i was aware on a previous occasion that i am not carrying your lordships house with me on this but i should like it to be recorded that i think that we are travelling down a slippery a dangerous road and i should like to warn your lordships about what you are doing <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all grateful to the noble lord lord harris of greenwich for introducing this subject this afternoon <e> <s> as the noble lord lord mancroft reminded the house i introduced a similar debate a year ago and when i was asked by my chief whip to take part in this debate i at first thought that i would merely rise and ask the government what they have done since <e> <s> then i changed my mind and decided that i would try to reiterate what i said on that occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords the hour is late but the minister when he replies tonight has an important and difficult job to do <e> <s> first he will have to explain why the government are prepared to ignore the recommendations of the greenfield report <e> <s> the greenfield committee consisted of six members of the dhss four gps one consultant physician one consultant anaesthetist one clinical pharmacologist

lords like other speakers i am grateful to my noble friend lady jeger for introducing this debate <e> <s> i was a little shattered by the complacent speech of the minister <e> <s> it is all very well to say that one is spending a lot of money on a particular job <e> <s> if you are not doing what is required you are failing <e> <s> i remember when i was in county hall and there was the question of flooding <e> <s> the banks were always being built up a few feet every year but there was still the threat of flooding so in the end we built the barrier <e> <s> i want the government to think of these issues in that light <e> <s> the question is not whether they are spending more money on the health service but whether they are meeting the need and we are not meeting the need <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord said that one of the consequences of the limited list will be an increase in over-the-counter sales if i understood him correctly <e> <s> is he telling the house that that is something we should welcome <e>", "<cs> my lords i am really sorry that we have come to this situation <e> <s> i had hoped that the government would recognise the need to halt in their march and would rethink and rediscuss the whole issue and come to a more sensible solution <e> <s> the drugs bill is as much in need of control as any other bill <e> <s> the criticism that i make is that the method selected is basically wrong and it is based on wrong premises <e> <s> we are frequently being told that it meets all clinical needs <e> <s> that is impossible <e> <s> not even the whole pharmacopoeia

has expressed the need for the services of the people to be preserved <e> <s> the trouble which has been revealed to some extent by the noble baroness lady gardner of parkes is that there is a great deal of pique about what has been going on in county hall <e> <s> because of that pique there is a kind of reaction let us get rid of it <e> <s> that is just a sort of final act because for a century there has been this battle between those who are localisers as i would put it and those who are centralisers in terms of london government <e> <s> however that has always had a political overview and the funny thing about it is that it has been the conservative party which theoretically is the party of the localisers which has done all the centralising because it has always done it for political reasons <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to provide for a ban on all forms of advertising of tobacco products and for purposes connected therewith <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am unhappy that the noble viscount the leader of the house did not answer the question put by the noble lord lord gladwyn about the evidence which suggests that the conditions of the under-developed world have improved <e> <s> i am quite worried about that <e> <s> the noble lord may not have the answer and if that is so will he undertake to write to me with the evidence because i should like to have that <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank my noble and learned friend lord elwyn-jones for putting this question <e> <s> i am concerned about

mostly non-europeans who are affected by them <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the members of the commission <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry but i am asking a question <e> <s> one of the members of the commission objected to my suggestion that we should write a report because of the discrimination experienced at heathrow airport <e> <s> will the minister not agree that whatever may have been the decisions of the house it is right to look at rules which it is suggested are discriminatory to see whether that is so <e>", "<cs> is not the noble lord in some sense trying to mislead the committee <e> <s> the real difference between what exists now and what will exist after abolition is that the precept will no longer be in existence <e> <s> what now happens is that richer boroughs contribute to the aid which is required by poorer boroughs the voluntary organisations in poor areas of london are being helped from the glc precept and the people who pay are from the richer boroughs <e> <s> once that precept is removed that redistribution will also be removed <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may delay the committee for a minute to follow what the noble viscount lord buckmster had to say <e> <s> it

london and not stick to the subject of the metropolitan counties <e> <s> however i know london best <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness sits down i hope she will realise that she has illustrated the

it is no use saying that having abolished the glc the grants will be available through the boroughs <e> <s> if the boroughs will not do so the grants will not be available <e> <s> i had hoped that the minister would say how the government will make sure perhaps they cannot make sure or what they will do to encourage the boroughs to ensure that grants are available <e> <s> but the minister has at no stage said that <e> <s> he merely says that the glc grants will be available through the boroughs <e>", "<cs> i am saying that the government should monitor the situation and be prepared to come to parliament and make recommendations if the situation deteriorates <e> <s> it is as simple as that <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e>", "<cs> my lords how should i say it <e> <s> i am bloody but unbowed <e> <s> i must begin by apologising to the noble earl lord caithness <e> <s> when i read his reply to

have been different interpretations of what happened in hereford <e> <s> all that we are asking is that before this system is extended to london we have authoritative views on what has happened in the

talk about clinical academic staff i actually mean medical staff although of course the term refers to dentists as well <e> <s> but i shall say something about the dentists later on <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we are all grateful to my noble friend lord hunter of newington for asking this question <e> <s> i call him my noble friend even though we do not take the same whip because we went through medical school together and qualified on the same day <e> <s> it is very appropriate that we should be considering this unstarred question in this house tonight because the government are drifting into a situation which will cause problems for the country <e> <s> we have been trying to obtain a ban on the advertising of cigarettes and other tobacco products which the government have opposed <e> <s> they have insisted that the voluntary agreement which entails gradually reducing the levels of tar and nicotine having health warnings more prominently displayed and so on will suffice <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel happy to be following the noble lord who has just sat down because i am glad that he has brought some of the realism required into this debate <e> <s> i am equally grateful to the right reverend prelate the bishop of southwark for so doing <e> <s> i need to apologise to my noble colleague lord winstanley for not having heard his speech <e> <s> i can only assure him that i shall read <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure we are all grateful to the noble lord lord kilmarnock for enabling us to have this debate <e> <s> i was glad to hear the way in which he introduced it and i am grateful to him <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend lord hatch of lusby for giving us the opportunity to have this debate <e> <s> when i decided to take part in it i wondered how to approach the subject <e> <s> i finally decided to share with your lordships my views on the world as i see it and this countrys place in it and perhaps show where we have failed to measure up to our responsibilities <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord walston for introducing this unstarred question <e> <s> i am happy to be following the noble lord lord greenhill because he has in effect illustrated the point i want to make <e> <s> he has described the plight that could face one of the territories in the caribbean whose major export is cane sugar <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble and learned lord lord scarman <e>", "<cs> i cannot allow the minister to get away with that one <e> <s> as we understood it the whole purpose of the act was to control local government expenditure and the way in which rate support grant was determined <e> <s> during several debates we have had on local government expenditure the goverment have always claimed that they were trying to help the local ratepayer <e> <s> on this occasion the local ratepayer is disadvantaged <e> <s> the amendment is saying that if the local ratepayer has been disadvantaged he should be compensated <e> <s> i cannot understand why the government cannot accept such a simple principle <e>", "<cs> will the minister not recognise that the real trouble is the formula for grant-related expenditure assessment <e> <s> if the formula produces a large number of boroughs that are heavily deprived the formula must be wrong but we certainly i cannot get the government to look again at that formula <e>", "<cs> my lords may i refer back to the ministers reply about keeping a list of the passengers <e> <s> it would not be that difficult if all passengers were required to leave their names and addresses before they boarded the ship <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord hacking for giving us the opportunity to discuss this important matter and for the way he introduced the debate <e> <s> this problem affects the medical profession as much as any other <e> <s> for the few minutes at my disposal i should like to express the increasing concern felt within the medical profession the health service and by the public about recent trends in medical litigation <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by congratulating the noble and gallant lord lord bramall on his maiden speech <e> <s> his brother and i are very good friends <e> <s> we were colleagues in county hall for years and i want to tell the noble lord that his brother was sitting in county hall when i made my maiden speech in <e> <s> i am very glad that i am here today to hear the noble and gallant lord make his maiden speech <e> <s> i can tell from the speech he has delivered to us this afternoon that we are going to hear a lot from him and it will be stuff that is fully worthwhile <e> <s> i would say to him just keep it up <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i too may join in thanking the noble baroness lady young for repeating the statement and thank sir roy marshall and his team for the good job that they have done <e>", "<cs> no we used to compete <e> <s> we had a joint civil service <e> <s> when i qualified and went back to grenada i was sent as a district medical officer to st vincent <e> <s> that sort of situation cannot be resumed because most of the other territories are independent <e> <s> however it strikes me that the government might investigate the possibility of closer co-operation in fields such as those <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise for not putting my name down but i am only too pleased to support the noble lord lord ezra in this unstarred question <e> <s> i am sure the house is grateful to him for having put it down <e> <s> i shall confine myself to speaking about london because the lack of progress made under the present government in the repair and renovation of the housing stock is highlighted by the latest greater london house condition survey <e> <s> therefore i support the point that the noble lord has just made about our having an annual survey so that we can see what is what <e>", "<cs> my lords when i heard the prime ministers positive statement that something was to be done for the inner cities i felt very pleased and very happy <e> <s> then in a funny sort of way i began to think <e> <s> i thought my god this is probably just another gimmick very much like branson cleaning up london <e> <s> i thought of the things which this government have done in the past eight years which have made the inner cities worse <e>", "<cs> as a consequence the rate support grant to many of the worst areas was reduced <e> <s> as i have said before if we have a formula which when it is put into the computer produces the <e>", "<cs> my lords that is very much the point <e> <s> it is the governments reduction of the rate support grant plus their use of penalties which has caused a lot of the increased rates in the inner london areas <e> <s> however it is not only the inner city areas in london that i am talking about <e> <s> that is the point that i was making and i am afraid that the answer the noble lord gives me does not meet that point <e>", "<cs> the minister said that this amendment is not the right amendment to give us what we want <e> <s> he has not told us in what way it is not right <e>", "<cs> my lords i have great pleasure in supporting the unstarred question asked by the noble viscount lord hanworth <e> <s> i am impressed by the case that he made out and i thank him for it <e> <s> complaints against the medical profession have increased tremendously <e> <s> in there were and by they had reached <e> <s> i do not know what the figure is today <e> <s> in addition there has been a great increase in the damages awarded although it is not as large as the increase in complaints <e>", "<cs> my lords cannot the minister understand that while spending an additional amount of money may not be the sole requirement it is obvious that additional resources are needed <e> <s> why cannot the government merely accept that fact <e> <s> cannot the minister see that <e> <s> if you are spending a certain amount of money to achieve a certain objective and the objective is not being achieved and you have said that people must save in <e>", "<cs> my lords when you are asked for million and you have given million are you not presenting an insufficient amount <e>", "<cs> my lords there is one matter that worries me and i hope the minister will not mind my putting it to him <e> <s> we are in a difficult position now and it strikes me that from all that has been said we may find ourselves in a similar position next year <e> <s> the government were asked for million and have given million <e> <s> the minister need not tell me now but i wonder whether he could confirm that the sum of million will meet the needs <e> <s> that is my worry <e>", "<cs> my lords the ministers answer covers the needs in a general sense <e> <s> the million was obviously not infinite it was a calculated amount that the health authorities thought they needed <e> <s> the government are giving them million therefore the government start with a shortfall of million <e> <s> all i am asking is for them to try to justify it <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble baroness who has just sat down i congratulate the minister on his promotion and wish him every success <e> <s> we have known him for a long time <e> <s> we know he will do well in his new job because he has performed well in this house at least since i have been here <e> <s> i am afraid that is where the noble baroness and i part company because i personally am very sorry that this should be the ministers first bill <e> <s> i genuinely believe this bill should never have been brought forward <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e> <s> if it is already illegal under ec law will the noble lord explain to me why the ec actually met per cent <e> <s> of the cost of the birmingham job which worked perfectly satisfactorily <e> <s> if it is illegal why did the ec finance it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am pleased to find myself following the noble earl <e> <s> i welcome the report <e> <s> i am glad that the government are acting and will create the authority and give it statutory powers so that there will be sanctions against those who disobey its instructions <e> <s> i congratulate the minister on the way in which he introduced the debate <e> <s> i thank the government for allowing the house to discuss the white paper before they produce a bill <e>", "<cs> my lords the warnock report also gave an answer on that <e> <s> it said that there should be a certificate of registration and legislation that the father should be shown as john smith by donor <e> <s> i would want it to be john smith by donor william henry <e> <s> therefore the point is that the child will know who his genetic father is if he wants to <e>", "<cs> my lords as has been said earlier homelessness is increasing tremendously quite rapidly <e> <s> we ought to do something to reduce it and abolish it but we do not seem to be doing anything <e> <s> homelessness has doubled in the past eight years <e> <s> worse than that we are aware of the increasing homelessness and yet it has increased by per cent <e> <s> over the past two years <e> <s> therefore the condemnation of us for allowing this to happen is considerable <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment <e> <s> i am a layman in this matter but in my medical practice i have known many occasions when bereaved persons have been very unhappy about coroners inquests <e> <s> on all those occasions i had formed the impression that if they had been able to provide themselves with legal representatives they would have been less unhappy and i should have seen less of them <e> <s> therefore i should like the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor to bear that in mind in deciding whether to accept the amendment <e> <s> many people do not understand what has taken place and it has not been properly explained to them <e> <s> they emerge unhappy about the situation but had they had a good lawyer looking after their interests they would not have felt that way <e> <s> i should like that point to be borne in mind <e>", "<cs> i was expecting something to be said about the fire brigade in the debate on clause and i have not heard anything <e> <s> is there another amendment <e>", "<cs> i find the situation difficult to follow <e> <s> the government say that they wish to revive the inner cities <e> <s> they also say that they wish to increase employment there <e> <s> the amendment merely seeks to change the bill which now provides that a local authority cannot inquire into the composition of a contractors workforce <e>", "<cs> i should like to know to what depth we are probing <e> <s> for example i also saw a letter from the director of the department in the ec which does not suggest it is illegal <e> <s> therefore i find it quite difficult <e> <s> if the government are so adamant about this will they put the legal opinion which they have received on the table in the library so that we can see it <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that the minister has again disappointed me <e> <s> there is more to it than whether or not the services are provided at the cheapest rate <e> <s> for example i would not buy south african goods and the committee would expect that <e> <s> but for years neither would i drink german <e>", "<cs> i have read the debates in the other place and i knew that the government were taking this attitude <e> <s> i had not expected that they would take it here tonight and i was hoping that the minister would be willing to look at this matter again <e>", "<cs> local authorities are doing this now <e>", "<cs> the bill will stop them doing it that is what the debate is about <e>", "<cs> that is not the issue <e> <s> there is no talk about enforcement <e> <s> the talk is about local authorities encouraging employers in their area to take on more people with disabilities <e> <s> that is what is being done now and that they cannot do under the bill because it says that they must not take the composition of a workforce into account <e> <s> if those words were left out none of this would arise <e> <s> when they could take account of the composition of a workforce they could deal with whether companies were discriminating against women whether women were getting proper promotion whether they were discriminating on grounds of race and whether there was a proper distribution of employment <e> <s> that is done now <e> <s> the bill says that authorities must not take it into account <e> <s> all we are asking so far is that they be allowed to take sex discrimination and discrimination against disability into account to encourage employers to take on more disabled people <e> <s> i cannot see where the difficulties lie <e>", "<cs> as the committee knows i have had a fair amount to do with this subject <e> <s> i was at the time deputy chairman of the community relations commission <e> <s> i am always amazed when i listen to speeches like that of the noble baroness lady blatch <e> <s> we were always told i remember and that the law would do more harm than good in terms of helping us <e> <s> what we did however was to pass a law which made it illegal to discriminate in employment <e> <s> before that law was passed one did not see black people in any of the shops in oxford street in the banks or anywhere like that <e> <s> they were firmly discriminated against <e> <s> they were and i was involved in those days <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may follow up this point <e> <s> is the minister aware that in inner london the education service is financed by a rate on the whole of inner london <e> <s> is she saying therefore that the government will have the power to rate the whole of inner london in order that it may establish the equality that the inner london education authority now provides <e>", "<cs> as the minister i understand is prepared to look at it again if that is the sense of his remarks i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my worry is about the time factor <e> <s> can the minister help me on that matter <e> <s> my worry is about some youngster who is in need and who goes to the dhss <e> <s> at the moment someone decides whether he is entitled to benefit and he receives it <e> <s> as i read the bill i have the impression that there will be long delays <e> <s> can the minister tell me what will happen during the interval <e> <s> i hope that he can help me on that matter because that is my major worry <e>", "<cs> could the minister answer my point about the delay <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may be difficult and ask what that means <e> <s> does the minister mean that the decision will be made that day <e> <s> that is the sort of thing i am talking about <e> <s> can i be satisfied that when a youngster in need comes to the dhss something will be done that day <e> <s> that is really what i am asking <e>", "<cs> i wish to support this amendment <e> <s> my worry is what in effect will the government regard as severe hardship <e> <s> for example many of the kids with whom i have talked have fallen out with their parents <e> <s> i would regard them as being in severe hardship because of what might happen to <e>", "<cs> if that means that the situation will be the same as the interpretation of intentional homelessness then i am afraid for the youngsters <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that the clause does a lot more than that <e> <s> if the clause merely prevented people from choosing voluntarily to be unemployed i should not oppose it but the clause has failed to take two important matters into account the degree to which year-olds and year-olds are estranged from their parents and the homelessness that results therefrom <e> <s> it is because the bill has failed to take those factors into account that we must ask the government to look again at clause and to close that particular loophole <e> <s> i support the noble lord lord banks because if the government are not prepared to look again at the clause then we must force them to do so <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness opposite made mention of my earlier comments when quoting from a ladys letter <e> <s> my question to the noble baroness is this what answer must that lady give when homeless young people go to her in september <e>", "<cs> my lords i must ask my question again as it still has not been answered <e> <s> the noble baroness has been in the kind of situation i am talking about <e> <s> what will she say to a or year-old kid who comes to her in those circumstances next september <e> <s> we must remember that there is in fact no guarantee of income supplement <e> <s> the only way that such a person can get that benefit is for the secretary of state to declare that he is in hardship <e> <s> what does one say to such a person when he approaches one for assistance <e>", "<cs> i apologise for not being in my place when the amendment was called i am afraid that i was having dinner <e> <s> i have listened to the minister and i am still not satisfied about the position of pregnant mothers <e> <s> the issue is of the utmost importance because of the findings of low weights among babies of women who have not been well fed during their pregnancy <e> <s> the provision of milk during that period has been a useful addition to the diet of those women <e> <s> i should like some assurance form the minister <e> <s> it appears that pregnant mothers especially those having their first babies will not get that milk <e> <s> will the minister say whether i am right or wrong <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for making that point <e> <s> the minister has not convinced us that the milk will be available to them and it is the milk that i want them to have <e>", "<cs> my lords the only reason that there is the difference between the two bills is that the sex discrimination bill was first and the race relations bill was second <e> <s> if the race relations bill had been passed before the sex discrimination bill i have no doubt that there would have been a similar clause in the sex discrimination bill <e> <s> i hope that the government will take that into account <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that we shall come to a decision different from the decision we reached in committee <e> <s> perhaps i may repeat some of what i said earlier <e> <s> i believe that the issue is not whether sanctions against any country will work but the question of whether local authorities have a right or as i would say a duty to reflect the feelings of the consumers whom they are serving <e>", "<cs> my lords those public authorities are the creation of parliament <e> <s> there is no reason why parliament cannot say that those public authorities should observe certain regulations <e> <s> all that the government are being asked to do is to say to those public authorities that they too should observe section of the race relations act <e> <s> we do not need to pass any law to do that <e> <s> when they are created to do certain things they should observe certain conditions <e> <s> what is so difficult about that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am still worried about this clause <e> <s> i do not believe we have taken into account youngsters who are estranged from their families <e> <s> they are the people about whom i have been worried all along <e> <s> as a consequence of being estranged from their families they become homeless <e> <s> i accept that it is quite difficult to put into the bill details along those lines <e> <s> however it strikes me that what the noble lord lord henderson of brompton said in committee and repeated is sound <e> <s> we can have in the bill some principles with regard to the kind of people who would not be allowed to fall by the wayside <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope your lordships will permit me to break the rules and congratulate the noble lord lord jakobovits on his excellent maiden speech <e> <s> i was very impressed and touched by much of what i heard and i am looking forward as i know will many lords to hearing him on many future occasions <e>", "<cs> i wish the government would try to face the issue <e> <s> we must recognise what is at stake here <e> <s> when the immigration bill was going through parliament in there was tremendous concern in the black community that their rights were being taken away from them <e> <s> the home secretary of the day gave an undertaking that that would not be so <e> <s> this chamber went further than that and tabled an amendment to the bill which the government finally accepted to safeguard that position <e> <s> therefore the black community felt satisfied <e> <s> it is still satisfied but when the government repeal section of the act it will once again be upset <e> <s> if a pledge made in that connection can be taken back that means that any other pledge that has been made can be taken hack <e> <s> that is why it is unwise to go down that road <e>", "<cs> there is a real issue here because again we must go back in time <e> <s> many of the children about whom we are talking are the children i mentioned earlier who are on the indian subcontinent and who are trying to come here but the officers have been denying that they were the children of the people of whom they claim to be the children <e> <s> we now have an advance in that <e> <s> because of the dna test it can be proved conclusively that they are those children <e> <s> we want to preserve the measure so that those children can now come here <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may ask the noble lord for help <e> <s> what is required is that it is clear that the government claim that compassionate grounds are already considered before the home secretary decides about deportation <e> <s> the evidence we have is that it is considered by some adjudicators but not by all <e>", "<cs> may i say to the minister that i probably used the wrong word when i said guidance but parliament can give directions <e>", "<cs> at all stages the government say that these compassionate grounds are and have already been taken into account <e> <s> however there is evidence that adjudicators do not take them into account <e> <s> some adjudicators take them into account and some do not <e> <s> it must be possible for parliament to give some directions to adjudicators to ensure that they should take compassionate grounds into account at some stage <e> <s> the government seem not to mind that they are not taken into account <e>", "<cs> i hope the committee will agree that clause should not stand part of the bill <e> <s> i said at second reading that i was worried about making overstaying a continuing offence because of what i saw as the danger to the relationship between the black community and the police <e> <s> if an offence has been committed the police have a duty to intervene <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may ask the noble lord whether he thinks that on balance it is better that families be divided rather than united <e>", "<cs> with respect to the noble lord that is not the point <e> <s> we are not talking about heads of families <e> <s> the noble lord lord renton has introduced a red herring <e> <s> we are talking about spouses and children <e> <s> all the amendment proposes is that when the rules are drawn up the rights of those who are settled here to bring their spouses and their children into this country should be no less than the rights of ec nationals <e> <s> that is all that it asks <e> <s> we are talking about spouses and children <e>", "<cs> i should like to support these amendments and commend them to the committee <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones will remember that during the committee stage of the nationality bill i moved similar amendments <e> <s> i moved in particular an amendment to give the government power to waive the fee <e> <s> i was surprised when they resisted it <e> <s> we forced it to a division and lost <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that i had to leave the chamber for a while because i seem to have missed some very good speeches and the speeches i have heard were very good indeed <e> <s> i am sure we are all grateful to my noble friend lord ennals for introducing this debate <e> <s> as i said some of the speeches i have heard have pleased me very much in particular those of the noble lord lord thorneycroft and my colleague the noble lord lord winstanley <e> <s> i was pleased to hear the minister commit himself and the government to the health service <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the previous speaker in one respect <e> <s> it would have been better to have had a full debate with a full house <e> <s> i am nevertheless grateful to my noble friend for asking his unstarred question <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister allow me to intervene <e> <s> what i really wanted to know was since the banning of trade union leaders is an obstacle to the sort of progress that he has in mind what solution the government have for unlocking that door <e> <s> that is the real question <e>", "<cs> my lords i have dealt with immigration cases over the years and i am convinced that the setting up of appeals tribunals has improved conditions tremendously <e> <s> by allowing people to go to an adjudicator and if necessary to the appeals tribunal we have improved conditions tremendously for people seeking through the immigration rules to enter this country <e> <s> the conditions of asylum-seekers are much more serious <e> <s> if a mistake is made someone may be sent back who has a genuine fear not merely of his liberty but also of his life <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot see what is wrong with that <e> <s> the bill says that if a person is to be deported because of a breach of limited leave or by virtue of being the member of a family that is to be deported he cannot appeal except on the grounds that the facts are different <e> <s> in effect that is what the bill says <e> <s> all the amendment says is that the fact he has a spouse and children here and therefore has some serious attachment to this country should be one of the grounds on which he makes an appeal <e> <s> it does not follow that his appeal will be successful all the amendment does is to allow that fact to be taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the government will accept the amendment <e> <s> i do not quite understand why the government have chosen a period of seven years <e> <s> when all is said and done a four or five-year period is sufficient for naturalisation <e> <s> seven years seems very arduous <e> <s> i hope that the government are prepared to rethink the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendments <e> <s> i invite the government i think that we did so in committee and i hope that they have given some thought to it in the interval to think about the consequences of forcing each member of a large family to pay the fee <e> <s> we will often be talking about people on below average incomes and for them a large fee would be an onerous obligation <e>", "<cs> my lords i begin by saying that i agree with everything that my noble friend lady blackstone said this afternoon <e> <s> i shall use my few minutes to comment on three aspects of the bill <e> <s> i wish to comment on one error of omission and two errors of commission <e>", "<cs> i am sorry <e> <s> i will stop <e> <s> it is all right by me <e> <s> i merely say that really and truly i find the whole performance terrible <e> <s> the government clearly did not work through this process <e> <s> they have not thought through what they are doing <e> <s> i appeal to your lordships that when the bill comes before us in committee we should give careful thought to what we are doing and amend the bill so that it will not do the harm that i envisage it will in fact do if it is not amended <e>", "<cs> my lords i too wish to thank the noble lord lord hunter for initiating this debate <e> <s> i owe him an apology for not being present at the beginning of his speech but i shall catch up with it in <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise to the house for not putting my name down to speak as i had not intended to intervene <e> <s> however what we have just heard is quite lamentable <e> <s> to think that the government are prepared to place people in that kind of position is something of which they ought to be ashamed <e>", "<cs> with the permission of the committee i should like to move amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i should prefer to move my amendment when it is called but it was being referred to during the course of the debate so perhaps i should speak to it now <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will permit me to intervene i wish to say that this country is already multi-cultural <e> <s> there is an english culture a welsh culture a scottish culture and an irish culture <e> <s> all that i was suggesting is that there should be respect for the other cultures that are now in our midst <e>", "<cs> i may be wrong but i gather that the cabinet has about members <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor would think that that would probably be a better figure than the that is being suggested <e>", "<cs> my lords i too must begin by apologising to the minister in that i missed the beginning of his speech <e> <s> the previous debate ended much sooner than i thought it would <e> <s> one of the advantages of speaking as late in the debate as i am is that most of the points that i would want to make have already been made and probably better than i could make them <e> <s> i therefore wish to say how much i support the points that have been made about the wrongness of charging for eye testing and for dental examinations <e> <s> that is a retrograde step <e>", "<cs> my lords no i would not set any limit <e> <s> i am leaving that aspect to their partners <e> <s> they can decide whether it is worth while keeping such practitioners on <e> <s> in fact age is not the point <e> <s> if the other partners think that a certain doctor at the age of can still perform a useful service to the public then they will keep him on as a consultant <e> <s> however if they do not think so then they will not <e> <s> i am talking about a permitted activity <e>", "<cs> my lords in my capacity as chairman of shelter i am particularly concerned with one aspect of this legislation <e> <s> in my speech i intend to content myself with addressing one simple question <e> <s> will the bill increase or decrease homelessness in this country <e> <s> i regret to say that this is not an issue that the government addressed at all in the white paper that preceded the legislation <e> <s> however it is the issue by which the bill should be judged <e> <s> the increasing incidence of homelessness is one of our biggest immediate problems <e> <s> fine sounding phrases like giving a tenant the choice of landlord ring empty to those who can find no landlord at all <e>", "<cs> i hope that the government will accept the amendment <e> <s> it is important to a great many people <e> <s> according to my figures between september and september people applied to their local authorities to be regarded as homeless <e> <s> one hundred thousand of those were accepted as homeless but people who regarded themselves as homeless were rejected <e>", "<cs> my lords i was hoping that the minister would say something about including this in regulations <e> <s> i am quite happy now that he has put it on the record <e> <s> people will understand if they read <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to support my noble friend on this amendment <e> <s> the reintroduction of premiums is a blot on the bill <e> <s> your lordships know that i have much criticism of the bill in many respects particularly in the way i am afraid it will increase homelessness but on this occasion i am concerned about its effect on mobility <e> <s> if a chap finds a job in a new area he will not have key money <e> <s> he will have no money to pay a premium <e> <s> on the other hand we want him to be able to move into the area and find a house so that he can start his job pay rent establish his family get off welfare and so on <e> <s> to allow a landlord to insist on a premium is to put an obstacle in the way of the mobility which the government desire <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl not agree that although in a market where there is adequate or almost adequate housing the question of a premium will not be a serious matter in a market such as the present one where there is a great shortage in certain areas the very areas into which the government wish people to move because of the job situation the allowance of a premium will create great hardship <e> <s> will it not therefore be better at this stage to allow the existing ban on premiums to remain and to be prepared to remove it later when the provision of rented accommodation is such that its presence could he claimed to be distorting the market <e> <s> its removal would then be helpful <e> <s> does the minister not agree that in view of the present shortage a premium is going to be a handicap <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect the noble earl has misunderstood <e> <s> i am not suggesting that there should be no ban in one area and a ban in another <e> <s> i am suggesting that we keep the existing ban and then when rented accommodation becomes adequate or almost adequate we remove it <e>", "<cs> my lords there is one other legal point <e> <s> i am advised that the charity commission has told some of these associations that they may be acting <e>", "<cs> my lords i asked a different question <e> <s> all housing associations wish to be able to retain the right to succession <e> <s> they have been advised that unless it is a statutory obligation they may be <e>", "<cs> my lords the housing associations were set up not merely to provide housing but also to relieve poverty by providing affordable housing <e> <s> why do the government want to change that <e> <s> do they not recognise the fact that there will always be a need for houses at that level that the housing associations can provide them and that they should be encouraged and helped to do so <e> <s> i believe that in their anxiety to get rid of local authority housing and to stimulate the development of private rented housing the government are missing the point <e> <s> by allowing the housing associations to perform their social functions the government would be helped rather than hindered in what they are trying to achieve <e> <s> what the government are trying to do to the housing associations will make their other objectives more difficult to attain <e> <s> i ask the minister to think about that matter <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may put this point to the noble earl before he sits down <e> <s> let us suppose that a tenant is a jehovahs witness <e> <s> jehovahs witnesses do not vote <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not clear how the government know that the applicant has substantial support in the estate before proceeding <e>", "<cs> my lords how does he do that <e> <s> the method suggested by my noble friend lord carmichael of kelvingrove would enable him to do that <e> <s> he would have plenty of evidence by way of written consent that people would like a change <e> <s> what does the corporation demand of the applicant in order to know that there is interest in the change <e>", "<cs> my lords when i said government i meant the corporation <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister realise that he has not answered the question <e> <s> how does he know that this is so <e> <s> if the minister says that evidence must be produced of x having signed that is straightforward <e> <s> if the amendment is accepted the situation is again straightforward <e> <s> the ministers answer leaves the matter in the air in saying that the corporation has different or many ways <e> <s> we are legislating and must therefore lean on some rule <e> <s> how does the applicant satisfy the corporation that there is this interest <e>", "<cs> but how <e> <s> that is what i am asking <e>", "<cs> my lords i raised the matter from a standing position also <e> <s> the minister has still not answered the question <e> <s> he is being asked a straightforward question <e> <s> how does the applicant demonstrate to the housing corporation that there is this interest in buying property <e> <s> it is a simple question and deserves a straightforward simple answer <e> <s> why does the minister not answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may use this opportunity to raise a matter with the minister that i mentioned on report and for which i hope he has an answer <e> <s> he may remember that i raised the question of the worry of the charitable housing associations that they have been informed i think perhaps advised is the word i should use that they may be <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the minister just one question <e> <s> he has given the house a nice global figure by which the grants to local authorities are increased <e> <s> there are certain local authorities obviously having difficulties <e> <s> is it not possible i put it no higher that the distribution of those grants is defective <e> <s> is the minister not prepared to accept that <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the noble earl a very simple question are the government really suggesting that it does not matter how many people are made homeless as long as they continue with a particular policy <e> <s> because that is what the answer suggests <e> <s> is the minister aware that there is increasing homelessness because people who have bought their houses are unable to continue with their mortgage payments <e> <s> that is the problem that <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am grateful to my noble friend lord rea for introducing this bill and it has my support <e> <s> i must apologise to him for not being here for the early part of his speech <e> <s> unfortunately i am doing a locum for a colleague of mine at the moment and i was doing his evening surgery <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am very grateful to the noble baroness for giving us the opportunity for this debate <e> <s> it is very interesting that in this house the question is being asked by one of our youngest members and being answered by one of the youngest ministers <e> <s> what has already been said about the estimate of the number of people over and over is absolutely true <e> <s> they are very important predictions for those who are planning the health and social services because the very elderly whose numbers are increasing also make the largest demand on statutory services <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister replies may i say that i hope that the government will take a very generous attitude to the bill <e> <s> ist is a difficult subject <e> <s> we know that there are problems if we pass the bill saying that people should work certain hours and that those hours are limited <e> <s> there will be institutions some small hospitals for example where there will be difficulties <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the minister will accept this amendment <e> <s> in the bill we have already agreed that the childs religious persuasion racial origin and cultural background should be borne in mind <e> <s> i believe that it is just as important that its language should be borne in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord sits down will he take it from me that for the childs security the language to which the child is accustomed is of the utmost importance <e> <s> merely referring to cultural background will not in fact cover that <e> <s> therefore will the noble and learned lord undertake to reconsider with that in view <e> <s> as we have already indicated that cultural background social and racial origin should be in primary legislation it would be wise to include language <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that it is not too late for the government to look at this matter again and to have further consultations with the local authorities <e> <s> we are dealing with a very serious matter <e> <s> i am glad that at the end the noble baroness made the point that the choice will be between the local authority bearing the difference between the rent officers assessment and the actual rent or making the person homeless <e> <s> that is the stark choice <e> <s> some of the authorities will act in the way she suggested and some will not <e> <s> the government must look at the problem seriously because the chances are that unless this order is handled with great sensitivity and flexibility we are going to have a great number of homeless people as a consequence <e> <s> i invite the government to look at the problem realistically in that way <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e>", "<cs> my lords as a consultant physician in the national health service is the noble lord suggesting that he is not independent when the whole of his income is coming from the state <e>", "<cs> my lords like other speakers i wish to congratulate the noble lord lord mottistone on introducing the bill the provisions of which are admirable and a marked improvement on section of the disabled persons act <e> <s> if applied those provisions will go a long way towards meeting needs <e>", "<cs> my lords unlike the previous speaker i am not sure that i welcome the bill <e> <s> in fact i wish that we could find it possible to persuade the government to change their social security strategy <e> <s> the social security system has been described as being societys safety net but the government continue to find ways of making holes in the net <e> <s> in it was the social fund <e> <s> last year the to year-olds were penalised <e> <s> both those decisions have had unpleasant consequences <e> <s> one hoped that this social security bill would amend the social fund as as to remove its cash limitation and substitute grants for loans and make it less restrictive <e> <s> the evidence shows that to be the problem with the social fund <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord lord ross of newport for initiating this debate <e> <s> i should like to stress that the number of people accepted by the authorities as homeless is the highest ever <e> <s> that point needs to be stressed <e> <s> in addition there has been a rapid increase in people who are not usually even counted in these figures <e> <s> i talk about the visible homeless the people we see sleeping on the street <e> <s> they are not included in these figures <e> <s> furthermore there are what i call the invisible homeless who have to live unwillingly in other peoples homes instead of having their own home <e>", "<cs> before the minister replies perhaps i may put this point to him <e> <s> all that is required is that employers should notify the jobcentre of all vacant posts <e> <s> people who are unemployed should be sent from the jobcentre for posts for which they are qualified <e> <s> we do not need this battle that seems to be going on about whether or not people are actively seeking work <e> <s> what should be required is that they conform to the rules that exist <e> <s> these provide that they have to take jobs which are offered them and for which they are qualified or they lose their benefit <e> <s> the government could move in that direction instead of the way in <e>", "<cs> i do not believe that the minister has anwered me <e> <s> i put to him a method of dealing with this matter and i do not believe that it has been sufficiently explored <e> <s> it is all very well for the minister to say that the jobcentre will inform the unemployed person of vacancies <e> <s> i am suggesting a way in which the government can make sure that unemployed people are aware of vacancies which exist in a particular area <e> <s> it is by making arrangements for employers to inform the jobcentre of all vacancies <e> <s> that may well require regulations but i do not believe so <e> <s> an agreement is required with the employers that that should be done <e> <s> if such an agreement is reached then whenever an unemployed person goes to a jobcentre it can say where there are jobs <e> <s> if there are no jobs so be it <e>", "<cs> i too support the amendment <e> <s> i referred to the issue on second reading <e> <s> it is one of the serious issues confronting us <e> <s> the problem of homeless people using bed and breakfast accommodation is a difficult one <e> <s> one of the consequences as the noble earl lord russell has said is that people have to eat out <e> <s> we all know the cost of eating out <e> <s> the april regulations have made the position difficult <e> <s> they place people who eat out in the same category as people who look after themselves and get their own meals <e> <s> putting them in the same category has created the problem <e> <s> people in bed and breakfast accommodation now receive <e>", "<cs> when the minister replies i hope that he will not be thinking merely of the financial cost of paying the benefit but of the cost which matter has been raised by at least two of the speakers of the consequence of what is happening <e> <s> we now have young people on the street homeless and in danger <e> <s> the cost to the state of allowing that situation to go on is very much greater than whatever may be the cost of providing those <e>", "<cs> before a decision is made on this will the minister consider providing guidelines which will make severe hardship less severe <e> <s> from the cases which have come to me it appears that if a more flexible i do not like that word or softer attitude were adopted we may find that we have fewer problems <e>", "<cs> before the minister replies i wish to ask a simple question <e> <s> if i insure myself against an accident and then go to court and obtain compensation i do not know that i have to pay back what the insurance company will pay me <e> <s> i cannot see what the difference is between that and the benefits that one receives through national insurance because the state has already withdrawn from national insurance and the contributions for the national insurance fund come only from the employer and the employee <e> <s> in effect therefore the only difference between that and the insurance that i will have carried privately is that my employer pays as well as me <e> <s> i cannot see where the state comes in in terms of wanting to withdraw the benefit that i have been paid as a result of my contribution because of the compensation that i have received <e> <s> i wish that someone would explain that point to me <e>", "<cs> i do not see the difference if the state is not contributing <e> <s> that is the point <e>", "<cs> yes some of them will but it is more general <e> <s> it is people with their first pregnancies not necessarily or year-olds but older than that also <e>", "<cs> i shall obviously have to come back on report <e> <s> i am quite disappointed that the minister is so unhelpful <e> <s> one of the problems about this nice statement that young people have a yts place is this <e> <s> they could be sacked because the employer is unsympathetic <e> <s> there is also the question of the short period of training and whether it makes sense anyway if they work for only a short period and then because they are close to the confinement day they have to finish <e> <s> it seems to me that in the case of to year-olds there are other benefits to which they would not be entitled free milk and vitamins and so on because they are not receiving income support <e> <s> however by giving them income support during the whole of the pregnancy one would be helping the children in a specific way <e>", "<cs> my lords i must begin by apologising to the minister for not being here when he started his speech <e> <s> transport proved a little difficult the congestion in finchley road was far more than usual <e> <s> it is regrettable that i was not here for the whole of his speech because i intend to be very critical of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords l am sure that we are all grateful to the noble lord lord hunter of newington for tabling this unstarred question and for the way in which he has spoken to it <e> <s> i am very happy to follow the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i find it difficult to understand why in a bill by which the state seeks to withdraw any contribution to the insurance fund at the same time the state should be seeking to recoup compensation from people who have been injured and are receiving benefit as a consequence <e>", "<cs> my lords that still does not explain the point i am making <e> <s> i am saying that if you are involved in an accident compensation is paid to you <e> <s> if you have a private insurance it will not be deducted from that money <e> <s> that is the difference <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened to the minister but i am still disturbed <e> <s> he has not answered my point <e> <s> if i carry a private insurance and then i am compensated by the court there is no clawback in regard to my private insurance <e>", "<cs> my lords in what way is it different <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the leader of the house suggesting i am out of order <e> <s> i wish to ask a question <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not suppose that there is any point in pursuing the matter <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i read in the press that the government intended to accept this amendment <e> <s> i hope that is so because the amendment is a good step forward <e> <s> noble lords will remember that on second reading i expressed considerable alarm at the governments proposals and i am glad that we have moved forward in this respect <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise for coming in at this stage <e> <s> however earlier this week i went to the chief whips office to put my name down for this debate and was told that there was not a list <e> <s> that is why i am not on the list this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not intend to travel down the road that the noble earl lord cork and orrery has opened up for me <e> <s> i merely say that i should have thought it much more sensible if you have got a weapon and negotiations are taking place to agree in those negotiations about the use of the weapon <e> <s> that seems to me to be all that the party is saying at this moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should also like to thank the noble lord lord hunter of newington for giving us the opportunity of discussing the national health service <e> <s> the proposals for the reform of the service raise several worries <e> <s> the most important is the fact that it will create a two tier service not only in hospitals but also in general practice <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble baroness but i must point out that i specifically said that it was not cash limited i said that this was comparable to the rate-capping procedure <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment <e> <s> there is a serious situation in relation to medical students <e> <s> not only do they take five-year courses but they continue for a further two three or four years before they are in a position to repay the loan <e> <s> having completed their undergraduate courses they qualify but merely qualifying is not enough <e> <s> they must then qualify themselves further <e> <s> if they are to be gps they have to take a vocational course for another three years <e> <s> if they are going to be specialists they must train for a further three or five years before they are in a position to earn enough to be able to repay the loan <e>", "<cs> my lords in common with all the previous speakers i am in favour of this bill <e> <s> it is right that this country should be properly represented in the european parliament <e> <s> it is right that since all the other countries in the european comnunity use some form of proportional representation this country should do the same <e> <s> i also believe that since we have already accepted the principle of the single transferable vote for northern ireland it is simple to extend it to the rest of the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords we have before us a bill containing proposals which are ill-considered and untried and which is being rushed through parliament at a dangerously fast rate <e> <s> in the other place the bill as my noble friend lord ennals said had a truncated report stage in an all-night sitting and a limited third reading <e> <s> the other place should have given a much more thorough exploration of the bill <e> <s> we shall have to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that noble lords will understand if i concentrate on london for my illustrations <e> <s> i practised medicine in london for more than years and was active in londons government for nearly half that time <e> <s> it is therefore the city that i know best <e> <s> however from my knowledge of most of the larger cities of great britain i am aware that much of what i shall say about london is also applicable to them <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has tried to answer my suggestion that the government were not co-operating with local authorities in dealing with the homeless by referring to certain grants <e> <s> i pointed out straightforwardly that local authorities need to provide more dwellings for people accepted as homeless than they are allowed to build <e> <s> i had hoped the minister would say what the government were doing to help local authorities to build more houses so that they can meet the problem <e> <s> i said in my speech that in local authorities in london were building houses <e> <s> they are now building houses <e> <s> that illustrates the problem <e> <s> will the minister deal with that <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a decline even in the provision of housing by housing associations <e> <s> there is no use saying that we are moving <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister gave way <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has asked the questions that needed to be asked <e> <s> i do not see any point in continuing with this matter <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness sits down perhaps i may ask whether she agrees that we are better at dealing with the disabled than we would otherwise be because of the number of disabled people in this chamber <e>", "<cs> i rise to express my support for this amendment <e> <s> i do not intend to delay members of the committee for very long <e> <s> the new family health services authority will have great power over general practitioners <e> <s> it is sensible and i use that word advisedly that the authority should contain people who practise medicine who understand the problems involved and who can therefore make sensible decisions <e> <s> i hope that the government will accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> the amendment states <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment <e> <s> members of the committee will remember that i supported my noble friend when he piloted his bill through this chamber <e>", "<cs> i am glad that the right reverend prelate spoke as he did <e> <s> i have been reading the amendment and becoming more and more worried <e> <s> i feel that we are in the process of introducing another element into the doctor/patient relationship which is unlikely to be helpful <e> <s> i had intended to wait to hear the ministers reply but that is how i feel <e> <s> i am not against the proposal but i am worried about it <e> <s> we may be starting something which will not be very helpful in terms of the relationship between doctor and patient at the primary care level <e>", "<cs> i hope that the minister will accept the amendment <e> <s> it goes to the kernel of the worry which most people have about this proposal for budget-holding gps <e> <s> we all know that every year around the month of march problems arise in hospitals where their funds have run out and they are obliged to close wards in order to save money for that period of time <e> <s> that happens every year <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may ask the minister whether budget-holders will also be able to dispense <e> <s> if they are to take charge of the whole of the management of their patients dispensing should be part of the issue <e> <s> i have not noticed any suggestion that that should be so but if they are to be in charge of the whole i should have thought that dispensing would be included <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether in replying the minister will tell us how the indicative budget will be worked out <e> <s> that is what worries me <e> <s> when speaking to an earlier amendment i pointed out that in order to escape the stiff cash limits hospitals prescribe limited amounts of treatment and expect gps to provide the rest of the treatment <e> <s> i hope that in deciding on the indicative budget the government will take that into account <e> <s> i should like to hear from the minister how the indicative budget will be worked out <e>", "<cs> i am a little disturbed by the complacency which is evident on this matter <e> <s> the noble lord lord mancroft painted a very accurate picture of the situation <e> <s> i can assure the committee that when drug addicts are in crisis they are available for treatment <e> <s> if they have treatment then one can do something about the problem <e> <s> if the treatment is not provided there and then one loses them <e> <s> they go back to piccadilly or elsewhere have a fix and are not seen again <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord decides what he will do with the amendment i should like to ask the minister a specific question <e> <s> paragraph d of the amendment is quite important in terms of the people who are employed <e> <s> i say that because if we are to take into account the needs of individuals in specific areas we must also take into account their race religion and other such matters <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to prolong the debate but i was not suggesting that the authority would be discriminating i was suggesting that the authority should positively concern itself with such factors <e> <s> i was trying to elicit from the minister whether she agrees with me that the authorities would be encouraged under the regulations to act in the way that i suggested <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment and i hope that the government will accept it <e> <s> i know that they are thinking along the lines that we proposed <e> <s> i know from statements made by the minister mrs bottomley that she is sympathetic and is working towards trying to create exactly what we want <e> <s> the amendment will strengthen her hand <e> <s> i should therefore like included in the bill this requirement regarding the hours worked by junior hospital doctors <e> <s> that would strengthen the ministers hand and accelerate the solution to the problem <e> <s> i hope that when the minister replies she will take that point on board <e> <s> i believe that both sides of the house are in agreement about the principle if not the approach <e> <s> a little flexibility on the governments part will enable us to achieve that aim <e> <s> i hope to hear a little flexibility from the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords there is much substance in this amendment <e> <s> we are moving towards a stage where hospitalisation will possibly be for very much shorter periods of time than at present after which the patient will leave hospital and go home <e> <s> we should ensure that when this happens there is some responsibility for seeing to it that the patient continues to have the appropriate after-care <e> <s> that is what the amendment seeks to achieve <e> <s> in my view it is a sound amendment and i hope that the government will consider accepting it <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to be difficult but before the noble lord sits down let us assume that the patient is in hospital for three days and then comes out <e> <s> he is not too well but does not need hospitalisation <e> <s> what happens at that stage <e> <s> who is responsible for ensuring that the patient is looked after <e> <s> as i see it the amendment means that the district health authority will have some responsibility for ensuring that the patient is looked after <e>", "<cs> my lords i was quite interested to hear the remarks made by the noble lord lord mccoll <e> <s> i practised
