someone who is also familiar with procedure in both houses of parliament i believe that my noble friend is incorrect in assuming that the leader of the day gave a binding commitment <e> <s> he could not have given such a binding commitment because in the last resort it would have been for the house to decide <e> <s> nor could he bind the house in regard to the following session <e> <s> even if

in another chamber <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not intended to rise at this point but i must complain about the procedure that we are following at the moment <e> <s> we are discussing a limited amendment and we are now on to the substantive question <e> <s> what some of us would like to know is whether this amendment actually is viable and improves the bill <e> <s> we look to the minister to reply on that and since these arguments have taken place and are in danger of creating prejudice i am bound to say that some of them should be answered <e>", "<cs> my lords i intervene only very briefly because i have found this a most distressing debate <e> <s> i have found the allegations and the imputations of the noble earl lord lauderdale and my noble friend lord galpern a former deputy

sinister forces at work <e> <s> that is designed simply either to obscure the argument or to reflect the lack of charity <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware that it is parliamentary language but it is none the less objectionable unless it is justified by some sort of evidence and there has been no such evidence <e> <s> the fact is that it is very difficult to get this type of legislation through parliament anyway <e> <s> i say to my noble friend that i do not think that he would really suggest that the ten minute rule bill is a serious way of dealing with this type of matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope my noble friend realises that what he is proposing is quite unconstitutional <e>", "<cs> my lords i intervene because i am probably the only member of your lordships house who was employed by the bbc as a professional broadcaster in the days of lord reith <e> <s> i have never had a greater admiration for anyone for whom i have worked <e> <s> indeed he set very high standards and the country as a whole has benefited greatly from them <e> <s> but we simply cannot accept this amendment <e> <s> we might as well accept an amendment that declares sin unlawful <e> <s> the noble earl lord onslow pointed out some of the objections to it and we have to leave some responsibility on the governors <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had such a thorough debate and such an excellent account from my noble friend lord gregson that i propose to delay your lordships for only a few minutes having been a member of the committee and i wish at the outset to comment on what the noble lord lord todd said about the work of the select committee <e> <s> when i originally proposed the setting up of that committee it was based largely on the high quality of many of your lordships and the work already of the committees under the chairmanship of the noble lords lord todd lord sherfield and lord gregson which shows that in the course of time the select committee will be able to make some valuable contributions <e> <s> we began as lord todd made clear with a rather discrete area one we reckoned we could handle and get a report out quickly and i am told by the noble lord lord ironside and others that we have produced a very satisfactory report <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may i should like to congratulate the minister of state for the energy and initiative he has been showing in a matter of immense difficulty <e> <s> would the noble lord the minister not agree that this is of course only a very preliminary statement and that it is important not to come at this stage to too firm conclusions on this <e> <s> i have no doubt that the islanders will have to think very carefully <e> <s> may i ask the noble lord to ensure that his honourable friend does not put the islanders in a position of either facing decline because the british government decline to continue such little assistance as they are already giving or accepting this particular deal <e> <s> but at the same time

dependencies of the falkland islands and in particular i have in mind the beautiful island of south georgia which is very much in the area where krill fishing may take place <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the noble lord two more questions and i am very grateful to him for answering my previous questions so fully <e> <s> will the noble lord ask his honourable friend that in his negotiations with the argentine he will make clear that the people of the islands are as british as the members of your lordships house if not more so so <e> <s> they are totally of british stock and

to do that anyway but i missed my chance <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> he is aware that the navy has submarines <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble baroness completed her speech after introducing the question i thought that there was nothing more to be said <e> <s> she deployed the case very fully <e> <s> however as an ex-leader of the house one has the habit of tending <e>", "<cs> my lords will some of those costs fall on the department of trade or will the ministry of defence carry it all <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has given us so comprehensive a speech for an unstarred question that i do not think i shall need to make a very long speech <e> <s> since most of my remarks are to be gloomy i should like to begin with one or two remarks that are not <e> <s> first i would pay a tribute to those public servants who have been out there in particular the governors such as governor parker governor french and others who have carried a very lonely

lords i am grateful to the noble lord the minister <e> <s> there are continual rumours about actual oil strikes admittedly a good deal further west off rio gallegos but as far as i know there have not been any strikes in the disputed areas we are talking about unless the oil companies are keeping them very secret <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord the minister would care to comment on that <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support the noble lord lord morris <e> <s> i am not sure whether i heard him correctly at the beginning <e> <s> i support him on most things but if i may say so his enthusiasm has led him slightly astray in giving the names of senior diplomats <e> <s> on the whole as a former civil service minister i find this undesirable <e> <s> i forgive him and perhaps he may have said something at the beginning <e> <s> but perhaps at the end he might care to express some regret on this <e> <s> it would be very undesirable <e> <s> somebody might give the noble lords number but perhaps he would not mind that <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord lord mcnair will allow me to interrupt him the actual figures are that out of farms that we reported nine are sole trader partnerships and four can be described as owner-occupied in that the farm residents own more than per cent <e> <s> of the capital shareholding <e> <s> this does not destroy the main purport of the noble lords argument because the other farms are owned by companies and virtually per cent <e> <s> of the economy is owned by the falkland islands company <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble viscount give way <e> <s> i was not suggesting that the argentine was the opposition <e> <s> i was suggesting that the noble viscount was the opposition <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble lord says that it is under way does he mean that the recommendation has been implemented or not implemented <e> <s> if i may say so with due respect this is one of the most dishonest numbers games that i have ever heard in any debate <e> <s> i am not accusing the noble lord personally <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> i am not disagreeing but my remarks need a little more qualification than the noble lord has expressed <e> <s> i merely express a slight reservation <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord concludes may i give him one other correction <e> <s> in my report there is no suggestion that the extended runway was proposed in order to by-pass the argentine <e> <s> we merely pointed to the development of fisheries trawlers the need to fly crews out and above all tourists probably from buenos aires which happens to be in the argentine <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his statement so far as it goes <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble lord could tell us as reported in the press that this particular group of argentinians were in a ship chartered by salvesen and that no permission was sought from the governor or the foreign office or indeed from the base commander who represents the governor and has i think the status of a magistrate <e> <s> could the noble lord say how far this was recognised <e> <s> was the argentine flag substituted for the union jack because the ship was in british waters <e> <s> is it true as reported on the radio that a british patrol ship which i take it to be hms endurance has been asked to remain <e> <s> does this not strengthen further the case for the retention of hms endurance so that the white ensign can fly in these waters <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely encouraged by the ministers last remarks as he will realise <e>", "<cs> my lords on my temporary return to the front bench i should like to thank the noble lord for that measured and sensible statement <e> <s> i say sensible because if there is one thing that none of us would wish to do it is to exacerbate an already potentially dangerous situation <e> <s> clearly the noble lord appreciates the seriousness in coming back from perhaps a fairly difficult time in brussels and bound i hope for an easier time in israel although i rather doubt whether it will be easier <e>", "<cs> my lords while we do not want to prolong for too long questions on the statement and we are grateful for the firm statement made by the noble lord i would ask him to check on one point <e> <s> it is my recollection that an attempt was made on more than one occasion to refer the question of the falkland islands to the international court and that argentina always refused to participate <e> <s> it is important that that should be confirmed because this is a matter of international law and i have no doubt that the advice would have been that the british claims were valid <e>", "<cs> my lords it is <e>", "<cs> my lords it is with very considerable sorrow that we in your lordships house have to debate such a situation i speak as one of those who have had associations with the falklands and with the sturdy loyal and typically british way of life of the islanders in the knowledge that the islanders are now under the rule of a foreign invader and it is of course a humiliation which we must acknowledge <e> <s> the last occasion i can recall on which a colony surrendered to force was in singapore <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord must have rung them after i had done so which is only half an hour ago <e> <s> i do not know who they were in touch with <e> <s> they themselves made the approach and volunteered information to the foreign office who did not bother <e>", "<cs> my lords that is good that is better than british antarctic surveys managed to do <e> <s> i am delighted on this belated occasion <e> <s> perhaps when the noble viscount comes to reply he will tell us what they said <e> <s> have the argentinians landed on south <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> we have made several attempts in the past to take this whole dispute to the international court and the argentine has always refused to go and <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble viscount is leaving that question of forces he may or may not be able to say anything but of course we are concerned about the position of hms endurance and it may he that when he talks about south georgia he may be able to say something but again he may prefer to keep it quiet <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount may wish to check my statement as to who telephoned whom but we need not waste time <e> <s> he said that hms endurance was in good shape <e> <s> i should have hoped that hms endurance had sailed to safer waters <e> <s> the noble viscount may not feel that he can say anything <e>", "<cs> my lords my sorrow at the events of the last few days has been compounded by the loss to this country and to this house of lord carrington <e> <s> i had much experience as did my noble friend lord shepherd of working with him as we have to work in your lordships house <e> <s> the fact is that he has followed the great british tradition and i wish it had not been so in his case that feeling he was the responsible minister whoever else may have been to blame and we will not even discuss this he must go <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble baroness for her speech <e> <s> i cannot say that it was a very informative one but i do not think that we should blame her for that <e> <s> of course it is difficult for the government to go into much detail as to the measures they are taking <e> <s> nonetheless this does not absolve your lordships from making their contribution and giving consideration to the issues involved in a rather calmer atmosphere than existed last week <e>", "<cs> i beg lord cockfields pardon humbly <e> <s> indeed it was the noble viscount lord trenchard <e> <s> i am very sorry indeed and i congratulate the noble lord lord cockfield and i have now learned how to pronounce his name <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble lord and again we do not expect him necessarily to go into much further detail at this moment <e> <s> it clearly is still the firm view of all the parties in this country all the leading parties anyway that we support the government in the steps that they are taking and the remarks that i am about to make if i may are not designed in any way to weaken the governments resolve in this matter which we support <e> <s> clearly we agree that the haig mission is at the moment the best hope but none the less we may have to face the fact that the terms that would be remotely acceptable to the british government with their original statements will be unacceptable to the junta in the argentine <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that in fact the norwegians have a better claim to south georgia than the argentines because they have been whaling there for years <e> <s> it is quite ludicrous that the argentines should claim that <e> <s> may i again ask the noble lord whether he will seriously consider putting out the case because the point made by my noble and learned friend lord elwyn-jones is one that has escaped a lot of people <e> <s> my recollection is that we offered to take our claims to the antarctic to the hague court but i think it is this juridical side that again could be explored more closely <e> <s> if the minister well informed and generally courteous as he is to this house is not really very well aware of it it suggests that quite a lot of others of us are not <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord <e> <s> i think that the first thing we would all want to do in your lordships house is to wish the foreign secretary success and give him our support in the mission that he is undertaking <e>", "<cs> my lords there is little further that we need say at this moment other than to reiterate the fact that the government have had the unstinted support of the opposition parties on this matter <e> <s> i should also like to repeat notwithstanding certain anxieties many of us have had about the american attitude a tribute to general haig for the gruelling and tremendous efforts he has been making <e> <s> he must have shown great endurance and great courage to have tackled these pretty horrific negotiations <e>", "<cs> my lords i am tempted to answer what is turning into a debate so many points have arisen <e> <s> i have a number of points i should like to make but at the moment we are concerned to express our support <e>", "<cs> my lords the whole house will wish to extend the most heartfelt congratulations to the british armed forces <e> <s> the achievement which i will not say exceeded our expectations because we have very high expectations is a matter for the greatest congratulation to those who planned and carried out what could have been a very dangerous operation <e> <s> it is even more satisfactory that it was implemented without loss of british life and the wounding of only one argentinian and i would say at the outset how right the government are to return the argentinian prisoners to the argentine <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to thank the lord privy seal for an extremely forthright and clear exposition of the british situation <e> <s> some of the criticism of the government on which i do not propose to spend much time might not have arisen had we been given such very clear guidance both in regard to the united nations and the international court <e> <s> nevertheless i welcome the ministers speech and i wish to give my support and i believe the support of my colleagues in the labour party for the course that is now being followed both in seeking a peaceful solution and backing it up which has always been the basis of the policy which is being pursued with the inevitable and terrifying threat of force <e> <s> and even now at this late hour i share the hopes of the government i believe it may well be possible to avoid an all-out conflict <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> he is busy saying what is the attitude of the labour party excluding those in this house <e> <s> i suggest that he goes down the corridor and listens in the other place when he will find that he is giving an inaccurate representation <e>", "<cs> my lords the one piece of news that the noble viscount gave us was that a further sortie was made today to render the airstrip unusable for light supply communications and ground attack aircraft <e> <s> does he mean that there has been another attack on port stanley airfield <e> <s> i stress airfield after the black put up by his defence spokesman the other day <e> <s> is it being actively used <e> <s> are there any results from this <e> <s> this is the sort of information that we really ought to be given <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for her conduct of a difficult situation with the acquiescence of the house <e> <s> if i may ask the noble viscount one or two questions first of all has he any information i do not know if it has been published as to whether hms sheffield is still afloat and whether there is any prospect of towing her back <e> <s> i may say that this is infinitely less important than the loss of life on which the views of the house are identical <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that your lordships will share the gratitude that i feel personally and indeed on behalf of my party for the very clear exposition from the lord privy seal <e> <s> i think it would be agreed that it clearly gives the lie to the suggestions that have recently emanated that the prime minister however intemperate some of her earlier words were has in fact been intransigent <e> <s> indeed it is striking how far the government have moved from their original position <e> <s> it is quite clear now that we have the whole story that it is almost impossible at the present moment to arrive at any agreement with the argentine government <e>", "<cs> my lords we are most grateful to the noble baroness <e> <s> this is a moment not for discussion in detail but of pride of congratulation and indeed of sorrow <e> <s> i think that as british people we are entitled to feel pride at the performance of our armed forces at the planning the excellence of the general staff in these matters and of the joint chiefs of staff <e> <s> we learned during the last war that there were such animals as competent generals and air marshals <e> <s> they have shown this again on this occasion and they have achieved it with a loss of life which though tragic is extraordinarily small when one thinks of the enormous numbers who were opposed <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the purpose of asking questions in your lordships house is to elicit information and that he could have saved himself quite a lot of trouble and indeed showing some rather unjustified indignation if he had simply pointed out that these maps to which my noble friend referred were not strictly speaking ordnance survey maps <e> <s> they are the maps of which <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think we want to spend much more time on this <e> <s> the noble lord might have a look at the / maps which were produced by huntings <e> <s> it all goes back to the work of the falkland islands dependency survey <e> <s> whether or not they are generally on sale there is no doubt that they are perfectly easy to get hold of <e> <s> i have a couple of sets <e> <s> i will let the noble lord have one if he wants <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord is not prepared to comment on the morality of this matter is he prepared to consider expressing a political or even a social opinion which is of some concern i should have thought to this government <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl confirm that the work of the british antarctic survey is generally recognised among all the signatories of the antarctic treaty as the most cost effective and the most significant pound for pound <e> <s> in the light of his latter remark while acknowledging that at this moment there is this increased interest in resource development within the antarctic would he agree that it is not only the british interest but the extent to which the british will be able to sustain the international nature of development in the antarctic which is important <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just interrupt the noble lord to say that i thank him for his congratulations but it is of course the government who have determined the timing and it is the government who published this white paper on the eve of christmas so that nobody should notice it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord again but he is making a number of assertions that are not borne out <e> <s> what the report says is that the association of district councils supported the governments intention in principle but would urge strongly that the implications which the proposals might have on the quality of the unique service provided by the ordnance survey should be very carefully examined before any final decision is made on how they should be implemented so that this essential service is not in any way diminished <e> <s> that was the reason for my recommendation that it should go to the advisory board <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the usual courtesy of this house to give way <e> <s> that is important and it might give warning to the minister so that perhaps he could produce the published statements on the royal mint although i do not regard it as an analogy at all <e> <s> the noble earl lord bessborough has told us this <e> <s> from the accounts point of view what changes are there <e> <s> perhaps the minister will bear that in mind <e> <s> i do not regard it as an argument <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has delivered a splendid speech full of eloquence and charm and he has not made out in any way the case for the trading fund <e> <s> the only argument effectively that he has used has been the vote argument <e> <s> i do not know whether the government would like to treat the rate support grant in that sort of way or the defence procurement <e> <s> it is irrelevant to the issue we are debating on whether the trading fund is the right instrument for the governance of ordnance survey <e>", "<cs> my lords could the noble baroness divide the figures up as between the industrial side and the rest of the civil service and indicate where these great economies were made <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness has not dealt with my question <e> <s> is this information available and if it is could it be circulated <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know what the noble lord means by saying that it is one thing to put something in a report <e> <s> i had not intended to intervene but as i always tend to be traduced by whoever the government are on the subject of the falklands i see the eye of the leader on me i am breaking the rules will the noble lord not agree that if people say they are interested it is possible to consider that it is relatively large and not relatively small <e>", "<cs> my lords i had hoped to spend the time i was going to detain your lordships in discussing the noble earls report but i am bound to make one or two comments on remarks made by my noble friend lord longford <e> <s> i do not believe i have ever heard him quite so passionately convinced that he was speaking party policy <e> <s> i think probably he and i have not kicked over the traces very often but if ever there was a bad case on which to be so passionately committed to party policy this seems to me to be the one <e> <s> i for one am opposed to what happened officially in the other place <e> <s> the noble viscount who has just spoken has drawn attention to the rather strange number of absences from the division lobby <e> <s> those of us who are old members of the labour party are well aware i give this to the noble lord lord wigoder that we do on occasion disagree with one another that is perhaps the understatement of the year <e> <s> i think this is the sort of difficult issue on which there are bound to be strong feelings and feelings of conscience <e> <s> i hope i can remove any anxieties from the noble lord lord beloff <e> <s> it is not generally the intention of the labour party in the house of lords ever to vote against an order <e> <s> therefore i think the noble lord can go home if he wishes at this point <e>", "<cs> my lords i will insert the word special <e> <s> it does not affect my point that there was a need for special legislation <e> <s> if i may say so the noble earl lord longford committed something of a breach in the custom of the house <e> <s> he said as i understood him that he was speaking on behalf of the irish community <e> <s> but that is of course entirely contrary to the custom of your lordships <e> <s> there is a reference if i can find it which makes clear that we do not speak on behalf of any interests <e> <s> we speak for ourselves <e> <s> we can identify with outside bodies who agree with us but we do not speak on their behalf <e> <s> i think it is important to make that clear <e>", "<cs> my lords i would remind the noble lord that the proposition he is advocating was considered very carefully <e> <s> the danger of it is that it would imply some form of judicial process whereas by definition it cannot be a judicial process <e> <s> therefore i strongly support the use of the appeal to the adviser rather than to a judge in chambers who would find it very difficult as it would not be possible to confront the individual with the evidence on which he was being excluded <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will of course concede that the very great majority of those who were so-called detained were detained for a relatively short time and that the ratio of charges to those detained for more than hours was very much higher <e>", "<cs> my lords i should just like to ask the noble lord lord aberdare whether he sees a danger of all select committee reports being taken within this procedure <e> <s> i hope and i do not doubt that the procedure committee took this view that it will be very exceptional for the short debate to be used for debating the reports of select committees or subcommittees for which the government ought really to provide the time <e> <s> obviously we accept this now but i do so with a warning <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise not so much as a former leader of the house but as one of the surviving members of the

find the antarctic treaty powers and those concerned to keep the antarctic out of politics rather hostile to the idea <e> <s> i think one should approach the idea with caution <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> it may be helpful to those who think it may be renegotiated if i say that as i understand it it will automatically be renewed unless governments choose to withdraw

thought that the danger of it not being renewed providing peace remains there is slight <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt the noble baroness before she leaves that point <e> <s> can she tell us whether the funding of the station in south georgia which was the subject of argument between british antarctic surveys and the civil commissioner has been settled <e> <s> may i add that of course british antarctic surveys probably produce the highest quality scientific work of anybody in the antarctic <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble baroness but did she say that all support this <e> <s> i thought i heard her say that all support it <e>", "<cs> my lords i must point out if i may that there is great controversy on this subject and it simply is not good enough for us to be told that this is all very satisfactory <e> <s> there is a lot of controversy and disagreement and indeed some argument as to whether the falkland islands executive council or the legislative council agree with this <e> <s> i can produce any number of arguments to show that there are the people there who want farms <e>", "<cs> my lords are there any grants <e> <s> under the highlands and

lords i had not made-up my mind to speak in this debate until i found i was put in the honourable place of third on the list and i am now committed <e> <s> my reason for wanting to speak was to explain why having opposed the proposal in i have come to the view that the motion moved by the noble lord lord soames should be supported <e> <s> my reason for doing so i shall seek to explain and i

retirement as clerk of the parliaments and it was very clear then how strongly the house thought of the value of his services and how sad noble lords were that he was going to depart <e> <s> but

different conclusion to the one that i reached in my earlier inquiry <e> <s> the noble earl had additional information which made him come down on the opposite side <e> <s> i would however say to your lordships concerning legislation which i have never called draconian i have indeed suggested that it is an excessive description that the fact remains for reasons that my noble friend lord fitt gave that it is not really a very good thing to have an act that people are contravening every day of the year <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord the minister will allow me to correct him i did not say

past practice in this house of allotting two days to the debate with one day going fairly late to oclock and then bringing the matter to the vote at oclock on the second day <e> <s> that is the

chiding of the noble lord the leader of the house for being too gentle with the house that led to this discussion in the procedure committee i should like to say a few words on a matter which i believe is of tremendous importance to this house <e> <s> there is a danger among your lordships especially among those of us who come from the commons of an instinctive desire to get round the speaker <e> <s> well we have here nobody to get round except ourselves <e> <s> it has been very apparent that there has been a lot of shooting own goals in recent years <e> <s> if i may say so i think it is of importance that it is recognised that on the matter which is dealt with in the admirable report which i congratulate the noble lord on reading because i think it is important that all noble lords should take account of it there has been a failure of noble lords to realise that this is the procedure of the house <e> <s> i think that it ought to be incorporated in the <e>", "<cs> my lords

remarks <e> <s> i again repeat my apologies for the fact that the article which i planned for <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that we are now confronted really with a national tragedy in

of them sail into falklands waters and fly the flag of convenience the union jack whether they are russian or any other nationality thus recognising our right to be there <e> <s> the whole house would support the noble baroness in her efforts to open any sensible talks with the argentine which they have persistently spurned <e> <s> will the noble baroness recognise that there is a limit to the time that we should spend attempting what may never be achieved and therefore will she consider going ahead unilaterally and declaring the failure of other countries to back us in this matter <e>", "<cs>

produced the kind of speech of eloquence and conviction that i would have expected from him <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may interrupt the noble lord i did not use the word insensitive as my main point

abolition of the glc has removed the one local authority which is capable of supporting what is not just a local theatre but a national theatre <e>", "<cs> my lords since it was on an amendment that i moved on a previous occasion that this matter and also the rights of back bench peers in relation to statements was referred back to the committee i should first say that i entirely accept that the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter who perhaps for tactful reasons decided not to oppose my amendment on that occasion thinking that it was better discussed in committee should have deployed his case so forcefully and on the whole fairly <e> <s> however i disagree with certain of his remarks <e> <s> the purpose of neutral motions is that we should be in our manners in this house very different from

inconsistency <e> <s> i fully accept that the police and the immigration people must have the right to stop people of whom they are suspicious <e> <s> but mr kaukungua was well-known and he was

may interrupt <e> <s> before the noble lord leaves the subject of freedom of information this has as he said been considered by many governments <e> <s> the reason when i was responsible for an examination was that all the evidence seemed to me to be that we would have a more restrictive situation than exists under the present act <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness say whether she has any information about the many exiles from the days of south arabia who if they are still alive are in saudi arabia and elsewhere and <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to congratulate the noble lord lord strathclyde <e> <s> his father and indeed his grandfather were well known to many of us particularly in another place <e> <s> there is a strong nautical and naval tradition in his

the dark blue of an australian usually a navigator <e> <s> they were of vital importance to our own survival and i like to think that we shall remember that <e> <s> a little patriotism now and again is not entirely amiss in these days <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that your lordships should pass this order tonight <e> <s> in previous years my noble friend lord henderson and i have complained about the delay in the provision of the annual report <e> <s> i did not know that it was available although i ought to have guessed until my noble friend lord mishcon mentioned it <e> <s> i then went to the printed paper office where i was told that it had been received a few minutes before <e> <s> my noble friend lord henderson had not seen it either <e> <s> it is a major failure and it is outrageous that this house should be asked to pass the order without having had the benefit of considering the report <e> <s> however i have read enough of it to say that the important subject for discussion is the main review carried out by the noble viscount lord colville <e> <s> i should like to congratulate him <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords reply was in many ways predictable <e> <s> i did not believe that the government would move particularly in response to a debate in the house of lords but the minister left us with a measure of hope <e> <s> i suppose i ought to be grateful that he seems to have persuaded the canadian government that we can have a little more time so that her majestys government do not have to announce a decision for or against at the time of this debate <e> <s> the information which we have all had from official sources and from the canadian government was that the decision had to be taken by tomorrow <e> <s> however the minister seems to have succeeded in postponing that decision and i hope it will be the right one <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may express my appreciation to the offices committee for granting both the european communities committee and the science and technology committee an additional part-time specialist assistant for a period of two years <e> <s> the amount of work that our clerks get through on our behalf is amazing <e> <s> if by any chance the house thinks that we are being over-indulged let me say that i was subjected to a rigorous cross-examination by the leader of the house on the need for those clerks <e> <s> since i see that the next item refers to the parliament office i should like to put on record again how much we owe to the clerks of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask her majestys government a question of which i have given private notice namely <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister whom i certainly would not accuse of deliberately misleading the house agree that in effect it might have been better if he had said that during the debate instead of saying at col of <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed the minister has now written to me <e> <s> perhaps first of all i should like to acknowledge with appreciation his expression of regret <e> <s> i feel it is characteristic that he does so regret <e> <s> undoubtedly we were misled but i do not accuse him of doing it <e>", "<cs> of course my lords i withdraw my remark <e> <s> i just hoped that the minister would come a bit cleaner that is all <e>", "<cs> my lords it is within the knowledge of the house that it was deceived <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords whom you can hear all agree with that <e> <s> there is a large number <e>", "<cs> yes there was my lords <e> <s> however i say that the minister did not do it deliberately <e> <s> since he has now said that it seems unlikely that the uk will participate in radarsat would it not be the decent thing to say so now so that the canadian government are not involved in this rather curious exchange <e>", "<cs> my lords the ingenuity of the lord privy seal is something for which we should be grateful provided we notice that the amount of money which a noble lord so requires comes to about the equivalent of a weeks salary for one secretary <e> <s> this summer i shall be entitled to an extra for which i thank him very much <e> <s> next year i shall be entitled to an extra <e> <s> your lordships must recognise that this is a working house and that it ought to be possible to provide noble lords on all sides with a little more help for secretarial services <e> <s> secretarial services cannot be turned off and on <e> <s> nonetheless the noble lord has tried hard <e> <s> it is a quite ingenious solution if only it amounted to some worthwhile sum <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord glenarthur for his short but well-informed introduction <e> <s> i hope that he will give us some more information when he replies <e>", "<cs> my lords while the lighthearted intention of the noble baroness has been well echoed by the minister and since the government have now ensured that this country has no capability of putting any satellites into space the fact remains that a similar satellite i am sure that the noble earl has been briefed on this namely cosmos caused several million pounds worth of damage <e> <s> although the odds are heavily against the satellite landing on westminster the fact remains that there will be quite a problem <e> <s> will the government therefore consider pressing and supporting those who seek some limitation as regards putting into space nuclear capabilities which present a particular threat when they come down to earth <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl agree that it is perhaps desirable that the public should be informed of the risk if any <e> <s> is he aware that one fragment from cosmos was nine inches long and gave off times the acceptable level of radiation <e> <s> although the risk is small nonetheless it would be as well on a matter of this kind if the government were to issue a flat straight statement which showed the extent to which there could be a risk although i would agree that the odds are heavily against it landing in an inhabited part of the world <e>", "<cs> my lords while the noble lord is quite right to reserve his answer to my noble friend lord sherfield can he draw the matter to the attention of the new minister of health mr clarke to whom we also extend congratulations and wish that he will do better than he has done in space over hotol <e> <s> at the same time my noble friend has brought out a most fundamental point in the report namely that it is the view of the committee perhaps he will consider this that research should not just be transferred to the medical research council <e> <s> will he give a good deal of consideration to this fundamental point <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that although it is years too late and we should have set it up many years ago the zone has been a great success <e> <s> can he say something about the findings of the imperial college study on the success of the conservation measures <e> <s> whereas he may not wish to refer to the backing of the royal navy we all know that the royal navy is there <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for those figures <e> <s> does he agree that this effectively triples the revenue that is open to the falkland islands <e> <s> does he not also agree that considerable congratulations are due both to his department and indeed to the falkland islands government on putting in a very complex system and operating it apparently so wisely and successfully <e> <s> in the light of that will he now consider the other part of our recommendations and extend the limit to the generally internationally accepted level of miles which despite what some people say will not cost a great deal and will yield further revenue <e>", "<cs> my lords the last thing i wish to suggest to the noble lord is that he is concealing the basic reasons but does he not agree that political considerations are the main reason <e> <s> does he not also agree that the government have made every effort to talk to the argentines but that they have refused to talk and co-operate as everyone would desire <e> <s> in the light of that will he now give further consideration to extending the zone to the internationally accepted limit <e> <s> we might also take in south georgia on the way which is being hoovered up by the russians <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to press this subject indefinitely although i could go on for hours <e> <s> however will the noble lord accept the point made by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> we all agree that the measures were introduced for conservation purposes <e> <s> we doubt whether reducing the area to be considered to miles adds to the conservation <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not agree that the ministry of defence is virtually the owner of this great national museum <e> <s> can the noble lord say why the museum has not been consulted <e> <s> the trustees who are in his own department have not been consulted on what is going to be done <e> <s> a building such as the graham white hangar which is a very ancient and historic pre-first world war factory could sensibly be brought into the museum field <e> <s> does the minister agree that it would be very much cheaper to consult the director of the museum <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister explain what he means by his statement that the raf museum was associated with one of the companies that sought to develop the site <e> <s> is there anything improper <e> <s> does the minister believe that the raf authorities concerned with the museum or the raf board wish to become involved on the commercial side <e> <s> can the minister tell the house whether the planning brief is available <e> <s> i do not know that it has been seen <e> <s> if not can the minister make it available <e> <s> the noble lord lord orr-ewing had hoped to be here <e> <s> he was a former member and he wishes to be associated with everything that we are saying <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say what british rails arrangements are for enabling drivers of trains approaching a station rather late to have a sight of the digital clock and thus ensure their punctuality as the noble lord thinks <e> <s> if the noble lord is also considering the future use of clocks is he aware that the clock in the gare dorsai in paris is now a glorious centrepiece in a marvellous museum the musee dorsai <e> <s> all the british rail clocks could be offered to british museums <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the increased support which the government are giving to british antarctic territories which is very considerable <e> <s> the report of the abrc anticipates the nerc having to visualise higher costs <e> <s> does the noble viscount agree that the first requirement of british antarctic surveys especially in the light of the iceberg accident concerning hms endurance should be a ship of the highest quality <e> <s> is he able to say whether the government will look not only at quality but also that they would bend the rules a little with regard to the right price if the british competitors bid were not equal to that of say the finnsh <e> <s> can he also say when the results are expected <e>", "<cs> my lords while i am not suggesting that the noble viscount represents the finnish lobby undoubtedly finland builds the very best polar ships i am hoping that the government will make it financially possible for an equally good ship to be supplied from a british shipyard <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble lord lord glenarthur i have just come back from the celebration of the th anniversary of the founding of the european space agency <e> <s> it is not so unrelated to the antarctic as noble lords may think <e> <s> indeed when i initiated a debate over years ago asking her majestys government to sign the convention for the antarctic treaty we visualised it perhaps as an initial practice against the time when the problems of sovereignty in space would arise <e> <s> i shall not follow that now however <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord will allow me to intervene <e> <s> i hope that he will bear in mind the point i made that it is not only mining which is threatening the antarctic <e> <s> that is probably the least of the threats <e> <s> although this does not come under the bill recent accidents show what risks humanity creates and the dangers in the antarctic <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not often that a noble lord begins a speech by complaining that he has been listed too early in the debate <e> <s> however i do so and i blame the government <e> <s> i and other speakers have important engagements and i share strongly the official view that it is discourteous to the house to leave before the end of the debate <e> <s> however on this occasion i have no option <e> <s> i had asked to be listed late so that if necessary i could remove my name from the list <e> <s> as it is i shall make <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a particular pleasure to congratulate the noble lord on a first-class maiden speech <e> <s> it is customary for whoever follows to say something about the speaker but i had difficulty in finding out about him <e> <s> i asked the government whips and helpful as ever they gave me a brief which unfortunately related to his <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate that the noble earl is doing his best <e> <s> however since the noble lord the leader of the house is not present i wonder whether the noble earl the deputy leader would care to comment on a situation wherein the whole house unites in a particular view <e> <s> in my opinion the leader of the house ought to be here to listen to this discussion <e> <s> it is a matter on which this house will not let go <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that there are grave doubts about the reliability of the total rd national figure in particular in relation to the ministry of defence <e> <s> the select committee on science and technology will shortly be producing a report on rd and we need to know these figures <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord recall that the other day at the cbi lech walesa said that what poland wanted was not simply money but general help with the transition of industry into a modern state <e> <s> furthermore the east european trade council and the cbi have been working on management training for some while <e> <s> institutions already exist for such training but it needs more support from the government and more encouragement <e>", "<cs> my lords i orginally put my name down to speak in this debate to declare my support for the warnock proposals and to speak on behalf of the noble lord lord dainton who unfortunately like many of my scientific friends was unable to be present <e> <s> on his behalf i should say that he strongly supports the proposals for further research on pre-embryos <e> <s> he does so partly because he is involved in the research and has seen its results at the postgraduate school at hammersmith but also because he has a close relative who is infertile <e> <s> that subject is a very personal one <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble viscount sits down i should say that those of us who occasionally have had to consider whether there is a duty to eat human flesh have been faced with this kind of moral issue particularly on expeditions to polar regions where people have been eaten <e> <s> on the expedition i took part in we were never in danger of having to do that but we debated that possibility <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know of any serious scientist certainly in this country who has claimed that research on embryos has effected a cure <e>", "<cs> my lords may i make the noble viscount aware that certainly i and no doubt others have been treated with great courtesy by the police at marble arch <e> <s> recovery was not as expensive as i expected and i was back on the road in time to get to your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords the house ought to feel considerable concern about this report which reveals a rather alarming situation <e> <s> if we continue down the way we have been travelling we are in danger of moving further along the path of needing a speaker to keep order <e> <s> i shall not discuss all the items many of them will reappear <e> <s> the particular issue to which the noble lord referred the question of speaking after the minister has spoken on a commons amendment reveals a serious situation because your lordships know that amendments come from another house which have not been adequately debated <e> <s> we then have the minister speaking we hope early on when the amendment really ought to be discussed in some committee form <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord explain how that can be claimed <e> <s> is it claimed against the expenses that noble lords claim <e> <s> the provision in expenses in relation to rates is only about <e>", "<cs> i have just come into the chamber <e> <s> the noble earl has enunciated a principle that is completely unfamiliar to me as a former leader of the house <e> <s> he is saying that because the opposition and others sought to divide the noble baroness will not try to do her best for the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i too have an uneasy feeling about this report but not for the reasons advanced by my noble friend lord hatch <e> <s> it seems to me that he has misunderstood the role of the committee <e> <s> if he refers to the beginning of the report he will see that the committee of which i was not a very active member because i was unable to play the part i had hoped looked into a limited area <e> <s> it was not looking into the organisation of overseas aid generally <e> <s> i draw attention to paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend recall that the select committee on science and technology to which the government have today paid such tribute in regard to the nature conservancy bill was highly critical of the governments failure in regard to her majestys inspectorate of pollution <e>", "<cs> my lords it has been my good fortune to congratulate a number of noble lords on their maiden speeches when they arrived in this house <e> <s> i am constantly amazed at the variety of new peers whether they take their place by succession or are created peers such as my noble friend who made such an excellent speech or the noble viscount lord mills the biologist who sits on the other side of the chamber <e> <s> the noble lord who has just spoken has brought to the subject a knowledge expertise and intellectual quality which do not surprise us <e> <s> we all knew his father who was a popular member and i am glad to see his son sitting on his fathers benches <e> <s> he gave a speech which contained a great deal of information including his own personal activity in the field of wood making tent-pegs and told us of his interest and study <e> <s> he then branched off into a subject which i should have loved to debate for the rest of the afternoon namely the meaning of environment and ecology <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may intervene <e> <s> the noble lord asked on whose behalf the noble lord lord ross was speaking <e> <s> is the noble lord speaking for the labour party or the liberal party <e>", "<cs> so was the noble lord lord ross <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that i was here to welcome a bill <e> <s> i feel singularly ill-equipped to start debating this issue with the master of the rolls <e> <s> i am happy to leave that to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor <e> <s> however this is a sovereign parliament and we can do what we judge is right <e> <s> we shall override precedents <e>", "<cs> my lords i put my name down on the list of speakers and asked to speak late in the debate with fair confidence that most of the issues will have been already debated and therefore i could deliver a short speech <e> <s> however i wish to say how interesting and constructive was the speech of my noble friend lady ewart-biggs <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may intervene in this debate <e> <s> i am comforted to remember that my father was an irishman <e> <s> having seen the fury of the scots and the beginning of the fury of the english i hope i can lower tempers a little <e>", "<cs> perhaps the minister could also give us the figures as regards manpower <e> <s> of course as he knows there will have been an estimate which will have been put before the legislative committee <e> <s> therefore there must be an estimate in existence <e> <s> this factor is most crucial in relation to the question of money <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may interrupt and ask a question about the important statement made by the noble lord <e> <s> under the bill who will have the power now possessed under the wildlife and countryside act by the nature conservancy council to draw attention to a major conservation issue <e> <s> will that be dealt with by the co-ordinating committee or by the three separate councils <e> <s> who will raise an issue of national importance <e> <s> at present there is a power under the wildlife and countryside act <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> does he include the large number of contract staff who are essentially part-time <e> <s> will they be offered jobs <e>", "<cs> does the noble lord envisage amendments to this bill being suggested in the white paper <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment <e> <s> i find it slightly embarrassing to put myself alongside the noble lord

sports council in wales <e> <s> i admire its professional skill commitment and its ability to show people how to do things and to stop silly fools like me getting stuck on tryfan because i do not have

success <e> <s> however from the outset i was sceptical about the willingness and ability of the government to provide the necessary funds and i remain so <e>", "<cs> we are grateful for the attempts of the noble lord <e> <s> he dismisses which he is entitled to do some of the outside estimates <e> <s> however what about the pe estimate <e> <s> he must have that <e> <s> does he know what that is

whether the scheme will work <e> <s> i do not believe that the money will be there <e>", "<cs> the minister has not answered my question <e> <s> could he give the figures of the pe study <e> <s> i presume they are in the hands of his department <e>", "<cs> perhaps the minister needs a little time to obtain an answer on this topic <e> <s> the minister indicates three but i do not know what that

separate totals it would be useful <e> <s> we do not believe the government will finance this change adequately <e>", "<cs> we will then have the figures in the white paper <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble baroness herself read the so-called wooding report because a great deal more is involved in the report about the need for supervision and an advisory committee than emerges from her remarks
