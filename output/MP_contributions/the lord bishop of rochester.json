["<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether he can assure us that the comparatively small but quite significant development education fund will be maintained <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the minor consequences of the two main parties in this house changing sides is that my noble and reverend friend lord soper now looks across at us on these benches with characteristic irreverence for the establishment instead of sitting behind us and being able to prod and exhort us in his own inimitable way <e> <s> we are all very grateful to him for initiating this debate <e> <s> if one consequence of it is that it has kept him from the methodist conference let me say that i have been there and as always have been refreshed by methodists singing and by their equally vigorous social concern <e>", "<cs> my lords the may report is the first report of its kind for over years <e> <s> none of us therefore should be surprised that it was eagerly awaited by everybody concerned with the prison service

creative and far-reaching proposals likely to involve both hard cash here and now and long-term investment later <e>", "<cs> my lords the common feature of all historic cathedrals north and south is not only that they attract visitors in large numbers but also that they still evoke a considerable loyalty over quite a large area and some even have as well quite effective overseas associations <e>

in use <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the last phrase in amendment no <e> <s> and to do so on the grounds that i think that as we all want the best possible governing bodies for all these

of mature students as they are called <e> <s> they have brought an enrichment to many of the professions and they are particularly needed in the areas that lady faithfull mentioned where the need for

benches and we are grateful for the expression of concern for ageing church of england bishops would very much prefer any extension of the representation from these benches to include our friends and colleagues from the other churches of the british isles <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble and learned lord for his answer <e> <s> would he not agree that in view of the changed value of money and the comparatively small amount involved anyway in the contribution to this particular united nations agency it is rather sad that the british contribution is not higher than it is having regard to the urgent situations throughout the world on which this fund is trying to help <e>", "<cs> my lords in rising from these benches to support the noble lord lord ritchie-calder i am sure that in the same way as he co-operated with the divinity faculty in edinburgh university he will be ready for me to say that i believe that there are many christians of all traditions and not only within the church of england who are concerned that the nations which together make up the united nations which has no existence apart from them shall together enable it to rise to its full potential as an instrument for promoting the long-term interests of governments and peoples <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not expect that i am the only member of this house speaking in this debate tonight who has a feeling that this is where he came in <e> <s> but the one all-important difference for those of us who took part in a similar debate three years ago is as the right reverend prelate the bishop of durham has reminded us the publication of the long-awaited alternative service book five months ago and the opportunity which has given many parishes up and down the land to consider afresh the pattern of their worship in <e> <s> this is the really significant thing that is happening as many clergy and laity would testify without anguish or distress <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that the general synod of the church of england passed a motion in calling on her majestys government

of canterbury who spoke from these benches during the second reading debate on the bill is unable to be here until later today because he and the right reverend prelate the bishop of truro are detained at york for an important debate in the general synod of the church of england <e> <s> as some noble lords will recall while conceding that at some point a new nationality act would be desirable the archbishop insisted that the basis of any such measure must be clearly seen to be equality of respect and regard if it was to give reassurance and confidence to all concerned <e> <s> he laid great emphasis upon belonging being a basic human need and it is because we believe that clause of the present bill is causing real anxiety and fear among those who thought that they and their children belonged and would continue to belong to britain that we on these benches have tabled these amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i think noble lords have recognised that it is only very rarely that we on these benches venture into the more detailed discussion of legislation mainly because our duties do not allow us to be here sufficiently regularly to do so <e> <s> so i ask noble lords to believe that it is in no sense unadvisedly lightly or wantonly that the most reverend primate and the other three of us have put down this amendment but because of the deep concern that has been expressed to us not only by the clergy but by many lay people of the congregations throughout the land <e>", "<cs> although i think it is more than she deserves after her indulgence in the national sport of bishop baiting i should like to respond to the earlier invitation of the noble baroness and assure her of my support for this amendment <e> <s> if this rather complex procedure has been devised in the interests of the exercise of compassion then surely this additional discretion for the secretary of state is much to be encouraged <e>", "<cs> i intervene in the discussion on this amendment with more hesitation than usual but only because church members in the colony of gibraltar and both the anglican and roman catholic bishops in gibraltar have expressed their deep concern about the added distress which this matter has caused to the people of gibraltar after their years of enforced isolation from the mainland <e> <s> it was unfortunate to say the least for it caused an unnecessary amount of concern in gibraltar that the news media there gave credence to a rumour that the bishops in your lordships house were not prepared to seek any redress for the people of gibraltar during this present debate in your lordships committee <e> <s> the bishop of gibraltar received a number of agitated telephone calls some of them during the night and one of my lay correspondents even suggested that the prime minister had canvassed the bishops in your lordships house to vote against this amendment <e>", "<cs> throughout the discussions in this committee we on these benches have been looking for assurances for those about whom we are concerned who are fearful as to the consequences of this bill and who rightly or wrongly misunderstand its motives and intentions <e> <s> that is why we shall look forward with particular interest to the response at the report stage to the amendments in the name of the noble viscount which we have recently discussed

clarity i would appeal to the minister to take this back <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches would like very much to be associated with what has been said about the former leader of <e>", "<cs>

further correspondence on this and i assume that he is of a mind that this point has been met <e> <s> it seems to me to be so <e>", "<cs> my lords as one who spoke in support of the noble and learned lord when he moved this amendment and as five members of these benches voted with the majority of this house in passing it <e> <s> i must express my own regret that the government are unwilling to sustain the decision of this house or to do what they have done in one or two other instances to provide alternative amendments to meet the concern which has been expressed here <e>", "<cs> my lords i

of the parts to be omitted from the original act did away with certain provisions which affected the jewish faith <e> <s> i think that that underlines the importance of what the noble baroness lady seear has just said that it would appear that there is <e>", "<cs> my lords the most reverend primate who took part in the last debate on april th is not yet back from an arduous official visit to the church in nigeria but in view of his direct responsibility for the anglican church in the falkland islands i know that it would be his wish that there should be a spokesman from these benches in a debate which is taking place at such a critical moment in this long-drawn-out crisis <e> <s> i must apologise if a longstanding commitment to a parish in kent tonight will make it necessary for me to leave before the reply to the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches would very much like to be associated with what has been said so well by noble lords on the other side of the house and of course to express on this day of liberation and rejoicing our very deep sympathy with those for whom it is also a day of mourning <e> <s> we are particularly glad that the initiative for the cease-fire was made by the british commander and we can be thankful it met with such a quick response <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that where we are concerned with human relationships we are anxious that not only the social legal and medical implications but in addition some of the acute moral problems that arise should also be considered by any committee that is set up <e>", "<cs> my lords while the alleviation of the immediate needs of the displaced people is obviously very urgent indeed may i ask the minister if he is aware that what the lebanon needs more than anything else is secure and respected frontiers <e> <s> may i therefore ask him what steps the government are taking to ensure that any peace-keeping forces are given adequate international authority <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house may i thank my fellow church commissioner for his support and for the additional information he has given to your lordships which i am sure is helpful to those who wish to understand the way in which the rather complex arrangement between the church commissioners the pensions board and the dioceses operates to provide adequate pensions and housing for the clergy and lay workers <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house may i thank my friends who have spoken if i may be allowed from these benches to refer to them in that way and especially thank the noble viscount lord esher and the noble lord lord kennet for explaining some of the background to what i think some will see as the change of view of the advisory board <e> <s> i think that what i tried to suggest earlier about partnership of the various bodies involved in <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to have to disappoint your lordships that you are not to hear my noble friend and distinguished namesake lord rochester as a misprint on the list of speakers might suggest <e> <s> i hope that your lordships will be ready to accept that anyone speaking from these benches at the beginning of a new session of parliament when the gracious speech directs our attention to the future naturally hesitates before first looking back to the events of the summer and to the silly season in the media and the press which followed it <e> <s> but those of your lordships who have followed the attempts to suggest that church and state are moving towards a confrontation may even be surprised that i still speak from these traditionally independent benches and not with my back to the wall on the opposite side of the house <e> <s> if the church of england is not the tory party at prayer it is also not the alliance at communion or the labour party in meditation <e> <s> the delicate balance that a proper relationship between church and state requires is certainly not helped if entirely unrelated if unhappily coinciding events are magnified out of all proportion to their importance <e>", "<cs> my lords in the debate on the address earlier this month i ventured to point out that there was no mention in the gracious speech of community and race relations and i said that i felt this was particularly unfortunate because the british nationality act comes into operation on st january next year and there is still much anxiety in certain places about its implementation as other noble lords have indicated tonight <e> <s> in his reply to that debate the noble lord lord elton in acknowledging my concern for confidence in our society on the part of what he called its minority members assured me that the party for which he spoke is founded upon the principle that we are one nation <e> <s> he went on to assert with some firmness that her majestys government remain unshakable in their support of that principle <e>", "<cs> i said no such thing my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of the requirement on every local authority to produce an agreed syllabus for religious education may i ask the minister what encouragement and what additional resources are the government giving to the authorities to implement such syllabuses throughout the whole of the maintained sector of education <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may be allowed to intervene very briefly before the minister replies <e> <s> much has been said about the importance of the dartford tunnel to through traffic and the noble lord lord tordoff referred to the undesirability of such largely heavy traffic taking

very heavy <e> <s> there is a surprising number of people who live in kent and work in essex and <e>", "<cs> my lords in the absence of my right reverend friend the bishop of derby i should like to speak from these benches and to associate ourselves with what the noble lord lord mishcon has just said <e> <s> first i should like to express our very special thanks to the noble lord for the way in which he has carried the bill through the house and not least for the assurance which he gave us in response to the amendment moved by the right reverend prelate the bishop of derby without which i

with the assurance that the governors will be given a firmer voice on that matter we were very happy to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> i hope too that the bill will now go forward and become law before long <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches should like to thank the noble lord lord elton for repeating the statement <e> <s> we are grateful that among the five points that he picked out was the question of the maintenance of standards <e> <s> we shall look forward to hearing the ways in which these are to be maintained and the way in which the new authority is to be appointed and is to work and to hearing about its relationships with the corporation <e>", "<cs> my lords as the first speaker from these benches i should like to thank the noble baroness lady young for her comprehensive speech and to wish her every success and happiness in her important new post at the foreign office at the same time joining with other noble lords in thanking her for her service to the whole house during the last session when she was our leader <e> <s> i have a feeling that she would probably echo the views of the noble lord the chief whip who was overheard to say in my diocese

expressed the hope that we would look in committee at some of the alternative options that the law commission themselves considered before recommending a one-year bar with no exceptions <e> <s> i am therefore very glad that we are now looking at four of those options simultaneously <e> <s> i would remind your lordships again that the law commission themselves said in their report <e>", "<cs> my

words of todays psalm spoke the truth from his heart <e> <s> he never wasted time or words and he was a consistent guardian of the rights of minority groups in your lordships house <e> <s> we greatly regret the suddenness of his passing <e> <s> we should like to express to his colleagues on the opposite bench and to the members of his family the assurance of our sympathy and our prayers at this

with what has been said <e> <s> we had a great regard for lord bishopston who served as second church estates commissioner <e> <s> he was spokesman on the other side on ecclesiastical matters speaking only recently in a debate <e> <s> we should like to acknowledge his kindness and charity and the very real distinction which he brought to this house and we too convey our sympathy to his widow and four daughters <e>", "<cs> my lords in the unavoidable absence of the right reverend prelates the bishops of london and southwark it falls to me to take part in this debate because one-third of my diocese is in the greater london area <e> <s> the right reverend prelate the bishop of wakefield will be speaking later with reference to the metropolitan counties in the north of england <e>", "<cs>

campus and because of the pressure on accommodation in canterbury have to live all over east kent and beyond <e> <s> the cost of daily travel for them can be over a year which is as much as or more

archbishop of canterbury the scottish moderator the english and scottish cardinals and the secretary of the british council of churches have just issued a statement expressing their profound thankfulness for the escape from assassination of the prime minister and other ministers of the crown their heartfelt sympathy for those bereaved or injured and their admiration of the work done by

session of parliament and if i may say so this afternoon the only one left on these benches who is proud to be a macmillan bishop i should like to thank the minister for her comprehensive and perceptive speech and to assure her and her majestys government that we share their concern for peace and justice and for the solution of so many of the problems which confront them in so many different parts of the world <e>", "<cs> my lords in her gracious speech from the throne at the beginning of this session of parliament her majesty the queen said <e>", "<cs> my lords i was quoting from sir john lawrences book published by chatham house last year <e> <s> what i said was a direct quotation from him <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches understand fully the reasons for the

speech and for the way in which he made it clear to the house that he understood the fears the undoubted fears of the voluntary organisations in certain parts of london <e> <s> i should like to thank him for the assurance that he has given the house that his door will remain open i think that was the phrase he used and that the process will be carefully monitored in the months and years ahead <e>

speech that we have just heard from the noble lord lord caradon with the unique and distinguished contribution that he has made to the united nations for the whole of its years <e> <s> perhaps i may say that for <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join those who have welcomed this announcement <e> <s> i am particularly grateful to the minister for the assurance he has given us in response to

will give an assurance that there will be access points well away from kent because the last thing we want is a greater concentration of traffic building up outside cheriton <e>", "<cs> my lords i think this refers to the fact that all the legal fees payable by a bishop for all kinds of services provided by the legal officers such as the installation of first dignitaries and so on are not paid by the bishop personally but by the church commissioners on his behalf <e> <s> the clause on which the noble lord has picked merely puts that on the record so that any fees that the archbishop or bishop has been required to pay are reimbursed to him by the church commissioners in the perfectly normal way <e>", "<cs> my lords i should first like to say how grateful we are on these benches for the leadership that has been given from all the front benches of this house including that of the cross-benches in the protracted debates that we have had during this deeply divisive bill <e> <s> we

very strongly on this matter <e> <s> i feel sure that it is both necessary and right to single out race relations for special treatment in this bill <e> <s> the promotion of good relations is already enshrined in the race relations act <e> <s> surely we must make sure that this local government bill is consistent with that act and we must be careful to see that any new legislation does not run the

listened to him with the greatest pleasure <e>", "<cs> my lords we are dealing in this bill with what i believe is one of the cherished inheritances of our country the maintenance of the queens peace

ago when the law had to be strengthened in section of the public order act to deal with the political dissent on the streets of london which led to grievous violence at that time <e> <s> i do not

undertaking that where the recommendation was not that the building should go to the fund they would make further effort to find an alternative use and would engage in further <e>", "<cs> my understanding is that the consultation with the secretary of state would be what has been referred to elsewhere in the debate tonight on the making of funds available for the purpose by an additional grant to enable what the secretary of state wishes to happen <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding is that the agreement with the government is that in such circumstances there would be further consultation with the secretary of state before using the pastoral measures powers to demolish <e> <s> i think i am right in saying that the minister went on to say that he proposed to make further inquiries with the intention that they should be broadened in consultation with the church commissioners before any actual implementation took place <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord lord kennet will feel that the concordat in fact provides what he wants <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the question is that they will become clergy <e> <s> whether there will have to be an adjustment in the

grateful to the representative of the opposition who spoke and to the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter to whom i am always ready to listen when he speaks as a churchwarden <e>", "<cs> however my lords i do wonder whether the noble lord lord soper and others perhaps really want to revive talk of disestablishment which would mean a public disavowal of the christian faith <e> <s> some of us on these benches so much prefer to work toward a broadening of the establishment and i believe that there are those in the free churches who would be happy to recognise the sovereign as supreme governor as we do <e>", "<cs> my lords like the last speaker i am most grateful to the noble viscount lord buckmaster for providing us with this opportunity to comment on the continuing chaos and horror of events in
