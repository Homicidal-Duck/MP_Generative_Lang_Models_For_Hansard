["<cs> i should like to intervene here and to refer as the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey suggested might be done to the thomson committees report in this matter concerning the substitution of four for six hours <e> <s> the thomson committee and i may say here that the noble lord before he went to the bar was an apprentice of mine in edinburgh considered that a period of up to hours might be thought of <e> <s> they then reduced that to hours but revised their conclusions and said that six should be the maximum <e> <s> that is what appears in the bill <e>", "<cs> would it not be better to substitute a sheriff for a high court judge <e> <s> there are plenty of precedents <e>", "<cs> bearing in mind that at this stage in the proceedings we are dealing with a reluctant detainee in my view the taking of fingerprints will be desirable because it could hasten the identification of a guilty detainee on the one hand or exculpate the innocent on the other <e> <s> secondly may i again refer to the late lord thomsons report <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey said something about what this report had to say in paragraph but he did not say that the committee thought that the invasion of the person involved in fingerprinting it was limited to fingerprinting was so slight as to be outweighed by the usefulness of the information provided <e> <s> in those circumstances i cannot accept this amendment <e>", "<cs> it may be of interest to your lordships to have the view of the law society of scotland to which the noble lord lord ross of marnock has just referred <e> <s> i do not think it is right to say that they were diametrically opposed to this clause <e> <s> the council appreciate that the proposal for an intermediate diet between the pleading diet and the trial diet in summary proceedings is intended to deal with situations where accused persons plead guilty on or just before the day of their trial causing inconvenience to witnesses and a waste of the time of judges solicitors prosecutors and others <e> <s> at the same time the council do not see how this proposal will improve the present situation <e>", "<cs> my lords we all know that crimes of violence in scotland are on the upgrade <e> <s> mugging attacks and acts of violence are prevalent to the extent that innocent citizens are afraid to walk abroad in certain areas by day or by night for fear of being assaulted and robbed <e> <s> these attacks are often made by youths carrying and using offensive weapons such as knives which can wound disfigure or even kill <e> <s> we look to the police to give us protection against such assaults but the police cannot give protection unless we give them adequate powers to carry out their duties <e>", "<cs> having heard the ministers reply for which i am very grateful i concur with my noble friend lord campbell of croy in saying that we should like to take this amendment away and consider his <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that very welcome statement <e> <s> i am very happy to do what he wants and on condition that he brings forward an amendment at the next stage of the bill i am happy to withdraw this amendment <e> <s> before doing so for the record i think i should say that i am not chairman of the british legion scotland though i was some years ago <e> <s> i thank noble lords for their contributions <e> <s> i have not heard any voices from any side of the house against the amendment and therefore on the undertaking given by the minister i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords it only remains for me to express my gratitude to the noble earl lord avon for having introduced this amendment which is not in exactly the same terms but expresses the same sentiment and principle as i did in my amendment <e> <s> it is slightly differently worded by parliamentary draftsmen on his side <e> <s> it is in a different place in the clause but it is of equally good effect <e> <s> in particular it carries forward the reference to the disablement pensioners and war widows which is the essential point that i wanted <e> <s> it only remains for me therefore to thank him and other noble lords on all sides of the house who supported me at report stage and to assure the noble earl lord gainsborough that i am sure the english legion and other ex-service organisations will be able to take advantage of this benefit which scotland has had for some time <e>"]
