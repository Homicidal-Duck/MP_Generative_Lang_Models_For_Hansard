["<cs> my lords i rise as a member of the sub-committee of the select committee responsible for this report to support the noble lord lord obrien of lothbury who assisted the noble lord lord plowden in the conduct of this inquiry and who has inherited the task of presenting this report to your lordships <e> <s> he has done so with his accustomed clarity and thoroughness and leave me with little more to do than put a few glosses on what he has said <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord jenkins of putney for raising this matter but perhaps he will forgive me if i do not follow him in what i venture to call his more tongue in cheek flights of fancy <e> <s> like my noble friend lord caccia i have no first-hand knowledge of the recent dealings and negotiations between the two governments but as far as i can tell the relationship has been very well managed on our side in the last three or four years with one exception to which i shall return <e> <s> therefore i do not propose to say much about current issues except perhaps that far from being afraid that the americans will get us involved in another war my concern is rather that they might become disenchanted with their european allies and begin to weaken the links which at present guarantee the security of ourselves and our european friends <e> <s> therefore if your lordships can bear a few glimpses of the obvious i shall briefly sketch part of the changed and changing background in the united states which inevitably shapes and conditions the relationship between our two governments <e>", "<cs> my lords i was unable to take part in the debate in your lordships house on th december because i had not then read the hetherington-chalmers report <e> <s> i have now read it carefully <e> <s> i have also read the debate which took place in december and have listened to most of the speeches today <e> <s> i should like in a couple of minutes to indicate my position on the bill <e>"]
