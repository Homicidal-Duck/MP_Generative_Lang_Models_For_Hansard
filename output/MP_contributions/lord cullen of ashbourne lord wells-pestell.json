["<cs> my lords as the noble lord the minister has said the order is technical and is mainly if not entirely an administrative convenience <e> <s> i do not think that any useful purpose would be served by my attempting to cross the noble lords ts and dot his is <e> <s> i am grateful to him for drawing our attention to this crucial matter <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the minister for his statement relating to the three orders now before your lordships house <e> <s> i am not unmindful of the fact that this house has several more hours work before it nor do i forget that i have already made two comments about these very matters on previous occasions since the coming into office of the new government and so i do not propose to go over that ground today nor to ask the minister any questions <e> <s> however i am sure that he would be the first to recognise that i too would wish to take the opportunity to register our concern at certain features of the matters that he has mentioned <e> <s> obviously we welcome the up-rating but as i have said previously we are very disturbed that these and future increases are to be tied to prices not wages <e> <s> i know the governments arguments on these matters but i have in mind the effect of rising prices and the serious increase in inflation which many of us believe will take effect as soon as november of this year let alone in the succeeding months <e> <s> the noble lord mentioned an increase of inflation to per cent <e> <s> by november <e> <s> i hope that it is no more than that but we are fearful that it may well be and we feel that the government ought to have been a little more mindful than they seem to have been of that eventuality <e>", "<cs> my lords there is not much i want to say beyond thanking the noble lord the minister for giving such a detailed and fairly simple explanation of the position <e> <s> i do not find myself very much at variance with it because the principle involved is very much in keeping with the thinking of the last government and although the figures may differ a little what is proposed runs parallel with what we had in mind <e> <s> therefore i approve of the order and give it support <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to thank the noble lord the minister for putting the position so succinctly and so clearly <e> <s> obviously we on this side of the house welcome the additional p as a premium to lone parents but i think the noble lord will understand me when i say that it is really inadequate when one recognises what will be the inflation rate which i think is accepted by all people at the present moment and not least by his own government <e> <s> the p will be absorbed almost immediately it comes into effect as a result of the increase in the cost of living and when the noble lord says that they want to do a great deal for children and it is only a question of money that prevents it i would ask him not that i want a reply to this whether there can be <e>", "<cs> my lords once again we are grateful to the noble lord for his explanation <e> <s> i am fairly familiar with this kind of situation <e> <s> however in the noble lords opening remarks he used the phrase <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that your lordships will be as grateful as i am to the noble lord the minister for placing the order before us and explaining it <e> <s> i do not want in any way to argue about the amounts of increase <e> <s> i recognise that with increased benefits and so on it is necessary from time to time to increase contributions all the way round <e> <s> however what i am concerned about and wish to call to the attention of your lordships is the report of the government actuary <e> <s> he says that he has been instructed to assume for the benefit of the compilation of these matters that in there will be about unemployed and that does not include school-leavers <e> <s> in fact he is asked to assume that there will be in addition to that figure about unemployed youngsters <e> <s> it is perhaps the first time that the government have acknowledged that there is going to be a very serious increase in unemployment and i believe that we ought to remember what the government actuary says <e>"]
