["<cs> my lords i must begin by apologising to the noble lord lord elton who is due to reply to this debate for the fact that it is very unlikely that i shall be here to hear what he says because i am afraid there is an aeroplane which i must attempt to catch tonight and the debate had already gone on for longer than certainly i expected <e> <s> i should also like to congratulate the noble duke the duke of abercorn on his excellent maiden speech which i for one thoroughly enjoyed and thought was of great value <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord dunleath for the opportunity to discuss the security situation in northern ireland once again <e> <s> we have had as he said over years of terrorism <e> <s> we have had over people dead <e> <s> many of them were members of the security forces even more were perfectly ordinary civilians <e> <s> against this background of years of terrorism i am afraid that it is very unlikely that any of us tonight can make any suggestion that is going to bring about its immediate end <e> <s> it is certainly an opportunity to emphasise through her majestys government how long this has been going on and those of us who live there feel that it has been going on far too long and to say again to her majestys government that if anything worth while can be put forward the vast majority of people in northern ireland are prepared to put up with almost any inconvenience to bring this thing quickly to an end <e> <s> having said that it is true to say that of course the security situation is a great deal better than it was <e> <s> i have come to this house on many occasions when there has been nothing but a stream of incidents reported on every local news day after day <e> <s> now thank goodness those incidents are very much fewer but unhappily those that take place are usually very much more lethal <e>", "<cs> my lords what the noble viscount says is perfectly true <e> <s> there are people godfathers if you like directing many of the acts of violence who manage to remain immune to the law <e> <s> but personally i still take the view that whatever form of detention internment or call it what you like is brought in it will still provide once again a cause for the catholic community <e> <s> one would see violence on the streets again on exactly the same scale as it was in the early s <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like first to offer my warm congratulations to the noble lord lord hunt of tanworth on a really excellent maiden speech <e> <s> with his very distinguished background one certainly expected that we would get a good one <e> <s> in fact it was an excellent speech one that was knowledgeable analytical contructive and helpful to us in northern ireland <e> <s> those of us who come from northern ireland will be very grateful to him for what he has said today and would offer the hope that he will take other opportunities to help us in our affairs <e> <s> i certainly offer to him my warmest congratulations <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to address a few remarks on the subject of unemployment in northern ireland <e> <s> i am told that at the moment unemployment is running at the highest rate since and to me against the background of our already serious security problems this is indeed a very serious matter <e> <s> it seems inevitable that if there is no work and no money for people some of them at any rate will get themselves involved in terrorism <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to start by offering my congratulations to the noble lord lord elton on his succession to the department of agriculture which has given many of us great pleasure <e> <s> we wish him well there and hope that he will have a profitable and enjoyable time <e> <s> i would add as an afterthought that i hope the farmers of northern ireland will also have a profitable and enjoyable time during his term of office there <e>", "<cs> my lords over the years there have been a great many discussions about new initiatives and solutions for the northern ireland problem both in your lordships house and elsewhere <e> <s> a good many indeed have already been mentioned today <e> <s> every one of them i am quite certain was produced as a genuine effort to be constructive <e> <s> i am afraid that it is probably going to be my lot to be somewhat discouraging today about some of the suggestions that have been made <e> <s> i want to say that i am doing it not in an attempt to be destructive because nobody would like to see peace restored in northern ireland more than i should <e> <s> i would say this i have said it many times in your lordships house and i say it again now <e> <s> no solution will come until terrorists are in fact defeated <e> <s> that is the only way in which a solution to the northern ireland problem will arise <e> <s> the reason for it is perfectly simple <e> <s> politics community relationships whatever you like to call it are so polarised at the moment that there just is no hope of compromise between the two communities and between the various political leaders <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords who have spoken before me i should like to thank the noble earl for the way in which he introduced this bill and for the excellent assessment that he gave of the state of affairs in northern ireland <e> <s> but saying that is not going to prevent me from being perhaps a little critical of the northern ireland office <e> <s> i have no fault to find with the bill itself or very little the fault i have to find is with the timing <e> <s> at this moment i just cannot believe that it is going to be given a chance to work even when royal assent has been achieved <e>", "<cs> i should like to add my voice to that of the noble lord lord donaldson and say that i too am opposed to the idea of a referendum <e> <s> a referendum is very much the same as another election and in northern ireland we already have far too many elections <e> <s> we have an election to another place we are to have an election to an assembly we have local government elections and we have the constitutional referendum <e> <s> every single one of them always puts up the temperature <e> <s> sooner or later every single one of them degenerates into a sort of sectarian slanging match <e> <s> it does nothing for the peace of the place and is of very little benefit to anyone added to which every extra form of election is an additional burden on the police and army from the security point of view <e> <s> so for that reason alone i would be very much against another referendum added to the list of elections <e> <s> but surely to goodness once there has been an election to the assembly it will be absolutely plain to the electorate why they are electing representatives and it does not seem to me that one needs to have it rubber-stamped yet again after the assembly has reached a decision <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by offering my congratulations to the noble earl on his appointment to the northern ireland office <e> <s> i hope that he will have a very interesting and rewarding time <e> <s> even more strongly i hope that we in northern ireland will benefit from his wise advice and ministrations <e> <s> i owe the noble earl i am afraid a number of apologies <e> <s> first time has marched on <e> <s> i shall probably have to leave before the noble earl replies to the debate as i have to catch an aeroplane fairly soon <e> <s> i hope the noble earl will also forgive me for not having given him notice of what i intend to say <e>", "<cs> my lords from the outset i shall be honest and say that i am afraid i cannot find it in my heart to give any warm welcome to the proposed anglo-irish agreement <e> <s> having said that i think i should make it plain that i am not here on a unionist party ticket <e> <s> i do not belong to either unionist party <e> <s> i am here simply as a law-abiding citizen of ulster who does not want to see confrontation conflagration or holocaust and i think that any one of those could occur over the next few weeks unless attitudes can be changed <e>", "<cs> my lords would not my noble friend agree that the biggest problem as regards northern ireland at the moment concerns the rumours lies and so on which are prevalent on all sides <e> <s> in the light of that would he say whether anything can be done to improve the governments information service so that these lies and rumours are countered at the time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord the minister for what he said in introducing the appropriation order <e> <s> i am afraid that i am not going to cover the wide field that he covered because the only thing in my mind at the moment and the only thing that is taking priority as far as i am concerned is trying to resolve the extremely unpleasant political situation that exists in northern ireland today as a result of the anglo-irish agreement <e> <s> i am not here to excuse or to condone in any way the events of march rd <e> <s> i was abroad at that time so that what i know about it is only second-hand but at the same time i know enough to know that it was an utterly deplorable day and probably did more harm to northern ireland than any other day in the course of my lifetime <e>", "<cs> my lords it was not my intention to say anything on this measure this evening but as i am perhaps the only person present who actually lives in northern ireland i should like to express and add my appreciation of the efforts of the ruc over the past <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for his explanation of the appropriation order <e> <s> i apologise to him in advance for the fact that i have not been able to give him notice of what i am about to say <e> <s> i hope and believe he will find it to be in such general terms that it will not set him a problem and i will certainly excuse him if i get no reply <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend for his introductory remarks and his explanation of the appropriation order <e> <s> i hope that it will not be taken as slightly frivolous against the events in northern ireland if i address my remarks this evening to the subject of salmon and salmon fishing <e> <s> it is an important subject because it is an important element of the tourist trade and it has a spin-off importance in many other fields <e>"]
