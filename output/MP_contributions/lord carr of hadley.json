["<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord lord wade and to congratulate him on bringing this bill before the house <e> <s> in this matter he does indeed show a truly biblical importunity <e> <s> i hope that in due course his prayers to your lordships will be answered in a favourable way <e> <s> i will certainly assist him in trying to bring about that result <e>", "<cs> my lords i will deal with that in a moment if the noble and learned lord wishes but perhaps i may pursue this point for a moment <e> <s> the third way is the one which is before us today the enactment of a bill of rights <e> <s> and the fourth i suppose is the adoption as in some other countries of a written constitution <e> <s> what i want to submit is that we need at the very least one of these measures and in my view preferably not less than two of them <e>", "<cs> yes my lords that is the fourth and i hope i have made clear to your lordships that i have considerable reservations about that <e> <s> but what we are considering today is the third namely the bill of rights and i do support it i repeat but i think it is the least effective of all those four <e> <s> although standing on its own it is better than nothing and that is why i wish to see the noble lord lord wade successful i cannot believe that its efficacy will be sufficient to meet all that is needed to allay my own growing concern which i suspect is shared by many people inside and outside parliament <e> <s> so in conclusion i wish to appeal to my noble and learned friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i do agree and this of course is one of the reasons why although i welcome this bill i am bound to say that it is the least of all the measures that i think necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to go into a long argument about the history but i have all the strike figures here in front of me <e> <s> i should like to ask the noble lord why despite what he has just said after that very brief apparent improvement after the labour government came to power and repealed the industrial relations act the trend of deterioration in our industrial relations including our strike record set in again even more acutely and with an even greater accelerating trend than before <e> <s> because that is what it did <e>", "<cs> my lords this is all very interesting <e> <s> i am at least glad that the noble lord now wants me to take figures net of mining <e> <s> i remember that when i used to do that in the late s i was severely reprimanded for so doing perhaps not by the noble lord lord mccarthy himself but by most of those who support him on that side of the house and in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree <e> <s> let me be quite clear <e> <s> any person in your lordships house or anywhere else who imagines that ballots are always going to lead to there being no strikes needs to think again <e> <s> that is not the point <e> <s> the point is that where the membership is to be consulted they should be properly consulted <e> <s> while i could perhaps criticise some aspects of the way in which the num conduct their ballots i can only wish that all unions did the same when faced with that sort of situation <e>", "<cs> i really think i should not because owing to giving way i have already spoken for five minutes more than i meant to and i am about to finish <e> <s> the trade union leadership of this country if they wish to maintain their present attitude on the acceptance of legal responsibility and liabilities must answer some fundamental questions in a positive way <e> <s> why do they need these present unique immunities and privileges in order to do their job for their members <e> <s> in other countries unions do not have them <e>", "<cs> they do not <e>", "<cs> no in sweden they do not <e> <s> they have certain important rights and it is a basically different approach <e> <s> if the trade union leadership of this country wish to carry the majority of the public with them in a free country it is necessary for the trade unions like anybody else to either <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to embark on a debate on unemployment <e> <s> i thought that the noble lord lord kaldor was moving into that area of an economic debate but i do not think that i had better follow him or the noble baroness at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> the only question that i should like to ask him is does he not think it would be right and proper for the musicians union in the case he has mentioned or the appropriate unions in other cases to be under a greater obligation to help to support their striking members <e> <s> that is surely in the best and oldest traditions of trade unionism <e>", "<cs> my lords first may i ask for your lordships indulgence <e> <s> i shall have to leave the house at about to take the chair at a dinner which was fixed long before the date of this debate <e> <s> i can only assure your lordships that it is not a social occasion and that i shall make a point of coming back after the dinner in the hope that i may just be in time to hear the winding up speeches <e>", "<cs> i cannot support the amendment because i do not like the idea of advisory members and i believe that it would be wrong <e> <s> however i am unhappy about the governments proposal <e> <s> as secretary of state for employment at the beginning of the s i had a considerable hand in the formulation of the idea of the manpower services commission although when it was implemented i had moved on elsewhere <e> <s> i am sure that the idea of parity was central to its acceptance and its working certainly far from perfectly but not too unsatisfactorily <e> <s> i believe that to disturb that parity would be detrimental and not helpful <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend confirm that he will give further and careful consideration to the matter <e> <s> i have no doubt that the intentions are extremely good <e> <s> however sometimes good intentions pave the road to an unacceptable place <e> <s> like a one-time permanent under-secretary to the home office i as a one-time home secretary am somewhat puzzled and concerned by what i have heard <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope i may urge my noble friend to accept the amendment which has been moved and supported <e> <s> to call out all the members of a union on strike is an enormously serious step first of all for the sacrifices demanded of the union members concerned and secondly for all members of the community who may be affected and usually also for the state of the national economy <e> <s> such a serious decision should not be taken except with an accurate ballot <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the government even if unable to accept either of these amendments in their exact form will agree to do something along the lines suggested by them <e> <s> the country has an interest in trade unions being effectively and efficiently managed <e> <s> looking at the position of a company the members of the company who are the shareholders elect the directors and the directors appoint managers advisers and employees <e> <s> if an employee is also a director he too must be subject to election <e> <s> the management of any large organisation would be in a chaotic state if those employees who were non-directors could appeal to shareholders above the heads of management chief executives and so on <e> <s> any chance of directing and managing such a company effectively and efficiently would be severely undermined <e> <s> i am sure that exactly the same principle applies to unions <e>", "<cs> my lords i should very briefly like to support the amendment of my noble friend lord renton <e> <s> my past career as a minister at various levels in various departments has been punctuated by moments of fury at the treasury trying to dictate in detail how i and my department should spend money that we have obtained in our vote <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say briefly to my noble friend that this is as he realises an extremely complicated matter <e> <s> if it is to work at all it must not get off to a muddy unclear start <e> <s> to have the short delay requested while the explanatory booklet can be percolated through to those who have to operate the clause and to give some training in what may be right and what may be wrong will help the smooth working of the governments intentions <e> <s> not to do so would be a case of more haste less speed <e>", "<cs> my lords i strongly supported the noble lord lord wyatt of weeford when he moved his amendment on report <e> <s> i felt at the time and still feel that the government made a serious mistake which they will eventually in practice come to regret no doubt they may well have to come back to parliament to correct that mistake in another years time in not at least taking the principle of that amendment looking at it and trying to redefine the kind of action that the noble lord lord wyatt had in mind in a more acceptable way <e>", "<cs> my lords once again i should like to urge the government most strongly to take action along the lines recommended in the amendment <e> <s> as i understand the governments policies in this area since one aim has been to democratise the trade unions <e> <s> i most strongly agree with that and support the government <e> <s> but another purpose has been to encourage the efficient management and administration of trade unions which i also strongly support and wish to encourage <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down may i ask him a question <e> <s> perhaps i did not make myself clear <e> <s> he like myself has had experience of being the chairman of a large company <e> <s> would he really be happy if one of his executives or advisers who was not a member of the board was directly elected by the members of the company and could as it were appeal to the popular vote over the heads of the elected board <e> <s> it might seem a remote possibility but it could happen <e> <s> if one is a member of a board or a principal executive one must be but if one is not one is under the control of the elected board <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby nearly always has something of interest to say that is a pleasure to hear <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not object at all to that interruption <e> <s> in so far as it goes my noble friend is quite right but that is not as far as it goes <e> <s> there is still the fact that when per cent <e> <s> of ones income or per cent <e> <s> as i believe it is in wales comes through central government it introduces whole fields of responsibility over which one has too little control <e>", "<cs> i do not enjoy differing seriously from my party and the government on any major issue <e> <s> i think that in years in parliament i have never voted against a three-line whip <e> <s> however one must be true to ones convictions on a major issue <e> <s> the imposition by the government of a tax which applies to every adult citizen in our community is in my view certainly a major issue <e> <s> i have to say that my strong conviction is that the community charge as at present drafted is wrong and is unacceptably unfair <e> <s> i must seek amendment to it and i cannot support it in its present form <e>", "<cs> would it not be possible for the noble lord to undertake on behalf of the government between now and report stage to consider the possibility of setting up an inquiry which i understand is necessary for the law to be changed in england and wales to match approximately that which already exists in scotland <e> <s> if the committee were to receive such an assurance i think some of us would be eased in our consciences about the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am not seeking an assurance of deliberate action but an assurance that the matter will be inquired into with reasonable dispatch over the next year or two <e> <s> i do not ask that any decision should be taken within the next few weeks <e>", "<cs> there are very important issues to be raised here <e> <s> i certainly wish to support not oppose the governments amendment but before i support it and certainly before one is prepared to be satisfied by it we need to get answers to questions which can only be raised by a proper discussion of amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it would not be satisfactory to be cut short <e> <s> i say that particularly as those of us concerned with this amendment made it clear in ways it is possible to make clear that this is a probing amendment that we did not wish to force to a division if only we could have the opportunity to raise the questions and get answers to them <e>", "<cs> i am sometimes tempted myself to use the old geometric proof of a <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say to my noble friend before he sits down that i will attempt perhaps also in writing to clarify my figures which arc difficult to put over in the course of a speech <e>", "<cs> i draw some encouragement from my noble friends last remarks and i shall certainly do all i can to co-operate with him as i am sure will others in the future consideration of this matter <e> <s> frankly following on from what the noble lord lord jenkin said i am not so much concerned about from where the help comes but that it should come from somewhere and that the government should not run away from the responsibility which they undertook in the setting up of the present grant system <e> <s> i indicated to my noble friend ahead of this amendment that it was at this stage a probing one <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that my noble friend the minister will be able to give the house more specific information about how needs are to be calculated by his department <e> <s> following an earlier debate i wrote to him about the situation in westminster <e> <s> i took westminster as an example and i raised it in a speech which i made a week or two ago in connection with an amendment moved by my noble friend lady gardner of parkes <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down certainly i am prepared to wait until tomorrow and the debate on westminster <e> <s> i just happened to be citing westminster as an example with which i am a little familiar but the point is a perfectly general one the need to give reassurance that these needs assessments are based on measured realities and not on theories <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that when a takeover is made largely with borrowed money the risks to the shareholders of both companies both of the bidding company and of the company being taken over are increased when the new entity has a very high gearing ratio <e> <s> would it not therefore enable the shareholders of both companies to make a better decision if the bidder were required to make a proper statement of his business strategy leading to the take-over bid <e>", "<cs> my lords there are many aspects of this bill about which i am tempted to speak not least perhaps the question of employees <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may ask the minister to give some further thought to this principle between now and report stage <e> <s> i draw an analogy from experience in another field <e> <s> for the greater part of the last decade until a year ago i have been intimately involved in helping to form local business partnerships in an attempt to tackle in the first place youth unemployment and then adult unemployment also and inner city problems <e> <s> that was first in my capacity as chairman for about four years of the cbi special programmes unit and for three years ending just over a year ago as chairman of an organisation called business in the community <e>", "<cs> i do not for one moment wish to press the point as to whether this is the right place or the right way in which to take action on this but i want to add my support to the principles contained in the amendment <e> <s> the amendment covers two points which i made in my speech on the second reading of this bill <e> <s> although i am quite prepared to accept that it would not be right to do it now and in this way i think we ought to have from the government if not now certainly before the bill completes its progress here some statement of their feelings on this matter <e> <s> very important matters of policy are concerned <e> <s> as many of us made clear on second reading when we were talking about mergers and monopolies all is far from well in this field <e> <s> if efforts are not made in whatever may be the appropriate way to clean up what is going on at the moment the whole market economy system could be brought into serious and growing disrepute <e>", "<cs> i should like to add a word of my own concern on this <e> <s> the minister quite rightly drew a distinction between merger control and regulation of takeovers <e> <s> that is a very valid and important distinction to make <e> <s> for that reason i would not wish to press this amendment tonight <e> <s> nor would i agree necessarily with the per cent <e> <s> figure in the first clause <e> <s> however having made that distinction the minister did in one sense what we wished him to do but in a way that was disturbing <e>", "<cs> i must very briefly support my noble friends <e> <s> i do not believe that i have the reputation at the moment anyway of being a yes man in support of the views of my noble friends on the front bench <e> <s> i believe most strongly that the governments view is right in this matter and that the amendment is wrong <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord mentioned my name perhaps i can be the first to go into bat on this side of the committee <e> <s> i have not received the cbi brief <e> <s> whether or not that is an oversight i am not sure <e> <s> i was on the council of the cbi for a good many years and also the chairman of two important committees or one unit of the cbi and i have a great regard for that organisation <e> <s> it does not mean that i share all its views but i have a great regard for the work that it does and the expertise it brings to bear on these matters <e> <s> i have not had the brief so i have no idea whether i shall be taking its line <e>", "<cs> thank you that is helpful so far as it goes <e> <s> one of the troubles with legislation that i have not got over yet is how one defines the term non-executive <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> dc says that one of the non-executive directors <e>", "<cs> of course the buck stops with the board and i stand corrected on that <e> <s> however when one is talking about the responsibilities of individuals i believe that in the end there is no individual in the company with whom the buck stops more clearly than with the chairman <e> <s> he is in a special position as regards stopping bucks if the going gets tough <e> <s> the other matter is how we are to stress in legislation this need for the cadre of non-executive directors also to be fully independent <e> <s> they could all be retired executives of the company <e> <s> i have known that position and i had some hand in changing it <e> <s> those people had worked very well in the company but i did not believe such appointments right in principle <e>", "<cs> i have said all i wish to say at the moment <e> <s> i am not saying it would be impossible but why have a separation there <e> <s> speaking as a one-time chairman of a large company if i cannot trust the chief executive to be a full member of a committee with two or three of his board colleagues albeit non-executive ones it does not seem to me that the company is in good shape or that the chairman is doing his job <e>", "<cs> having stayed here for this amendment at this time of night i shall not argue <e> <s> i should just like to say how strongly i support the amendment and how bitterly disappointed i should be if the government were to resist it <e>", "<cs> my lords that is slightly wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the date that is wrong <e>", "<cs> i too should like to support the amendment moved by my noble friend lord jenkin of roding <e> <s> there can be no doubt of the strength of general feeling that the burden of regulation and its enforcement is very much greater than many of us envisaged when the financial services act was being debated <e> <s> it is good to find that the government themselves have recognised and accepted this <e> <s> indeed that was not only shown by something that was said during our second reading debate on the bill but has also been proved by the consultative paper that has just been published <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend give us any even broad idea of the scale of detoxification treatment and how it has increased as i hope it has increased over the past years <e>", "<cs> my lords i should preface my question by declaring my interest as one of the vice-chairmen of the english national opera <e> <s> are my noble friend and the government aware that the english national opera company is not just the concern of the arts council as was said although it is an important concern of the council <e> <s> it was also the concern first of the greater london council and then most satisfactorily after the abolition of the glc of westminster city council <e> <s> it is the continuing help from westminster city council which is almost certainly removed from possibility by the local government act to which the noble baroness lady birk referred <e> <s> is my noble friend aware of that need and of the need to have some certainty about what is to happen because it is in the nature of an opera company that we have to make binding financial commitments several years ahead when engaging conductors singers and so forth <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend tell us whether there is any sign of much regional variation in the way in which these non-custodial powers are being used <e>", "<cs> my lords reverting to the narrow and specific point of the original question will my noble friend at least give us hope to think that we need not wait for a decision and implementation until legislation which will undoubtedly be necessary if more major changes are made to the system is introduced <e> <s> i am sure that the <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that in this dreadful and pressing affair the fact that action has been taken so quickly and that an inquiry is to go ahead without delay together with all the other reported intentions will bring much relief and be regarded as nuggets from which to take comfort in this business <e> <s> i should like to ask him one question only <e> <s> can he tell the house whether the terms of reference of the inquiry will permit it to examine and if necessary make recommendations about the ways in which in future in this country inquiries into serious allegations of miscarriage of justice take place <e> <s> although there may be much comfort taken from the way in which this matter has eventually been brought out there must also be very grave concern about the length of time that it has taken to bring it to this stage <e> <s> i feel that the methods used should be examined and if improvements can be suggested they should be made <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that all of us including myself want to see more collections but that some of us believe that it is even more important that the accuracy of delivery should be improved <e> <s> in the post collected in my flat over the weekend no fewer than letters should not have been delivered to me at all <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear that i have to add a similar rider to my speech because of an engagement that i made long before i knew that this debate would take place <e> <s> i hope that i do not have to leave as early as seven oclock <e> <s> i may not have to leave before the end though that is a possibility <e> <s> i too wish to speak only briefly but i wish to record most strongly my support for this bill <e> <s> i can be brief because the arguments for it have already been made <e> <s> they do not need repeating or indeed supplementing <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like most warmly to thank the noble lord lord hunter for giving us an opportunity to debate this subject today <e> <s> it is valuable that we should have it in advance of the inevitably more detailed and i fear more adversarial discussions on the bill when it comes before the house <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend confirm that the policy which he has just been defending whether right or wrong is the policy consistently pursued by all british governments of all parties for as long as i can remember <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may very briefly add my support to the purpose behind the amendment <e> <s> i supported the noble lord lord campbell of alloway the first time round last session <e> <s> i should have done so again had i been able to be here on the evening of th december <e> <s> i was disappointed at the governments reaction at that time <e> <s> i could use a stronger word than disappointed but i shall not <e> <s> however i felt that there was this one point of substance in their objection which the purpose behind the amendment corrects <e> <s> i very much hope therefore that the government will accept the amendment in principle taking note of the uncertainty that at present it contains and the need to put the uncertainty right presumably with some further amendment at report stage <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that however unsatisfactory the pay settlement system for the ambulance workers may appear this year it would be wrong in principle and in practice to alter that system without looking at the system of pay settlements if not throughout the whole public service at least throughout the health service <e> <s> it would be most unfair on other sectors of workers in the health service to make one <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may return somewhat nearer to the original question by asking my noble friend whether she will comment further on the alleged reduction in treatments referred to by the noble lord lord ennals <e> <s> can the minister say whether it is really a fact that the number of treatments has been reduced or rather that the number of patients staying overnight in hospitals has declined <e> <s> if it is the latter can the minister say whether we should expect that to happen because so much more treatment is now given on a without-stay basis <e>", "<cs> i should like briefly to add my voice to those members of the committee who stress the importance of part-time education <e> <s> i am convinced that if one looks ahead a few decades we <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that all your lordships would wish me first on behalf of us <e>", "<cs> my lords even if it is a matter of two regions that is not the way to proceed in my view <e> <s> i should like to see a rather different type of testing <e> <s> i conclude by making four summarised proposals <e> <s> first i wish to see the establishment of up to about independently managed hospitals <e> <s> some would be independently managed within the health service and others would be of the new independent trust hospital type <e> <s> at the same time i should also like to see established about gp budgeted practices <e> <s> i should like the secretary of state and all his colleagues and staff at every level to give those tests the greatest possible attention to ensure that they succeed to monitor them as they go along and to magnify their strong points and discover and correct their weak points <e> <s> they will have weak points as well as strong points and it is important by an adequate scale test to discover what they are fairly soon and to remove the bugs from the system before they spread nation-wide <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend replies i wonder whether one of its supporters can enlighten the committee as to the exact intention of the amendment <e> <s> i see much objection to reappointment of people within their own district <e> <s> i see no objection to their reappointment in other districts where a potential clash of interest and principles would not arise <e> <s> does the noble lord wish to ensure that a person not reappointed in one area is nonetheless qualified to be appointed to another authority in a different area <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord ennals seems to assign the main role of the new chief of research and development to one of evaluation <e>", "<cs> i thought that that was the strong point he made in his speech <e>", "<cs> i am glad to have that clarification <e> <s> i apologise to the noble lord if i misunderstood him <e> <s> while i would agree that evaluation of what is going on both in existing methods and in new methods might indeed be part of the role of the chief of research and development and his staff i could not accept for one moment that it would be anything like the only role or the main role or that he should occupy most of his time with it <e> <s> moreover i cannot accept that his role in <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend says any more and before the noble lord lord dainton makes up his mind what he wishes to ask the committee to do about the amendment i should like to add a few further thoughts <e>", "<cs> on two occasions on second reading at the beginning of this month and in the first of our short general debates at the beginning of september i have coupled strong support for the governments proposals in principle with strong warnings about the dangers of trying to proceed too rapidly and treading on ground without testing it as one goes along <e> <s> therefore i suspect it would be natural for the committee to imagine that i support this amendment <e>", "<cs> i must reiterate the warnings i have given on this very point that to embark upon this market principle a principle which i wholly support and want to see implemented as quickly as possible without adequate preparation could do the utmost damage to the whole principle <e> <s> i must repeat what i think i said earlier <e> <s> a few weeks ago i had a long conversation with the chairman of a district authority who believes in the principle he is already preparing for it but who sees the greatest danger to it if he is forced to introduce it before he is ready and as at the moment he cannot see how he can be ready by next april <e> <s> all he said was dont let us have this deadline date hanging over our heads <e> <s> let us get ready as soon as possible <e> <s> if we can be ready by st february let us start on st february but dont make us start on st april if we are not ready <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down i wonder whether he could promise us a little more information <e> <s> if i understood him aright he said that the report in <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to have to intervene again <e> <s> however we want to know whether what mr freeman said yesterday means something new or not <e> <s> we know and i fully support the belief that these reforms will assist in regard to the urgent need which the noble baroness emphasises <e> <s> did or did not the words used yesterday imply that there would be some reduction of present movement of that kind <e> <s> if so it is serious <e> <s> i think that they probably did not but neither of us know it <e>", "<cs> if i am honest i am not sure whether i do or do not support this amendment <e> <s> like the noble lord lord kilmarnock who has just spoken i observe several ideas in the arena but i am not sure which is the right one or whether any of them is right in its present form <e> <s> we have the accreditation idea the hmi idea and we also have the initiative between the secretary of state and the royal colleges <e> <s> we are to have more <e> <s> i am not yet sure what the right answer is <e> <s> however i feel sure that there is a great need to assure the public at large that is all patients of the health service both <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord advises the committee what he wishes to do about his amendment and i hope that he will not press it to a division at this stage of the bill i must say to my noble friend that i cannot be wholly satisfied with the way in which she replied to the debate <e> <s> of course i accept and i hope that all noble lords accept that the intention of the government is to put quality at the top of the list <e> <s> i do not doubt that for one moment <e> <s> however i have a feeling in my bones that in a matter as vital as health care there needs to be a genuinely independent element in the supervision of the service <e>", "<cs> my lords i am distinctly nervous about the effects of the amendment if carried <e> <s> while i agree most strongly that some of those who are appointed to these authorities should have the kind of experience that is described in the amendment i also believe it is of immense importance that there should be others who are completely fresh and with entirely independent experience <e> <s> we need a mixture of people <e> <s> as i assume is the case with other noble lords i am speaking about the non-executive members of these authorities <e> <s> i believe that the non-executive members should constitute a mixture of those with the kind of experience that is mentioned here <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down can he clarify what he has said <e> <s> at one moment he talked of persons among those non-executives appointed <e> <s> i am in agreement on that point but i believe that his amendment means that all those persons appointed should have relevant service within the national health service <e> <s> if he intends to divide the house it would be helpful if he would make clear whether he means what the amendment seems to me to mean or whether he means something different <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to intervene again but the noble lord uses the word desirability <e> <s> is it not also highly desirable that other people should be appointed to bring in entirely new experience <e> <s> the desirability that is expressed at present is an exclusive one <e> <s> i fear that i must object to that and vote against the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i support amendment no <e> <s> and its objective <e> <s> i do not want to repeat the remarks made by the noble lord lord hunter with which i agree <e> <s> my personal objective in supporting the amendment is to ensure that the director of research and development a new officer in the health service and through him a new management board proposed in the national health service should have available to them information and advice on the widest possible basis in the field of research and development <e> <s> i therefore pay particular attention to the importance of the words at the end of subsection of the amendment which refers to <e>", "<cs> my lords i am supporting the amendment but i am doing that which i believe is traditional and common practice both in your lordships house and in another place i am tabling a probing amendment <e> <s> in the previous debates i have not heard enough to satisfy me that the input of advice in quantity and breadth through the director to the top management of the health service will be of the kind that i believe to be desirable <e> <s> if i cannot be satisfied regarding that matter then i shall vote for the amendment <e> <s> if i can be satisfied in a way which i have not been satisfied before i shall not wish to vote for the amendment because it will be unnecessary <e> <s> that is not because i disapprove of it but because the amendment will not be necessary <e> <s> the objective might be achieved in other ways if the appointment is set up with the right terms of reference <e>", "<cs> my lords i support this government amendment <e> <s> it is a most important development <e> <s> i know that it was not easy to arrive at and i congratulate both the minister and those involved on bringing it forward <e> <s> i do not want to propose anything that would upset that <e> <s> i pay attention to the need for the body to have the right initiative <e> <s> i also believe that it should report regularly <e> <s> however i do not quite understand why that should not be set out in the amendment <e> <s> i am perfectly content with the quite clear assertions from the front bench that the group will have the power of initiative and that it will report <e> <s> nevertheless i should prefer to see this provision in writing although i shall not press the point provided the minister can assure us that there is no doubt that the body does have the right to take such initiatives and that it will report <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down perhaps she will make the issue as regards reporting a little clearer <e> <s> i have served as secretary of state in more than one department <e> <s> i recollect that there were various bodies associated with the departments of which i was secretary of state which made annual reports <e> <s> i cannot remember there being any way in which they stood between me and my accountability to parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment which i joined the noble lord lord hunter of newington in tabling <e> <s> as your lordships will be aware in various debates on the bill i like other noble lords have made clear the great importance that i attach to the assurance of quality <e> <s> the maintenance of quality is above all the responsibility of the management of the nhs as it is of any organisation <e> <s> unless the management is almost obsessively dedicated to putting quality at the top of its list of priorities no independent outside body will achieve that aim <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that there has been no time during the past years during the life of the health service when it would not have been possible to bring before your lordships examples of the kind given today <e> <s> i do not ask my noble friend to agree that nothing should be brought forward but it may be helpful if good cases as well as bad cases are advanced so that we can thereby put the argument in balance <e>", "<cs> my lords at every stage of this bill and in the debates before it i have always coupled my continuing very strong support for the principles of this bill with warnings about the dangers of going forward too fast <e> <s> however despite that i wish most strongly to oppose the amendment that the noble lord has just moved <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope my noble friends on the front bench will be seized of the great importance of this subject <e> <s> both the availability of open access to clinics and the fact that they should be undeniably associated with confidentiality are factors of great importance for the future health of this country in many areas <e> <s> i am afraid i have not had time to reread what was said on th june <e> <s> however i recall that while i was quite satisfied with the desire and the determination of the government to provide both open access clinics and confidentiality i felt that the statement of good intent did not go far enough in order to give the assurance which is needed <e> <s> one must remember that the people who want to use these clinics will to a large extent be deeply suspicious about whether <e>", "<cs> my lords i have now heard that argument several times <e> <s> every time i hear the case made by the noble baroness lady darcy de knayth and by the noble baroness lady masham i feel that it becomes stronger <e> <s> every time i hear my noble friends on the front bench resisting it i feel that their case becomes weaker <e> <s> i simply do not understand why a government who have as one of their main principles to help people to stand on their own feet and manage their own lives should so obstinately refuse the amendment <e> <s> even at this last stage i beg the government to give way <e>", "<cs> my lords the clinical standards advisory group whose powers and functions we once more seek to amend was one of the glimmers of hope of what might have been in the bill i am sorry to have to say what i now say but i shall say it nonetheless if only the government had been a little more prepared to listen to opinions other than their own <e> <s> i welcome the group because it is a great deal better than nothing <e> <s> it is a great move forward <e> <s> it seems a pity that there is this grudgingness around the edge <e> <s> i believe that at some point in the future that will be changed <e> <s> it seems a pity that we cannot have a little more give now <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend confirm that in many areas of this country where there are bodies such as local enterprise agencies a movement to which the government have given a great deal of support the rate of failure of new small businesses has been about halved in recent years <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that as well as considering the numbers on waiting lists it is important to consider the number of operations which are carried out <e> <s> can she give any figures as to the increase in the number of operations since the two are closely related <e>", "<cs> my lords before i comment on the report i must add to the praise already given to my noble friend lord aldington for his role as chairman of the sub-committee conducting this inquiry and to our clerk and advisers <e> <s> this year has been my first experience of participating in a scrutiny of european community affairs by your lordships house <e> <s> it has been an honour to be so involved and it was a pleasurable and stimulating experience particularly the inquiry leading to this report <e> <s> i am sure though it is not necessary to say this that all members of your lordships house understand that the high degree of regard which i believe our committees scrutiny has achieved not only in your lordships house but far beyond it and outside the shores of this country is due more than anything else to the skill and dedication of those who chair the inquiries and those who serve the inquiries as clerks and advisers <e>"]
