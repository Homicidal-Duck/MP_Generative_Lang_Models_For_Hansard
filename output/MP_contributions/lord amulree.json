["<cs> my lords in view of the lateness of the hour and the very large number of people who want to speak i propose to cut my remarks down as much as possible but on behalf of noble lords on these benches i should like to say that we are in general agreement with the bill which the noble lord lord nugent of guildford has put forward <e> <s> it will obviously save a great many injuries to people <e> <s> i agree that it is difficult to remember to use a seat belt <e> <s> when i reach the end of a journey i very rarely find that i have been wearing my seat belt <e> <s> it is beside me i do not wear it not because i disapprove of it but simply because it has not crossed my mind to do so <e> <s> i believe that if the wearing of seat belts were made compulsory that would be a better way of getting people to wear them <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i should like to support the motion that the right reverend prelate has moved <e> <s> i hope that it will be agreed to by your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support what the right reverend prelate has said and to support the motion <e>"]
