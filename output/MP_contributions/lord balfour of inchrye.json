["<cs> my lords my first words must be to congratulate the government upon their formation and to wish them well <e> <s> when one surveys the problems that they have i believe that congratulations

courteous considerate treatment of his opponents as much as of his supporters <e>", "<cs> may i ask the minister two questions my lords <e> <s> in july we signed bermuda ii which gave bilateral agreement as regards certain of our cities and certain cities in america with access for american aircraft to our cities and for our aircraft to american cities <e> <s> which has paramountcy the bermuda ii agreement or the federal aviation administration in america <e> <s> it appears to me that the american action is in breach of the bermuda ii agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel grateful

unpleasant and we are going to have a lot more unpleasantness in every direction <e> <s> that is largely because we inherited from the party opposite an economic position which intensified by the

for it is clear that i should have added wales as has been forcefully pointed out to me by various noble lords <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the minister for that reply may i ask whether he is aware that norway iceland ireland and canada have already updated their conservation legislation in order to meet the increasing danger from new technology to the diminishing stocks in in-season

extinction of salmon <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for his

disputed position of the whole fishing policy within the eec the offence would have to be dealt with under community law and therefore be referred to the european court for that preliminary hearing

government paper published many months ago which visualized gatwick accepting up to million passengers with a second terminal how on earth can a single runway deal with the movements in and out of an airport which will have million passengers going through it <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the minister for that reply may i ask whether he is aware of the appreciation felt i believe by members of all sides of the house of the efforts which ministers here in particular the noble lord lord soames have made to ensure that some major bills are started in this house <e> <s> furthermore will not the government decision which was insisted upon by the opposition in another place to take the local government bill first in the commons and then here seriously increase the risk of a july log-jam <e> <s> in order to ease this possibility will the government consider a really formidable

running gatwick with million passengers a year passing through and only a single runway <e> <s> it is of course a controversial issue <e> <s> may i secondly ask him whether he can appeal to the noble earl the leader of the house to give us an opportunity of debating this matter at a fairly early date and not necessarily abide by the custom that this house does not touch a particular subject until

sides of the house and should be debated without long delay <e>", "<cs> my lords it falls to me to have the privilege <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend this question will the minister give an assurance that when north sea quotas come to be considered the atlantic salmon has some representation it has been entirely neglected so far by those considering quotas particularly as of the nine eec countries only three produce any salmon and the other six are avid consumers and will therefore need a lot of persuading in order to agree to preservation measures <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel sure that all your lordships would wish to share in the gratitude that i should like to express to the noble lord lord clifford of chudleigh for raising this important matter <e> <s> i should also

financial manpower technical rhodesia though our smallest partner in that great enterprise never failed to be in the forefront of assent and help to this country and that we owe them a debt that we can never repay in full <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the minister for his reply and ask him whether he is aware that this decision will bring great relief to air crews <e> <s> they have for many years had to operate in and out of gibraltar under severe spanish restrictions and often <e>", "<cs> my

programmes as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the mover for making this clear <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether from now on scheduled airlines and charter companies will operate from the new airport and not from this airport at which the aircraft which crashed was attempting to land and which is admitted to be particularly in bad weather one of the most unsatisfactory

increasing the number of birds in schedule the blackheaded gull is nevertheless a species which is steadily reducing in number and which deserves special consideration in the circumstances which my noble friend lord haig has outlined <e> <s> the amendment is necessary because it is one of those cases where theory does not work in practice <e> <s> in theory the blackheaded <e>", "<cs> my lords is

my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say in thanking the minister for that reply that at the end of it i am not quite sure whether the proposal is or is not to do away with the traditional british passport in blue with gold lettering which has been carried all over the world by tens of thousands of citizens with pride and confidence <e> <s> further on this matter does the minister not think it about time that the eec bureaucrat enthusiasts for standardisation in all forms of our national life should be curbed <e> <s> we have already heard about the proposals to do away

more faith in future action of the eec in a reasonable course of time than i have <e> <s> i only hope that i am wrong and that he is right <e> <s> secondly i cannot quite agree with him about the danger that my noble friend lord campbell of croy dealt with the danger of having sectional interests because you already have sectional interests in the set-up of the authority <e> <s> you have certain representatives of the fishing industry and you have certain representatives of consumers <e> <s> what i am now suggesting is that there should not be an executive such as is put forward in the bill for those interests but that there should be a watching brief <e> <s> however if my noble friend feels that that is not desirable while i retain my view i am afraid i have no option but to ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the minister for that reply may i ask him whether he will go this far will he confirm that although economies may have to be made in the concorde programme nevertheless the concorde achievement which has put britain into the first world place in supersonic travel will not be abandoned <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend to say whether in connection with this important scheme the government have obtained the co-operation and assistance of all the trade unions individually and collectively because that is a matter of the greatest importance for the success of the enterprise <e>", "<cs> my lords could the minister kindly answer two questions on this <e> <s> if he cannot answer now can he say that the answers will appear in the regulations to be issued in the future <e> <s> the first is with regard to milk floats do they come within the definition of goods <e> <s> my second question is can he define what is a short delivery because harrods send out their vans to fleet to basingstoke <e>", "<cs> my lords is a milk float under the heading of goods <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister clarify a little more one or two points as regards this very excellent amendment of the noble baroness lady macleod of borve <e> <s> it seemed to me from listening to the minister that he was almost encouraging pregnant mothers to wear seat belts <e> <s> he was quoting medical science saying that it is really excellent <e> <s> i do not know what medical advice the minister will obtain but certainly i hope that someone who has been pregnant several months will not fall under that category <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend the minister for his reply but in my view he has been entirely unconvincing <e> <s> the noble lord did not say one word to justify the scale of penalties as compared to those in foreign countries <e> <s> he spoke about the maximum and then said that one could rely on the mercy of the courts not to extract the maximum <e> <s> there is no security for the motorist there <e> <s> if the noble lord wants to squeeze the poorer motorist off the road he is doing his very best tonight by sticking to the fine <e> <s> i personally cannot accept that and shall ask your lordships house to express its view on whether the fine should indeed be or <e>", "<cs> my lords in spite of this tragic accident will the minister confirm that the is a remarkably fine aircraft that has been exported to nearly all of the countries of the world and has been and is in fact a tribute to british production of civil aircraft <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister this question in terms of modern speed are not the andovers considered extraordinarily slow and antiquated <e> <s> is the minister aware that there is a saying in the royal air force about those who use andovers that strong men on bicyles can pass them on a windy day <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware of the real urgency for comprehensive legislation for the preservation of atlantic salmon which are in great danger not only from the points made by the atlantic trust but internationally and nationally <e> <s> atlantic salmon may well be extinct in a few years unless the government take urgent steps in the not distant future <e>", "<cs> my lords after the very powerful speeches from the noble viscount lord thurso and the noble lord lord home of the hirsel there is little for me to say <e> <s> what i wish to say will be brief and largely on one point which i have raised a good many times over recent years in your lordships house <e> <s> there is no need for me to speak of the value of the salmon industry to scotland to england and to northern ireland <e> <s> but what i feel is most important is what was touched on by the noble viscount lord thurso a national policy which is absolutely essential as a first step and as a second step a policy wider than national in order to embrace other countries that use the high seas <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not be rather inconsistent and rather unfair if the final result of this was that the revenue now wish to take in tax a large percentage of all christmas gifts to servants of clubs all over the country while these people get away with without paying tax on it <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister say whether the help that we are giving in transport to zimbabwe covers also the development of internal civil aviation in that country <e>", "<cs> my lords there is an expression which many of your lordships know small is beautiful <e> <s> this bill is small and it is useful and i would commend it on grounds of justice to the individual and of political consistency <e> <s> i would submit two propositions <e> <s> the first and it applies very much to the words of the noble baroness lady birk is that those who supported the bill can justifiably support this one because it really has nothing to do with the increase or the decrease of sex discrimination <e> <s> in other words some noble lords may feel that if they support this bill they are in some way weakening the provisions of the act <e> <s> there is no case for that <e> <s> my second proposition is the description of this subsection as it appeared in the race relations bill by the noble baroness lady elles <e> <s> she said <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that the best way of dealing with this problem is not by prohibition but by parental example and education showing the results of glue sniffing and making the young realise the evils of the substance which they are tempted to use <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not propose to say one word about airports but i should like to be allowed for a few minutes to make some remarks concerning british airways <e> <s> the background to this increase of borrowing powers as the minister said is world airlines going into the red and each of them trying <e>", "<cs> my lords may i disagree with my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter as regards the possibility of increasing the number of questions <e> <s> i think the remedy lies largely in those who ask questions and get a long ministerial reply and who then are tempted and fall to the temptation to ask an equally long supplementary in return <e> <s> that seems to me to be one of the basic weaknesses of our present question time <e>", "<cs> my lords in asking permission to withdraw my motion may i say that i think it has been a two-way debate <e> <s> we have received from the minister a most admirable and full reply the contents of which i hope will be circulated well beyond the limits of your lordships house <e> <s> secondly the minister has received something <e> <s> he has received the views of many noble lords on all sides of the house views which are varied and of which i am quite sure her majestys government will take notice <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question of which i have given private notice <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his reply <e> <s> will he agree that laker has pioneered mass air travel and that while fares must of course be at a level which will give a reasonable return on capital never again as in past years shall we see the high level of fares exploitation of the public by means of what i would term cosy cartels monopolies and international traffic pools <e> <s> may they never be countenanced again <e> <s> that is my question to her majestys government <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> may i ask him this in respect of ratepayers who promptly paid the rate demand as compared to ratepayers who did not comply with that demand are not the former put at a financial disadvantage <e> <s> should the local authorities not be willing to give credit in respect of the moneys which they have been holding for long periods of time and would not the easiest way of giving this credit be not to return the money to the ratepayer but to give a credit note for interest due when the next rate demand comes in april <e>", "<cs> my lords could the noble lord say when it is likely that clarification will take place and if and when it does take place will it be retrospective in respect of the interest which would now be due <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall detain your lordships only a very few moments but i cannot resist giving a welcome to this bill introduced by the noble lord lord strathcona and mount royal <e> <s> as other noble lords have said this bill is a modest measure but nevertheless it must be a welcome one to those who are striving to preserve the atlantic salmon species <e> <s> i think it will be particularly welcome to the poor salmon themselves who after all cannot speak cannot bark cannot squeak but must look to we humans for safeguarding their lives <e> <s> it is indeed a modest measure but the noble lord lord ross stressed the fact that salmon legislation of a comprehensive nature was well overdue a matter which is not confined to one side of the house at all <e> <s> in fact i can remember the noble earl lord mansfield answering me in a debate on this particular subject and saying well a large study is being made but beyond that nothing has ever been promised and i am very fearful about when we are ever going to see actual legislation brought forward <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister agree that those ratepayers who paid promptly are put at a financial disadvantage as compared with those who did not pay <e> <s> if that be the case is it much of an inducement to ratepayers in general to pay their rates promptly <e>", "<cs> my lords may i inflict upon the minister just one further brief question with regard to the matter of interest <e> <s> is it really beyond the powers of local bureaucracy to attach a credit note against the next rate demand stating how much had previously been paid the period involved and the interest due on the payment <e>", "<cs> my lords knowing the speed at which the eec works can the minister give any forecast of the date when these negotiations are likely to be concluded <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say whether this exhorbitant landing fee represents an individual discrimination or a general raising of <e>", "<cs> my lords in his very interesting answer the minister did not give a specific assurance that representatives of the taxi driver community were definitely consulted as regards the new design <e> <s> can he give that positive assurance <e>", "<cs> my lords pending some positive improvement may i ask the minister whether there are any sanctions which can be brought against a consistent offender as regards quotas <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask a question of which i have given private notice <e>", "<cs>

country and can teach people to use it would be wise for the government to regard every open space as precious for the future and not to desecrate it by building if it is possible to avoid doing so

further questions to ask <e>", "<cs> my lords i will not follow the noble lord lord brockway except if i may to offer him my sincere sympathy in his inability at one moment to hear an interruption

terrible ordeal <e> <s> they are dedicated british citizens who have declared that their main wish is to see the restoration of a british administration under a governor <e> <s> it is on this issue

argentine propaganda is extraordinarily powerful within its own boundaries and possibly spreading outside them to other countries which are sympathetic to various degrees to its cause to its beliefs <e> <s> is it possible for her majestys government to develop this propaganda weapon to a greater degree than at present on our side <e> <s> i believe that the bbc service to the argentine has ceased

reply <e> <s> can he give any indication as to the likelihood of the steps that he has envisaged being taken in the legislative field at a fairly early date <e> <s> does the minister agree that unless

whether he will accept grateful thanks for all the information he has given arising from my previous reply <e> <s> may i ask him this would he possibly consider summarising perhaps in an official report all the concessions and benefits which a widow gets coupl ed with those which would go to her in respect of her children <e> <s> in that way the house would get a wide view not only of the residential benefit but of other forms of benefit which we try to give to those who are deprived of their husbands <e>", "<cs> my lords may i declare an interest as a resident and ratepayer of kensington and say that there is a great body of citizens in kensington who welcome this demolition the demolition of a building which is derelict unused and of no particular architectural merit <e>

impose the basic principle of compulsion to which i object <e> <s> nevertheless i shall not argue against these regulations in any detail but will accept defeat on the principle behind them <e>", "<cs> my lords i should first like to ask my noble friend whether he is aware of the grief which we feel and which is shared by all sides of the house at the accident which occurred yesterday on an oil rig in the north sea and that we should send a message of sympathy to the bereaved families <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his answer but it does not go quite far enough <e> <s> will the noble lord envisage a dark night in the north sea an emergency landing strong seas running a -knot wind and the need for a crew member to leave his post and come aft but a trained cabin attendant is not on hoard <e> <s> are these dispensations sufficient even when there are fewer than passengers <e> <s> should not the authorities review them with a view to doing away with dispensations on the ground of safety precautions <e> <s> these dispensations are prepared by worthy civil servants and officials who are desk-borne and do not actually fly aircraft <e> <s> those people who do fly aircraft are determined that <e>", "<cs> my lords from listening to the ministers reply it seems that there is a sequence of operations <e> <s> first the serviceman is discharged and then his assessment as to disability is in the hands of a civil department <e> <s> can we be assured that there is no financial gap which will leave a man short of money because either his pay and allowances continue until assessment is made or he is informed of the assessment before his discharge <e>", "<cs> my lords if there is ever to be any instruction could we be quite sure that it includes peace through strength <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister give us an assurance that until the argentine admits and recognises that hostilities have ceased in the south atlantic these sanctions will in no way be diminished or lifted <e>", "<cs> my lords may i i think for the first time in nearly years ask for your lordships indulgence and express an apology to the minister and to the house for my inability to be here at the end of the debate if it continues for very long <e> <s> i should like to condone that apology by saying that my remarks will be very brief indeed <e> <s> i congratulate the noble baroness lady vickers and the government on the outcome of the bill that she has promoted and the promises that her majestys government have made <e> <s> i think that the bill or the amendment to the british nationality act which gives the falklanders the same status as those who live in the channel islands or in gibraltar is laudable and will please your lordships in all quarters of the house <e> <s> i was fascinated to listen to the minister <e> <s> his delivery was very rapid quick and for me difficult to take in skipping over <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the minister for that reply which i think will be greatly welcomed in service circles and among dependants of servicemen <e> <s> may i ask whether the minister can give rather fuller information on the conditions with which the men posted to the falklands will have to contend <e> <s> rather fuller information than my noble friend lord trenchard was able to give on th december when he stated as reported at column of the <e>", "<cs> my lords having listened to virtually all the debate one question has yet to be answered <e> <s> i listened to the leader of the house with great admiration for her complete justification of the policies of the cabinet during the falklands crisis <e> <s> i listened to the brave speech of the noble lord lord carrington and i listened with less conviction to the attack on the government by the leader of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i trust that your lordships will grant me the courtesy of a few moments <e> <s> but for an unfortunate confusion i should have had my name on the list of speakers <e> <s> before i say anything may i as a fairly old member of your lordships house be allowed to congratulate the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey on the admirable maiden speech which he made and which i enjoyed i am sure in common with all other members of your lordships house <e> <s> i wish to speak on only one subject and that is the effects of the governments proposals on civil aviation aircraft <e> <s> i am one of the few members of your lordships house who probably owes his life to the ordnance map <e> <s> i assure your lordships that when you are flying a small aeroplane when visibility is nil when even the birds are walking and you are looking for a church or a road crossing or a level crossing then when you meet one of those you check on your ordnance map and you know that at any rate for that journey you are safe <e>", "<cs> my lords may i raise one question largely for guidance from the chairman of committees <e> <s> the point i want to make deals with the passage <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the very important issues raised by my noble friend lord orr-ewing in his question and the fact that major changes in policy personnel and administration have taken place in british civil aviation over the last two years since civil aviation was debated in february would the minister consider approaching the leader of the house to see whether the time is not due for another general debate on civil aviation <e> <s> we have already had two debates extending the borrowing powers but we in your lordships house have not had a general debate for two years <e>", "<cs> my lords if the british tourist board is to play a part in improving amenities will the government pass on to the board the thought that it should not neglect amenities in our provincial civil airports where there is much room for improvement <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend lord harvington for having initiated this debate <e> <s> i must of course declare a most acute interest in the particular subject we are discussing this evening <e> <s> i believe that in many cases <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the first question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister kindly say what success has been achieved in the case of the last two examples one of which was rebuked by the head of the treasury and the other was rebuked by the prime minister who said that it was deplorable <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister consider that the present procedures are adequate in the light of the results hitherto achieved <e>", "<cs> my lords while i quite accept that the results of the investigation cannot be revealed would it not be reassuring to the public if they were told in the broadest terms whether the investigation resulted in something positive <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether greater use of the system would be significantly encouraged if british rail would take steps to give to the travelling public cleaner trains tidier stations and more punctual operations than at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be because i am very old but i cannot share the optimism of the noble lord who moved this debate in the likely results and benefits of what he terms a new initiative for job creation <e> <s> i should like to ask him a question <e> <s> i am only sorry that he is not here for his own debate <e> <s> my question is this <e> <s> is the noble lord suggesting creation of artificial jobs for the sake of giving work or is he intending to confine himself to work promoted for the furtherance of industry on which as the minister has said we all depend for our livelihood <e> <s> he did not make that clear in his speech <e> <s> that is the reason for my regret that he feels himself unable to be here this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend agree that the department of employment report says that per cent <e> <s> of unemployed men over now have the mental attitude that they will never work again <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to ask the minister one question <e> <s> i refer to clause on page the transitional modifications about licences <e> <s> i would ask the minister if he could kindly explain to me <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to be allowed to take part in this debate because on th june i led the opposition to the motion at that time <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the first question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend the minister for his reply <e> <s> may i ask him this within this very congested area could not the police and traffic wardens be instructed to request any car which has immunity and is causing a congestion over christmas time to move on <e> <s> in the event of the driver declining to observe such a request could not the driver and the car be subject to a special report to the ambassador or high commissioner concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree that it is about time this one-way traffic of complaints should cease in that our representatives overseas do their very best to comply with the traffic laws of the countries in which they are serving whereas in this country some of our diplomatic immunity plate users simply ignore our traffic regulations and there is no redress we have except paper protest <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not be to the great advantage of a large number of the staff of british airways and also the conduct of foreign airline negotiations about british airways if we could have the earliest possible privatisation <e>", "<cs> my lords for the few moments that i intend to speak i wish to deal with one subject only <e> <s> and it was mentioned by the noble lord lord underhill <e> <s> twice in his remarks the question of safety in the air <e> <s> many years ago more years than i care to remember when i started my flying career i was reminded of two things firstly that what goes up must come down and secondly if god had meant us to fly he would have given us wings <e> <s> i have always remembered those two truths <e> <s> they particularly apply to flying today just as they applied to flying in the past <e> <s> there is today always a risk present when any of your lordships defy the laws of gravity <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the number of speech-hungry noble lords i see all around the chamber there is nothing for me to do except to thank those who have kindly taken part in this debate to thank the minister for his reply and to ask leave to withdraw my motion <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for that reply which of course i accept gladly but may i ask her this will her majestys government go on seeking initiatives perhaps even internationally which will result in a revival of the berne agreement and thereby bring the argentine to the conference table for matters economic and cultural and without any reference at all on either side to the vexed question of sovereignty <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords i welcome the bill and i regard it as a paving measure for future legislation which is urgently required in many directions for the preservation of our salmon <e> <s> i regret very much that we lost the opportunity some years ago of having comprehensive salmon legislation just after the hunter commission report <e> <s> i still hope that we shall have it <e> <s> but there are two ways of having legislation either with a comprehensive big bill that covers all the major points or as in this case with a series of comparatively smaller bills which will start improving the infrastructure and then going on to possible remedies which we have been discussing today to curb illegal fishing poaching and many other weaknesses on the high seas and on the rivers which we ought to tackle <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister give an assurance that in any future relationship between gibraltar and spain there will be the removal of the present air restrictions on british civil aircraft entering gibraltar which are not allowed to enter spanish air-space at times when they should be able to do so having regard to weather conditions and so on <e> <s> this is a matter of great importance and brings in the question of safety <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend consider telling the various parties that a time limit must be set for these negotiations <e> <s> if we wish we can make it a reasonable one but there must be a time limit on all those concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may detain your lordships for a few minutes <e> <s> i promise it will not be for many minutes because i know there are speakers hungry and thirsty for the next business <e> <s> i have been through that myself and i know how they rather resent someone coming in before the main debate <e>", "<cs> my lords although we do not normally like making legislation restrospective is there any chance of doing so in this case <e>", "<cs> my lords in welcoming this order i must say that i am amazed at the extent of the privilege and perquisites which those who administer this order are going to obtain <e> <s> nevertheless one welcomes the order but i would suggest that for a moment we spare a thought for the fish which after all are going to be affected more than anything else by this order <e>", "<cs> catch them my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords on the last occasion when this third report came in front of your lordships my noble friend lord shackleton and i took some objection <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for having started my few remarks but one of the penalties of extreme old age is deafness as i am afraid some of your lordships will find out later in their lives <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> would the minister agree that there can be wide differences between recommendation and implementation and that there are still certain outstanding items recommended in the report which so far it has not been possible to implement that affect the safety of the personnel concerned <e> <s> i know that some of these points require engineering knowledge and there is also need for time to develop and conduct experiments <e> <s> even so can we be assured <e>", "<cs> my lords the way the debate has gone so far gives me little comfort for the point of view i wish to put forward <e> <s> the only support i have is from the noble lord lord monson and from the bench in front of me if noble lords will permit me to lean upon it <e>", "<cs> my lords with thanks to the minister for what he has said about me can i ask just one question deserving i believe a definite answer <e> <s> in the case of someone who obeys the law goes out in his car and is killed through no fault of his own because he cannot get out of the vehicle he may be burned or he may be drowned who is responsible for the order that made him put on his belt <e> <s> is it necessary and wise that this should always be so <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i very rarely worry your lordships these days but i must tell the house why i have done so today <e> <s> i find that i am the only member of the air council of and and i worked alongside lord dowding daily for a long time <e> <s> therefore i could not let this question go by without asking leave to pay tribute to him <e>"]
