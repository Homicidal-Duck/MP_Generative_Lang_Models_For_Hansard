["<cs> my lords i should like to ask my noble friend whether the government of southern ireland have been consulted about this matter and will steps be taken to keep them informed as the conference progresses <e> <s> i am one of the many people who believe that the secret of this dreary and terrible subject lies much more with keeping the government of southern ireland informed and in trying to bring them along with us <e>", "<cs> my lords i too would like to congratulate the noble duke the duke of abercorn who unfortunately has left the chamber for the moment so our strength of dukes is reduced again to one on his maiden speech <e> <s> i thought that he spoke most sensibly and it is clear to me that he will add considerably to our debates <e> <s> i hope that perhaps he will read what i have said later in <e>", "<cs> my lords may i please interrupt the noble lord in order to say that in no sense was i being derogatory in using the word planters <e> <s> i am looking at two of my noble friends and thinking of many others with whom i have served in the army <e> <s> the term is simply a way in which in england we describe the history of the plantations of ireland <e> <s> in no sense was i being derogatory <e> <s> i see my noble friends are smiling that is all i require <e>", "<cs> my lords i too would like to congratulate the two noble baronesses on their maiden speeches <e> <s> i knew the husband of the noble baroness lady airey of abingdon quite well at oxford <e> <s> how pleased and how proud he would be with the way that she made her maiden speech <e> <s> i hope that lady saltoun will find cause to desert the tribal fastnesses in which she lives and come south and continue to give us some of the benefit of her wisdom and wit <e>", "<cs> my lords i well understand the question <e> <s> in this particular case it is simply the intention that this land should be designated heritage land which means that it can be handed on from one generation of families to the next without its being subject to capital transfer tax <e> <s> the other use referred to is that if it was given in lieu <e>", "<cs> i hope it is clear to the rest of your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords having made those three points i really do not wish to speak for much longer to your lordships except to say that we are unique in our country <e> <s> we have not been invaded since <e> <s> we have not had the ravages of wars such as they have had on the continent <e> <s> we have not had those awful revolutions they have had <e> <s> what we have is absolutely unique <e> <s> i return to the point i made before if it can be preserved it has a great effect on the youth of our nation and on the way people respect things their home life and all their history <e> <s> i commend this bill as being a great move forward <e>", "<cs> my lords i support most of the bill and think that in many of its clauses it will do great good but in clause i find very great harm and in my view that clause should not be part of the bill at all <e> <s> i talked to the noble baroness about this and naturally i heard her opening speech today <e> <s> she is a most understanding and sensible person but i think she suffers from a complete misapprehension about the question of transport <e> <s> to me she said <e>", "<cs> my lords he is sitting in another seat <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble baroness allow me to say that the noble lord lord butler of saffron walden is present and it was expressly said during the debates on the act that he as the minister would ensure that there was always going to be free transport and there was an argument that went on in the other place <e> <s> he said leave it with me <e> <s> i am the minister and i assure the house that was the other place there will always be free transport to the denominational schools <e> <s> i want to make the point that there is no question that that was the commitment that was taken on by the noble lord lord <e>", "<cs> i hope that all noble lords are quite clear about what is happening <e> <s> this arrangement has been agreed upon by the noble baroness and by the opposition whips <e> <s> the only thing that i have been unable to do is to tell the noble lord lord butler of saffron walden exactly what is happening which think he understands and i hope that he will speak very soon after i have done so <e>", "<cs> it is clearly the wish of the committee that i should withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> before the minister replies may i say that with my family i have built about or houses in lancashire and before i changed my name for the last time that is how my poor mothers family existed <e> <s> we went bankrupt almost but we survived in the end <e> <s> the noble lord lord pitt whom i know well talked about losing one single relet but the whole point is that we want to see many more houses built <e> <s> up in lancashire we built all types of house <e> <s> unpleasant houses were closed down and people moved out to the new areas <e> <s> i think this is a perfect example where the government are trying to say to the nation look we want the nation to go forward to buy houses and <e>", "<cs> may i be allowed to reply <e> <s> i should like to say most sincerely that what i have said is on the menu <e> <s> i believe that if there is to be no extra housing built by the county councils or whoever it may be houses can be built by free enterprise <e> <s> it may surprise many noble lords to know that i am experienced in house building in the city of bolton in lancashire where we are building houses of all types and we make them pay <e> <s> that is what we are talking about more and more houses to be built by every means <e> <s> i think that what i am saying is very much on the menu <e>", "<cs> i really cannot allow the noble lord to compare this subject with ernie <e> <s> when a man buys a house on a private housing estate it very often happens that within two or three years he moves to another job in another part of the country by reason of promotion <e> <s> people change their location within a firm and go from one area of the country to another <e> <s> i know this from the experience i had when i built a little housing estate in lancashire <e> <s> i have spent most of my life on housing estates what we in the army call the married family patches <e> <s> if we take germany as an example they have no shackles like this <e> <s> they can sell and buy their houses they are not normally council houses and <e>", "<cs> does the noble lord really suggest with inflation as it is now and as it is likely to be that in five years time it will be much below the market value <e>", "<cs> my lords i too wish to congratulate the noble lord lord hunt of tanworth on his maiden speech <e> <s> his wide experience in whitehall as secretary to the cabinet meant that it was no surprise to any of us that he was able to contribute enormously by what he said <e> <s> his analogy of the need for the government to keep going forwards he spoke about going forwards on a bicycle without falling off is a most apt analogy for the whole of this debate and is typical of the depth of the noble lord <e> <s> i hope that we shall often hear him speaking in your lordships chamber <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say that i fully understand the point <e> <s> i am a yorkshireman and i am making generalisations but i fully understand what has been said <e> <s> may i continue <e> <s> there is one solution there i think whereby you would certainly satisfy the essential promise that the protestants of northern ireland the two-thirds of northern ireland should never leave the womb of the parliament of westminster <e> <s> but one has to solve the problem of how the one-third of catholics are to take part in being part of the island of ireland <e> <s> this could take place if one had condominium <e> <s> this could take place if one started with condominium and it might go to bigger things and gradually in that way one <e>", "<cs> just one moment my lords <e> <s> the new hebrides is one condominium <e> <s> anglo-egyptian sudan was a very successful condominium <e>", "<cs> my lords like all noble lords i am very grateful to the noble lord lord chitnis for having put down this question because i think it is a subject which this house should very properly investigate deeply and carefully <e> <s> i have been only to mexico and venezuela <e> <s> i have never been to san salvador <e> <s> i should also like to mention before i speak in detail that i am speaking having been approached by the catholic bishops and many catholic organisations who have given me much information about this sad subject information which i am afraid has often led me to the sad conclusion that our great ally the united states for whom i have the greatest respect is not exactly on the same lines as i would like to see it <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord very much for that <e> <s> what we are really saying is that there was a great disagreement between the ambassador on the spot and the state department in washington <e> <s> i see the noble lord is nodding approval which is what i want <e>", "<cs> my lords may i take two minutes to say that we absolutely agree that there is a problem and that it was an anachronism that mr berry had to have a private bill to marry his stepdaughter mrs ward <e> <s> however the bill of the noble baroness does not answer the problem in the way that it should be answered <e> <s> it more or less abolishes all affinity except for under and so on <e> <s> that will leave the door wide open to many assaults on the family <e> <s> for instance if this bill is passed it will be possible for a father to divorce his wife so as to marry his stepdaughter <e> <s> it will be possible for a father to divorce his wife so as to marry his daughter-in-law <e> <s> all these things are examples of how that sacred unit the marriage unit the family unit would be weakened <e>", "<cs> i wish at the outset to clear up one point and i shall do so with my customary brevity <e> <s> i have talked to many of the catholic bishops and only last night i talked to the cardinal <e> <s> i explained to him that the abolition in the bill of the principle of <e>", "<cs> that is exactly what i was talking about <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> the two cases which the noble lord lord avebury has just mentioned which were curious to say the least are typical of what happens when one abandons <e>", "<cs> perhaps i could give some explanation though i give it without knowing fully the exact technical details <e> <s> the situation is one which concerns the catholic schools the church schools and if the noble lord lord ross looks at clause he will see that it refers to the acts of and <e> <s> the act was when the church schools of the roman catholics in scotland and i understand the jews were handed over to state control <e>", "<cs> i apologise if i am putting this badly <e> <s> would the noble lord care to intervene <e>", "<cs> i apologise deeply for any error i have made in describing the episcopal church <e>", "<cs> under the act of the schools of the roman catholics in scotland were transferred to the state and under the act the new schools that were subsequently built were treated similarly <e> <s> the prescribed words relate to the fact that the schools want to be under the control of the roman catholics of scotland and not under the control of the local authorities of scotland <e>", "<cs> i think that i am not wrong <e> <s> we are on amendment no <e>", "<cs> i have to admit that perhaps i was a little premature but i was informed about this <e>", "<cs> i should like to say to the noble lord lord gifford that i think someone must defend the civil service <e> <s> it is a very great service and the suggestion that the home office is unreasonable that it sits on cases and is unjust gives an idea that the bill is racial and discriminatory which it is in no way <e> <s> the home office handles many cases and i know that it handles them extremely well <e> <s> the noble lord quoted the case of a pole who was turned down <e> <s> i can tell the noble lord that last year i secured nationality for two poles noble people they are who live in paddington <e> <s> i can never remember polish names much as i love them all <e> <s> i secured nationality for them through the home office which came back with one or two questions <e> <s> the people were old and so on but they became nationals of our great country <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether this is quite the time to be debating the appeal question but what i was really saying to the noble lord was that if some decision is given by the home office i know that you can go back to them two or three times you can then go to your member of parliament you can come to your lordships house and so forth <e> <s> i do not necessarily believe there need be a high court judge <e> <s> when we come to the appeal situation i will most willingly it may be support the noble lord lord gifford <e> <s> at the moment i would just ask him to appreciate the points i have made which are made very sincerely indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to assure the house that the roman catholic hierarchy of scotland have been sufficiently consulted and are very pleased with this amendment and grateful for it <e>", "<cs> my lords precisely the new clause <e> <s> the hierarchy feel that times have changed as the noble lord lord ross has said and they very much welcome the governments interest in the religious education which the new clause will provoke <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not intend to speak but i now find myself impelled to do so because there is great feeling among the roman catholic community about this matter <e> <s> i should like to say very simply and with great respect to the noble and learned lord and also to the noble lord who spoke for the liberals that i see this as quite a simple problem <e> <s> subsection says that there shall be no discrimination on grounds of race colour or religion <e> <s> that is a fact and it is laid down <e> <s> the noble lord lord pitt of hampstead who is my great friend and a fellow roman catholic has said that if we do not agree to this amendment to clause we are allowing discrimination to take place <e> <s> we are not <e> <s> when the secretary of state or a governor applies this law he must be bound by subsection <e> <s> all that i am doing if i support the government which i shall do is saying i trust the government the secretary of state to abide by subsection and i do not need to have the additional check that there can be an appeal in the courts about it <e> <s> the government do not wish to have endless appeals in the courts because of the general implementation of all these matters <e> <s> but in no way by going into the lobby on behalf of the government if there is a division am i believing that there is any intention on the part of the government to discriminate because this amendment is not inserted in subsection <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend lord belstead will spell this out when he replies <e> <s> i think that it is quite extraordinary that the noble lord should be twisting it in this way <e>", "<cs> that is absolutely true my <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope you will not mind if i leave this debate before it is concluded because i have a commitment to which i simply must go <e> <s> i have been impressed recently by the sincerity of the interventions made by people like the noble lords lord jenkins of putney lord brockway and lord soper <e> <s> i have been alarmed by the size of the demonstrations that have taken place in hyde park amsterdam and bonn and all the other peace movements <e> <s> i am really following the theme in many ways of what the noble lord lord chalfont has just been saying <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that i caused that intervention and i apologise for wasting the time of the house <e> <s> perhaps i misinterpreted what was said <e> <s> however there is particularly with people like bruce kent some of the bishops of the church of england and the theologians of the roman catholic church to which i belong a lobby that is saying that the nuclear deterrent is so awful the use of a nuclear weapon is so terrible that it is immoral to contemplate using it and therefore we should subscribe to nuclear disarmament <e> <s> i have been to some theologians and discussed this with them and i believe this is a complete flaw in the cnd argument <e>", "<cs> i can tell the noble lord at once that i do not know what his holiness the pope says on the subject <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord knows <e>", "<cs> my lords do not for a moment think that i am bound as a roman catholic by everything his holiness the pope says <e> <s> good heavens above <e> <s> how could the noble lord think such things of my family or me <e> <s> having made those comments i am itching to hear the replies of the cnd philosophy and i will say no more that is all i wanted to say <e> <s> i end by saying that i am totally behind the present governments defence policy and indeed the opposition defence policy because there is nothing much between them <e> <s> oddly enough this is a debate of both sides of the house against the cnd and the soviets <e> <s> it is not a debate between the labour party and the conservative government and therefore my last words are that i totally support the present governments defence policy <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing on this matter which does concern the question on the order paper could my noble friend please confirm whether the russians are deploying one new ss every three weeks and whether the total they have now deployed is something like <e>", "<cs> my lords i was lucky enough never to have been taken prisoner of war so when i was asked by the noble earl lord kimberley to talk on this matter i contacted a certain captain watson of the royal marines who happened to have been taken prisoner in crete and was in germany <e> <s> he telling me a similar story to that related by the noble lord lord clifford said he was paid what were called lagermarks which were deducted from his pay and he said they were no use to him because in the camps where he was there was practically nothing to buy <e> <s> the sort of things he was meant to buy with that money were he said portraits of hitler and he did not particularly want to purchase those <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise for not being here for the beginning of this debate but i have been in birmingham and was able to return only a few moments ago <e> <s> there is no question but that this bill has the will of the whole country the overwhelming will of the whole country <e> <s> it seeks to curb the vile trade that goes on of exploiting mens and womens sex and making money out of it and so proliferating this subject

lordships heard the noble and learned lord chief justices excellent speech and i need say no more <e> <s> the second evil of pornography is that it is an assault on the family <e> <s> the family is the central human unit and anything which assaults family life is something that does our country great harm <e> <s> i have no hesitation in saying that i wholeheartedly support this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords if so to speak i may speak i hope not out of order before the noble lord sits down may i also ask the noble lord to confirm something which i know to be absolutely true that the trade union system in germany which i have witnessed for years in my service in germany was the child of ernest bevin <e> <s> he designed it he made it and he was proud of it <e> <s> he said that when he had the power as foreign minister he was going to make quite certain that they had an up-to-date trade union system which so to speak he believed in and he wished that ours could have evolved into <e> <s> that is what the german system was <e>", "<cs> my lords i regard this as an immensely significant debate <e> <s> we have heard one or two extremely important speeches and the one with which i find myself most aligned is that of the right reverend prelate the bishop of norwich <e> <s> i found that i agreed with everything that he said <e> <s> i shall not speak for long i never do but i should like to start by thanking the noble lord lord brockway for raising this subject at this time and i should like to ask him when he replies to the debate to cover the points that he and the noble lord

badly received by everybody but in fact it is the basis of this bill and is a very remarkable and wonderful white paper <e> <s> it has been paralleled by the dimbleby lecture by dr garret fitzgerald

its views <e> <s> i should like to speak for two or three minutes on this <e> <s> it was a very good paper and i am pleased to say that most of the requirements of that paper have already been met <e>", "<cs> before the minister replies perhaps i may raise a somewhat different point <e> <s> it is well known that by the provisions of the act church schools of the church of england the church of rome the jewish faith and so on were allowed to be created and the government agreed to pay for their running but said that the churches would have to pay per cent <e> <s> of the building costs <e> <s> that is what they have been paying <e> <s> however in scotland the presbyterians were fly enough to say that they would not pay anything at all and so the roman catholics in scotland pay nothing <e> <s> that figure of per cent <e> <s> has now become per cent <e> <s> i should most willingly greet some future bill in which it is suggested that we should pay nothing and not per cent <e> <s> i wanted to cover that point <e>", "<cs> i too support amendment no <e> <s> tabled in the name of the noble baroness lady cox <e> <s> the amendment is designed to make it easier for new voluntary-aided schools to be established where there is a demand for them on denominational or other grounds <e> <s> surely that is a purpose which must command wide support from all concerned for parents rights in education especially in the religious education of their children <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that a critical situation has now developed because of the nurses pay award <e> <s> the award is a most admirable one and in no way am i suggesting that it is too much <e> <s> however it is being suggested that the minister might look further into the matter <e> <s> some hospices are most labour-intensive and in some cases per cent <e> <s> of their costs are for nurses or doctors who also carry out their duties voluntarily <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that the amendment has already been spoken to for a little too long but i am always brief and give myself five minutes at the very most <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble earl <e> <s> in no way am i the leader of the catholic laity <e> <s> i happen to be the senior catholic from the point of view of this kind of organisation in this country but in no way do i speak for the catholic laity <e> <s> i speak as a catholic layman <e> <s> that is all no more no less <e> <s> i speak as someone who was educated by the catholics at ampleforth oxford and so on <e> <s> i do not speak for the catholic laity any more than other noble lords presumably are speaking for the catholic hierarchy <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to support these amendments on collective worship in county schools in the name of the right reverend prelate and myself as well as of the noble lord lord elton <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to amend the law relating to human embryos produced by <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i have moved that the bill be now read a second time <e> <s> i commend it to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the unborn children protection bill <e> <s> i hope that the government will bring in a bill of their own next session to deal with the problems raised by the warnock report <e> <s> if they do not i shall ask noble lords whether i may bring in my bill again <e>", "<cs> i understand that my amendments nos <e> <s> and are grouped with amendment no <e> <s> and i shall speak to them <e> <s> the noble baronesses lady faithfull and lady seear have covered some of the fundamental ground and detail of the attendance allowances <e> <s> i want to call the committees attention to patients who have reached the terminal phase of cancer aids and similar illnesses <e> <s> the vast majority of those patients survive for nothing like six months and so they can never qualify for the benefit <e> <s> st josephs hospice in hackney operates an extensive medical and nursing service for patients dying at home <e> <s> the average period of care by the home care service from referral to death is just nine weeks <e> <s> this most valuable benefit for the chronic sick can rarely be paid to those whose sickness is mortal <e>", "<cs> having put down my amendment i received an immense groundswell of support from all sides of the committee and also from many people outside who knew that it was down <e> <s> we also had very sympathetic meetings with the minister and i fully understand now that the government are looking at the hospice movement with great care and with a comprehensive force about its future <e>", "<cs> i should like to reply at once <e> <s> my noble friend lady carnegy is talking about the case of mrs ruddy which was considered by the hierarchy <e> <s> it was annoyed that she had removed her children from a roman catholic school but she was promoted to head of the catholic school where she was an under-teacher <e> <s> she still holds that post <e>", "<cs> in view of what the minister said and the assurance given i certainly ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i speak as a very ecumenical catholic layman <e> <s> i am very conscious that the reformation started because we provided anne boleyn the niece of the duke of norfolk who led henry viii astray and this unfortunate division began <e> <s> we have suffered on tower hill for doing that frequently and in my ancestor the twelfth <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to labour the point but the question is simple <e> <s> at present the word approve is in the bill that is to approve of the religious character and religion itself <e> <s> if a teacher from a different branch of christianity was to come to a catholic school then the hierarchy want to be able to consent <e> <s> they cannot approve of the religion because that religion is <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble earl lord longford for introducing <e>", "<cs> my lords we should all like to thank the noble and learned lord on the woolsack for the way in which he introduced the debate with his balanced and comprehensive speech <e> <s> i listened with great interest to the speeches that followed <e> <s> i did not agree with them all but i absorbed what was said <e> <s> we all wish to thank and are doling so almost tediously the noble baroness lady warnock for compiling her great report in july <e> <s> it was not unanimious and contained three minority expressions of dissent <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not intervened before although i have felt tempted to do so <e> <s> we live in a pluralist society <e> <s> in no way do i as a catholic a papist or whatever one likes to call it want to impose catholic views on the noble lord or on any other noble lord <e> <s> we live in a pluralist society and we do not believe in doing that <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make three brief points <e> <s> first as the noble lord lord stallard assured the noble and learned lord lord brightman scotland adheres to the equivalent of the infant life preservation act because the scottish gynaecologists and the scottish office have given that order to the scottish doctors <e>", "<cs> my lords i only hope that some noble lords can see that i am not trying to impose anything in this free democratic country of ours <e> <s> the idea that a minority of people be they catholic or yorkshiremen as i am can impose their wishes on other people is totally wrong <e> <s> i believe in the democracy of this country and in the majority vote <e>", "<cs> my lords i set that out at the beginning of my speech and it will appear in <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that the noble lord has stiffened the conditions up to weeks but he has then opened the door from to weeks <e> <s> that is what i am worried about <e> <s> i would welcome a bill in this house on abortion but not this one <e> <s> the bill is so full of matters which do not tally that i wish to test the opinion of the house on my amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to preface my remarks by saying that i happen to be a catholic and that i hope that everything which happens during the course of this debate will be done in the usual pleasant and happy way in which we deal with matters in this chamber of which i have the honour to be a member <e> <s> i am a very new member some noble lords have been here for many years but i am very proud and glad to be here <e> <s> i loathe any question of our having unpleasant arguments <e>", "<cs> i should like to make the matter more precise <e> <s> the words were contained in the unborn children protection bill tabled by enoch powell in the other place <e> <s> i more or less copied his bill and brought it before your lordships house about a year ago <e> <s> i had wide support on second reading but did not carry on with the bill <e>", "<cs> i hope that it is not out of order for me to speak now <e> <s> i see that the chief whip is nodding <e> <s> that does not always happen <e> <s> i obviously have not explained myself properly <e> <s> we do not like to see any experiments carried out on any embryo <e> <s> however the pro-life group agrees that there should be therapeutic treatment for the benefit of that embryo <e> <s> we regard the embryo as a born child or a grown-up <e> <s> treatment can only be carried out on that born child or grown-up for its own good <e> <s> that cannot be so if it is carried out for the benefit of other people <e> <s> we put in this amendment and it was in the enoch powell bill to try to limit it so that only an embryo which will be inserted into a woman can be treated for the benefit of that embryo <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble and learned lord and i withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i much respect what the noble and learned lord has said and i fully agree that once this embryo is created in the uterus and is not yet attached to the womb nidation or whatever it is called nature flushes a lot more out of the womb and we think that perhaps those should be the ones that are used for tests <e> <s> we think that it is unfortunate to take a human life that is beginning and remove it from the uterus to inspect it and maybe to experiment on it <e> <s> however i agree with the noble and learned lord that we are awaiting the arrival of clause <e> <s> i should prefer to return to this subject on report if necessary <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i wish to thank the members of the committee who have spoken including the noble lord lord mcgregor the noble earl lord lauderdale and the noble lord lord jenkin <e> <s> we feel strongly that there should be a wide representation <e> <s> the noble earl lord jellicoe also mentioned that <e> <s> i am a little bit unhappy about the idea of the present membership of the licensing authority being taken on completely <e> <s> i think there should be a new authority which will no doubt include some members from the present one but which would also contain many new people <e> <s> that would give the country a feeling that this bill has had an effect in this area <e> <s> however having heard the comments of my noble friends i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am glad to have heard what has been said <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for that assurance <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the answer is simple <e> <s> i believe that an embryo is the start of life and must be given the same status in life as a child a grown-up person or a member of your lordships chamber <e> <s> i can see no distinction between that and the life of an embryo <e>", "<cs> may i thank the noble and learned lord for his masterly summing up <e> <s> it was abundantly clear and abundantly fair to both sides of this very important debate <e> <s> i should like to thank everybody for their speeches which enlightened me a great deal <e> <s> i now without further ado propose that amendment no <e> <s> be carried <e>", "<cs> in view of the fact that the authority will be so widely drawn i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the purpose of my amendment was to stop what i call the brave new world scenario coming along in which mankind is being manipulated by the abilities given through in vitro fertilisation <e> <s> that itself is a wonderful thing <e> <s> however having heard what has been said i wish to reserve the possibility of bringing the matter up in some other form if necessary at report stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> since i have been quoted as almost misleading the committee i immediately say that the noble viscount was quoting from the same gallup poll which i was using <e> <s> the poll builds up question by question so that one answer did not lead into the next <e> <s> the critical question was on the last page and per cent <e> <s> on the consolidated list were in our favour <e>", "<cs> we held a press conference and the gallup poll figures were given to the press <e> <s> i shall make quite certain that a copy is placed in the library if it is not already there <e> <s> some people were against the research and some were not but the final figure of per cent <e> <s> was on our side <e> <s> i assure the committee that that is the situation <e>", "<cs> the poll is very complicated but the final figure was per cent <e> <s> i am sorry if the committee feels that it has been misled <e> <s> i was totally confused but the press reported the figures <e> <s> members of the committee can see the statistics for themselves <e>", "<cs> in view of what the noble and learned lord and other speakers have said i am consoled <e> <s> i pointed out that we did not wish to have a licence granted to someone who is purely let us say the director of a pharmaceutical company <e> <s> we do not want that <e> <s> however if the people who will carry out this kind of activity will have appropriate qualifications we shall be content with that <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am certain that in such matters we should be guided by the truth <e> <s> it is wrong to pretend by failing to tell the children <e> <s> the truth will out truth has the mastery <e>", "<cs> the effect of this clause would be to prevent prosecutions under the bill when enacted without the consent of the director of public prosecutions <e> <s> it would make private prosecutions brought by ordinary members of the public impossible <e> <s> this appears to me to be a serious erosion of the effectiveness of the bill <e> <s> the right of ordinary citizens to bring a case in law is of the greatest importance <e> <s> this is indeed an issue which concerns many ordinary members of the public as was indicated by the gallup poll which i mentioned on a previous occasion and which i fear was misunderstood by my noble friend lord craigavon <e> <s> outright majorities opposed the use of the human embryo for experiments to develop contraceptives or abortifacients <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble and learned friend for this amendment <e> <s> it meets what i require <e>", "<cs> my lords i of course appreciate the decision that noble lords took on clause on th february when we voted to to allow experimentation on human embryos <e> <s> i am not so to speak kicking against that decision in any way but the reason i support the amendment tabled in my name which was opened by the noble lord lord jakobovits is that i believe that it is a method of limiting some of the things that i dislike happening <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord sits down perhaps i may say that i totally agree that we have the same religion and the quicker we get together the better <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house and the noble and learned lord perhaps i may say that there was indeed a case that came up under my cousin as earl marshal which had lapsed <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened to this debate and to other matters connected with it <e> <s> as a nation we are getting into awful muddles about childbirth <e> <s> people have children without being <e>", "<cs> my lords with the assurance from the noble and learned lord that lord goddards use of the word dignity included coat of arms i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may be permitted to endeavour to restore a moment of calmness <e> <s> first i want to thank the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor <e> <s> i honestly believe that he made a considerable difference to our debates as a mastermind <e> <s> he was able to explain matters that we wanted to understand and he did so all the time <e> <s> we owe him a great debt of gratitude <e> <s> i know that many noble lords have already said that but i must say it too <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a remote interest in that there is a heralds museum in the tower of london and obviously i have some interest in that <e> <s> why are the tower armouries to be moved having been in their present position since <e> <s> i believe that they are to be removed to sheffield after that long period in the white tower which was almost built for them by william the conqueror <e> <s> that is to take place because of a desire to make money rather than to preserve our heritage <e> <s> is that what the government really want <e>", "<cs> my lords we are talking about the white tower the central tower built by william the conqueror <e> <s> are the tower armouries to be removed from there <e> <s> why can those which are there at present not be left there and the surplus moved away <e> <s> to evacuate the whole of the tower armouries from the tower after so many centuries merely to make money is something which we should not do <e>", "<cs> my lords in speaking on the possible effects on the law which could result from the abortion amendments passed in another place i feel that i can do no better than quote a very old and i am sure greatly honoured friend of the noble lord lord houghton <e> <s> i refer to professor glanville williams qc fba one of the finest academic lawyers we have in this country and one of the leading advocates in favour of liberal abortion and euthanasia to which i do not necessarily agree in any way <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down perhaps i may say a few words <e> <s> i hesitate to do so because she is
