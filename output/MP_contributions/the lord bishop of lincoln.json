["<cs> my lords i should like to make one or two comments relating to the subject of unemployment and i should like to do so against a certain personal background <e> <s> i am a bishop who comes from a great rural diocese with nevertheless large patches of urbanisation where unemployment is running at anything from to per cent <e> <s> also i am chairman of the industrial committee of the general synod of the church of england and i spent years of my ministry as an industrial chaplain in one of our great industrial cities coventry <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to pay my tribute to the gist at least of much that the noble lord lord crowther-hunt said in his speech and also to the things the noble baroness lady seear said in balancing that up <e> <s> i should like to assure lord crowther-hunt that i think my right reverend brethren on these slightly sanctified benches do not really think that the economy is to be revived by prayer alone <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciated much that was said from both sides of the house by the noble lord lord beswick and the noble baroness the leader of the house <e> <s> when i was an industrial chaplain and in daily contact with people at all levels of factory life i found i needed to coin for myself a definition of the word justice because it was too <e>", "<cs> my lords are her majestys government satisfied with the fact as revealed by the hmi survey of secondary education in england that per cent <e> <s> of this countrys maintained schools appear to provide no religious education whatever for -to -year-olds <e>", "<cs> my lords with all brevity may i say with what respect and gratitude lord butlers work was always viewed by all the churches in this land <e> <s> obviously i think particularly of the education act <e> <s> it was his gifts which turned what might have been a mere compromise into the very remarkable dual system which we still have today <e> <s> lord butlers understanding of religion as well as of education was wide as well as deep <e> <s> he was deeply concerned with the education of the disabled the less able as well as the high fliers and he extended education into adulthood <e> <s> on the basis of those insights i think that the churches very much hope to play their due part in shaping the education service for the multi-faith and multi-racial community of the future and in so doing we shall be following his spirit <e>", "<cs> i would like to support this amendment <e> <s> as we all know sex shops exist and the object of this bill is to control their existence <e> <s> it seems to me that from this amendment stems the capacity of local authorities to do exactly that <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i can be brief <e> <s> i know that the noble lord lord bruce of donington was in touch about this sad case with the archbishop of canterbury and that the archbishop wrote to him to say that he was not able to be here himself but would very much have wished to be here in order to speak in this debate <e> <s> however he has asked me to speak on his behalf and i would also want to speak on my own behalf because i think that we would be as much concerned as others have stated already in the family aspect of this matter and particularly the aspect of the child who is only six years old <e> <s> i think the case is highly eloquent in itself and i do not think i need to underline that and i hope i would not need to underline the fact that i and those i stand for are profoundly concerned at this sort of instance <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> we have a prison in lincoln which i visit from time to time so i am well aware of what has been described as the conditions of overcrowding in our prisons and of the extreme seriousness of that <e> <s> for that reason alone i should want to support this amendment <e> <s> i had prepared a few words but the points that i had in them have already been made very clearly and cogently by lord hunt and lord elwyn-jones and there is no point in going over things which have been well put already <e> <s> i should have thought that this new venture would also provide the sort of space in which those likely to be responsive to rehabilitation may find some sort of encouragement and again that is something to be in favour of <e> <s> for those reasons i support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble baroness the leader of the house for having courteously sent me a copy of the governments response to the report <e> <s> it may be that she sent them to all members of your lordships house but i am grateful for having received it myself <e> <s> i think one of the most important and impressive things about this report is that the members of the select committee by virtue of being that represented every party in your lordships house and independent and church opinion and i say that this concerted view which they have produced is important and impressive because it is in contrast to what one tends to hear <e> <s> party views on unemployment can be very divergent as to remedies some of our most strongly felt political tensions are about this and obviously so because we are here concerned with matters not only of crucial economic importance but also of deep human and social and therefore moral import <e> <s> because of this because of the nature and the seriousness of the subject i think that the tone of voice of the political debate that takes place about it matters a lot <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to touch on one point which noble lords have already mentioned and that is the anxiety that is felt in rural areas about the effects of these proposals on services there <e> <s> i detected in the speech of the noble lord the minister a note of reassurance about this and i recognise that it is in black and white in the document that we have <e> <s> but i also recognise that behind these assurances there are presumably very complicated financial and technical matters <e> <s> therefore i should like to support what the noble lord lord beaumont of whitley has said the governments intentions should be very clearly spelt out about this making need the criterion rather than demand because i know that anxiety is still very much present in the rural areas <e>", "<cs> my lords it is late and i shall be very brief but i should like to say one word about the subject of the implications of the knowledge and understanding of the things we are talking about tonight the effects of unemployment on people for industrial relations <e> <s> that may sound rather strange but what i mean is this <e> <s> i think it is clear that bad industrial relations are a factor in the crippled state of our economy and that better industrial relations would contribute to our economic health <e> <s> but one of the problems about improving industrial relations is that so often the motive is not there because the sides concerned are so bound up in the mistrust that has been created between them that the motive does not get through to achieving something better <e>", "<cs> my lords it was only as i arrived at the house today that i discovered that i was to have the honour of speaking directly after the noble lords maiden speech but i was handed a copy of his entry in <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> i just want to point out that at the beginning of my speech i did say that there were a number of government achievements which i would very much want to salute and it was exactly that particular one which i had in mind although i did not specify it perhaps i should have done so <e>", "<cs> i merely want to say that the anxiety expressed by the noble lord lord mishcon has also been expressed to me and i should like to support what he said <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say one or two things briefly in support of the intentions of this bill because it seems to me that its implementation would lead to the enhancement of democratic government <e> <s> that sounds a great big phrase but it is very important <e> <s> i suppose in theory most people would go along with the idea that it is good if people can have a say about matters that affect them at absolutely local level <e> <s> but in a world which is becoming increasingly complex and therefore more and more difficult to control and direct the good intentions of democratic feeling are always up against <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a tremendous and exacting privilege to follow the noble earl and to pay tribute to him for the superb speech which he has just made <e> <s> i have in my hand a copy of the maiden speech which he made years ago <e> <s> it is years since his last maiden speech but of course the noble earl has had a few years between then and now in which to practise before the superb speech which he has made today <e> <s> none of us will ever forget the magnificent survey of our countrys economic political and moral life which we have had the privilege to hear today <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble earl made his celebrated maiden speech in your lordships house he said that during his time as prime minister he had come to think that the speeches made on economic and political subjects by bishops tended to be as he courteously put it somewhat eccentric and capricious <e> <s> i believe that what i want to try to say conforms to neither of those adjectives <e> <s> if i introduce a slightly different note than hitherto in this debate it is not in any way that i should not want to put myself absolutely behind what the noble earl has said and what all speakers have said so far about the vital importance of technology about the huge opportunities it lays before us and about the importance of our grasping them for the good of our country <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the points that have been made by the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones in his very cogent speech which paints a grave picture with regard to the law centres <e> <s> i should like to do it briefly from a particular angle <e> <s> your lordships will know that two years ago the most reverend primate the archbishop of canterbury set up a commission to look into conditions in the inner cities <e> <s> at the turn of the year it produced its report <e> <s> the commissions report received some rather foolish and hysterical criticism from certain quarters before it was even published <e> <s> nevertheless the report itself comes out of a very deep and wide penetration by a whole variety of expert people into the facts and the feelings that is important the facts and the feelings of the most deprived areas of our land the inner cities and the housing estates which often surround them <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join other noble lords in thanking the noble baroness for introducing a debate into your lordships house which has enabled so many valuable interesting and important things to be said and to be heard <e> <s> i should not want in any way to minimise the importance and the seriousness of the present crime rate in this country but i should like to enter a caveat about the way the matter is sometimes presented because i think it has important implications <e> <s> the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor has already spoken about this <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the noble earl who he means by the church <e> <s> he said that the church should stand up and say this that and the other <e> <s> he is a member of the church the church comprises the laity as well as the clergy and <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the minister for that answer may i ask him this is it not contrary to the report of the environment select committee of the house of commons <e> <s> does the minister not believe that the questions raised by that report should be addressed and answered before further exploration of any sites takes place not least the questions raised about the handling of the public experience of which we in lincolnshire have not felt at all happy about <e>", "<cs> my lords while accepting what was said by the noble lord the minister about the report dealing considerably and largely with high-level radioactive material may i ask whether or not he is aware that it also devotes a lot of its work to low-level and intermediate material being deposited <e> <s> it is very critical of the way in which we do that at this moment in this country <e> <s> that situation causes very great anxiety to those of us in south humberside and lincolnshire in respect of the possibility of the same methods being used in that area <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the noble baroness in bringing this bill before us and to identify myself with the sense of urgency with which she has spoken and the sense of urgency with which the matters in the bill need to be dealt with <e>", "<cs> my lords i also should like to thank the noble lord lord holderness for initiating this debate and also to support many of the points that the noble lord lord ezra has just made <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment <e> <s> it has been spoken to so eloquently that i do not wish to add to what has been said about the unemployed <e> <s> i support it in principle and because i come from a part of the world where unemployment is above the national average <e>", "<cs> my lords i support this amendment <e> <s> the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs spoke with eloquence in favour of the amendment and tribute has been paid to that so i do not want to go over the ground she covered <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl the minister aware that neither the churches nor the teachers would be at all happy in a situation where schools were brought to court <e> <s> is he further aware that both the most reverend primate the archbishop of canterbury and the right reverend prelate the bishop of london in conversations with the select committee on education and science in another place have spoken of their wish for greater flexibility in the approach to the law not with regard to the flexibility of their conviction that religion should be part of the total education experience but with regard to the fact that the whole educational scene has changed greatly over these last years and that many people including the churches hope that this matter can be approached with greater flexibility than it is now <e>"]
