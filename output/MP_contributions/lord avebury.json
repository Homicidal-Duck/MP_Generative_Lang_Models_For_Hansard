autonomy of local education authorities in this matter may be harmful to the development of computer education since a large variety of different courses has been adopted by different schools in

refugee can ever be released under the temporary admission procedure even to a responsible organisation supported by the home office such as the joint working group for refugees <e> <s> if that is so can the rule be made known to the joint working group and others so that they do not waste their time intervening on behalf of people who are held in custody at harmondsworth claiming to be refugees <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has not answered my question with a simple yes or no as i had hoped he might <e> <s> why are the forecasts of future traffic growth which the department uses and has always used treated as matters of public policy when the decline forecast in public transport is apparently not public policy <e> <s> surely in logic the alterations in the level of traffic flows whether public or private must be of a similar nature <e>", "<cs> my lords following what the noble lord lord campbell of croy has said namely that we have never been correct about traffic forecasts in the past i should like to point out that it is wrong to treat them as public policy <e> <s> as the noble lord himself has said they tend to be speculative <e> <s> so why is it that before trunk road and motorway inquiries these forecasts are treated as so sacrosanct that no witness or objector is entitled to question the department about how they were reached or to produce alternative evidence throwing doubt on the way that the forecasts have been derived <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards verification does it not appear from the development of nuclear weapons by countries such as pakistan that if any nation is sufficiently determined to divert nuclear materials from a civilian programme it can with the minimum technical competence manufacture useable nuclear bombs <e> <s> in view of those developments would the disarmament conference take on hoard the need to tighten up the safeguards on the use of civil nuclear technologies to ensure that very large numbers of developing countries do not obtain nuclear weapons in unstable parts of the world <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say just a few words on this bill <e> <s> i remember i think it must be years ago when in another place we had the st georges hanover square burial ground bill and i took the opportunity to ask the then minister who was replying whether it might not be for the general convenience of those who had to apply cemetery land for other purposes and of the church authorities if consideration were given to a public general act which laid down a procedure for relinquishing land within a shorter period of time than is laid down in <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord care to ask his holiness the pope what his opinion is of the example we are setting by spending million on modernising the polaris missile fleet <e>", "<cs> my lords is the secretary of state aware that when this matter was taken up with the previous government about a year ago they declined to refer the question of eritrea to the security council on the grounds that such a move would be unlikely to secure enough international backing particularly from african countries and that the african countries might be opposed to its ventilation on oau grounds of territorial integrity <e> <s> but my lords would the noble lord not agree that the latter argument has lost a good deal of its force by reason of the recognition by many african countries of the claims of the polisario front in west sahara while the general condemnation of soviet intervention in afghanistan makes it more likely that a move in the security council in respect of eritrea would be successful now <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say one or two words about a provision in the isle of wight bill which has come before your lordships notice on one previous occasion that is to say on th february last year <e> <s> several of these county council bills were considered on the same day and i ventured to draw your lordships attention to the provisions regarding notice of street processions <e> <s> prior to the local government act many local authorities had provisions in their local legislation requiring such notice but in general it was very much shorter than the notice they sought in the reorganisation that followed in <e> <s> by far the largest number of the old enactments called for either or hours notice whereas in the new bills that were presented either in your lordships house or in another place as much as five or even seven days notice was to be required <e> <s> in the case of the isle of wight bill it started off with three days and it finished up with three days <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord not aware he must be that <e>", "<cs> my lords where there is a difference of opinion about the value of a particular offer so that the interpretation of it is as the noble earl said in his original reply subjective would it not be possible either for the government or for acas to publish the estimates both of the employers and of the trade unions with a very short statement giving the reasons for reaching such conclusions so that the public could evaluate the offer for themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that there is an inconsistency in community policy here <e> <s> as the noble lord has told us this afternoon the community has cancelled all food aid to afghanistan because of soviet intervention there but has continued to grant food aid to ethiopia where soviet intervention has taken place on an equally obnoxious scale <e> <s> only this morning i received a letter from m cheysson the european community official in charge of these matters saying that it is the intention of the community to continue to send food aid to ethiopia notwithstanding the fact that it falls into the hands of the ethiopian armed forces and not into the hands of the civilian population for whom it is intended and thereby supports the ethiopian war effort against the heroic freedom fighters of eritrea <e>", "<cs> my lords while the minister is reviewing the timing of all trunk road and motorway schemes will he take into consideration the fact that economic growth and therefore road traffic growth are turning out to be very much lower than the forecasts which were used as the basis of the original schemes and will the noble lord give us any indication of when this review is expected to be published <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord confirm that report lr shows that damage to the road surface increases according to the fourth power of the axle load that therefore heavy vehicles are causing a disproportionate amount of damage to our road surfaces in this country and that the owners of these vehicles are paying in the form of vehicle taxation very much less than the costs which they are imposing on the rest of the community <e> <s> are these not very important facts which have been revealed in relation to the current discussion regarding the increase in the permitted weights of vehicles on our roads <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the noble lord agree that it is also true to say that local authorities who despite the recent cuts in government expenditure and assistance to local authorities still build a larger number of houses per annum than any private developer will always build down to the minimum standards laid down by the government and that this means that the cost in use of heating these houses is being laid upon the tenants who increasingly are unable to afford it <e> <s> therefore will not the government consider whether in the long-term interests of energy conservation and in the short-term interests of the tenants who have to live in houses with inadequate insulation higher standards should be laid down as a condition for local authorities to receive approval of dwelling construction <e>", "<cs> my lords as long as the soviet union continues to violate the helsinki agreement and in particular to victimise distinguished scientists such as sakharov who has been mentioned shcheransky orlov and lerner does the noble lord not think that at least we should take retaliatory action against them by discouraging scientific contacts <e>", "<cs> my lords while recognising that this is primarily a matter for another place may i say that it is rather incongruous that a body which is described as the review body on top salaries should be recommending such derisory increases which will cause bitter disappointment among secretarial staff in the commons <e> <s> does the noble earl honestly think that it is possible to employ a part-time research assistant at and that this is going to go any way at all <e>", "<cs> my lords i was referring

proposals submitted to the glc for the development of this site was one by the jewish cultural foundation which involved the preservation of the jubilee hall <e> <s> will he not urge his friends in the glc to have another look at this to see whether the proposals submitted by <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell the house whether this <e>", "<cs> my lords in the latter half of my supplementary question i am talking about people detained under schedule that is the administrative provisions of the act <e> <s> i am asking first whether they can contact a friend or solicitor under the judges rules or the criminal law act and in the case of those persons detained as alleged illegal entrants or otherwise under the provisions of schedule where they do not have a friend and do not know the name of a solicitor whether the prison authorities or the police authorities would on

of mr mugabes party and yet when the journalists went to these regions to check it they found that meetings of other parties had taken place in a perfectly normal manner <e> <s> therefore does this not indicate that the governor is receiving false information from the people on the spot and that he needs further backing from this country <e>", "<cs> my lords among the political considerations which the foreign secretary mentioned will human rights be included <e> <s> also will the noble lord take into account the fact that some of the recipients of our aid at the moment pakistan and

repeating the statement i should like to ask how the government expect local authorities to make housing expenditure plans for the year beginning th april when only now six weeks before the start of that financial year are they being told how much money is available <e> <s> secondly with regard to the costs of local authority building mentioned in the statement can the minister say what is the increase in the cost of an average three-bedroom semidetached parker-morris house which has been brought about by the rise in interest rates since the conservatives came into office <e> <s> how are people going to buy the houses offered for sale by the local authorities when these cuts are likely to add to the mortgage famine <e> <s> does not the initial p rent rise mentioned come on top of the increase which has already been imposed by the government and does not the minister consider that this will be likely to fuel inflationary wage demands even beyond those of the order of per cent <e>

of the increase in interest <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the whole house would applaud the forthright statement made by the noble lord lord todd in hamburg which i think was published in full in last weeks <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the noble lord wrong about the grants made by his own department in that the joint working group for refugees from latin america has had its money cut by the home office notwithstanding the fact that the number of refugees to which it gives assistance in the united kingdom is still the same as it ever was <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that notwithstanding the governments abhorrent decision last year to end the special programme for refugees from latin america we still have the same number of these people who look to the joint working group for assistance in matters such as education in english classes and the cut by the home office is making it impossible for them to carry out their work <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say what may be the total amount of fissionable material locked up in nuclear weapons in the zone to which the noble lord refers and what this would represent in terms of kilowatt-hours if it were used for electricity generation <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the first question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords since the judgment is so clear to the minister can he explain whether it means that the whole question of need is to be excluded from cross-examination as being a matter of government policy or that inspectors should hear evidence on need but make no recommendations on it or finally that the minister has the power to restrict the scope of the inquiries in any manner he sees fit <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that the inspector in the aire valley inquiry ruled just the other day on th february that he would make recommendations on need but only because in that case he was considering a self-contained scheme and that in the case of a motorway or a trunk road which was part of a larger operation this evidence would not have been able to be put <e> <s> therefore ministers can exclude any evidence of this kind simply by dividing up the road into little bits <e>", "<cs> my lords if one cannot deal with these matters at a local inquiry where can one deal with them bearing in mind as the minister knows that the forecasts that were made in and all turned out to be wildly over-stated and that if we had relied on those entirely we should have built thousands of miles of trunk roads and motorways at the expense of millions of pounds to the taxpayer which subsequently turned out to be unnecessary <e> <s> does the minister not think that if you exclude objectors from raising matters which are of importance to them at local public inquiries <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister finally say whether the ruling by the inspector mr <e> <s> chance in the aire valley inquiry on evidence relating to need is correct because as

follow him any further into his historical dissertations on the development of railways <e> <s> as to the report of the council of europe which is before us i must say that such reports are not my favourite bedtime reading and after studying this one i can say with some confidence that they are unlikely to hit the best-seller lists <e> <s> we find the usual turgid prose that we expect from international quangos where they have regard to they reaffirm they believe they are convinced they recall and then the committee sets out the aim of their public hearings to which the noble lord referred two days in which they took evidence from experts <e> <s> then after a few pages of o-level physics the committee comes on to state the conclusions they reached as a result of this intense process of two days of hearings <e> <s> we do far better than that in the select committees of another place and i hope we shall do in your lordships house than to attempt to reach far-reaching conclusions such as are contained in this report on the basis of two days hearings <e> <s> it is really quite absurd <e>", "<cs> my lords i am indeed aware of that and this is why i said that there are other techniques that nations have used already <e> <s> i was coming on to mention the particular case of pakistan if the noble lord had waited a few minutes <e> <s> what i say is that we do not want to open up even more routes towards a weapons capability than exists at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord allow me to interrupt him <e> <s> i do not know whether he has read gerald leachs report <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree that it is not really very instructive to look at the overall totals of staff employed in departments and that you have to see how many people are <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister really able to say that valuable technical conclusions were reached in a forum where most of the soviet participants by all accounts were not scientists at all but kgb officers <e> <s> can the minister say whether there was any response whatsoever to the forthright and encouraging statement made by the noble lord lord todd or whether the government will still continue to press for the release of distinguished scientists like shcharansky and sakharov before they continue with exchanges of the kind which took place in hamburg <e>", "<cs> my lords while warmly endorsing the tributes that have been paid to the noble lord the foreign secretary and the governor lord soames may i respectfully agree with the noble lord that we cannot claim to have achieved ultimate success until a stable government are in power in zimbabwe <e> <s> would not one method of helping to ensure the success of the government which will take office under

if some of the whites leave as they are bound to do <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the existence of reserved lines and the threat of a possible motorway construction causes a blight affecting property values in the area and that many people in the vicinity of the proposed m motorway extension have been thereby prevented from selling their houses except at ridiculously low prices for many years <e> <s> in these matters certainty is what is required and therefore once the department has considered the representations that have been made they should put an end to all schemes for the indefinite future <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord agree that it is not only the soviet invasion of afghanistan which should prompt us to consider declining to attend the olympic games in moscow but also the soviet assistance to the repressive regime in ethiopia which is murdering and persecuting many thousands of citizens in eritrea and the ogaden and also the intensified persecution of dissenters within the boundaries of the soviet union itself <e> <s> will the noble lord not agree therefore that the advice given to the british olympic association that they should not take part in the games would not be rescinded simply as a result of the soviet union agreeing to the carrington plan on afghanistan <e> <s> the soviet union would have to show willing on these other matters as

a report by the organisation of american states confirming that torture has been used universally as an instrument of policy in that country <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister not aware that an honourable friend reputedly put down a question on the order paper in another place concerning the sale of arms by this country to <e>", "<cs> the minister said there was nothing in the bill about the powers of governing bodies a point that was touched on by the noble baroness lady david <e> <s> would it not be desirable for the committee to direct its attention to this subject while we have the opportunity in debating this amendment <e> <s> we seldom look at the powers of the governing bodies and if we let this opportunity pass during the proceedings on this bill there may not be another chance of returning to it for many years <e>", "<cs> will the noble baroness remind us whether the william tyndale school which was the school i was thinking of had governing bodies and whether its powers were in theory sufficient to deal with the crisis that arose there <e> <s> what was the sum aspect of the dispute other than the articles which led to the impasse <e>", "<cs> i should like to say one more word before we conclude on this amendment <e> <s> it seemed to me that the noble baroness lady david was aiming at parity of treatment between the primary and secondary schools <e> <s> if the government are really prepared to think in terms of the local education authorities approving the statutes of both primary and secondary schools this could have been a way round it that nobody had thought of before this debate <e> <s> one possible solution would be for this amendment to be withdrawn on the undertaking that on report stage the noble baroness would bring forward an amendment that would give parity of treatment by causing the local education authorities to have the responsibility for both sets of articles <e> <s> i do not know whether this would be acceptable to the noble baroness lady david and her colleagues but certainly it would achieve that part of what she set out to do <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that the noble lord lord belstead has missed something rather than the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge <e> <s> he has missed the perfectly clear distinction which exists between the making of the arrangements for the admission of pupils to a particular school on the one hand and the publication of those arrangements so that parents know what they are on the other hand <e> <s> as i understand it the noble lord lord donaldson has not said that the arrangements for the admission of the pupils shall be taken away from the governors of aided or special agreement schools but simply that when once the governors have come to such an arrangement for the admission of pupils it will then be the responsibility of the local education authority to publish them <e>", "<cs> may i be helpful and put another suggestion which i think will satisfy the minister and my noble friend <e> <s> why not have a duty to publish laid on the governors of the aided or special agreement schools and on the local authorities <e> <s> in that case the governors of the aided schools could as is suggested send out the particulars of the arrangements for the admission of pupils to a wider area but they would also be available in the comprehensive document which would be distributed by the local education authority to the parents within the area of the local authority itself thus satisfying both requirements <e>", "<cs> may i say how useful it is to have the notes on clauses and to thank the government for providing them <e>", "<cs> it would be unpopular to enter into a discussion on the minefield of examination results at this late hour because so much

baroness for her to take on board during the consultations which she said will cover this subject as well as all the rest <e> <s> if i may say in passing it seems a little peculiar to me that at this stage the government have such definite ideas about the publication of examination results when as the noble baroness has told us she has not yet even started on the process <e>", "<cs> i think that

school with substantial laboratory facilities the amount that would be properly spent per child would be very much higher than in a school where the main subjects are in the field of the arts <e> <s> if therefore the amendment moved by the noble lord lord stewart of fulham were to be accepted the parents would need certain additional information <e>", "<cs> the noble lord may not be surprised that

request had been granted there would have been no question of having to cut any of the orchestras as they are being cut now <e> <s> will the minister take this one back and reconsider the refusal of

demand would be expected would they not to continue as far ahead as the eye can see <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs>

rolling stock on the tanzam railway <e> <s> might it not be a good idea to enter into discussions with the zambian authorities with a view to offering them the facilities of the british rail workshops

learned lord lord scarman <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may interrupt the noble baroness may i say that despite thehear hearfrom her front bench the home office ministers have said that they do not in any way criticise the custom of arranged marriages as such but only arranged marriages which as they claim are used by men to get into this country for economic motives <e> <s> does not the noble baroness understand that only some arranged marriages arc being stopped by these rules and that the vast majority of them will be allowed to continue as before <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not read the labour party document to which the minister has just referred but i certainly agree with it that the existing rules are arbitrary racist and unjust <e> <s> to prove that in the majority of cases which i have submitted to the present minister of state since the tory government came into office he has decided outside the rules that the particular claimant should be given the benefit of the doubt and should be allowed to remain here in the exercise of his discretion <e> <s> that means that the existing rules before these were introduced were already causing serious hardship which could be remedied only by ministerial intervention <e> <s> i think the noble lord lord belstead knows this perfectly well because sometimes when his honourable friend has not been there he has had to deal with some of the correspondence <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join with the noble baroness in pressing this amendment on the government <e> <s> i do so in the hope that it may commend itself to the minister as her colleague the noble lord lord belstead promised on more than one occasion when we were discussing it at an early hour in the morning that he would take it away and have another look at it <e> <s>

good practice as the minister has said and i accept that you can require local authorities to adopt good practices <e> <s> as i read this amendment that is all that is being asked for that they should be under a duty to ensure that so far as possible confidentiality is maintained <e> <s> no uniform system of ensuring confidentiality is being imposed on the local authorities from above <e> <s> they

the soviet union near sverdlovsk which have been taken up by the united states can the noble lord arrange to have assembled in the library of your lordships house all the reports which have come to the notice of the government regarding this alleged release of anthrax pathogens so that noble lords may judge for themselves what validity there is in the allegations and if they were found to be true can the noble lord say whether it would be contrary to the convention which he has mentioned and whether we would take the responsibility for raising this matter at the united nations <e>", "<cs>

the european economic communities for free distribution and another one showing a sack labelled given by the italian people which was captured on the battlefield of nacfa by the eritrean peoples

ethiopia and that he did not know how much had taken place <e> <s> in view of these facts should not the eec and the british donors in particular carry out a thorough investigation to discover the extent of illegal diversion of humanitarian supplies and decide whether or not they should continue <e>", "<cs> my lords did not the noble lord say that this evidence had come from higher up the chain <e> <s> is it not intrinsically unlikely that such evidence which would have to emanate from within the rehabilitation agency of the ethiopian government would become known to us or to anybody in the

particular to look at what has happened on the battlefields of eritrea <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister not agree that it is highly desirable for the commission so far as possible to attempt to harmonise the rules on genetic manipulation with those to be introduced in the united states <e> <s> bearing in mind that a great many of the companies which are involved in this field are multinationals and can readily move their research and development and indeed their production from one country to another and that they will tend to go where the regulations are least onerous <e> <s>

that more restrictive rules would be necessary in europe <e>", "<cs> my lords as the home office has decided to act in the issuing of work permits for catering and hotel staff was this not the main basis on which the few hundred work permits were being awarded in the last few years and is it not a fact that the employers in the hotel and catering industry only find it difficult to obtain english labour because their wages are so much less than can be obtained in other occupations <e>", "<cs> my lords was it not alleged on very good authority that the libyans supplied arms to the ira <e> <s> does the noble lord think it is a good idea for our european allies to sell arms to a country which is prepared to do such a despicable thing <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that there will be great disappointment that he has resiled from the categorical statement that he made in the house on th march that we would not export arms to a country which is guilty of torture <e> <s> is he also aware that that statement is readily monitored and policed whereas the general assurances that he has given following his predecessors that we take into consideration human rights factors in the sale of arms are very difficult to evaluate in particular cases <e> <s> however in the case of argentina which he was talking about the other day when he said that we would not export arms to a country which is guilty of torture does the fact that we would not sell arms of a particular kind where they could be used against the civilian population show that we recognise the truth of the assertions which have now been made following many others such as those by amnesty international in the recent report of the inter-american human rights commission which indicated that torture is still prevalent in that country <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister recall that a few years ago the south of scotland electricity board conducted a feasibility study in the pinkston area of glasgow and came to the conclusion that it was marginally uneconomic on the assumptions made of required return by the treasury and the future increases in the cost of coal <e> <s> in view of the fact that the government are now committed to undertaking a feasibility study would not one possible way forward <e>", "<cs> my lords does the answer of the minister to the noble baroness to the effect that all parties will be involved in the inquiry mean that they will not be represented on the body which is to conduct the inquiry and that therefore it has already been decided to have an internal departmental inquiry to which the political parties would merely be able to give evidence <e> <s> if that is so does the minister recognise that it would be profoundly unsatisfactory to do this behind closed doors and that what the public in london demand in particular the parents and teachers in inner london is that the examination should be conducted both thoroughly and in public <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that while it is very welcome to hear him say that the members of the commission for racial equality are free to make criticism of government policy it just so happens that the five commissioners who have been sacked were those who favoured a more active role and were most strongly critical of government policy <e> <s> is the minister further aware that these particular five commissioners were the ones who voted for the commission to undertake an investigation of immigration policies whereas the other commissioners who have remained in office were those who voted for it not to undertake such an investigation <e> <s> it therefore looks to many of us outside that this was the approximate reason for their sacking and that the general reason was that they favoured a more active role for the commission <e>", "<cs> my lords although the government have been in office for only one year does not the noble lord the minister recall taking part in a debate on the working party over two years ago in which he expressed some opinions so that the government did not come into office without having considered the problem <e> <s> why therefore were they unable to introduce legislation based on the sensible remarks that the noble lord made when in opposition <e>", "<cs> my lords quite apart from the review of the public order act which is being conducted by the home secretary is there not an important question of resources which must be devoted to these demonstrations <e> <s> would he not agree that the fact that public order was maintained

given us about the review of section of the local government act which is now being conducted by his right honourable friend <e> <s> i welcome his hint that perhaps the criteria for the award of section aid might be changed by administrative means that would not require legislation because whether or not your lordships agree to give this bill a second reading this evening i had not anticipated that it would go through all its stages in both houses by the summer recess but i simply felt that by means of the committee stage we should be able to ventilate some of the problems raised in the other place and which i mentioned earlier <e>", "<cs> my lords if the contemplated yield is much lower than the rate of inflation indicates and the institutional investors market is expecting the rate of inflation to come down within the period of the stocks then if their expectations are not realised is it not incorrect to say that the burden of interest on future generations

a bill to amend section of the street offences act <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the green paper say that one of the matters for consideration is whether the police should have power to ban or divert a march when they are not reasonably confident of being able to prevent a serious threat to public order from within their own resources <e> <s> would it not be useful if consideration could also be given to the question of giving powers within greater london where the police in a division cannot be reasonably confident of containing a serious threat to public order within the resources of their division so that demonstrations costing up to half a million pounds like the recent one in lewisham which are of a purely local nature and the disturbances in southall might also be mentioned in this context could be banned or diverted by the police in that area <e>", "<cs> my lords although the whole house will wish to endorse the sentiments of the noble lord lord boston of faversham my noble friend lord wigoder and the right reverend prelate the bishop of london i should like to ask the minister about the present position of the hostages and their relatives <e> <s> is he aware that since they were released from the embassy the hostages have been held <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the minister consider that we are lacking in a sense of proportion if we can spend half a million pounds as he told the house the other day on protecting a handful of fascist thugs in lewisham but cannot establish and maintain a police presence on the underground which would deter these bullies from frightening and intimidating members of the travelling public every friday and saturday evening particularly when there is a football match <e> <s> can we not increase the presence of uniformed police on the underground so as to act as a deterrent <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the minister agree that we have made some efforts in the past including at previous review meetings of the helsinki agreement to persuade the soviet union to honour the undertakings which they entered into freely particularly those concerned with the freedom of expression and the emigration of people who wish to join their relatives abroad <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that in particular a conference was held just last weekend in amsterdam attended by the former prime minister of portugal former ambassador andrew young and many other distinguished persons which unanimously issued a demand for the release of the prisoner of

considering whether or not to <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that it is not yet a provision of our law that preventive detention especially for first offenders should be imposed on anyone who is inclined to shoplift and that to keep someone in prison for five weeks as mrs de-silva was when the offence for which she was convicted was thought worthy of a fine which was immediately paid

every possible step should be taken to reduce the overcrowding particularly in this prison which is far worse than the average of prisons in england and wales <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble and learned lord aware that the statement in question was made during the debate on defence sales by the minister who was speaking from the front bench opposite and that he made the statement in order to deflect a question that i put to him concerning the governments policy on the sale of arms to regimes which practised torture and to argentina in particular <e> <s> the noble lord then on the front bench opposite said that it all depends on what you mean by torture and that for instance this country had been convicted of torture in the european court of human rights <e> <s> therefore is it not vitally important that this misstatement by the minister should be <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the noble lord lord gisborough was not alone in feeling some anxiety that proper

"<cs> my lords it is about three and a half years since we last debated the proposal which is embodied in the bill now before your lordships house a proposal which i was prompted to reintroduce when i read the reports of the speech of the home secretary of st march when he said that measures had to be taken as a matter of urgency to prevent the prison population from growing any further than it already has <e> <s> he remarked in that speech that five years ago his predecessor mr roy jenkins had said that a prison population of would be intolerable and yet it had already reached a figure of

the age of three <e> <s> other provisions have to be made where a child is aged over three and these are the occasions on which the child has to be received into care <e>", "<cs> my lords on this point i obtained some figures from an inner city probation department in sheffield today <e> <s> the department told me that in the -month period between january and may women were given sentences for soliciting by the magistrates courts in sheffield and among those women six had either a child or groups of children who were received into care as a consequence of their mothers sentence <e> <s> i do

large number of children into care purely as a result of the convictions for soliciting <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may intervene the noble baroness might also have reminded the house that out of all those people she has mentioned on that committee there was only one woman <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord remind us whether in the courts had power to award suspended sentences or has that

overseas <e> <s> will he take every opportunity to emphasise that ever since the figures were first recorded the number of people leaving this country each year has exceeded the number of those arriving <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord not agree in relation to the figures which he gave of the number of overstayers that the vast majority of these people are people who have no intention of settling permanently in the united kingdom but are for example students who have omitted to renew their leave to remain in the united kingdom while they are continuing to pursue a course of studies and that this is no reason to assume just because they have not complied exactly with the home office formalities that they will ultimately seek to remain here permanently <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord agree that if higher standards of insulation were to be prescribed for new dwellings and more resources were to be made available to local authorities and individuals to improve the standards of insulation in existing dwellings a considerable fraction of the million which he mentioned as going to the poorer consumers could be saved <e> <s> also what cost benefit analyses have been undertaken by the government so as to reach the conclusion that the present levels of insulation prescribed and the present levels of grants to local authorities and individuals are the optimum <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say first on what date the report of the law commission was laid before ministers and why it has not yet been published when it was already in print on th june when another place debated this matter <e> <s> will he accept the home secretarys assertion made in that place that it would not lead to widespread criticism of this law merely to repeal it and then in substance to re-enact it under another name <e> <s> will he also accept that the existence of the law commission does not absolve parliament from its duty of repealing obsolete and archaic legislation <e> <s> and finally can the minister say what observations or recommendations were in the report of the law commission that were not ventilated in your lordships house when this matter was debated on th december <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord will be kind enough when he does that to let me have the figures also <e> <s> if i may repeat my former questions as the noble lord invited me to do will he agree that the existence of bodies such as the law commission or the criminal law revision committee does not absolve parliament from its responsibility to deal promptly with archaic and obsolete laws such as the vagrancy act and will he tell the house what aspects of the vagrancy act were dealt with in the report of the law commission and were not debated in your lordships house when i introduced a bill to repeal section on th december i mean th december <e> <s> furthermore may i ask the noble lord whether he has not already had views from many of the bodies that he mentioned including the commission for racial equality which has expressed itself fairly forthrightly on the subject <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say whether the exhibitions to which he refers are on the same scale and are supported with the same extensive back-up by the government as the recent defence sales exhibition in aldershot <e> <s> if that is so can the noble lord very kindly tell the house how much was spent by the ministry of defence on that exhibition and which exhibitions concerned with sales to developing countries are supported on a comparable scale <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree that whatever conclusions may be drawn from the statistics collected this year they will already be out of date because on st january it is the intention of her majestys government to charge overseas students for any medical treatment that they receive under the national health service <e> <s> so on top of the burden of the increased fees they will have to pay for an insurance policy to take care of this eventuality <e> <s> will the government continue the assembly of the statistics into next year so that the deterrent effect of the large increases in fees plus the charges for medical treatment can be fully taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that if there are any foreign troops from cuba in angola they are there at the invitation of the government and not for the purpose of carrying out hostilities against the people of angola <e> <s> could the minister say what is the status of the prisoners who were taken by the south african military when they invaded angola <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister admit that extortionate interest rates are one of the main causes of the large numbers of liquidations in private industry and that in the long run it will be inflationary if domestic companies are supplanted in the home markets by foreign competitors whose prices are not under the control of the government <e>", "<cs> naturally we all agree with the minister that unnecessary ministerial powers over local authorities should be eliminated wherever possible and that government should reside as close to the people as is practicable <e> <s> however we are arguing in this amendment that perhaps some degree of ministerial control beyond what has been conceded by the noble earl opposite is required and that perhaps experience shows that local authorities may not be trusted entirely to exercise the powers that provide allotments as the minister would advocate <e>", "<cs> under section of the small holdings and allotments act the secretary of state is supposed to be obliged to report annually to parliament on the state of allotment provision and the reason given by the government for the abolition of this section is that it has not been invoked <e>", "<cs> the war is over <e>", "<cs> if i may intervene before the noble lord lord sandford deals with that reply may i ask the minister whether he does not consider that local authorities do a great many things as a matter of common sense which they are not obliged to do by statute <e> <s> it would be quite a simple matter for the refuse disposal officer in the district authority simply to get to the telephone and talk to the person in charge of highways to make sure that whatever he proposes does not create a traffic hazard <e> <s> this would occur in the normal course of events whether he was obliged to do it or not <e> <s> so why must we have a power in the statute compelling him to enter into those consultations and to obtain the formal approval of someone in the highways authority for him to do something which he is going to do anyway <e>", "<cs> i think that we have already discussed amendment no <e> <s> a in connection with an earlier amendment <e> <s> the noble viscount lord ridley explained that this schedule originally appeared in the local government planning and land no <e> <s> bill and then it mysteriously vanished like the smile of the cheshire cat as he put it and

someone i would have expected to see giving support to the opposition front bench <e> <s> it must be a unique occasion in this house for him to have done so <e> <s> it is a tribute to the noble lord lord bruce of donington and the forcefulness with which he put the amendments that the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls has been so convinced by them <e> <s> the noble lord lord bruce of donington did himself an injustice when he said it was very difficult in dealing with these accounting matters to make ones speeches interesting <e> <s> both on the last amendment and on this one i found everything he had to say interesting and of great importance not only to the local authorities themselves but to the ratepayers who have to study these matters and try to make some sense out of them <e>", "<cs>

now was one which relieved the local authorities of the obligation to show certain capital assets separately under each of the headings and therefore it becomes impossible not difficult for them to measure the rate of return <e>", "<cs> could i add one <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble and learned lord will explain one feature of the clause <e> <s> i hesitate to burden the committee with technical questions at this late hour but i notice that in subsection there is a provision for transitional relief about which the secretary of state may make regulations in respect of hereditaments the net

state to include in that report <e> <s> what mechanism would there be for resolving any dispute that there may be between the secretary of state and the treasury when the matter is submitted to them for their approval <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the first question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords do not those figures show that the use of rule is increasing <e> <s> bearing in mind that segregation is a form of punishment which is inflicted on a prisoner without any charges being preferred against him without his being given an opportunity of a hearing before a tribunal of any kind would it not at least be proper to make a rule that a prisoner should be given a notice when he is placed on rule explaining even if only in broad terms the reasons for it so that he can contest them if he thinks that it is unjust <e> <s> can the minister also say whether any psychiatric advice is sought on the effects of segregating a prisoner for considerable periods at a time and whether within the totals that the noble lord has given there are any records of a person spending longer than three months continuously on rule bearing in mind that although it provides for only one month the period can be extended indefinitely <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord recall writing to me only the other day stating that a particular individual prisoner was placed on segregation under rule because he was alleged to have fermented dissent within the prison where he was confined <e> <s> therefore was that not used as a form of punishment in this case <e> <s> is it not true that in many instances a prisoner who is thought to be a trouble-maker but against whom specific charges cannot be preferred is treated in this manner <e> <s> can the noble lord reply to the first part of my original supplementary question in which i asked whether he considered that it was just and proper that a prisoner who is segregated for reasons of good order and discipline should at least be given a notice stating that he has been so treated and explaining in broad terms the reasons for it <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that in the opinion of mind whom i have consulted about this matter the number of remands in custody for psychiatric reports is grossly excessive and that the figures that he gave certainly confirm that epithet <e> <s> bearing in mind the home secretarys expressed wish to reduce the prison population does not the noble lord think that where magistrates are considering asking for a psychiatric report they should be advised to inquire whether the accused could attend as an out-patient for that purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords while the ministers figures show that following circular of a reduction has been effected in the number of persons remanded in custody for psychiatric reports would he not agree that there is still cause for concern and will he at least consider the possibility of reducing the power of magistrates to remand such persons in custody where there is no previous history of mental illness and the person has answered to bail <e>", "<cs> can i assist the noble lord by pointing out that the act does not in fact apply to scotland <e>", "<cs> no it does not <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether there is a slight confusion in the minds of noble lords opposite in that they think that because the felixstowe docks is now a subsidiary of european ferries it must be ancillary to the business of european ferries and that therefore the main purpose of the undertaking is that of european ferries and felixstowe docks is covered by this amendment <e> <s> if the noble earl can stand up and give us an assurance that the meaning of this amendment is such that it covers the felixstowe docks and i very much doubt whether he can give any such undertaking then of course my noble friend would perhaps be more satisfied that he is at the moment <e> <s> but on any reasonable construction of these words i do not see how it can be pretended that it covers the case he has put forward <e>", "<cs> surely the noble earl can answer the question <e> <s> does this amendment or does it not cover the case of the felixstowe docks <e> <s> yes or no <e>", "<cs> i am not sure whether the minister was suggesting that simply because the order had been revoked the owners who might have suffered interim loss during the period when the scheme was in force had now had their property restored to its original value <e> <s> if that is what he was seeking to imply then it certainly is not correct because if one looks at properties that are in the immediate neighbourhood of the m one sees that there is no doubt at all that they are valued at considerably lower prices than are equivalent houses some distance away <e> <s> the reason for this is that there has been neglect by property owners of premises which they thought were under the threat of being demolished or which came very near to the line of the motorway <e> <s> they did not see any purpose in spending money on properties which in any case had depreciated in value <e> <s> so the character of the neighbourhood has declined very sharply over the very many years that this scheme has been hanging over the head of the locality <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the person concerned miss wilson or friends acting on her behalf lodged an affidavit with <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the noble lord lord strathcona and mount royal in a subsequent debate on the governments policy on arms sales generally retracted the unequivocal statement that we would not sell arms to a country guilty of torture

<s> is the noble lord aware that it is impossible to make any such clear distinction and that if we are to stand up and be counted in matters of human rights we ought not to sell arms not only to countries like chile but also to argentina and ethiopia and any country found guilty of atrocities against its own populations <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the minister for that helpful reply and for the reassurances which he has given particularly the one concerning the amendment which he says the government propose to table at report stage obliging local authorities to publish any proposals for the diversion of open space to other use and to consider the objections which ratepayers or other interested parties may lodge to those proposals <e> <s> it would be only wise for us to examine what the government have in mind and to see whether the rights of the objectors are deemed to be satisfactory by the green belt council and the other interests concerned <e> <s> so until we can do that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the practice which is being followed so frequently of ministers promising to write to an individual member is highly unsatisfactory <e>", "<cs> since previously the government very helpfully have been able to provide us with notes on clauses so that we have the same briefs as are available to the government surely they could do the same in respect of new clauses that they have tabled more recently <e> <s> if the noble lord the minister has in front of him a note analogous to those notes on clauses of which we have a vast pile available to us could he not on future occasions when such amendments are tabled ensure that we have those notes as well <e>", "<cs> i do not want to prolong the discussion on this particular schedule but i want to take up one of the points just made by the noble lord from the opposition front bench regarding the form of accounts which is laid down in part iii of this schedule <e> <s> i should like to ask the minister when he replies to the very reasonable questions that have already been put to him to look at paragraph which provides that the secretary of state may notify the corporation of information which is to be contained <e>", "<cs> i must apologise in advance for detaining your lordships at greater length than have some other noble lords who have spoken <e> <s> it is because there is a great deal of meat in these amendments tabled by the noble lord lord irving and ably moved by the noble baroness lady david <e> <s> they should not be allowed to pass without some examination and i am sorry to say in certain respects criticism <e> <s> if one looks first at amendment no <e> <s> b the caravan sites bill of the last government which was introduced by the noble baroness lady stedman whom i am glad to see is in her place repealed the whole of subsection of section of the act <e> <s> as the noble baroness pointed out when moving the second reading of that bill it was proposed at that time to abolish the limit on the duty of the metropolitan county councils and the london boroughs to provide for only caravans in each district or borough as well as to repeal the power of the secretary of state to grant exemptions from the duty to provide any sites on the grounds of lack of suitable land <e> <s> it was then further proposed to repeal the exemptions that were granted to county boroughs because they had had no gipsy population in the five years prior to st april <e>", "<cs> yes i did in fact mislead your lordships <e> <s> i had intended to put down an amendment to amendment b removing the -pitch limit <e> <s> i omitted to do that but hasten to declare that i shall rectify that on report stage <e>", "<cs> i do not think it was ever suggested by cripps that the targets should be imposed by central government on local authorities but that if as a result of the discussion process the total of the provisions which the counties intended to make as notified to the government did not add up to the same figures as the known population there could be another round of consultations to see whether any improvements could be effected in the contributions of individual authorities <e> <s> so the process would be consultative rather than compulsory <e>", "<cs> it is not for me to reply to the amendments but if i may enlighten the noble baroness a gipsy according to the definition in the act is a person of nomadic habit irrespective of racial or ethnic origin <e> <s> that means for example that the irish tinkers are equally gipsies within the meaning of that act as is the true romany <e> <s> i did not with great respect single out the true romany for attention in the remarks that i made because the provision which i am suggesting local authorities ought to be making and which should have been included in the programme recommended by sir john cripps in paragraph of his report applied equally to everybody who lived in caravans whether they were romany in origin or not <e>", "<cs> i agree with the noble baroness once again that the scrap remnants which result from the processing of old cars and so on create an unsightly mess on the borders of main roads <e> <s> for that reason it is important that the permissive powers contained in the act to provide working areas in the neighbourhood of residential sites should also be properly utilised by the local authorities <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord could answer one brief question while we are dealing with amendments to the long title <e> <s> as his colleague has just said the long title must accurately reflect what is in the bill and this change obviously is unnecessary from that point of view <e> <s> but there have been other changes made during the course of the passage of the bill through your lordships house which do not seem to be reflected in amendments to the long title <e> <s> i am thinking particularly of the amendments that we have made to the highways act <e> <s> does this mean that at some future date noble lords opposite will be bringing forward an amendment to the long title for that purpose as well <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord ask her majesty to keep th november free just in case <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord not agree that in the last year because of the military operations of the ethiopian regime against the subject peoples of eritrea western somalia and tigre starvation in those areas has become widespread and that the united nations high commissioner as well as the authorities in the sudan and somalia has made desperate appeals to the world for help <e> <s> what contribution have her majestys government made towards this need and what extra pledges were made at the meeting to which this question refers to help those particular refugees and starving millions in the horn of africa <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that everyone would welcome his assurance that the government are willing to play a constructive part in the discussions that will take place in mexico though we might have preferred the government themselves to have taken an initiative on this matter rather than to follow the steps of others <e> <s> but in preparation for this conference will the noble lord or his colleagues in the foreign office consider holding a meeting in the united kingdom at which agencies such as oxfam and war on want might be able to give the benefit of their advice to the government so that a more constructive part can be played than would otherwise be possible <e>", "<cs> my lords in the discussions at madrid will the noble lord and his colleagues pay particular attention to the provisions regarding reunification of families in the helsinki accords and to the cases of victor korchnoi whose wife and son have been prevented from leaving the soviet union to join him in switzerland and more recently that of anatoly shcharansky who we now hear is desperately ill in the prison camp where he is confined and is being prevented from joining his wife avatali in israel <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord confirm that the united states government has published a number of documents confirming the possession of these weapons by the soviet union <e> <s> will the noble lord arrange for copies of those documents to be obtained and placed in the library of the house <e> <s> secondly can he confirm that reports have appeared that chemical weapons have not only been used in afghanistan but have been stockpiled in ethiopia for use against the eritrean peoples liberation front <e> <s> will he obtain copies of any evidence to that effect and also place it in the library of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl said that noble lords must have passes <e> <s> however is he aware that i have <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords as parliament has decided that the commission for racial equality has power to conduct investigations of certain types and the courts have now declared that these investigations could properly extend to the workings of the immigration control system would not the obstruction of the proposed inquiry by the government either by the withholding of information or in any other way be to cock a snook both at the courts and at parliament <e> <s> would not the noble lord in particular agree that he should now make available to the commission for racial equality copies of the instructions given to immigration officers which go to the heart of this matter and since that would amount to publication will he place copies of those instructions as he has been asked to do many times before in the library of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords while taking up the point that the noble lord made that these were friendly proceedings between the commission for racial equality and the home office would it not be an extremely unfriendly act if having reached a decision in the courts the home office was to refuse to comply with the spirit of that judgment as well as the letter <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord read the whole letter <e> <s> because not every noble lord will have received a copy of it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to burden the noble lord with reading so much of the letter but i think that what is happening illustrates the undesirability of the practice to which i have drawn attention in the past of ministers writing to certain noble lords with information about matters discussed at committee stages when the rest of the house is in ignorance of what those letters contain <e>", "<cs> my lords before we part with these amendments may i say this <e> <s> first of all on the question of letters i agree with the minister that it would be impracticable for him to send some thousand or so letters to every single member of the house on a matter which is clearly of interest to a few of them <e> <s> but i believe that those who took part at the committee stage in the debate on the question of allotments were entitled to receive copies of the letter in possession of the noble lord lord davies of leek <e> <s> it might have been courteous if that had been done by the department <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful if i may speak again for the assurance which the noble lord has given that he would accept the amendment if it were tabled at another part of the bill <e> <s> i shall certainly do that <e> <s> with regard to amendment no <e> <s> the preamble to these offences in section reads <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the minister who certainly covered the points raised in the amendments extremely thoroughly and we shall have to look carefully at the points that he has made <e> <s> i am sure he would agree that notwithstanding the fact that he would not agree to increase the penalties as provided in amendments nos <e> <s> and a person who suffers any damage in consequence of a highway authority failing to maintain the highway or the statutory undertaker failing to restore the highway after works have been undertaken would have a remedy in civil law <e> <s> if it can be proved that the highway has not been maintained to a proper standard because of the negligence of the highway authority or the statutory undertaker then of course the person who suffers damage would be able to recover substantial amounts of money in the courts <e> <s> so in effect there is a built-in fine for authorities who negligently fail to maintain the highway or to restore it after works have been undertaken <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords does the position of her majestys

film were to be made on the same lines as the war game in colour and brought up-to-date with the most recent knowledge on the effects of a nuclear bombardment would the minister give an undertaking not to interfere with the making of such a film or the showing of it on television <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will allow me to intervene rather than ask him to go into the arithmetical calculation which i am sure the house would not want at this hour of the night may i ask whether it is not possible for the consultation document to which the noble baroness referred to be made available in the printed paper office so that everybody can study how the calculations are supposed to be performed <e>", "<cs> my lords does that mean that the noble lord has sent out per cent <e> <s> more letters <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister saying in dealing with the terms and conditions that the minister has power to direct that the land be disposed of within a given time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid what the minister has said this evening comes as an extreme disappointment to me not because i had imagined that the alterations in the new clauses that i was putting before the house made them perfect but i thought that having done my best to try to demonstrate the principles of the matter the minister would have been seized of those principles and would have agreed at least to take the matter away and come up with some kind of formula which would have paid the people concerned some amount which would remain to be determined but which would satisfy them for the very many years of discomfort injustice and financial hardship that they have suffered <e>", "<cs> may i follow the noble lord lord renton and first of all apologise for not having been here earlier <e> <s> this is a matter of particular concern to me because i have twice tried to amend the street offences act so as to abolish the penalty of imprisonment for soliciting <e> <s> indeed i had a substantial measure of support in your lordships house for that proposition <e>", "<cs> i venture to inflict one further sentence on the committee and that is to remark that in saying that this amendment has nothing to do with the case the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor may have overlooked the sentence in the long title of the bill which reads <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say whether any lessons were learned from this exercise about the ability of small numbers of infantry using modern laser-guided anti-tank weapons to stop an armoured thrust in central europe and what conclusions we may draw from this regarding the effectiveness of the limited numbers of troops we can deploy in germany to counter the possibility of invasion from the east <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister consider the more limited objective of the americans agreeing not to proceed with the construction of bases in somalia on the grounds that the soviet union and the cubans would agree to withdraw from ethiopia <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say one word and i shall not prolong this debate <e> <s> i find it unsatisfactory that any noble lord should attempt to rule the house by insinuation as the noble lord opposite has attempted to do <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i stand by that word <e> <s> to stand up at the end of lord bruces remarks and make reference to them as being undesirable in some way as if that were to be the same thing as impermissible is really not to direct the house in the proper way that it should be going <e> <s> if indeed anything that the noble lord lord bruce had done was impermissible under the standing orders then the proper moment to have raised it was right at the beginning of the debate or if i may say so it could have been done through the usual channels when the noble lords amendments first appeared on the order paper <e> <s> if there was anything improper in putting down a large number of amendments as the noble lord has done to leave out certain clauses then that could have been taken up through the opposition whips and perhaps if it was contrary to the procedure of the house the noble lord would have seen fit to withdraw them <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that many people in the falkland islands view with the greatest alarm these conversations that mr nicholas ridley has had with the military authorities in argentina and that bearing in mind that people have totally disappeared into thin air in that country and no explanation has ever been vouchsafed by the authorities in spite of comprehensive investigations by the inter-american commission on human rights this is a rgime to which the people of the falkland islands quite understandably do not want to be subjected <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord suggest to his right honourable friend the prime minister that mr heseltine be replaced by sir murray maclehose <e>", "<cs> my lords if the suggestion made by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter was accepted would it not mean that the electricity council would have to increase its charges at an earlier date than would otherwise be the case and would not the administrative costs of making a repayment such as he suggests ultimately fall on the consumer <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not putting pressure on the islanders for the minister mr ridley to go and negotiate in buenos aires on proposals which have not been submitted to the test of popular opinion in the islands themselves <e> <s> was not that the main reason why mr ridley received such an adverse send-off from the islanders when he left recently <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that when spot checks have been made in the past on the employment of disabled persons by local authorities and public bodies including some of the largest local authorities they have been found to employ fewer than the statutory quota of disabled persons <e> <s> one of the major contributions that the government could make is in monitoring the performance of all public bodies and urging them to fulfil their duties in this respect <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister not agree that fewer new places would be necessary if the government were to implement the report of the advisory council on penal policy on maximum sentences which was published in <e> <s> why have the government not brought before the house measures for implementing those proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord bear in mind that if the government were to do as i suggested not many new prisons would be required <e>", "<cs> my lords could the government say what would be the earliest date on which the general assembly if it were so minded could pass a resolution such as has been suggested by the noble lord lord brockway <e> <s> in view of what the foreign secretary said about progress not being thrown away could he in the meanwhile seek an assurance from the south african authorities that they would be prepared to adhere to the original timetable if such a motion were passed <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister confirm the statement made by sir peter parker recently on television that the london commuter pays two-thirds of the cost of taking him from wherever he lives to the centre of london and back again whereas the average commuter in paris pays only one-third of the cost <e> <s> does the noble earl not think that there is something wrong in such a comparison and that the government should be more generous in the grants that they make to british rail for supporting commuter services <e>", "<cs> like my noble friends i feel very strongly about this matter particularly because i happen to be president of the conservation society which has for years struggled to persuade successive governments to listen to the arguments for doing something about energy conservation and not to leave it entirely to market forces as the noble earl on the government front bench seems to wish <e> <s> i must say that when we have the opportunity as we have today of discussing an energy conservation bill it is our duty to try to see that it does what the title suggests as my noble friend had just said and does not simply introduce some very minor improvements in the governments policy for these matters <e>", "<cs> if the minister put down this amendment primarily with the intention of excluding hot water radiators then i do not think he has been successful because a hot water radiator is an appliance which takes in energy in the form of hot water from the remainder of the central heating system and transmits it into the room by radiation and convection <e> <s> therefore it would still be included within the extended definition as amended <e> <s> the noble earl should have another look at the definition between now and the report stage to sec whether the remarks i have just made do not imply that the radiators which he seeks to exclude are still covered <e>", "<cs> the noble earl has missed the point i was trying to make <e> <s> i was not disagreeing with him in his attempt to exclude radiators from the bill <e> <s> what i am saying is that he has been unsuccessful in modifying the definition so as to exclude radiators <e> <s> i am with him in his intention not to include radiators which he said do not need type approval but i do not think that the amendment tabled by the noble earl achieves that purpose <e>", "<cs> i certainly support the spirit of the amendment although i am not sure that the noble lord lord strathcona has brought it in at quite the right point in the legislation in that what he is really seeking to do is to mitigate the effect of powers conferred on the water authorities by the water act <e> <s> the examples he gave showed that apparently at any rate very unreasonable increases were being made in the charges where somebody as it would be expressed abstracted water for use in power generation thus making it totally uneconomic <e> <s> i do not know whether the individuals concerned knew that would happen before embarking on what was presumably substantial capital expenditure <e>", "<cs> perhaps i might add one or two words to those which have already been spoken by my noble friend and the noble lord lord strabolgi <e> <s> i remember a couple of years ago raising the question of the iied report in your lordships house and my noble friend has reminded me of its excellent proposals for a low-energy strategy for the united kingdom <e> <s> i wonder whatever happened to those proposals <e> <s> during the term of office of the previous administration for several years running i asked for the department of energy to examine a zero-growth energy scenario to see what kind of energy consumption patterns we could afford within such a long-term scenario whether by the use of much better insulation we could accommodate improved energy uses in other directions such as we were discussing a few minutes ago <e> <s> if my noble friends estimates are correct of something like an per cent <e> <s> reduction in primary energy consumption through adopting proper insulation standards in existing dwellings then obviously over the timescale that he was talking about between now and the year we could afford to have a very substantial increase in the other uses of energy within the home without any overall rise in domestic energy consumption <e>", "<cs> before leaving the subject of double glazing i wonder whether the noble earl would agree that the cost effectiveness of double glazing whether in the principal room of the dwelling or anywhere else must depend on what are called the degree days the number of days multiplied by the number of degrees that the temperature falls below a certain level <e> <s> this varies considerably from one part of england and wales to another <e> <s> while double glazing may not be effective in the heart of london where the temperature during the winter is reasonably high if one were on the north east coast of england then there might be a sound economic case for double glazing the whole dwelling <e>", "<cs> my lords may i add to the congratulations which have been expressed already to the noble lord lord trefgarne and wish him well in his new appointment when he takes it up <e> <s> may i ask him whether he is aware that today is the birthday of the distinguished computer scientist anatoly shcharansky who is incarcerated in the perm labour camp where he is prisoner no <e> <s> <e> <s> he has been prevented continuously from joining his wife avital in israel <e> <s> would the noble lord say what progress has been made in the case of persons such as anatoly shcharansky in implementing the family unity provisions of the helsinki final accord <e>", "<cs> my lords notwithstanding the number of train kilometres per members of staff employed would not the noble earl agree with the remark made by the noble lord lord underhill a minute ago that these figures can only be compared between the british and the european railway systems if you know what are the capital investments in those different systems <e> <s> therefore instead of purely looking at productivity per british rail staff should not the noble earl relate that productivity to the amount of total investment <e> <s> and is not this a figure which emerges from the comparison <e>", "<cs> my lords from the tory partys point of view is not this de-nationalisation an admirable way of distracting attention from the fact that the government have dismembered and mutilated most of private industry <e>", "<cs> i have not had the advantage of reading the notes on clauses and that is my fault because i have no doubt they are available in the printed paper office so i beg the noble lords forgiveness if the point i am about to raise is already dealt with there <e> <s> it seems to me from reading this subsection that the onus of proof is placed squarely on the person in whose possession the objects are found <e> <s> i wonder why it was necessary to have a double negative in line of subsection <e>", "<cs> can the minister say how often sentences of imprisonment have been imposed under the existing legislation <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord agree that the noble earls consideration should be confined to an examination of these proposals to see whether they are in effect the same as the ones that the noble lord has presented in his bills on three previous occasions <e> <s> the question of whether or not this is appropriate here has already been determined by your lordships this afternoon provided that the noble lord is advised that <e>", "<cs> i was not going to enter into a discussion on the merits of the amendment because although i listened carefully to the noble viscount lord ridley i am not an expert on the fame islands or on their conservation as a habitat of birds which he claims is being jeopardised <e> <s> however i did want to say one word about the general principles on which the ministers reply was based which seemed to me to be similar to those which applied in his answer to the previous amendment of the noble lord lord northfield <e> <s> i wonder whether it is altogether appropriate if i may venture to say so to the noble earl to rest the ministerial case on the inappropriateness of a particular amendment and the remark that one should not amend other legislation in a piecemeal way by amendments in this bill <e> <s> should not the minister in replying definitively to the noble viscount lord ridley or the noble lord lord northfield address himself to the merits of the amendment itself and not to the question of whether or not they should appear in this bill <e>", "<cs> do we not manage to enforce prohibitions on the import of dogs and cats and are not people sometimes prosecuted for bringing them in unlawfully <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord thinks it is going to be difficult to control the import of cuttings or seeds how does he propose to enforce this provision when persons might be scattering these seeds or planting these cuttings anywhere throughout the country <e> <s> is he going to have an army of inspectors operating throughout the national trust lands and all public open spaces to make sure that people are not planting seeds brought in from sardinia or corsica <e>", "<cs> if the noble baroness was going

months of searching <e>", "<cs> i shall my lords <e>", "<cs> i hope the minister will take this clause away and look at it not only in the light of the debate on this amendment but in the light of previous debates on other amendments as well <e> <s> when the <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord withdraws this amendment may i ask one question <e> <s> this amendment speaks about offences having been committed by a body corporate and then goes on to associate the managers or directors of that body corporate with the offence <e> <s> i can understand very clearly what the noble lord is trying to do if a servant of the body corporate has actually committed the offence but if it is on the instructions of the directors then they should not escape punishment <e> <s> but i wonder whether the noble lord had confined his attention to companies that are incorporated under the companies act and whether there are not other kinds of bodies in which the responsibility might be similarly apportioned between the managers or the proprietors on the one hand and the servants on the other <e>", "<cs> surely if any cruelty to animals is involved proceedings can be taken against the offender under other acts where there may well be imprisonment <e> <s> under the cruelty to animals act no doubt it is possible to send someone to prison for gross cruelty to animals <e> <s> as to whether this is the right place to put the penalty of imprisonment i must say i agree with my noble kinsman lord stanley of alderley in doubting it <e> <s> i think the serious crimes with which we are dealing here are properly punishable with very heavy fines and the minister has been given the power to impose very much greater fines than were in the bill as originally drafted <e> <s> to put on top of this the possibility of the courts sending somebody to prison for up to two years is really excessive <e> <s> i must say to the noble baroness that there are many offences on the statute book which are punishable only by fines and which do <e>", "<cs> does that mean that the noble earl will take the opportunity of letting us know what the decision of the departments has been <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister not agree that if defence spending were maintained at the levels which are planned in any case but the trident programme was not included as a matter of simple arithmetic there

in your lordships house i do not believe that i can recall a day when we have heard three maiden speeches of such uniformly high quality even though each speech was quite different from the others <e> <s> the right reverend prelate gave us some telling examples of the way in which discrimination works at the level of ordinary individual contacts <e> <s> the noble lord lord beloff brought to bear his immense experience of the world of higher education and the noble lord lord jenkins of putney who has just sat down has given us some extremely valuable advice on the role of political parties which i personally should be very delighted to see implemented <e> <s> i have in fact written to every constituency liberal party asking them what steps they have taken to ensure that the minorities are represented when they come to select candidates for parliament and indeed for the local authorities as well <e> <s> i feel that we need to get minorities and indeed women too represented in their due and proper proportions on the local authorities as much as we do in parliament itself <e> <s> i am sure that we all very much hope that we shall hear frequently in the future from all three noble lords <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e>", "<cs> my lords we have been over this ground before <e> <s> the noble lord is telling the house that black people are incapable of discovering for themselves if they were on this inquiry the if you like etiology of these racist attacks because of course all the home office officials who have been appointed to deal with the matter are white <e>", "<cs> you did <e>", "<cs> i shall come to the remarks of the noble lord lord lucas in a moment <e> <s> first i would point out that it was over four years ago that i introduced a bill in your lordships house entitled the road traffic seat belts bill which would have had the same effect as the amendment of the noble lord lord nugent of guildford <e> <s> if one accepts the figures that he gave this afternoon and if your lordships had been pleased to pass that bill in human beings whose lives have ended on our roads since then would have survived and no fewer than serious injuries would have been prevented <e>", "<cs> what alternative hypothesis could the noble lord suggest then <e> <s> he says that there are not any facts and yet rospa of which he is a vice-president and all these other organisations i have mentioned say that there are facts <e> <s> i have mentioned a couple of them <e> <s> if the noble lord really wants to he can go to rospa to the bma and he will soon find himself with boxes full of papers such as i have in my office all pointing to the same conclusion <e> <s> what the noble lord is saying in effect although i agree he did not use these words is that these organisations are trying to distort the meaning of the figures which have been collected so carefully by the transport and road research laboratory and which have been given to the public so that they can find out for themselves whether the claims that are made for the wearing of seat belts are true <e>", "<cs> my lords if the minister is encouraged by the number of new businesses which have been started since the beginning of this year can he tell us how many of them there have been and how many new jobs have been created in those businesses and what are the comparable figures for last year say up to the end of may in each case <e>", "<cs> my lords how can the noble earl be encouraged when he cannot give us the figures <e>", "<cs> my lords on one matter we certainly <e>", "<cs> my lords i was in fact assuming that that had been the case and that i was to speak on the second reading of the bill rather than on the noble and learned lords motion <e> <s> i was about to remark that there is nothing in this measure which is of such great urgency that if we do not pass it there will be a threat to the security of the state or that a failure to pass the bill might damage our chances of economic recovery <e> <s> there will be certain administrative complications if the bill is held over to another session but nothing more than that <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will give way i should just like to say that not everybody in this house would accept mr lyon as the ultimate authority on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be committed to a select committee <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that even in third world countries breast milk is infinitely preferable to artificial substitutes because it contains certain essential nutrients which are vital to the health and development of infants and which are not present in any of the artificial products on the market <e> <s> referring to the code of marketing practice which was adopted in the resolution can the minister say what steps the government are taking to draw this to the attention of firms operating in this country and whether in the resolution there is any method for enforcement <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the minister is aware of the particular case of people who have difficulty in claiming benefit for industrial diseases which have disabled them <e> <s> is the minister aware that in a number of cases about which i have written to the secretary of state recently the process of making a claim has been so lengthy that the patient has died before it has been decided <e> <s> is the noble baroness aware that notwithstanding the availability of these leaflets if they are not drawn to the attention of the patients in the first place they cannot initiate a claim <e> <s> while the secretary of state has said quite properly that a doctor in a nhs hospital cannot be given the duty of informing patients of their possible entitlements where such a patient is diagnosed as suffering from a disease such as mesothelioma or asbestosis the hospital social worker should at least draw the attention of the patient to the relevant leaflet <e>", "<cs> my lords when the secretary of state announced the setting up of the working party to review the charging of foreigners who have been resident in this country for less than three years and when he also announced that the introduction of these charges would be deferred he did not say did he <e> <s> who was going to be on this working party and how interested persons could make representations <e> <s> would the noble baroness circulate in the <e>", "<cs> my lords was not the ministers answer rather disingenuous in that the commission may not arrive at decisions but it does express opinions <e> <s> did not the commission express the opinion in the case of <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask whether while echoing the expressions of sympathy for the police in the appalling casualties they sustained in southall and in liverpool the noble lord does not think that sympathy ought to be expressed also for the asian community in southall who were terrorised insulted and assaulted by the influx of a very large number of skinhead thugs to appear at this pop concert <e> <s> would the noble lord look into the question of how these events come to be arranged since it may be that no one has deliberately attempted to foment disorder but that people who ought to have known better arranged a concert by groups such as the-skins who were known to have a skinhead fascist following in an area where their presence was likely to be provocative <e>", "<cs> i was delighted that the right reverend prelate introduced this amendment and in doing so had as he said the backing not only of the church of england but of all the churches in the british council of churches the roman catholic church and i believe also of the chief rabbi who has expressed opinions of a similar nature on this bill <e> <s> it shows as the right reverend prelate pointed out that we are discussing an issue which goes well beyond the normal cut and thrust of party politics

"<cs> as this may be the only opportunity i shall have during the whole of this committee stage to agree with the minister i think i should say just one or two words in support of the <e>", "<cs> i should like to say a few words on the amendment since it is important that people should understand what is the meaning of the word settled within the context of the bill <e> <s> this can make an enormous difference to their entitlement in a number of respects <e> <s> we are involved here with an idea that is not universally understood <e> <s> the case has arisen and has been put to ministers of the person who might be absent overseas for a period which is within the -year time limit normally applied by the home office to returning residents <e> <s> does he then remain ordinarily resident <e> <s> does he remain settled for the purposes of the bill or of any other legislation <e> <s> the answer that has been given to that question by officials in the home office is that a person who has indefinite leave to remain in this country and who qualifies for re-entry as a returning resident can remain settled here while being temporarily overseas provided he remains ordinarily resident here <e> <s> that seems rather circular but that was the answer that the home office gave to a recent inquiry on this subject <e>", "<cs> while the minister is thinking about that i believe the question of whether a person is or is not ordinarily resident here is amenable to a decision of the courts <e> <s> there is a case which i requested him to look at <e>", "<cs> there is one problem that i mentioned on second reading which the noble lord lord belstead may recall <e> <s> that is the position of refugees <e> <s> a person who comes here as a refugee normally lands and makes application to be treated as a refugee and then as much as two years may elapse before the home office arrive at a decision on the matter <e> <s> the noble lord may have seen the case reported in the <e>", "<cs> i wish to support the noble lord lord pitt in this amendment for several purely practical reasons which i will attempt to outline <e> <s> i accept the point made by the noble baroness that the childs entry into the infants school does not necessarily precede the fifth birthday and therefore the formalities <e>", "<cs> i want to say a word or two in support of the amendment which seems an extremely important one bearing in mind the fact that even lawyers in your lordships committee cannot agree on what the power of the courts will be to review the decision of the secretary of state <e> <s> the noble viscount lord colville of culross has a slightly different view of the extent of the powers of the court from that of the noble lord who moved the amendment <e> <s> whatever the truth may be it is inevitable as in the case of <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that the noble lord has not said enough to convince me that the amendment does not bear critical examination and i hope that he will agree on reflection that this is a matter which we should explore further perhaps not at this late hour but at the report stage <e>", "<cs> my lords following what the noble lord opposite has said will the minister agree that there is widespread misunderstanding throughout the whole of the united states and not merely on the west coast of the present state of affairs in northern ireland <e> <s> while we cannot afford to have as many information officers as we did in the palmy days of long ago could we not make a particular effort at the moment to send people over there with up-to-date information on what is in fact happening in the province so as to counter the propaganda of the ira and in particular the monstrous raising of money publicly by ira supporters for sending weapons into the province thus making the situation far worse <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister mentioned merseyside in particular <e> <s> could he say how many special constables from the ethnic minorities they have been able to recruit in that area <e> <s> would the minister recognise that the police have enormous difficulties in persuading members of the ethnic minorities to come forward either as special constables or as members of the regular police force <e> <s> would the home office give particular attention to the recruitment of these people from the minorities in view of the fact that while they see the police force as being almost entirely white it hinders the good relationships between the police and the ethnic minorities that all of us want to see <e>", "<cs> it certainly has my welcome my lords and my only regret is that it was not seen fit to take the step to abolish sus as it is called when the opportunity was provided to do so on the introduction of my bill more than two years ago <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord stewart of fulham has said we normally accord an unqualified welcome to bills providing for the independence of countries in the commonwealth and we would do so in this case if we were sure that the status of belize was fully safeguarded and that she could enjoy peace within her undisturbed borders as a result of the negotiations that are currently taking place with guatemala <e> <s> everyone would be extremely happy if the long-standing dispute with guatemala can be brought to an end and if that enables belize to proceed to her independence within the timescale that the noble lord the minister has mentioned <e> <s> he pointed out that the united nations had already passed a resolution calling for independence to be reached by the end of this year and that the united kingdom had said that it would do its best to comply with that timescale <e> <s> it is in our interests that we should comply with the time-scale because thereby britain will be relieved of an obligation that has involved the maintenance of our troops in the western hemisphere to protect against the threat of aggression by guatemala <e> <s> as the noble lord has said there have now been signed between the united kingdom and guatemala heads of agreement which at least indicate the way forward to a peaceful settlement of the longstanding dispute <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt for one moment <e> <s> the areas adjacent to the cays are to be explored jointly but that does not say who has sovereignty over the areas either adjacent to the particular cays mentioned in clause of the heads of agreement or elsewhere in the agreement where it is said that in the high seas generally in the neighbourhood of belize there will be arrangements for joint exploration for hydrocarbons <e> <s> can we have assurances that belize will retain sovereignty over these resources even though exploration may be a joint venture <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord confirm that what the noble lord lord pitt said is true <e> <s> that was that somebody who becomes a citizen of belize and who is living in the united kingdom will have no way of knowing that his status has changed and that if he does not take steps to obtain registration within five years he will forfeit that right and will have to pay a very large sum of money indeed to become naturalised if he is qualified <e>", "<cs> in answer to the noble lord opposite the provisions for reducing statelessness in schedule are indeed inadequate in the case that he put and there ought to be provision in the bill for ensuring that where children of british descent are born in countries which do not have <e>", "<cs> then those arrangements are inferior are they not to the ones in clause <e> <s> because they compel the parents to register the child <e>", "<cs> when he speaks about the clause being misused by people who are evilly intended the minister seems to equate the attempt to gain british citizenship with mugging or grievous bodily harm <e> <s> i consider that that is a gross exaggeration and that the noble lord was not thinking very carefully when he used those particular words <e> <s> however i should like to turn to the central point of what the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter is suggesting namely that crown servants should not be in a privileged position <e>", "<cs> why is that better <e> <s> when speaking to the previous amendment the noble and learned advocate said that the procedures in clause were not necessarily inferior to those which were conferred on crown servants by clause <e> <s> i still do not understand how a crown servant is in a less advantageous position when his children obtain citizenship automatically and the people who we are talking about in clause have to apply for citizenship and have to establish that five conditions are complied with <e>", "<cs> the only provision in clause which might conceivably have been in the ministers mind when he was talking about clause in another place is subsection a provision which has already been mentioned in relation to professors and other academics attending overseas universities <e> <s> that provision might be appropriate for academics providing as it does that a person has to be absent from the united kingdom on no more than days in any one of the three years preceding the date of application <e> <s> i assume that that figure was selected with a view to bringing in the academics knowing that the long summer recesses would enable them to come back to the united kingdom and maintain their entitlement under clause <e> <s> it would be extremely unlikely <e> <s> i take it that a missionary who is working in say africa would have such a rich employer that he would be able to send him home every single year and give him as much as days leave <e> <s> while it may be very appropriate from the point of view of the academics i do not think that the honourable gentleman mr timothy raison has quite fulfilled the undertaking which he gave at the committee stage in another place to ensure that missionaries were covered <e>", "<cs> i am really disappointed at the ministers reply <e> <s> i should like to say a few words about the arguments that he has put to your lordships which i do not think are satisfactory at all in particular when he answered the noble baroness lady elles by saying that there are no provisions for statelessness in schedule <e> <s> if we look at the provisions in schedule we see that in order to satisfy the requirements <e>", "<cs> i wish the noble lord had made that point before because if he had said that in answer to the noble lord lord mishcon i would have adopted a different tone of voice <e> <s> i now apply to reverse my stand entirely and say that i am most grateful to the noble lord lord trefgarne for adding that and saving us all from trooping through the division lobbies <e> <s> we will look forward very much to seeing what the noble lord produces on report stage for the benefit of people working in the european institutions and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> is it convenient to begin amendment no <e> <s> now or does the noble lord wish to adjourn <e>", "<cs> i accept that there would have to be consequential modifications to clause <e>", "<cs> i should certainly be delighted to do anything that would satisfy an australian having close australian connections myself <e> <s> my sister has lived in australia for the last years and there are several australian nephews and nieces who have no difficulty at all in travelling all over the world and working in great britain france and elsewhere <e> <s> it has always seemed to me that no legislation would stop australians from moving around the world so great is their ingenuity in getting around the immigration laws of great britain and many other countries to which they add lustre by their presence <e>", "<cs> i am accepting the second argument that was put by the noble and learned lord and this is where i am saying that he is a little inconsistent <e> <s> he says that if people continue to work overseas for several generations i paraphrase him surely the natural country for them to have their citizenship in is where they live <e> <s> that is what the noble and learned lord said having remarked in the previous breath that it would be unfortunate if in all circumstances the rights of citizenship were cut off at the second generation <e> <s> i agree with the noble lords second proposition that as a family lives and works overseas it gradually acquires closer and closer connections with the country to which it naturally belongs and gradually relinquishes the connection it has with the united kingdom <e> <s> the second generation may be an arbitrary cut-off point but that is why we have the provision in clause to enable it to continue <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord says that you cannot exclude relevant employment in the united kingdom and so he is trying to suggest to the <e>", "<cs> in the circumstances that have been outlined for example by the noble baroness lady elles where the couple have been unemployed or in the case that i mentioned where the couple have been at university the wife is pregnant and they are going overseas they have the offer of a job and the secretary of state is asked to treat subsection <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may reply briefly to the noble lord lord renton as someone who is on the other end of the line to the home office as it were in that i am frequently making representations to home office ministers in areas where they must exercise their discretion <e> <s> i am afraid i do not share lord rentons confidence that those ministers invariably get it right <e>", "<cs> i want to ask one question before the minister replies to this amendment <e> <s> pursuant to what the noble baroness lady elles said earlier on bearing in mind the large number of people we have unemployed at the moment would the minister consider expanding this requirement so that the parent in question could have been either in relevant employment during the period of two years ending with the date of birth or unemployed <e> <s> because that would then enable a person to comply with the condition if for instance she was unemployed for a year then was successful in finding a job and became pregnant after say three months so that she could not satisfy the test of relevant employment unless the period during which she had been out of work prior to taking this job was counted towards the relevant employment <e>", "<cs> if the minister can give that assurance i shall be delighted <e>", "<cs> surely if a woman has been unemployed in the united kingdom such as in the example i described and has been drawing unemployment benefit for one year prior to obtaining a job which takes her overseas where she has a baby then the one year of unemployment in the united kingdom demonstrates a close connection with the united kingdom <e> <s> therefore why cannot the noble and learned lord advocate write into this subsection a provision that will either allow the woman to be employed in relevant employment or unemployed in the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> i am glad the noble lord has put down this amendment because it enables us to probe a little further what is meant by close connection <e> <s> as the noble lord lord elystan-morgan has pointed out the phrase is riddled with ambiguity and doubt <e> <s> when accepting jobs overseas people simply will not know unless a much more comprehensive explanation is given by the minister at this stage whether they are going to be safe in taking the employment abroad in the full knowledge that they will be able to transmit citizenship <e>", "<cs> i do not want to prolong these proceedings but i did put two quite specific examples to the minister and i asked whether these people if they went overseas could satisfy the terms of the bill <e>", "<cs> it is all very well to be frivolous but somebody has to interpret <e> <s> there are going to be individual people faced with individual job opportunities and they will have to make up their minds whether if they go overseas their children are going to comply with these conditions in the bill <e> <s> if the minister is not going to say anything on the record how are people to know <e> <s> i asked him another question <e> <s> i said would they be able to apply to the secretary of state or to some official and be able to get a certificate in advance <e> <s> if they went to work for comalco the employment having been arranged by rtz or if through a british recruitment consultant an engineer were to go to work for the government of tanzania would he be able to get from the secretary of state or from some official a certificate saying that this employment satisfied the close connection requirement of clause <e> <s> will he be able to get that or will he go abroad without having the faintest idea whether his children are going to be british citizens or not <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords when the minister says that sactra has been reconstituted is that not rather an understatement for the sacking of every single member of this body except one <e> <s> why do the government bother to rig the composition of advisory bodies in this way rather than adopting the cheaper and more honest course of continuing to give preference to investment in roads as compared with rail as all governments have done in the past <e>", "<cs> my lords in regard to sactra may i ask whether as he has obviously read the <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may revert to a question which i put to the noble lord lord belstead at the previous sitting on th july which appears in col of <e>", "<cs> if i may refer back to the previous debate on the th when we were talking about the question of unemployment the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls suggested that if a person was out of work in the united kingdom and he was drawing unemployment benefit for the purposes of this bill he would be treated as if he was employed <e> <s> i think this was a point which was not picked up by the noble and learned lord the lord advocate in the reply he gave at column <e> <s> whatever the truth of the matter may be whether a person is looked upon as employed if he is drawing unemployment benefit is it not the fact that a person in that position would have a close tie or connection with the united kingdom <e> <s> has not the noble lord lord belstead reiterated again this afternoon for the <e>", "<cs> it does seem to me wrong continually to rely on the discretion of the secretary of state in clause <e> <s> i appreciate that as the noble lord the minister said this power or something very similar to it has been in our legislation since as far back as but surely we should limit as much as possible the number of occasions when one wants to leave it to the secretary of state to exercise a very wide power of this kind <e> <s> even though the amendment proposed by the noble baroness may not be in the precise form that the government would like if the minister is prepared to stand at the dispatch box as he did and say that this is the sort of case where the secretary of state would exercise his discretion then he could equally well give instructions to the parliamentary draftsman to produce a form of words which gives effect to the wishes of your lordships committee <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord has heard enough from all sides of the committee to realise not only that the amendment is welcomed universally but that many people would prefer to see something even wider <e>", "<cs> may i refer once again to the provisions of schedule for the reduction of statelessness which the noble lord the minister has prayed in aid on other occasions when it has been pointed out that children born overseas may not be entitled to the citizenship of the country where they are born as in the case cited by the noble earl lord bessborough of the british child born in france <e> <s> the noble lord the minister has airily said that we have provisions in schedule which will take care of this because they reduce statelessness <e> <s> but when one looks at schedule one finds that it does not apply to children born for instance in the countries of the european community unless at some stage in the childs life he can be brought back to the united kingdom or to a dependent territory <e> <s> if i may refer your lordships to paragraph of schedule it is headed <e>", "<cs> i have been compelled to rise to speak by the ministers example when he said that if it could be shown that substantial benefits flowed from the company to the united kingdom that factor might be taken into consideration in determining whether there was a close connection within the meaning of this clause <e> <s> clause <e>", "<cs> it may help your lordships to know that the action group on immigration and nationality have produced a series of leaflets which explain how the bill affects particular classes of individuals <e> <s> in the absence of any proper explanation from the government i warmly commend these leaflets to your lordships <e> <s> they are available from theobalds road london wc <e>", "<cs> i know this is a very important and sensitive issue one of the most vital we have had to deal with but i get the feeling that your lordships would like to come to a decision on this <e> <s> if i may i should like to say just a few words in reply to the noble duke the duke of norfolk <e> <s> first of all he said in effect that a slur had been cast on <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord could enlighten me on one point <e> <s> if one looks at the existing requirements for naturalisation on marriage as set out in the schedule they are dealt with in paragraph <e> <s> it sets out the requirements which have to be satisfied by the person who applies for citizenship on marriage by either sex <e> <s> going down the list each of them begins that he was that the number that on the date then in <e>", "<cs> then we go back to <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment because i think that if you are going to have a language test at all and as the minister will have realised i should have preferred to leave it out altogether then you have got to make it as flexible as you possibly can and you have got to give the secretary of state the power to cater for every possible eventuality as he has in other parts of the bill <e> <s> one example that occurred to me is this obviously if the applicants physical condition is such as to prevent him learning the english welsh or scottish gaelic language that would be a reason for exercising discretion and in another <e>", "<cs> my lords on the question of free speech can the noble earl say how many local authorities in the soviet union have passed resolutions similar in nature to that referred to in the question <e>", "<cs> first may i say that the noble lord need have no anxiety about the length of his reply or that any objection will be a made by the committee if he explains the governments policy with equal thoroughness on the amendments which we are still to tackle some of which are not concerned with transitional provisions as the noble lord suggested but are of almost equal importance to this one <e>", "<cs> i want to say two things <e> <s> one the noble lord the minister said that the amendment does not belong here because the clause preserves an entitlement whereas what i am trying to create is a new entitlement <e> <s> am i correct in saying that the former home secretary mr merlyn rees did as a matter of discretion grant citizenship to the children of british women overseas under certain circumstances which may not have been precisely the same as those which are envisaged in this amendment <e> <s> am i not therefore preserving an entitlement which was not conferred on these people as of right but as a matter of discretion by the predecessor of the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> but what about the children who were adults at the time when the former home secretary announced his discretion <e> <s> what is their position then <e>", "<cs> i shall have to return to this matter at a later stage <e> <s> in the meanwhile i beg leave to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> since the noble lord has really extended the discussion to the case of what happens if you confer the same privileges on men as on women perhaps it would be for the convenience of the committee if i said a few words at this stage not only about the noble baronesss amendment but also about my own amendments nos <e> <s> to <e> <s> i apologise for not having been here at the beginning of the speech of the noble baroness i think i heard all but two minutes of it <e>", "<cs> if i may say so we are not talking about an automatic acquisition of citizenship we are talking about registration <e> <s> i do not think that the noble lord could have read the amendments properly or else he would not have referred in such terms to my amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i am providing that the spouses of either sex will have to make the application before they will be entitled to the registration <e> <s> so we shall not get citizenship being conferred on people who do not want it and the case of the indian citizens to which the noble lord referred was a complete red herring <e>", "<cs> what if she has remained here all the time <e> <s> supposing she has not gone to another country <e> <s> supposing her marriage has broken up and she has remained in the united kingdom <e> <s> what happens then <e>", "<cs> if the minister does not intend to answer that eloquent plea perhaps i should say in conclusion that we are here dealing with a group of women who at the commencement or immediately before it would have been entitled to be registered as citizens of the united kingdom and colonies whose husbands became citizens at commencement but who <e>", "<cs> at this late hour my best course is to say that i will study carefully what the noble and learned lord has said and possibly return to the matter on report <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am certainly very grateful for any crumbs which fall from the rich mans table and i entirely accept the noble lords assurance that he will look at this question of the discretion of the secretary of state <e> <s> in my speech a few minutes ago i meant to remind him of what happened at the time of the act when the question of section of the british nationality act was under discussion <e> <s> the way in which the secretary of state was likely to exercise his discretion came before your lordships on that occasion <e> <s> i am sorry it was much earlier because it was in the debate on the act in your lordships house on th november when the then minister of state for commonwealth relations and for the colonies the noble duke the duke of devonshire said in reference to the discretion in section of the british nationality act <e>", "<cs> can the noble lord recall whether the french have the same difficulties in the committee of in respect of their <e>", "<cs> i am very sorry if i was inaudible but i was explaining that this in fact is a paving amendment for the later one which leaves out subsection <e> <s> it deals with the position of citizens of the united kingdom and colonies who acquired that status by virtue of the british nationality no <e> <s> act <e> <s> that act was passed in order to enable the united kingdom to comply with the obligations which we undertook on ratification of the united nations convention on the reduction of statelessness which i believe was in the same year <e>", "<cs> the noble lord the minister has not convinced me because he failed entirely to deal with the main point of my argument which was that by incorporating this provision the government are withdrawing from certain of our citizens a privilege which they have enjoyed ever since the implementation of the act <e> <s> as i have pointed out several times this is contrary to the assertions made by ministers in the other place that nobody but nobody was going to be disadvantaged by any of the provisions in this bill <e>", "<cs> i wish very briefly but none the less warmly to support everything that has been said by the noble lord lord mishcon and first to endorse the epithets that he has applied to the new form of citizenship which confers no rights of residence on a person anywhere in the world <e> <s> this british overseas citizenship is a pitiful sham and a fraud and i am ashamed to see it appearing in legislation coming before the united kingdom parliament <e> <s> i am particularly ashamed that it is the intention of the government to apply this to people whose rights were already undermined by the infamous act which we vigorously opposed at the time <e> <s> when in our paper of july we commented on the previous governments green paper we said <e>", "<cs> i am so sorry <e> <s> i should have made it clear in that part of my speech that i was speaking for the liberal party <e>", "<cs> the minister astonishes me when he says he is not going to take away the citizenship somebody already has <e> <s> that is precisely what is going to happen unless this amendment is accepted <e> <s> persons who are citizens of the united kingdom and colonies and are resident here and settled here for some years will lose that status and will become british overseas citizens extraordinary as it may seem on the date of commencement of the bill <e> <s> these are people living here resident in the country who have made their lives here <e>", "<cs> i am talking about the people we are concerned with in this amendment citizens of the united kingdom and colonies british protected persons who are actually resident here at the time of commencement <e> <s> i am saying i want these people to <e>", "<cs> i shall not be deterred by what the noble lord says from putting down two separate amendments when we come back to the matter on report one dealing with those who are admitted for settlement on arrival and a separate one encouraged by the minister to take care of those who are admitted for settlement on removal of time limit <e>", "<cs> we shall have to argue about that at perhaps some length when we get to the report stage <e> <s> with that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am so sorry i was addressing myself to amendment no <e> <s> a <e>", "<cs> yes i did not move that <e>", "<cs> does not the noble lord lord renton think that if the person were a citizen of any country other than the united kindgom he would not have been recruited to crown service or to service of the kind designated in clause <e>", "<cs> a very important question occurred to me as i listened to the speech of the noble baroness in moving the amendment <e> <s> she outlined the dilemma which might face parents serving overseas for some considerable period of years who have a child out there and who then have to make up their minds whether the child is to be a british citizen by descent as it would be if it were registered overseas or whether at some stage during the childs minority they will bring it back to the united kingdom and wait the requisite number of years so that it can be registered as a full british citizen with the right to transmit that citizenship to the childs own descendants <e>", "<cs> could the noble lord deal with the point i made as to how the parents would exercise their right to bring the child back into this country so that it fulfilled the residence requirement for full citizenship bearing in mind the sole responsibility rule which we find in the present immigration rules <e> <s> if the two parents are overseas at the time of the birth they may decide they do not want to follow the clause procedure because whether the noble lord likes it or not it confers in their minds an inferior brand of citizenship they want while the child is still a minor to bring the child back into the united kingdom which they may in any case have intended to do for the purposes of education and that education may proceed for long enough to fulfil the necessary residence qualification <e> <s> but as long as one parent continues to <e>", "<cs> if this amendment undermined one of the principles of the bill and that was all it did would be warmly in favour of it <e> <s> but the trouble is that it leaves another of the principles of the bill unimpaired and that is the creation of two different classes of citizenship which is what we objected to in the green paper of april <e> <s> the reason why i could not support the creation of separate citizenships for each of the dependent territories is because in the liberal response to the green paper we called for a unified citizenship with those who lived in all the dependent territories except hong kong which would have its own citizenship entitled to exactly the same quality of citizenship as people who live in the united kingdom itself <e> <s> that of course includes the right of abode in the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord the lord advocate for the remarks he has made <e> <s> i agree with him that if the principle were accepted the amendment would have to be accompanied by another amendment defining british overseas citizenship otherwise than by descent <e> <s> it was only because i wanted to have a discussion on the principle first that i did not go to the extent of drafting a clause analogous to what is now clause which the noble and learned lord said would certainly be necessary if we were going to pursue this matter <e>", "<cs> i wish to comment on the distinction which may emerge between british overseas citizens and citizens of the dependent territories because the <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord gifford seeks leave to withdraw the amendment may i ask whether he is of the opinion that the minister does not intend to deal with the question of the distinction between parents who are citizens of british dependent territories and british overseas citizens <e>", "<cs> does the noble lord agree that the minister should be given an opportunity to reply to that point <e>", "<cs> i want very warmly to support what has been said by the noble lord lord gifford and to emphasise the difficulties that we are putting in the <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord replies would he be kind enough to clarify what he said before the noble baroness spoke <e> <s> did he not say that the position of refugees was in no way impaired under this bill and is what it always has been <e> <s> does not schedule prvoide that the child of a refugee may qualify for british citizenship only if the child is over and under <e> <s> does that not then mean that questions arise as to this stateless childs entitlement to national health service treatment <e> <s> it will have to be proved when first entering school that it is eligible for education and so on <e> <s> all sorts of difficulties will be put in the way of refugee parents to establish that the child is entitled to the benefits of our social security health and educational system difficulties which are not there at the moment <e> <s> this will represent a serious impairment of the rights of a refugee coming to this country which they presently enjoy <e>", "<cs> following on what lord gifford has said i wonder whether i could remind the noble lord the minister that at an earlier stage i put the question to him about the immigration rules and i did not have any reply then <e> <s> i asked him to confirm my understanding that the minor child who is stateless having been born outside the united kingdom would be entitled to admission to the united kingdom only if either both the parents are here and he comes as a dependent child or one of the parents can demonstrate that he or she has the sole or main responsibility for that childs upbringing because that is what the rules say at the moment <e> <s> i had rather understood the reverse of what the noble lord lord gifford has suggested <e> <s> i had understood that there was not going to be any change in the immigration rules because nothing has been said about that certainly in another place it was not mentioned in committee or at report stage <e>", "<cs> after sittings of the committee in another place four days on report and six days in committee in your lordships house i should have thought that the government might have been able to present the committee with some kind of a solution for the european problem which has been outlined so many times during the proceedings on this bill <e> <s> however i realise that we shall not make any further progress on this matter this afternoon <e> <s> therefore with the hope that at some time on report we shall get some positive news from the government i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am sorry <e> <s> i will try to do so <e> <s> the noble lord lord drumalbyn has just said that in some ways it is easier for parents in europe with whom we were concerned just now to take advantage of their proximity to britain to come back here whenever a child is expected so that the child would then have citizenship by birth from the start instead of having to acquire it through one of the laborious processes which we have been examining <e> <s> however the noble lord said that it was very much harder to <e>", "<cs> i just fail to understand entirely why the noble lord could not accept the amendment <e> <s> he repeated what i had already said which was that the government had extended to british protected persons the concession of registration which was already held by commonwealth citizens <e> <s> he confirmed that british protected persons were neither commonwealth citizens nor aliens and this was an anomaly in the law which was to be continued under this bill from the previous legislation including the act <e> <s> he did not advance a single argument as to why the british protected person should not be entitled to vote to serve on juries or to be eligible for public service <e>", "<cs> the government keep saying that they are not unsympathetic to the plight of united kingdom citizens overseas and yet no reply was given yesterday when i pointed out that the waiting period for applicants for quota vouchers has been gradually extended so that from a period of three-and-a-half years in it has risen progressively until now it takes five years eight months between the date of application of a person overseas and his interview by an entry certificate officer with a view to granting him permission to come here <e>", "<cs> perhaps i can help the noble lord because i have the figures here <e> <s> the number of people in africa and india who are eligible under the special voucher scheme is some <e> <s> at present it is said that there are some applicants who with their families total people waiting in the queue <e> <s> those figures come from the house of commons select committee th sitting col <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord lord trefgarne to answer a point about the malaysians <e>", "<cs> i do not think that is the answer <e>", "<cs> there is no question of these people registering and the only evidence i know of that might be available to the foreign and commonwealth office is the number of people in malaysia who have applied for united kingdom passports and those are numbered in hundreds <e>", "<cs> i feel the noble lord is wrong with respect because if they have been in malaysia all this time for very many years they must have the right of abode there and are not included in the noble lords amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness says that if one is going to do this at all one should put in something about duties and yet earlier on she talked about the international instruments to which we are a party and which we have ratified <e> <s> i am not aware that there is any such instrument entitled <e>", "<cs> i suppose that the noble lord lord renton imagines that the rights he is speaking of are conferred on the british people by the common law <e> <s> that is what he means is it not <e> <s> well he is wrong <e> <s> i must say that <e> <s> ministers are constantly whittling away and slashing at the rights that people have had under the common law for centuries and nobody takes a blind bit of notice <e> <s> the noble lord lord belstead knows perfectly well the sort of rights that i mean because i am in correspondence with him about them <e> <s> i will give an example <e> <s> the right of a <e>", "<cs> i am glad to have the noble lords opinion on that <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord on the front bench is listening to him <e> <s> he knows perfectly well that there are certain people who have been prevented by his department from bringing private criminal prosecutions and the rights which the noble lord lord renton thinks that they possess have been taken away from them by an administrative act of the home office <e>", "<cs> it would be helpful if when the minister comes to reply he could give us illustrations of the kind of case in which a person has been deprived of his citizenship on the basis of concealment of any material fact <e> <s> i am very anxious about this as the noble lord lord gifford is because in the case of applications for citizenship i have found that decisions go against a person on extremely trivial if not frivolous grounds including the alleged concealment of facts which i would have thought were extremely immaterial <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble and learned lord two questions <e> <s> first he mentioned that there had been two cases where a person had been deprived of his citizenship on grounds of security <e> <s> one was klaus fuchs <e> <s> i remember his case <e> <s> i did not catch the name of the other <e>", "<cs> in those cases to which the noble and learned lord referred i believe that they were convicted of espionage in a court of law <e> <s> presumably therefore to revert to what the noble lord lord gifford said on the previous amendment they were properly deprived of their citizenship because they made false representations in taking the oath of allegiance <e> <s> so that there need have been no secret considerations entering into the secretary of states decision <e> <s> it must have been obvious because of their conviction in a court of law that they had acted falsely in swearing <e>", "<cs> exercising the most painful self-restraint i rise merely to say in a sentence that i warmly support the speeches of the noble viscount lord colville and the noble lord lord mishcon in support of some form of right of appeal <e>", "<cs> may i make a point about the remark that the noble baroness has made <e> <s> during the course of todays proceedings there have been half a dozen instances where people have asked the minister to write to them and the minister has usually nodded and said he would do that <e> <s> it is only a partially satisfactory procedure because while the recipient of the letter may know what is in the ministers mind others who may be equally interested want to know what home office policy is in case it may modify their stance on report stage or change their minds about an amendment that they personally want to introduce <e> <s> i hope the minister whether the noble lord lord belstead or the noble and learned lord the lord advocate will bear in mind those interested in these matters apart from the person who is promised the letter <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> i should like an assurance that if any such searches of registers are carried out in connection with an inquiry made by a member of parliament or a peer on behalf of a correspondent that no fee will he charged <e>", "<cs> i asked at an earlier stage whether the minister could explain to me how the fees were to be determined and i want to echo what has been said by the noble lord lord gifford that for registration and for naturalisation is a very large sum of money to have to pay <e> <s> i asked the government whether they could inform me if it was their policy to recover by way of fees the whole of the costs of the officials who are employed in determining these applications <e> <s> if that was so i had to point out that in there were staff in post and they determined in the course of that year applications which made applications per employee whereas in there were staff in post almost double the number and they determined fewer applications <e> <s> there was a drop of almost two-thirds in the number of applications which were decided per member of the staff <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that in some cases which i have taken up with his honourable friend mr timothy raison deportation orders were made against cypriots many years ago but suspended from operation because of their circumstances back home and then years later were suddenly reactivated because of an alleged change of circumstances without the persons concerned having any right to a re-hearing <e> <s> where there is a dispute about the family circumstances in the country of origin will the minister have a look at the possibility of referring these cases to the appellate authorities so that the evidence can be properly examined <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the minister agree that the cell cards that are placed in the cells at present are inaccurate and that he told me in a letter of th january that a major revision of cell cards is in an advanced stage of preparation <e> <s> yet on th july six months later he tells me in another letter that cell cards are in the course of extensive revision <e>", "<cs> my lords is it the policy of the government to wait until the judgment of the european <e>", "<cs> in view of what the minister has said would he be prepared to accept a manuscript amendment to write the actual date into the bill instead of this charade of an order in council <e>", "<cs> it is said that if you sup with the devil you must have a long spoon and that certainly applies to the assurances that have been given by general lucas garcia the dictator of guatemala <e> <s> it is proper that the government should have made as they have a statement promising that the military support for belize should continue after independence and that we should assist the belizean defence forces in building up their own strength <e> <s> however it was well put by the noble baroness lady vickers that it will be impossible for belize ever to compete with guatemala in the scale of its military effort because of the huge disparity between populations and resources <e> <s> even if we were prepared to station troops there for the purpose of training belizean defence forces more or less indefinitely and build them up at the rate of a year as the noble baroness suggested so that after years the belizean forces would equal those of guatemala that would bankrupt the belizean economy <e> <s> therefore it is not conceivable <e>", "<cs> they could be recalled <e>", "<cs> would not the noble lord lord home of the hirsel agree that if the amendment were passed and the government still considered it absolutely vital to adhere to the timetable they could in theory bring back another place to deal with it during the recess <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord denham might not have been aware that over the weekend there took place major developments which created certain military obligations for this country to continue after the independence of belize and the question before us is whether or not we should write that point into the independence bill <e> <s> it was the noble lord lord home of the hirsel not a member of the opposition who raised the question of whether or not this could be done procedurally this side of the summer recess <e> <s> i wanted only to tell the noble lord lord denham that i served as a whip in the other place and i would venture to express the opinion that it could be done if your lordships were to pass the amendment it could be sent back to another place and it could be completed in another place in time for them to rise when previously planned <e>", "<cs> we are facing a changed situation <e> <s> it is not true to claim as the minister does that the people of belize voted in for independence on the terms which are now being offered to them <e> <s> at that time they had no knowledge of the heads of agreement <e> <s> may i quote from a pro-government paper which is entitled supercream of friday th march <e> <s> it said <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down is he suggesting that mr price had a mandate for the heads of agreement when the general election was in and the heads of agreement were in <e>", "<cs> are we going to finish this debate without answers to any of the questions which have been put <e> <s> are we not going to have answers to any of the questions about the heads of agreement <e>", "<cs> all that that means is that if no treaty is signed then guatemala never recognises belize <e>", "<cs> but there is no treaty <e>", "<cs> no that is not true <e> <s> if the noble lord is relying upon the bbcs world today which spoke of belizeans celebrating the news of independence he may like to know that a friend of mine who telephoned belize this morning was told that the riot squads were out that tear gas was being used and that disturbances were occurring <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make it absolutely clear that we while going through the division lobby on the previous amendment are in no way opposed to the independence of belize and we fully support the governments move towards decolonisation <e> <s> our only reservations were on the timing as i think the noble lord will agree <e> <s> we express our warmest good wishes to the people of belize for their future happiness and prosperity and we hope that the protection of their sovereignty will be fully assured and that they will take their place as a member of the commonwealth as a member of the united nations and as a member of the oas in full security for the future <e>", "<cs> perhaps i could say a few words in addition to the opinions that have already been expressed and with which i warmly agree although it has been proved in practice that taking individual cases of discrimination before the courts or before any tribunal is not a very satisfactory way of asserting rights because there can always be a multitude of reasons advanced as to why some decision has been made other than the question of race religion or colour <e> <s> i anticipate that if the secretary of states decisions were queried or the governors and i agree with those who have said that we are not talking about the present secretary of state there would be a multitude of other reasons why he had declined to grant nationality or to have exercised his discretion in favour of the applicant under any of the other parts of the bill where the powers are given to him <e>", "<cs> that last point made by the noble lord lord home gives rise to a further consideration that is whether the procedures we have had for looking at persons characters have always been successful in the past <e> <s> for instance have any of the spies who have been convicted of offences been naturalised citizens of this country <e> <s> i do not remember for example whether mr klaus fuchs who was referred to at an earlier point was a naturalised citizen <e> <s> but i am convinced that some spies whose cases were dealt with in the early post-war years had become citizens of this country by naturalisation <e> <s> so the assumption we are making that these cumbersome procedures built into this bill in continuation of the processes that have always been in our law are a method of safeguarding this inestimable privilege of citizenship from undesirable characters is not correct <e> <s> there are examples not a million miles from your lordships house which we can think of where persons who have been granted our citizenship have subsequently been convicted in a court of law <e> <s> so the procedures while they take up an enormous amount of time and effort in the home office cannot be said to be per cent <e> <s> successful <e>", "<cs> as has been pointed out this amendment does have all-party support and my noble friend viscount thurso would i am sure want me to say just one word or two in support of the noble lord lord aylestone and the noble baroness lady vickers <e> <s> although i would agree with her that the amendment stands on its own merits none the less an argument which the government might have used if it had not been for the vote on gibraltar is now no longer available to them because the principle has been conceded that it is possible for one of the dependencies to have the same citizenship as the united kingdom itself <e> <s> i think that is an extremely important factor apart from the great merits of the principle of self-determination which is the really important aspect of this amendment <e> <s> as the noble baroness has said there are -odd people in these islands who unanimously wish to remain british <e> <s> after all if we accept that the people of northern ireland can have a plebiscite and can declare that they will remain part of the united kingdom and they do not wish to be transferred to the republic of ireland what is the <e>", "<cs> i did not mean to imply that the claim over the malvinas as they call it was of recent origin merely that the people of the falkland islands might have heightened anxieties about the consequences of an argentinian takeover because of the nature of the rgime which rules that country at the moment <e>", "<cs> i think that that is the most co-operative answer that i have had from the minister during the whole of the proceedings on the bill <e> <s> i will not look a gift horse in the mouth <e> <s> i will certainly beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to raise a very small point with the minister of which i am afraid i gave him notice only this afternoon <e> <s> it is on schedule which is concerned with the transitional provisions <e> <s> it relates to the position of british protected persons who made an application for naturalisation prior to the commencement of this bill <e> <s> as the minister explained earlier there is an improvement in the position of british protected persons in that once the bill becomes law they will be entitled to apply for registration as opposed to naturalisation <e> <s> the question that arises is what happens to the people who are in the pipeline at the time of commencement and who have already submitted an application for their naturalisation <e>", "<cs> my lords the tom-toms of the <e>", "<cs> my lords in addition to the need to achieve agreement for allowing freedom of expression on these matters may i ask the noble lord to look at another connected issue which is the continued refusal of the soviet authorities to permit the free movement out of the country of people who want to join their families abroad as exemplified by the case of igor korschnoy the son of grand master victor korschnoy who for years has been prevented from joining his father in switzerland and anatoli shcharansky the well-known computer expert who has been detained and prevented from joining his wife in israel <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for not having been here at the beginning of the speech of the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones <e> <s> i should like to support wholeheartedly the principle of his amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords any person could apply but there would be the presumption against the secretary of state accepting it if this amendment was not accepted <e>", "<cs> my lords not as being allowed to stay but as having the right to register their children as british citizens <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has left out the most important part of my argument which is that a refugee does not begin to qualify for the four-year period until some time after his arrival in the united kingdom <e> <s> if he comes here from pakistan or argentina or el salvador it takes some period which as i pointed out may be over two years as in two cases that we are dealing with at present with the home office for the person to be accepted by the noble lords department as qualifying for refugee status <e> <s> therefore the period is not four years as he stated in the letter that i quoted but sometimes it may be more than six years or even seven or eight <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say a few words about the kind of people who will be eligible for the concession which the noble lord lord pitt has suggested and which i would very warmly support <e> <s> as i pointed out in committee the vast majority of parents who are not settled here would in fact be students who enter for university degree courses which normally last for three years <e> <s> therefore if the noble lords amendment were accepted there would be plenty of latitude between the period for which a student is normally admitted even if he or she then goes on to do a phd which might take another two years and the period of seven years which is mentioned by the noble lord in his amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friends i wish to echo the words of thanks that have been expressed to the government and to say that whatever reformed chamber might take the place of your lordships house in the future it will be effective so long as it contains noble lords such as the noble viscount lord colville of culross and the noble lord lord gifford <e>", "<cs> my lords if i had known that the government were going to be prepared to go as far as they have and as far as i have described in the amendment that we are shortly going to deal with then i probably would not have pressed a similar amendment to a division on committee stage and i certainly have no intention of asking your lordships to divide on this amendment now <e> <s> this is one of the places where we are able to welcome so far as they go the concessions that the government have made and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am prepared to accept the advice of the noble lord the minister on this <e> <s> i think it is a matter of taste where you put the amendment <e> <s> i do not think there are very strong arguments for having it in one place rather than another <e> <s> the noble lord mentioned that the government amendment was on the marshalled list a week ago <e> <s> i may say that i drafted my amendment earlier but that it took some time to get to the public bill office because of the difficulties which arise when the house is not sitting when it is not always easy to bring in material and get it onto the right desk <e> <s> but having seen the government amendment after tabling my own i was delighted that it sought to do the same as we were aiming to do <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy that the minister has tabled this amendment the drafting of which i can see is superior to that which i put down in committee <e>", "<cs> i should like to add just one word to what has already been said in commendation of this amendment <e> <s> we on these benches are also very pleased that the government have accepted the views <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord the lord advocate mentioned clause <e> <s> he said that it was a matter for consideration how far the government were likely to go in designating overseas service for this purpose <e> <s> but when we discussed an amendment of mine in committee which would have defined the organisations in a schedule the noble lord lord trefgarne in his reply gave a very definite indication of what bodies the government had it in mind to designate which he said had already been intimated to the committee in another place <e> <s> those were merely the british council international organisa <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to say a word or two of welcome for this amendment because this is a very significant concession which the government have made and one which enormously improves the bill <e> <s> it makes it more comprehensible and above all more definite <e> <s> my primary criticism of clause as it stood when we looked at it in committee was as the noble lord reminded us the difficulty that people would have in knowing when they were going abroad whether or not children born to them overseas would qualify <e> <s> now the test is a fairly simple one <e> <s> the parent in question must demonstrate that at any time prior to the birth of the child he or she has lived for three years in the united kingdom and the children must be registered within months of the birth unless the circumstances are exceptional <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord the minister a question before he sits down <e> <s> he has just given what i think is a most valuable undertaking that in cases where the child is in the united kingdom and a person makes an application on his or her behalf the secretary of state will invariably exercise his discretion to register the child as a british citizen <e> <s> but it was very noteworthy that he did not extend this to the case to which the noble lord lord drumalbyn was addressing himself that is of the child who is orphaned in a foreign land and who is not qualified <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has given me a rather disappointing reply <e> <s> the minister of state in another place when replying to an amendment moved by miss richardson on report stage at col of <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to underline what has been said by the noble lord lord elystanmorgan and referred to in passing by the noble lord lord pitt of hampstead about the effect of the belize act and the difference in treatment between the citizens of countries which attained their independence earlier on during the s between those countries and not just belize but now also antigua which i shall refer to in a moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to look a gift horse in the mouth <e> <s> i have seldom heard a more <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> amendment by leave withdrawn <e>", "<cs> my lords may i make another point <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened with care to what has been said about the position of children who are in homes and on behalf of whom the local authority which is in <e>", "<cs> my lords that is an abysmally bad answer and contrasts markedly unfavourably with those which the minister has been good enough to give on all previous amendments <e> <s> i am very disappointed in his statement that in sex equality some will be more equal than others and i am afraid that i cannot accept the explanation that he has given <e> <s> he said that since february it has been the practice to register as citizens of the united kingdom and colonies children born overseas to mothers who wish to register them <e> <s> he neglected to make any reference to the point that i raised about what happens to the children of mothers where either the mother neglects to apply while the child is still a minor or she is totally unaware of the merlyn rees concession and so by the time it comes to notice it is too late and the child is an adult <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister following the discussion we had in committee for having given some thought to the question of the resumption of citizenship and for tabling this amendment which deals with the position of those who had a qualifying connection persons who renounced united kingdom citizenship as the minister said for the purpose of becoming citizens of another commonwealth country such as was mentioned in section of the british nationality act and who would have been entitled to resume it under section of that act <e>", "<cs> but my lords am i not right in thinking that under the act there was a discretion to register a person who lacked a qualifying connection and that the noble duke the duke of devonshire speaking for the then government on the bill gave an assurance that that provision would be liberally interpreted as indeed it has been <e> <s> further did not the noble lord lord belstead in a written answer to me on february rd of this year reiterate that overseas posts had exercised in that liberal manner the discretion of which the noble duke the duke of devonshire spoke <e> <s> in the circumstances does this not represent a change in the policy of her majestys government which dishonours the undertaking given by the noble duke <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord one question before he sits down <e> <s> did he not tell me in the answer on rd february to which i have referred that one person was registered under the discretionary provisions in and one person was registered in <e> <s> what difficulties did this create for her majestys government <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may ask one question <e>", "<cs> but they do not know that my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords what section of this bill does is to substitute some new words for section of the immigration act so that persons who

in this amendment who have been granted indefinite leave to enter or remain in the united kingdom will at any future date be re-admitted without conditions <e> <s> the only difference between the two amendments that we have before us if we may take amendment with this one is that amendment contains the words before commencement and amendment no <e> <s> although the words are arranged in a slightly different order means the same without those words so that a person who is granted indefinite leave to enter <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount lord colville drew attention to the economic factors which would prevent the exercise by the secretary of state of the discretion he is given in subsections and of the amendment immediately in the future and he wisely said that that would be left to develop as money became available <e> <s> the noble viscount was underlining if he will permit me to say so the difficulties we get into as soon as we depart from the rule which was suggested in the green paper namely that there should be objective tests for citizenship that would have removed a substantial element of discretion from the bill and thereby saved considerable public resources <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not going to be as easy for the applicants as would appear at first sight either for somebody who is in this position even taking the noble lords figures may not be very much to him but it is a great deal of money for somebody who is on the dole a great deal of money to somebody whose income has to be supplemented by family income supplement <e> <s> where is that person going to get <e> <s> the minister did not condescend to explain he merely said that difficulties were created for the public purse <e> <s> as he explained only per cent <e> <s> of the cost of these applications is now recovered in fees and he gave the noble baroness lady birk the ominous reply that further increases are inevitable without giving us any idea of how much the government have in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords while this may not be a bill to be used as a vehicle for general judicial reform it is certainly a vehicle for the reform of one particular case which the noble viscount lord colville outlined and which i wish to pursue <e> <s> it seems to me that the case of <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not at all clear what sort of a fantasy world the minister is living in if he thinks that there are people in this country who are going to comb the world for children so that they can bring them here for some reason of spite to the noble lord lord belstead or the home office to flout the immigration laws by bringing in floods of adopted children <e> <s> such an hypothesis is utterly absurd <e> <s> everybody on the front bench is laughing except the noble lord lord belstead <e> <s> this proves that even the noble lord lord trefgarne thinks that my imagery is amusing <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder how many people who were incapable of grasping the present purposes of citizenship have applied to become citizens of the united kingdom and colonies in the past <e> <s> i am very surprised that this should have been so or that anybody who was incapable of taking the oath of allegiance should put himself forward to take the oath or that someone should put forward such a person that someone presumably being a relative <e> <s> i find it rather difficult to imagine the sort of circumstances in which this could have occurred in the past <e> <s> in view of the lateness of the hour i do not intend to press this matter to a division <e> <s> i shall consult further with the national association for mental health and see whether we cannot come forward with an even more acceptable formula <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister confirm that the amendment retains the existing position <e> <s> i am most grateful to him <e> <s> does that mean that distinguished canadians for instance would be able to stand for membership of the house of commons as they have done in the past <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister to deal with one point <e> <s> the noble lord lord belstead said when the amendment of the noble lord lord geddes was being discussed that we had to make a distinction between the words national and nationality <e> <s> they dealt with two completely different concepts <e> <s> what we are talking about here is nationality <e> <s> i should like the noble lord who is to reply to point to one single use of the word nationality anywhere in this bill except where reference is made to the nationality acts to <e> <s> i do not believe that the word nationality is used except in that context and therefore it is entirely inappropriate to have it in the long title <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether the then lord privy seal also explained to the south african ambassador that in britain unlike south africa journalists cannot be jailed or exiled for what they say <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord a question <e> <s> i understood that we were now in the twentieth century and using word processors for the drafting of successive prints of a bill <e> <s> if that is so most word processing packages have a facility on them for finding particular words or sequences of words even if there are numbers of repetitions of them <e> <s> if that were so and this bill had been produced on a word processor then it would be a matter of a few seconds to find all the instances of british dependent territories <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the minister devoted a great part of his remarks to an analysis of the concessions which were extracted so painfully from the government during the many hours that we spent considering this bill and i share his pleasure in welcoming the improvements that your lordships have seen fit to make <e> <s> but i must agree with the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones that these changes do not alter the fundamental objections that we had to the bill when it first appeared in your lordships house <e> <s> the concessions it seems to me were mainly ones that were designed to placate white middle-class opinion and indeed the main defeat of the government was occasioned by a coalition of sentimental imperialists europeans and those who would like to see the whole scheme of citizenship in the bill undermined <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the answer given by the noble baroness the leader of the house is it not more than simply a procedural question affecting another place if an important statement of the kind referred to is made in answer to an oral question <e> <s> would not the noble baroness agree that the decision to make the statement in this form was taken by a minister of her majestys government and therefore it is perfectly proper for a noble lord to refer to it in this house and does she not think that in view of the importance of the subject that was under discussion the selling-off of large parts of the british national oil corporation and the privatisation of the british gas corporations interest in onshore fields this would have merited a statement in your lordships house where it could have been questioned <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to congratulate the noble lord lord geddes on his initiative and persistence and i think everyone agrees that the result achieved is far better than in the original bill <e> <s> it was sensible for these amendments to be incorporated in all the places where reference is made to british dependent territories rather than simply leaving it as was originally suggested by the government as a substitution in one place <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the minister said that there were reasons given by the commons for disagreeing with the amendment but in fact there is only one reason and one reason only and as he said it is an important reason of principle <e> <s> but it is here set out on the marshalled list because the government believe and as the noble lord said another place by a majority believes that discretionary decisions under the act should not be subject to appeal to or review in the courts <e> <s> that is a fundamental matter of principle which now has to be resolved in the light of the arguments which have been put to us by the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords may i <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord again refers to the role of the parliamentary commissioner <e> <s> does he mean that in spite of the fact that clause says <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of the calculations published in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i warmly welcome the initiative of the noble earl lord longford in raising this important question and i am glad to follow him into some of the areas where he has perhaps entered into some controversy although i shall attempt to pour a little largactil on troubled waters if i may put it that way <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble baroness allow me <e> <s> what does the noble baroness think of the suggestion that has been made by the director of nacro that the more the minimum is brought down as she has proposed the greater the likelihood that the courts will use the sentence to give a taste of imprisonment to those who otherwise might not have been awarded a custodial sentence at all <e>", "<cs> my lords i have been trying to intervene to ask the noble lord whether he was going to deal with the other suggestion which i made which is that the government should consider adopting per cent <e> <s> remission as we have in northern ireland <e> <s> no doubt the noble lord will be able to give the house an exact figure of the number of people who would be released from prison by such a scheme because <e>", "<cs> i did not know that <e>", "<cs> i did know that of course i did <e>", "<cs> my lords in relation to nuclear weapons within the european theatre in particular is the noble lord aware that the public are very confused by the apparent conflict between the figures given by president reagan

such advantage <e> <s> is it not possible to get an agreement at least on the facts between the superpowers as to how many of these weapons there are on each side <e>", "<cs> my lords may i take the opportunity of ascertaining an answer to the question i asked during the course of yesterdays proceedings namely what would be the reduction in the number of prisoners in england and wales if the per cent <e> <s> remission which applies in northern ireland were extended to the mainland <e>", "<cs> my lords we also are very grateful to the noble lord lord belstead for repeating the statement made in another place <e> <s> the report which is before your lordships is in fact a profoundly important document for which parliament and indeed the whole nation must be tremendously grateful to the noble and learned lord lord scarman who has done his work so thoroughly and so competently in the short span of time that has been available to him since he was asked to undertake this work by the secretary of state in april and with that concern for justice and humanity for which the noble and learned lord is so rightly renowned <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl has done the house a service in raising this question and enabling us i hope to extract some information from the minister when he replies about the improvements in the methods of monitoring asbestos and the alternative materials that have been developed <e> <s> in i first realised the full extent of the morbidity and mortality arising from the industrial uses of asbestos when i was concerned with the publication of a document entitled <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister not agree that international competitiveness is a function not only of unit labour costs but also of the exchange rate of the pound <e> <s> would not the noble lord also agree that the enormously high exchange rate which has been maintained throughout this year unrealistically in relation to the dollar and other currencies is hindering our competitiveness abroad and preventing british manufacturers from raising their exports <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am very glad to welcome the opportunity that has been given to us by the noble lord lord young of dartington for discussing the important report of mr rampton and his colleagues <e> <s> i want to take this opportunity to say to the noble lord lord young that i believe that this is one of the prime areas in which we as liberals and social democrats must get together and collaborate because it would he one of the major priorities of a liberal/social democratic administration to see that we achieve genuine racial equality in this country and stop talking about it and stop discussing the many reports valuable as they may be which have been in front of us for a long time <e> <s> the noble lord himself emphasised this when he went right back to the s and showed that we knew all the facts before we ever got to rampton and yet administrations of both labour and conservative hue have made the right noises but have done nothing about them <e>", "<cs> my lords the committee report says that only two such schemes are going now <e> <s> what are the government doing to encourage more of them <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that i heard the noble lord lord jenkins of putney ask whether the noble viscount lord trenchard could say when the original announcement was made in the defence <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord elton has just referred to the interests of the patient <e> <s> i do not know whether he was here during that part of his noble friends remarks when he was referring to the comparison between this subsection and section but i should like to point out to your lordships committee that there is a very real and important distinction in that clause <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord belstead for the comprehensive way in which he replied to the amendment and also for the remarks he has just made drawing attention to the effect that the interim hospital orders will have on the relationships between the courts and the hospitals which i think is a matter of some importance and may well result in more frequent compliance with the wishes of the courts when we come to section orders <e>", "<cs> i could detain the committee for a long time in replying to all the points the minister made but i know it is the intention to come to a conclusion fairly soon so i will content myself with a few remarks about some of the most contentious points he made <e> <s> first the noble lord talked about a patient who becomes ill shortly before he is due to complete his sentence <e> <s> if that is the case then presumably he would be transferred to the prison hospital and then as my noble friend lord winstanley pointed out he becomes a person who is eligible for the protection of the mental health review tribunals because he is then within for example the hospital wing at parkhurst before he is transferred to a special psychiatric hospital <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister not agree that alcohol plays a very important role in the causation of accidents involving motor-cyclists as it does motor-cars and that research figures by the trrl show that as many as a quarter to a third of those killed in motor-cycle accidents have taken more than the legal amount of alcohol into their blood stream <e> <s> would not one of the contributions that the government could make towards improving the statistical knowledge of this factor be to ensure that any person involved in such an accident has a blood test as a matter of routine <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords am i wrong in my recollection that the noble lord the minister gave the figure of to my noble friend lord wigoder for the immediate reduction in the prison population that would result in applying per cent <e> <s> remission to all those serving sentences of two years and less <e> <s> therefore is it not curious that the figure which the noble lord now gives for the reduction for all those serving sentences of whatever length should be smaller than the figure he gave to my noble friend <e> <s> however even if it is a figure of for the total prison population would that not represent a very significant reduction of the burden now being felt by the prison service and is it not therefore worth reconsidering the governments decision to reject that proposal in favour of one which is very doubtful as regards its effect of reducing the prison population at all <e> <s> other things being equal is it not a good idea for the system to he the same in the united kingdom as a whole bearing in mind that northern ireland is still part of the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the minister could advise his noble friend that the prison population in saudi arabia is effectively reduced by means of executions and amputations <e> <s> will he also ask the secretary of state for northern ireland to take note of the views expressed by the noble lord lord campbell of alloway that the system operated in those countries is a mockery <e> <s> returning to what the minister said about the parole system would he not agree that if the parole system were retained for the balance of one-sixth of the sentence which would make the total amount of remission allowable under both remission and parole the same as it is now so that a person could obtain per cent <e> <s> remission by means of the northern ireland system and an additional one-sixth under the parole system then no one would serve a sentence longer than he would <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord the minister whether he is aware of the refugee children from el salvador who are in

that even at the end of the eight months when the explanatory statement is supplied by the entry certificate officer very frequently it occurs that the adjudicator requires clarification of some point contained in it <e> <s> therefore the eight months which the noble lord mentions is not the time taken between the refusal of an entry certificate and the preparation of the case by the appellant before the adjudicator <e> <s> it may be as much as two years <e> <s> when we are talking about these elderly people they may die before the case is resolved <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the consideration to be satisfied in these cases that the parent in question is wholly or mainly dependent on the child to whom he or she would like to go in the united kingdom and that the child concerned is able and willing to support them <e> <s> are not these matters of fact which will be known to the entry certificate officer at the time of his decision <e> <s> and what is he doing during the whole of those eight months <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the advice given to the department of transport that it is not so much the number of vehicles which causes damage to the track as the weight which has to be sustained by individual axles <e> <s> has the noble earl seen the calculations on the increased tonnes lorry weights which show that according to the governments suggestions there would sometimes be an axle load of tonnes which would cause an immense amount of damage and result in the m hardly ever being open <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not appropriate to look at the general rate of inflation in relation to the expenditure of parents on children under the age of <e> <s> should not the government rather have regard to the figures in the household expenditure survey which show a fairly sharp rise has occurred since the government came into office in in respect of expenditure on childrens clothes for example which have gone up by more than the effect of inflation <e> <s> would the government therefore re-examine the figures given to the noble baroness lady faithfull to see whether some additional measures of help are required for this group of children <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble viscount mention one single fact which has been presented to the government which makes it appropriate for this country to have an independent nuclear deterrent when richer members of the nato alliance such as germany do not find it appropriate to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree that recently published research by the home office itself indicates that dangerousness is not a predictable characteristic and that therefore to single out persons who commit certain classes of offence as being less eligible for consideration for early release is not a satisfactory means of protecting the public against serious harm <e> <s> in view of that does not the minister think that the non-eligibility of category a prisoners for consideration for parole is a serious matter and that there should be some means whereby these prisoners could get their categorisation reviewed so that they might qualify for earlier release <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble lord seen reports appearing in this mornings papers of the use of chemical weapons by the ethiopians backed by the soviet union in eritrea the warnings of which have been given to the foreign office over the past <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord consider the difficulties that sometimes arise on the boundary where the prison psychiatric service considers that a person needs to be treated in a hospital but the hospital when they examine him believe that he is perfectly all right <e> <s> this happened in the case of richard campbell who the noble lord may remember was thought to be suffering from schizophrenia when he was in prison but when he was sent to st bernards southall they found that he was perfectly normal and he was sent back to prison where he subsequently died of dehydration <e> <s> does not the noble lord think that this tragic and unnecessary death indicates a failure of communication between the prison medical service and the psychiatric hospitals which needs to be examined perhaps in the case of patients such as richard campbell who was a rastafarian by sir george young who has just been appointed particularly to look into questions of race <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble viscount seen the evidence in the newspapers relating to the use of chemical weapons by soviet backed ethiopian forces in eritria only this week <e> <s> will he make

secretary convey to the indonesian authorities our concern indeed horror about the reports of mass executions in the territory of east timor last year and the starvation of the people resulting from the military operations there <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the whole house and the agencies which were operating in east timor will be most grateful for the expressions of concern which the foreign secretary conveyed to the indonesian authorities but will an opportunity also be taken to say to them that if they exclude representatives of the aid agencies such as oxfam and catholic relief services then obviously they have something to hide <e> <s> will the foreign secretary co-operate fully with the investigation by the australian senate of the human rights and the condition of the people of fast timor which has now been undertaken <e>", "<cs> my lords i have had one or two cases recently of persons who were alleged to be suffering from untreatable personality disorders by the psychiatrist who first examined them when they came before the courts but who later on during the course of their sentence may have had different opinions expressed about them by other and equally expert psychiatrists <e> <s> so i rise only to enter a note of reservation both to this amendment and to that section of the bill that we shall come on to later where it is provided

will be necessary for the litigant in the european court to show that he has exhausted the domestic remedies whatever they may be <e> <s> he goes through the domestic courts he goes through tribunals

much better procedure if i may say so if your lordships in your wisdom had been allowed to press forward with that legislation <e> <s> the person who was wrongfully detained under the mental health

homes and hostels and the necessity for a power to delay the release of a patient because nursing and after-care facilities are not available <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt the minister to ask a question <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a contravention of this house to ask questions about matters that fall within the province of the local authorities <e> <s> if it is now permissible for noble lords to put questions to ministers and to require answers about details of local authority expenditure in this manner will there be an amendment to the standing orders so that we all know precisely where we stand on the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the minister would agree to have a look at the special case of refugees in the light of a case which i have drawn to the attention of his department concerning three young cambodian refugees who wanted to take a course which would have been beneficial to them in adapting to life in england <e> <s> they were young ladies from cambodia who wanted to acquire skills which would enable them to make a positive contribution to life in the united kingdom <e> <s> is the minister aware of the particular difficulties which generally arise in the case of refugees because usually they do not have any relatives who would be able to make any contribution to their living costs <e> <s> therefore it is essential for the refugees to be able to remain on the full supplementary benefit rate because the small allowances they would receive from leas would be totally inadequate to survive on <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister care

secretary and the ministers in his department simply say that the ambassadors of the western nations in addis ababa do not have conclusive proof of the deployment of these weapons <e> <s> therefore

need to search typewriters to make sure that unauthorised objects are not concealed in them this is a skill which is particularly appropriate to be taught in prisons and that if it cannot be done

government as a whole and the leader of the house take measures to discourage these questions whatever one may think of the merits of the particular matter under discussion now <e>", "<cs> my lords if the governments purpose is to get the best possible value for money and at the same time as the noble lord the minister said in answer to my noble friend to encourage people to go in for technological and scientific education may i ask him this question is it not wrong that the effect of the imposition of numbers limits on the universities has been to damage disproportionately some of the technologically based universities such as aston and some of the faculties which are essential to the future of this country such as the faculties of computing in universities like cambridge and kent while at the same time allowing the student numbers in similar faculties to rise in the polytechnics <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness agree that while there may be general approval of the notion that the house of lords should continue in being neither the labour nor the conservative party wishes it to function effectively because it would be a nuisance for them if proper resources were

read the report of the advisory council <e>", "<cs> my lords is not one of the best ways of preventing attacks by terrorists on targets within the united kingdom to stop weapons getting into the hands of psychopathic regimes like the libyans who are prepared to use terrorism as an instrument of policy <e> <s> will the noble viscount give proper attention to this in conjunction with our european allies so as to ensure that the activities of the libyans and the ethiopians do not spread from the continent of africa into our own continent <e>", "<cs> my lords is there not a contradiction between the professed concern of the tory party for the freedom of local government to take its own decisions and the constant slight sniping and barracking against individual decisions of local authorities

pay particular <e>", "<cs> my lords since some of the ships that are involved in this operation were due to have been scrapped within a very short time including one of the aircraft carriers would not the minister like to reconsider his assertion that nothing in our future defence plans would prevent us from mounting an operation of this size and complexity in the future <e> <s> because surely if those ships had been scrapped as was planned no immediate replacements would have been available to the navy <e>", "<cs> my lords not for the first time the noble earl lord longford has called for an immediate and substantial reduction in the prison population <e> <s> that plea will find an echo in many quarters and i believe not least in the home office and the present home secretary whose enlightened views on the matter we all applaud <e> <s> but there are very few options that will enable us to accomplish this end <e> <s> one of the choices to which the noble earl referred in passing and which would be of major significance would be the idea that remission should be increased from one-third to one-half bringing it into line with the practice in northern ireland <e>", "<cs> my

of transport is considerably encouraged <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the noble baroness lady faithfull and to underline one of the things that has just been said by the noble lord lord hunt about the preparedness of the courts to incarcerate children since the passing of the children and young persons act which as the noble baroness told us was thought to be going to be a means of reducing the number of children in custody when in fact the reverse has happened and there has been a very sharp increase indeed over the last years <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down will he say if he can conceive of any circumstances in which the court of appeals guidance would conflict with the words proposed by the noble baroness lady faithfull for insertion in this bill <e>", "<cs>

the minister has given to us we know that there are up to of these young people who are mentally ill at any one time who get dumped in the prison system does the noble lord agree that it would provide a strong incentive to the home office to get on with the job of providing these youth custody centres for up to young persons if this amendment were put on the statute book now <e>", "<cs> i should like to make a couple of observations <e> <s> first i should like to refer to the european standard minimum rules which have been <e>", "<cs> i asked a specific question how medical officers are to carry out this function which they are obliged to do under the prison rules <e> <s> so there is a statutory obligation on prison authorities that medical officers should certify a cell as being fit for accomodation by prisoners <e> <s> what i wanted to know was in the absence of any quantitative standards how is the medical officer to know that a cell of any particular dimensions having windows of a particular size and heating to a particular temperature is in fact adequate for accommodating prisoners <e>", "<cs> why is the minister being so coy about this business of certified accommodation <e> <s> if one looks at the prison departments annual report one can see in the appendix that every single prison is listed there and a figure is given for certified normal accommodation which is the figure arrived at by the judgment of the medical officers using the process which the noble lord the minister has described <e> <s> he said that this exercise of the judgment of medical officers was under the supervision of the regional prison departments <e> <s> what i want to know and what i am sure the noble lord who moved this amendment and noble lords who are signatories want to know is how in a particular region the medical officer and the governor together arrive at the figure for certified normal accommodation <e> <s> and if there is any difference between one region and another what is the rationalisation for that <e> <s> on the other hand if there is a figure which applies throughout the whole of the prison department establishments of the amount of floor space the cubic content the level of illumination the level of ventilation the level of temperature and so on if such things are uniform throughout the prison system why is it the noble lord cannot give us the figures <e> <s> if it is not uniform could he tell us what the variations are between one region and another <e> <s> i think the committee must know the answers to these questions before coming to a decision on the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord tell the house how the rapid deployment force could have been able to prevent ethiopian aggression against eritrea or the present happenings in the lebanon <e>", "<cs> i wonder if the noble lord could help by telling the committee whether or not napo were aware at the time when they made representations concerning this clause that the noble lord lord elton was going to put down the amendment which the noble lord lord trefgarne has mentioned because it seems to me to go some way towards meeting the case which the noble lord lord donaldson has underlined yet again <e> <s> if the probation officers were anxious in case the courts imposed conditions which could not be monitored then the amendment which we shall be coining to shortly would largely take care of that <e> <s> as the noble lord lord trefgarne has said the courts do not have to use this provision <e> <s> it is there for them if having consulted the supervisor they are satisfied that it is feasible to secure compliance with those conditions <e> <s> having regard to that i should have thought that the use of these provisions by the courts would tend to expand and to do so with the full approval of the probation officers <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord the minister can answer two questions which he may have overlooked in the course of his reply <e> <s> the noble <e>", "<cs> i cannot imagine the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask the noble lord the minister why on this occasion he does not like the idea of guidelines <e> <s> whenever we have tried to insert proposals in the bill in the form of a statutory provision it has been said by he or his colleagues that guidelines are far better <e> <s> now we have some guidelines and no doubt the minister can tell us in what respect they are not working satisfactorily if that is the case <e> <s> then as the noble and learned lord suggests we can consider whether it would not be better to try to improve them rather than to write into the statute <e>", "<cs> i understand that the minister may not look too favourably on the idea of using these former teacher training colleges as secure accommodation because of the cost of modifying them as compared with erecting new special purpose-built accommodation <e> <s> but there is no dispute in principle on this as i understand it because the government have said that they intend to phase out these remands as soon as resources allow <e> <s> the question before the committee is whether or not the government have a definite plan and will come forward now and tell us precisely on what date the resources will allow for secure accommodation to be provided in every region instead of there being certain shortages only in particular areas of the country as there are now <e>", "<cs> i should like to pursue the european convention point for a few moments before we draw this debate to a conclusion <e> <s> i am very glad to hear that the noble lord the minister will take advice on whether or not the procedures that are laid down under the community homes regulations satisfy the obligations that we have under the convention <e> <s> certainly the report to which the noble baroness lady david has referred is quite categorical in saying that the procedures do not comply with the convention <e> <s> i should have thought that at this stage the noble lord the minister might have been able to express a preliminary opinion on his reading of that report <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness withdraws her amendment <e>", "<cs> does not the noble baroness think that the government should give slightly higher priority to this matter and that it was not good enough for the minister to say that the law officers were not able to give their immediate attention to it <e> <s> if there is a threat of our being brought before the european commission yet again for a breach which has been drawn to their attention in another place and now again in this house <e>", "<cs> that was an intervention on an intervention which is wholly irregular <e> <s> first of all the minister said that the law officers are not able to give this matter their immediate attention <e> <s> after that when pressed he said that it was currently before the law officers which means that in common with many other issues it is lying on their desk waiting to be looked at but not at the top of the heap <e> <s> should not the law officers now be asked to come forward with their advice before your lordships reach the report stage on this bill <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord donaldson deploys his panoply of arguments which he has warned us he has up his sleeve the minister said again just now that the regulations would be looked at as soon as this bill is on the statute book but on the last occasion when he made that remark he also went on to say as an aside that of course his right honourable friend already had the power to conduct a review of the <e>", "<cs> i was not aware of having said that i had no faith in the regulations <e> <s> the noble baroness lady faithfull quoted me as having said that when i simply said that i hoped the regulations would give effect to the suggestions that had been made in the previous amendment so that we could enshrine in the bill some provision to ensure that we were in conformity with our obligations under the european convention on human rights <e> <s> although i agree that the amendment should be taken into consideration by the minister i am not clear that that would satisfy our obligations under that convention because the article which was quoted allows the person deprived of his liberty to initiate proceedings before a court or some other judicial tribunal whereas the noble baronesss suggestion is that after three months the regulations would provide for a review of his detention <e> <s> i am not sure and i should be interested to hear any legal advice the minister may have on the point that we would honour our obligations in that way <e>", "<cs> i warmly agree with the noble baroness lady trumpington because i think there is a world of difference in as she says a board of governors who look after a school carrying out many of the functions about which the noble baroness lady masham who moved the amendment was talking such as the interface with the outside world <e> <s> it is a very desirable objective in the case of a school or community home that those members of the board of governors or in this case the members or nominees of the local authority who make occasional visits should spare the time to act as pr agents if you like for the community home going out and explaining to the general public what it is aiming to do and trying to enlist their support for the objectives and so on <e> <s> but not for heavens sake <e> <s> to go hack into the homes and carry out disciplinary functions which in my opinion are incompatible with the functions of a board of governors <e> <s> in fact no school would expect a hoard of governors to be involved in internal disciplinary procedures <e>", "<cs> if i may say so the noble lord the chief whip has indicated to members on his own side that they have been speaking too long and they have been on their feet for only a couple of minutes <e> <s> it is unfair to say that everybody should be more concise when nobody has been fillibustering in the speeches i have heard <e> <s> in deference to the injunctions of the noble lord the chief whip i have not made any speech in the last one and a half hours <e> <s> the speeches have all been extremely concise <e> <s> i do not think that the arguments to which we have listened could have been compressed into the space of a fewer number of minutes than they have taken <e> <s> to suggest that the committee has been delaying matters or prolonging proceedings on the bill is unfair <e>", "<cs> for a start the noble lord lord campbell of alloway is working from an old marshalled list because amendment no <e> <s> is not starred in the marshalled list issued today <e> <s> if i may venture to offer the noble lord some advice the partly suspended sentence which we discussed earlier <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment which has the merit of simplicity in comparison with amendment no <e> <s> and enables us to calculate with a fair degree of certainty by how many thousand prisoners we would reduce the population of prisons in england and wales <e> <s> this calculation has been done by the noble lord lord elton and he gave the results to the house on a previous occasion <e>", "<cs> it is only relevant to this amendment because as i said a moment ago perhaps the noble lord missed it by passing this amendment we would reduce from the present one-third to one-sixth the proportion of the sentence which was susceptible to parole <e> <s> i was indicating that from the point of view of the prisoners this might be a very important advantage because so many of them who were unsuccessful in their applications for parole and could not see why this was so would sooner that that affected a smaller proportion of the time they spent in prison <e> <s> i think that this is a beneficial aspect of the proposals contained in this amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble earl had just said that the cases of life sentence prisoners are different in their nature from the cases of persons serving indeterminate sentences in that they do not even come to the local review committee until a committee of the parole board and home office have decided to refer them <e> <s> this may happen at any stage in a mans sentence <e>", "<cs> if he has not improved during that <e>", "<cs> the prisoner does not think there is an imminent likelihood of his being released if he is in category a <e> <s> no category a prisoner has been released on licence or given parole since september <e> <s> therefore the prisoner may be aware that reference to the local review committee will not lead to his release for a long time <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> i said that people had served years or more of life sentences <e>", "<cs> i am so sorry to interrupt the noble lord so soon <e> <s> recently i asked him how many of the life sentence prisoners at present in our prisons were serving sentences for which capital punishment was provided under the old legislation and he said that he could not tell me <e> <s> that rather destroys the argument that he has put that many of the people now serving long sentences in prison would have been executed <e> <s> he cannot tell me what the figure is <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down he knows perfectly well that cases fererred to the local review committee do not hit the press as he put it <e> <s> also before the noble lord sits down would he care to deal with the point about the successive interval between reviews <e> <s> it is after all an integral part of the amendment and one which i spent a few minutes talking about particularly the lengthening of intervals <e>", "<cs> of course the parole board is a quango and of course it is very hardworking as any body which contains the noble baroness and the noble lord lord harris of greenwich would be <e> <s> i too would like to pay tribute to the enormous amount of hard work the noble lord has done as chairman of that body over the years and also to the noble baroness <e> <s> i am quite certain that they do work long hours and that they consider these cases extremely carefully <e> <s> nevertheless and i am sorry to have to say this to the noble baroness it is true that they work behind locked doors no member of the press or public can hear the deliberations of the parole board or indeed of the local review committee <e>", "<cs> that only reinforces the point i was making that the whole system is a closed shop <e> <s> members of local review committees can sit in on the proceedings of the parole board but no outsider can <e> <s> somebody who wants to understand the system such as a journalist or a member of your lordships house seeking probably to support the work of the parole board and of local review committees and to explain them to the public who probably do find them to be cloaked in an unintelligible mystery as the noble earl lord longford put it are disbarred from being able to do this and from interpreting the work which the noble baroness and the noble lord lord harris of greenwich do <e> <s> that is one of the reasons why one gets these criticisms and why there is the demand reiterated by the noble earl lord longford for some explanation to be given for the decisions of the parole board and the local review committees <e>", "<cs> i am very interested in this point because i think that the effect of alcohol on crime has not been properly examined although i pay tribute to the work of the parole board in this regard <e> <s> in the report of the parole board for one of the factors mentioned in offences of violence which have to be looked at is the degree of addiction to drink which the noble lord has said was a factor in this particular case <e> <s> but surely you would not ask the wife for a professional opinion on whether or not the offender was likely to turn back to alcohol after his release <e> <s> this is a matter on which you would get the opinion of a trained psychiatrist <e>", "<cs> i do not know why the noble lord says that we would get a torrent of litigation because there is nowhere in the world where as has been said in the debate comprehensive reasons for refusal are given <e> <s> we only have the menus such as they have in new south wales <e> <s> if we had comprehensive reasons how does the noble lord know since there is no comparable experience that that would result in a torrent of litigation <e>", "<cs> i should like to take up one point that arises out of the debate we had last week which i think is equally important in relation to prisons and so on as it was to establishments where juveniles are detained <e> <s> it is the question of minimum space air volume ventilation heating and so on such as is mentioned in subsection of this amendment <e> <s> what the noble lord told the committee last time was that we could not lay down any general standards because the fabric of the existing prisons varied enormously between one establishment and another and between one region and another <e> <s> he said that this was why for the time being it was better to let the regions specify what minimum standards had to be adhered to within those regions knowing the nature of the buildings with which they had to deal <e> <s> i can very well understand that <e> <s> i have to concede to the noble lord that he was putting an insuperable objection to the committee in the way of laying down any general guidelines such as we had in mind at that time <e>", "<cs> i was really hoping that there could be some input from the professional expertise outside parliament while the guidelines were still in the process of being formed and that for this purpose if the regional guidelines which are now operative were published it would enable people to see how the prison system is coping with the task at present and to make more intelligent and constructive proposals about what should be in the final version <e>", "<cs> to me too there is much to be said for it and i am glad to have the powerful reinforcement of the noble lord lord campbell of alloway <e> <s> i believe that if there had been any technical objection following publication of the groups report we would have heard about it from the ministers in the home office and many others who would have the opportunity of studying the proposals <e> <s> the evidence is fairly conclusive and some of it comes from the home office itself that we need to increase the effectiveness of fines enforcement and it has to be done in the early stages if possible before default has occurred <e> <s> the home office in its research pamphlet no <e> <s> on fines in magistrates courts published in shows that action to enforce payment had to be taken in nearly half of the sample of over offenders who had been fined or ordered to pay other sums such as compensation or costs <e>", "<cs> this matter has caused endless correspondence as the noble lord lord elton may be aware <e> <s> certainly his predecessors in office have had to deal with an enormous number of cases where because the secretary of state does not get around to considering a recommendation for deportation made by the court until towards the end of a mans sentence the procedures have not been completed by the day on which he ought to have been released <e> <s> he is then held sometimes for fairly considerable periods under the immigration act powers after he would otherwise have ended his sentence <e> <s> this is clearly quite contrary to the rules of natural justice and i am pleased that some steps have been taken in this bill to give power to the courts to direct the release whether subject to conditions or not of a person who would otherwise be so detained <e>", "<cs> there is only one point i would ask the minister perhaps to consider as a result of his intervention that in the case of the non-custodial sentence where as he rightly points out a person is held in detention only because of the powers of the immigration act and not because of any sentence of a court of law it is not necessary for time to be allowed for that person to appeal against destination <e> <s> although formerly ministers always used to say that this was legally necessary there have been instances as the noble lord may be aware in which the person concerned has signed a memorandum waiving his right of appeal against deportation <e> <s> the secretary of state has then very reasonably in my opinion proceeded with the deportation notice without waiting for the two weeks to elapse in which the person would theoretically have had the right to appeal against destination <e>", "<cs> it really is depressing the way every single suggestion that has been made during the course of this committee stage for reducing the prison population has been rejected for some reason or other by ministers <e> <s> even when we come down to this one which i should have thought everybody would have agreed with the noble lord lord elton has reasons for maintaining prison in the case of defaulters largely on the civil service-like ground that if you abolish imprisonment for default in the case of drunkenness offenders you will be creating an anomaly because people could still sent be to prison for default on other types of fines <e> <s> all right the government could solve that one very easily if they would agree to extend this amendment and abolish imprisonment for default of fines altogether which i would warmly endorse <e>", "<cs> the noble lord invites me to upset the noble lord lord denham and i shall not do that at this stage i shall save my reply to that last remark for the next occasion <e>", "<cs> when i last raised this matter in i think figures were available for the number of sentences of imprisonment that were passed on offenders for simple possession of cannabis <e> <s> the number was certainly not significant although i am glad to say that the practice of imposing sentences of imprisonment for first offences in the united kingdom had virtually disappeared by that time <e> <s> however in the channel islands where they have a rather antiquated view of these matters there were many cases where people were being sent to prison for first offences unfortunately we do not have jurisdiction there <e>", "<cs> at this late hour i do not want to prolong the debate but i quite accept the ministers contention that he would not want to treat foreigners more favourably than we do prisoners within the united kingdom <e> <s> but if we are to sign this draft council of europe treaty it surely presupposes that someone who is domiciled here and who is a citizen of one of the other countries that are signatories to the treaty will normally he repatriated if he satisfies the conditions laid down in the draft treaty and if he has applied for a transfer <e>", "<cs> i hope we shall review the criteria and perhaps there will be an opportunity to discuss the matter at a later stage <e> <s> it would be wanton cruelty to the committee if i were to prolong the discussion on a matter which is of interest only to the noble lord and myself and therefore i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords surely the truth is that production of these weapons by either the soviet union or the united states is a matter of genuine concern to many hundreds of millions of people all over the world <e> <s> is it not perfectly right that this country and indeed all the allies of the united states should be using their influence now that the start talks have begun in geneva to try to obtain the maximum possible reduction of nuclear weapons on both sides <e>", "<cs> my lords why should the noble lord not ask a second supplementary <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that in the long term there could be tremendous opportunities for both china and britain if there could be closer co-operation between our two countries in the field of information technology and that some initiatives would be particularly welcome if they could be taken within information technology year <e> <s> does the minister know what steps would have to be taken for us to be able to escape from the constraints that cocom imposes on trade in hardware and software respectively <e>", "<cs> my lords further to my noble friends question if the cuts which are stated to be planned by the government in the <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord campbell of alloway stated what would be the conclusions of such a committee were it to be set up <e> <s> but my lords is there not a preliminary question which must be determined before a study is conducted of a particular issue such as implantation of foetuses <e> <s> that question is where do the government draw the boundaries around the clinical freedom of doctors to do what they consider to be best in the interests of their patients <e> <s> has not that to be sorted out first before one conducts an inquiry into a particular aspect of medical treatment <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government make it plain to guyana that it would be easier for us to support applications for international financing of this kind if the government in guyana ceased to violate human rights <e> <s> as for example exemplified by the murder of the distinguished scholar dr walter rodney and the continued persecution of his brother mr donald rodney <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind what was said about sensitivity in this issue may i ask whether there is not some misunderstanding about what hours actually would be worked under the flexible <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not possible to resolve this matter once and for all and following the noble earls question by labelling the flue gases from power stations with other isotopes of sulphur that will enable the fall-out to be identified as coming from a particular origin <e> <s> would not the minister also confirm that the problem with acid rain is now spread not just from scandinavia but to the entire northern hemisphere and that our own agriculture in this country is threatened in the long term with serious side effects from this cause <e> <s> therefore should it not be the subject of intensive research by the government probably in co-operation with other european and north american nations <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged to the noble baroness <e> <s> did the figures which the noble lord gave for capital and revenue expenditure include spending by the regional authorities on the interim secure units <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that even though obviously in the long term we must have the permanent facilities the interim secure units are doing a very good job and at any rate at the one in beckenham patients and staff mix in a reasonably civilised atmosphere which would be a lesson to the prison service on how to contain potentially violent and refractory men <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask a question about one aspect which does not seem to work very well and that is the disparity in treatment between prisoners sentenced for life and prisoners given determinate sentences for similar offences <e> <s> because as the noble lord will be aware there are many cases where a life sentence may be given for offences other than homicide <e> <s> is it not possible because two different parts of the home office consider these cases that those sentenced for life serve an inordinately long time in prison compared with those who are given determinate sentences <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry i did not explain myself properly <e> <s> i was referring to the disparity in actual time served between the two categories of sentence given <e> <s> the difference between determinate and indeterminate sentences is out of all proportion to the difference in the gravity of their offences because of the fact that they are considered in different parts of the home office <e>", "<cs> my lords if the minister suggests that this is going to be a very large problem when he paints a picture of the enormous administrative burdens that will be laid on the staff if our views prevail would he care to tell the house how many young people aged and he calculates will be sent to prison if the <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the noble lord the minister has accepted although i cannot find the actual quotation that young persons of and should not be detained in adult prisons <e> <s> therefore there is no argument between us on the matter of principle it is solely a question of practicalities and of how one can keep this very small number of young persons of or years of age out of adult prisons when they are unfit for a detention centre <e> <s> when we were last discussing this the minister did say that there were as many as young persons who were mentally unfit at any one time although he subsequently qualified this and went on to say that they were not only the mentally unfit but also those who had any kind of disability which made it impossible to deal with them in a detention centre including those who had a mild ailment such as a hernia <e> <s> as he rightly pointed out these are of a different order <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel unhappy about this and i am reinforced in that feeling by the strength of the opposition against it <e> <s> i think the noble lord the minister could have told us a little more <e> <s> many of us will have seen the paper which embodied the view of a great many responsible organisations the association of directors of social services the british association of social workers the conference of chief probation officers the national association for care and resettlement of offenders i will not read them all out because the minister is aware of the generality of the opposition expressed <e> <s> although the present amendment is a great deal better than the original proposal in the bill it does not take care of the objections voiced by the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords nobody disputes the fact that secure accommodation is necessary for some children of kind the minister described although it was alarming to read of the nature of some of these units in a recent <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not spoken before <e>", "<cs> my lords it is no good the noble lord lord sandys shouting order <e> <s> when i have not spoken on this amendment <e> <s> i am determined to have my say <e> <s> it would not be good enough if the noble lord has made a mistake on such a substantial issue to write to noble lords who have spoken <e> <s> he must come to the floor of the house and correct the no doubt unintentional misinformation given to the whole house <e> <s> this is such a substantial error and it makes such a big difference to the way in which this amendment has been treated that it would be wholly inadequate for the noble lord to limit himself to writing to those who have taken part in the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords my name is also on the amendment and i should like to say a word in support of it and to echo the view of my noble friend lord wigoder that the fact that it concerns only a small number of cases does not detract in any way from the merits of the amendment <e> <s> i believe that even if it was only one individual who had suffered unjust imprisonment as a result of the lack of a power in the lower courts to give bail your lordships would be justified in making this amendment so as to save that person from wrongful imprisonment <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the press council issued a judgment long ago that newspapers should not glorify the life of criminals by publishing their memoirs or those of members of their families <e> <s> should not the newspapers bear this closely in mind in the present instance <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very glad that the noble earl lord longford has returned to this subject again because i think that your lordships need to consider the situation that has arisen in the last decade when the life sentence population of our prisons has in fact increased enormously <e> <s> i refer to the excellent home office research study no <e>", "<cs> my lords the point i make about representations is that many prisoners are not able to communicate in writing and that foreigners would not be capable even of communicating in the english language whereas if they could appear in person before the special committee which the noble earl lord longford advocates they would make verbal representations with an interpreter present <e>", "<cs> my lords a person sentenced to three years may be released after one year if he qualifies for parole and receives the full one-third remission of his sentence so that he is released after months <e> <s> but a person who is sentenced to months in prison may still be released after one year because he does not qualify for parole <e> <s> it is absurd that a person serves the same actual length of sentence when the courts have thought fit to impose a difference of two to one in terms of the length of sentence given <e> <s> they finish up by serving the same length of time as a result of the inoperation of the parole system on short sentences <e>", "<cs> my lords it obviously was not the main objective of the government to reduce the prison population or we should not have been left <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has said that the scale of reduction now proposed is anything that the secretary of state chooses to make it between one-third and one-half <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the minister is just as capable of reading what it says on the marshalled list as anybody else in the house including my noble friend <e> <s> either my noble friend is right and the amendment does cause the bill to read shall shall or my noble friend is misreading the amendment and the bill as amended would make perfectly good sense <e> <s> it is a simple matter on which i would have thought the noble lord would have no difficulty in making an immediate reply <e>", "<cs> my lords it was good of the minister to deal with this matter in such detail and what he has said has provided us with food for thought <e> <s> i will say at this stage only that i do not consider it a small matter that persons are detained in our penal establishments when they have committed no criminal offence <e> <s> we shall certainly have to return to this matter not perhaps at a later stage of this bill because i agree with the noble lord that the amendments were tabled rather at the eleventh hour but on some other occasion when we have the opportunity of going into the reform of the immigration act in a more comprehensive manner <e>", "<cs> my lords there may be a form of access but it is useless in this particular case because the provisions of section of the immigration act give the secretary of state enormous powers over anybody against whom an exclusion order is signed as the noble lord is aware and the merits of the case would not be tested in a court because where security matters are concerned the secretary of state would not be obliged to state any other reasons apart from the fact that he had signed the certificate <e> <s> i am afraid therefore that the remedy that the noble lord proposes <e>", "<cs> my lords there is an unseemly contrast between the governments approach to an amendment where our violation of the obligations that we have under the european convention on human rights arose where it was said that nothing could be done during the course of this bill because of the extensive consultations which had to be entered into and this problem where a minor question relating to the way we handle the matter of overstayers is of such urgency that it has to be brought before your lordships at very short notice and rushed through the house without any consultations whatsoever and particularly with those organisations that represent ethnic minorities in this country <e> <s> even in the short time which they have had to scrutinise the amendments they have already expressed grave alarm as the noble and learned lord has said and i believe with good reason because this is yet another instance of the way that the tory government is determined to hound the last over-stayer illegal entrant and person in breach of any provision of the immigration laws with such high priority that measures to tackle it must be brought immediately before the house the minute any breach is disclosed <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will look at section <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister to address himself to the frenchman who has been resident here for seven years working in the united kingdom under the provisions of the treaty of rome but whose mother is in france <e> <s> would not the council of europe draft convention provide that ordinarily unless there were some other considerations he would be repatriated to france to serve his sentence no matter how long he had been working in the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords the draft convention states that the sentenced person can be transferred <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not disagree with that point <e> <s> all i was saying i think that the noble lord agrees with me we are on all fours in this respect at least is that the person from scotland or from wales for that matter should not he treated in an inferior way compared with the person from france or germany who benefits from the provisions of the draft convention <e> <s> that was all that i was seeking to achieve that when the draft convention comes into effect and a prisoner may apply for a transfer or may be offered a transfer between the contracting states similarly a person from scotland or wales could have the right to apply for a transfer back to scotland or wales to serve the sentence that has been imposed on him by an english court <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord donaldson is right <e> <s> we cannot pursue this now and we shall have to refer to it on a future occasion <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask just one question <e> <s> regarding these transfers between jurisdictions which is still a discretionary process do there have to be strong compassionate grounds for that discretion to be exercised in favour of the transfer <e>", "<cs> my lords did the minister say that it would be for the house to decide on the proposal of the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter and will the government make sure that the house does have an opportunity of deciding on the matter <e> <s> is he aware that when the proposal was put to your lordships by the noble baroness lady vickers it was lost by only a very narrow margin and that if it were now put again with the support of so many noble lords sitting behind the minister it is certain that it would be accepted <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord not agree that one of the few qualifications for which there is still an excess of demand over supply is computer programming and in this year of information technology i wonder if the government will consider financing education and training schemes within industry which would enable young people of this age group to get the two years experience which is required by most employers before they will take on somebody in a paid job and thereby enable more of this age group to get their feet on the first rung of that employment ladder <e>", "<cs> my lords is there not a golden opportunity now with falling school rolls to redeploy teachers into pre-school education particularly in the areas where a high proportion of both parents go out to work and in areas where there is a high concentration of ethnic minorities as recommended by the rampton report <e>", "<cs> my lords why is the minister reluctant to make any comment on the delivery of incendiary devices to israel by the united states <e> <s> is it because the government do not believe there is any moral content to the use and facilitation of these weapons or because they do not wish to offend the united states which is our greatest ally <e> <s> in connection with the rights of the civilian population would the noble lord make representations to the israeli authorities that international observers should be admitted to the territory they have occupied so that they can see that the persons who have been detained by the israeli military are being properly treated <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with those remarks of the noble baroness lady faithfull but the noble baroness lady david having moved the amendment i am provided with an opportunity of repeating a question which i put to the noble lord lord elton at an earlier stage but which i fear he did not answer at the time <e> <s> i refer to the important question of what parents are supposed to do when there has been a breach of an order <e> <s> i put that question to the minister on th july at column and although he made a speech later in that debate he must have forgotten by the time he came to make it the question i had asked him <e> <s> it is an important point because the courts will make a night restriction order only if they are satisfied that the relationship between the young person and the parents is such that there is a reasonable chance of it being observed and both the parents and child must agree that a restriction order shall be imposed <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that the parents themselves are not under any duty to the court to report the absence from home of the child during the hours when the night restriction order is in force <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness lady young aware that those of us who believe in the preservation and indeed the enhancement of the national health service are not afraid of the arguments of the wreckers but would welcome the exposure of their arguments to the light of day so that we can contradict them <e> <s> is the noble baroness further aware that it diminishes the standing of the government when documents submitted to them in confidence are leaked partially to the press in such a manner as to distort their meaning and that the best way the noble baroness and her colleagues have of convincing the public that they mean what they say in declaring that they wish to preserve the health service is to publish the report in its entirety and then argue against its findings <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minster agree that so far as land-based warfare in europe is concerned the balance has shifted decisively in favour of defence with the advent of light and accurate infantry borne anti-tank weapons <e> <s> does this not mean that arguments about the exact strength of forces on either side of the iron curtain have become irrelevant and that we should settle down to negotiations to dismantle the theatre nuclear weapons on either side because so far as the west is concerned they are unnecessary to repel an attack by the warsaw pact <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that what matters to the ordinary patient is not the amount of money that is spent on the national health service but the ease with which he can get access to treatment and the length of time it takes him to get an out-patient consultation or to have an operation for a condition which is uncomfortable or painful such as hernia or varicose veins <e> <s> can the noble lord say whether the increase in the level of resources which he <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i agreed with nearly every word that was spoken by the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale on the policing aspects of the scarman report <e> <s> i only want to add that i was delighted to see that the noble and learned lord lord scarman noted in the speech to the association of jewish ex-servicemen to which the noble lord lord elystan-morgan has referred the fact that there had been substantial progress in the last year in fact more than he had expected <e> <s> one is very glad that the noble and learned lord saw that there were signs of optimism bearing in mind that inevitably the two speeches which we have just heard have focused on the enormous amount of work there still remains to do <e> <s> we should he under no illusion that there is a very substantial task to be undertaken before there can be any real improvement in the image that the police <e>", "<cs> my lords does the figure that the noble lord quoted include the cuts in real terms which have arisen from the failure of the government to increase particular benefits in line with the cost of living such as the death grant which has remained constant since <e>", "<cs> my lords i too wish to give a partial welcome to the bill and in particular to some of the points outlined by the minister in his introductory remarks <e> <s> we certainly like the extension of the protection of sites of local authorities the obligation on owners to offer agreements to all residents the fact that the initiative must be taken by the owner and not the occupier and the prescribing of a notice by regulation which will inform residents of many of the rights they may not have known about in the past <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord aylestone asked me to say that he was sorry that he could not remain for the debate <e> <s> he was good enough to indicate to me the sense of what he had intended to say and particularly on the questions of husbands and children we found ourselves in broad agreement and he authorised me to say that the remarks that i am about to make on these matters coincide with his own views <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether when the minister comes to reply to this amendment he will say a word about the problem of the mixed site where it is possible for a person to be granted a right to station a mobile home as his principal dwelling but where equally there are other parts of the site where only <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord bishop-ston deals with that helpful reply of the minister i should like to pursue one point which arose as the minister spoke namely whether it is correct to say as he does that the occupier will be deemed to have an unrestricted right if the licence provides for nothing but residential use unless the contract which the owner offers to the occupier expressly limits the occupation to holiday use therefore it is not necessary to have such a provision in the bill because most of the sites are licensed for residential use only and a person coming onto a site would automatically have the unrestricted right which is mentioned in clause a <e> <s> this reinforces the point which i made that in the case of the mixed site scheme there is a danger which we must guard against <e>", "<cs> i would ask the noble lord lord bellwin to have a look back at the proceedings on the mobile homes act to see how many of us warned then that site operators were not going to enter into the agreements that were hoped for then and that more teeth were required in the bill which we did not get to make sure that this happened <e> <s> i had a sense of <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to prolong this matter <e> <s> what happens is first of all he does not offer the agreement <e> <s> then he finds that some of the terms of occupation are unenforceable <e> <s> he cannot collect the rents to put it bluntly <e> <s> then he has another opportunity of rectifying the matter by offering the agreement at that point <e> <s> there are two stages at which he can avoid being brought before the court <e> <s> one is when he has the three months that is given to him under the existing wording of the bill to offer the agreement and then later after the three months have expired again when the occupier fails to comply with any of the terms of his occupation he has another chance because of the wording of this amendment <e> <s> i think that we have taken every possible step to encourage the owner and to give him the incentive to offer the agreement over and above what the bill at present provides <e> <s> we believe that that is necessary and we believe that your lordships will agree with us <e>", "<cs> i am sure the minister will appreciate from the correspondence in the doe that this is a matter which concerns mobile home occupiers almost as much as the level of the actual charges imposed <e> <s> i think one should say also that it is not quite as simple a matter to deny the payment of key money to the owner of a mobile home site as it is in the case of furnished rented properties <e> <s> the noble lord lord bishopston mentioned the act <e> <s> the provisions go back earlier than that in fact to the rent act of <e> <s> parliament considered that it was wrong that premiums should be charged in that manner for the granting of an agreement to occupy a furnished letting <e> <s> on similar reasoning we would say that it is fundamentally inequitable for premiums or key money to be charged as a condition of the granting of an agreement under this bill or under the mobile homes act which preceded it <e>", "<cs> is the minister aware that there is a shortage of sites in this country <e> <s> we are not faced with a completely free market <e> <s> it is like the market for rented homes where parliament prohibited the charging of key money <e> <s> therefore does not the noble lord consider that these charges ought to be fair and reasonable as is provided for on the weekly pitch fees under clause <e>", "<cs> i do not want to prolong this discussion <e> <s> however one point that has not been mentioned is the reluctance of the local authorities to grant planning permission and site licences for new mobile home parks <e> <s> i am sure that the minister is well aware of that and that the department is familiar with the arguments that local authorities put forward against the development of these sites and the imposition of obligations on a local authority as a result of having mobile homes within its area <e> <s> it cannot be disputed that the use of mobile homes as a form of residential accommodation is highly unpopular among planning authorities who resist to the teeth the development of any new ones <e> <s> that is why i said in my earlier remarks that there is a shortage particularly in certain areas <e>", "<cs> the minister did not deal with the second point raised by the noble lord lord bishopston about the relationship of the definition in clause and the powers of the court in schedule <e> <s> as the noble lord pointed out the parties may have agreed in writing to submit any question arising under the bill to arbitration and when they do that the arbitrator may take the place of the court <e> <s> according to the definition the court is then given power in schedule <e>", "<cs> just one further word in response to the ministers invitation to clarify the purpose of the amendment <e> <s> if i may take up where he left off about cats and dogs the point is that under part ii of the schedule the site rules do not have to be included among the matters concerning which provision has to be made and so the agreement between the occupier and the site owner could be completely silent regarding site rules <e> <s> what i should like to see as a very minimum is for the secretary of state to have power to prescribe additional matters for which provision has to be made in the agreement so that in his wisdom he might see his way to treating the rules as something to be included in the agreement and not to be treated as something separate from it <e>", "<cs> in that case i shall be happy to seek your lordships permission to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the most important point that the noble lord the minister was making was that the discounts or premiums reflect to some extent at any rate the investment which the site operator has put into the land to make it suitable for a caravan site <e> <s> on that i would say that originally when the site came to be developed the site operator sold new caravans to the residents for occupation on the pitches and he was entitled to a commission as a person running a business selling mobile homes <e> <s> the example i gave earlier was taken as an indication of what the earnings level might be from these sales a twin unit home might cost and if his level of commission was per cent <e> <s> the site owner would get <e>", "<cs> that is certainly a more encouraging reply than we have had on some earlier amendments <e> <s> i believe it will be best if we delay further consideration of this point until we know the results of the consultation paper which i understand will not be known during the proceedings of this bill <e> <s> nevertheless i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether it would be convenient to take at the same time amendment no <e> <s> the amendment standing in the name of the noble lord lord bishopston and myself which takes into account the points made by the noble lord lord campbell <e>", "<cs> i thought the committee had agreed that we would take them together but i am perfectly happy to deal with them separately <e> <s> it seems to me illogical because they are both addressed to the same point <e>", "<cs> i am quite happy to leave it to the noble lord lord campbell to deal with his amendment and then come to mine later <e>", "<cs> i am happy to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to add a few words to what the noble baroness has put to the minister with such eloquence <e> <s> if the old people living in this mobile home do not have any close relatives to whom they wish to leave their property but they have a close friend who has been very good to them in their retirement to whom they may wish to transfer the benefit of this asset under the bill as presently drafted they would not be able to do that because as the noble lord has pointed out gifts and assignments are only to a member of the family approved by the owner <e>", "<cs> in the course of his reply i wonder whether the minister could remind the committee of the point we had reached as regards the matter of electricity charges which used to be a very difficult area to resolve when there was a supply of electricity to a site that was metered at a single point and not separately to the individual mobile homes <e> <s> i know that the area electricity boards were very keen that every mobile home should be separately metered and then of course no difficulty would arise <e> <s> but the problem of apportioning supplies that were received from a common source was a very difficult one to sort out and in many cases led people to think that they had been unfairly overcharged and in some cases it was possible to prove it <e> <s> although the electricity boards were always quite ready to entertain representations from people living in mobile homes that their charges were excessive and to look into the matter site operators were never happy about electricity officials coming on to the site measuring the amount that was being consumed by particular residents and seeing whether or not the charges were fair <e> <s> therefore i think that notification to the residents of that particular charge to the extent that sites are still commonly metered would be a very helpful way of ensuring that the charges are properly apportioned as between individual residents <e>", "<cs> i did ask the department and they said that the consultation letter was not available <e> <s> if it is now available may we have copies <e>", "<cs> i am sorry i was distracting my noble friend when the noble lord was putting that question <e>", "<cs> when the minister says that my noble friends second amendment would interfere with the arrangements that have already been made under section <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble earls attention been drawn to two publications that are highly respectful not only to teachers but also to senior officers of the armed forces and even to members of your lordships house <e> <s> i refer to the <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to abolish local authority resolutions assuming parental rights and make provision for the making of care orders in cases where a child is already in the voluntary care of a local authority and for connected purposes <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to prohibit dealing wholesale in certain alcoholic liquors with persons who are not licensed or permitted by law to retail such liquors and with clubs which are not registered and for connected purposes <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister to explain why on-site verification is still considered to be of such fundamental importance bearing in mind that the numbers of troops and quantity and types of weapons can be accurately assessed by satellite observations <e>", "<cs> my lords to what extent have we to believe the ministers assertion that the government are now prepared to listen to advice on local government in greater london when the noble lords predecessors including sir keith joseph then minister of housing and local government disregarded the excellent advice that we were given by the royal commission <e>", "<cs> my lords what happens in the case of buenos aires where there is such a good sale for naval gas turbines and electronic equipment for controlling exocet missiles <e>", "<cs> my lords while agreeing that it must have been very distressing for the relatives to have the test results given at the inquest is there not something to be said for the practice of taking blood samples from the victims of all accidents whether on the roads or in homes and industry to discover if possible the extent to which alcohol has played a part in the aetiology of those accidents <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for the information about the appointment of sir john garlick which everybody will welcome and also for the assurance that the timetable need not be strictly adhered to but is the noble lord aware that if the first meeting of the steering group takes place on th february and the members taking part in the deliberations have not yet received any papers the timescale is impossibly short <e> <s> will there be any papers before the meeting and in particular is the minister going to give guidance to the members beyond what is contained in his letter of th october <e> <s> will the steering group be able to consider the possibility that a new organisation will assume the functions assigned in the red consultation document to an organisation called action against alcohol abuse <e>", "<cs> my lords does that mean that the department and the government as a whole will accept recommendations from the steering group for a very wide range of functions to be assigned to the new organisation including campaigning functions of the kind i mentioned which were given to the four-as body in the consultative document <e> <s> will it be acceptable to the government if the steering group makes recommendations that the new body should overlap departmental bodies and be able to consider for example matters like alcohol and employment and alcohol and crime rather than confining itself strictly within the departmental boundaries of the dhss <e>", "<cs> if i may i would add one word to what has been said by the noble lord lord mottistone and my noble friend arising out of the remarks made by the minister on the last amendment when he sought to draw a distinction between information which is comprehensible to human beings and information which is only understood by computers <e> <s> it seems to me that it follows from what the noble lord lord mottistone and my noble friend have said that the line between these two definitions is being increasingly blurred <e> <s> i give two examples <e> <s> one is the growth of optical character recognition which enables a computer to read ordinary typescript and perhaps ultimately manuscript so that the question arises about whether ordinary typescript or manuscripts held in filing cabinets would be covered by the definition now under consideration <e> <s> the second example i want to draw to the noble lords attention is the growing ability of computers to recognise human speech <e>", "<cs> i hesitate to intervene in an argument between lawyers but perhaps i may make a suggestion on this point <e> <s> if one wants to ensure that the definition of processing when applied to personal data is the same as the definition when applied to any other kind of data the simplest way of doing that would be to leave out all the words from and in line onwards so that no reference occurs to personal data in the subsection <e> <s> therefore the processing of personal data would have to be exactly the same in definition as the processing of any other data <e>", "<cs> i am wondering whether the noble lord is strictly speaking correct in saying that it is only when they go on to the machine that they become data <e> <s> the definition in clause says that <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the minister agree that under the existing law it has been open to a person such as a single person working abroad for quite a number of years whose parents live here who has a qualifying address in the united kingdom to use that address even if he has not been there for many years <e> <s> therefore there is discrimination taking place within our law between those who work overseas and have a qualifying address that they can pretend to have been at on the qualifying date and those who have moved abroad with their whole families <e> <s> this really requires looking into as a matter of urgency <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mottistone addressed himself to the problems that may be faced by the commercial data user as a result of clause in that he may be compelled to give information to any member of the public in the form of a copy of the register which might prove to be commercially damaging and the minister has given assurances that the data user is fully protected from the revelation of any information which might be commercially damaging to him <e>", "<cs> the noble lord did not quite answer the point that i was making which was that while the particulars to be given in the register include a description of the personal data to be held by the data user it is not stated whether the data user will be required to state what particular classes of persons are to be contained in a particular file <e> <s> the example that i was giving was that in the case of the computer at harmondsworth we know that it would contain a list of suspected illegal immigrants and overstayers but as was shown in the article in <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the noble lord by saying that if the ministers crescendo of activities is followed we shall start with the informal representations by the registrar to the data user to tidy up his operations so that the cause of the contravention is eliminated <e> <s> it is at that stage that the data user might have to say as the noble lord has put it that the contravention is so fundamental to the nature of his operations that he is not in a position to comply with any request that the registrar has made to him <e> <s> if he says that then the requirement contained in the amendment moved by the noble lord lord mottistone is satisfied that the registered person had had sufficient opportunity to rectify the contravention because when it is drawn to his attention he looks at it and says to the registrar i am sorry but there is nothing i can do about it it is absolutely fundamental to my operations <e> <s> we then immediately proceed to clause without the intermediate stage of clause and there would be no disadvantage in having the amendment moved by the noble lord lord mottistone written into the bill <e>", "<cs> it says that there has to be evidence that an offence has been committed or that any of the principles have been contravened <e> <s> but supposing that the data user merely declines to provide the registrar with any information on which to base a suspicion that either an offence has been committed or any of the related principles have been contravened <e> <s> the registrar is not in a position to issue an enforcement notice or to bring into play any of the other powers that he has under clauses and <e>", "<cs> the minister said that a request for and refusal of access will have to have occurred before a warrant is issued under clause <e> <s> can he point to the words in the bill which have that effect <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mishcon has rightly said that the immigration rules could be attacked from many different points of view <e> <s> from the experience that i have of working closely <e>", "<cs> my lords i have quite enough in dealing with the home office without dealing with the immigration policies of other countries <e>", "<cs> my lords i merely ask whether the noble lord expects the house to rely on his unsupported assertion that he continues to live with his wife and whether the immigration officer in asking this same question of the intended fiane or husband will accept the persons assertion that he does intend to continue living with the person whom he is applying to join here or whether he will apply some additional test <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has turned my argument on its head <e> <s> what i said was that if the tories pretend that the entry of every single person is a threat to good race relations they are by that very statement stirring up racism <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble and learned lord to explain what happens in a case of information collected by a subsidiary of a company and then fed into a computer used by the parent <e> <s> if that counts as information coming from a third party it would be an easy way for somebody to give himself an absolute safeguard against the provisions of clause because he could merely record that the information came to him from a subsidiary so exempting himself from any claim for damages which an individual might otherwise be able to formulate <e>", "<cs> does that mean that if the information had been collected in manual form and it did not go into the computer until it got to the parent company there would be no right of action <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask one brief question about clause before we leave it <e> <s> does the right which is conferred on a data subject under the clause depend on the access provisions of clause <e> <s> in other words does the computer have to be other than a computer which is exempt from the subject access provisions there defined <e> <s> i am thinking in particular of the home office computers which as the noble and learned lord may recall have already figured in our discussions on one or two occasions during the committee stage <e>", "<cs> nobody would disagree with the noble lord lord mottistone that the requirements of national security are paramount <e> <s> in this bill as in the rest of our legislation we have to take good care that what we do upholds the powers of the government to ensure that national security is properly taken care of <e> <s> at the same time we should be jealous of arguments which are deployed in favour of secrecy and in favour of an extension of the powers of government under the guise of national security when in fact the records to which they refer may embrace a far larger category of subjects <e> <s> and we can see from the files which are kept by government on other matters apart from national security that they may extend into areas which are connected with the main purpose of the operation but are not directly germane to it <e> <s> therefore <e>", "<cs> may i raise a further point which i hope can be dealt with by the noble lord at the same time <e> <s> it relates to the disclosure of personal data held otherwise than for the purpose of safeguarding national security <e> <s> i take the example that he postulated of how this might operate in practice <e> <s> in pursuing an alleged breach of national security it might be necessary to find out the name of a person who has hired a car perhaps a terrorist who has hired a car for the purpose of committing an act of terrorism <e> <s> the noble lord explained that the person who holds this data would need to be sure that he was not liable to proceedings for a breach of the act if when someone asks him to disclose the name of this person for the purpose of national security he accesses the computer and gives out that information <e>", "<cs> strictly on the point of clause <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord reminded us on a previous amendment that the convention permitted derogation from the general principles which are set out now in schedule for certain purposes <e> <s> these were as he reminded us the protection of state security public safety the monetary interests of the state or the suppression of criminal offences <e> <s> on the previous amendment the noble lord pointed out that the assessment and the collection of tax came squarely within the phrase the monetary interests of the state <e> <s> for that reason it was properly to be found within clause <e> <s> will the noble lord tell us which of these purposes includes immigration control <e> <s> as i see it this is something which has crept into the bill after the white paper and has no place in the legislation <e> <s> indeed it may be likely to bring us into conflict with the provisions of the convention <e>", "<cs> my noble friend has advanced the very important case of medical records <e> <s> but there are other records of not perhaps quite the same sensitivity which are equally affected by these provisions <e> <s> the noble lord lord mishcon earlier on mentioned the representations which we have received from the national association of citizens advice bureaux which relate to the possibility that in the future as new technology advances and they are in the process of studying the ways in which microcomputers can be used in the operations of the citizens advice bureaux they would have sensitive <e>", "<cs> i hope that when the noble lord is consulting with the doctors he will consider a particular case of difficulty which has arisen which although it does not relate to information held on computers may well do so in the future that is the reports which are made by doctors in relation to a persons mental state when he comes before a court of law <e>", "<cs> may i take this opportunity of asking the minister what is the position of personal records kept by members of parliament for the purposes of their work <e> <s> i ask this <e>", "<cs> i am taking the opportunity of this amendment to ask the minister what is the position regarding exemption of personal data records kept by members of parliament in the course of their duties <e> <s> as the noble lord will probably appreciate i have a personal interest in his answer because i keep my immigration case records on a computer which i have <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say how much local authorities are allowed to spend without explicit statutory authority <e> <s> can he also say whether there are any restrictions on the purposes for which that money can be spent <e> <s> also if we believe in the greater freedom of local government from central control is it not bound to happen that from time to time local authorities will do things which are unpopular with the government of the day <e> <s> therefore if the noble lords party believes in the extension of power to local government will they not have to accept that the glc and other authorities may publish material with which they do not particularly agree <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree that what matters to the public is not the numbers of <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the minister agree that the government have a responsibility under the social security act which provides that the department of health has a duty to maintain and provide resettlement units at which persons without a settled way of life are afforded shelter <e> <s> is the noble lord aware i am sure he is that three hostels in london arlington house tower house and rowton house may close as a result of their sale to private developers rendering the inmates homeless <e> <s> will the noble lord say what were the results of the conversations last week between sir george young of the department of the environment and the three boroughs concerned with this matter <e> <s> what is the <e>", "<cs> does the noble lord agree that in the event of a catastrophe occurring and hostels closing with people being added to the number who already have to sleep on westminster embankment or under the charing cross arch the government would have responsibility for providing accommodation for them under the social security act <e>", "<cs> cover all these enormously important problems <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not be preferable if the government stated plainly not only that they have no present plans to do so but that irrespective of any recommendations that may be made by certain elements in the tory party they will resist any proposal to alter the franchise of irish citizens in the united kingdom <e> <s> would not the noble lord agree that in the present state of anglo-irish relations improving steadily and we all welcome that it would be an enormous blow to the progress of our dealings with the irish if there were any suggestion that their franchise in the united kingdom was to be altered <e> <s> ought we not rather to press instead for reciprocal rights to be granted to united kingdom citizens in ireland which was one of the items on the agenda in the joint talks <e>", "<cs> my lords if the irish republic does go ahead with the legislation the noble lord mentioned which i think we should all welcome is it not even more unthinkable that there should be any down-grading in the rights of irish citizens in the united kingdom <e> <s> does not the noble lord appreciate that the period of uncertainty we now face is not only likely to stir up anti-irish feeling by discussion of the possibility of legislative changes but also make the irish in the united kingdom less sympathetic to negotiated solutions in the north and more sympathetic to extremists <e>", "<cs> my lords will the inquiry look at the development of computing within the national health service <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the questions that have been put to him this afternoon are ample evidence of the effectiveness of the racist south african rgimes propaganda based on minor cosmetic changes in the field of sport and that the last thing that the commonwealth nations which adhere to the gleneagles agreement should do is to relax the pressure at a time when more is needed to be done by the western democracies to dismantle the very fabric of apartheid <e>", "<cs> my lords is this not an instructive lesson on the priorities of the present government that they are quite happy to allow local authorities such as merton to exercise their discretion to abandon the provision of school meals while insisting by law that all local authorities shall prepare for a nuclear war <e>", "<cs> my lords i meant data not personal data <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the minister says that a pianola roll is not data <e>", "<cs> my lords not personal data <e> <s> but we are talking here about data <e> <s> we are talking about clause and we come on to the question of personal data later on <e> <s> i would put it to the noble lord the minister that what is contained on a pianola roll could be personal data for instance if one were to write a code which linked musical notation with the ascii code which is used in a computer it would not be a physical impossibility to make a pianola roll record personal data <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister give any indication of the circumstances in which he thinks the registrar is likely to be satisfied that more specific particulars would be likely to prejudice the purpose or purposes for which the data are to be held <e> <s> does he think that is likely to be confined to systems which are exempted from the subject access provisions under clause which talks about matters such as the apprehension or prosecution of offenders where clearly the arrangement of the files might give <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has taken the matter the other way round because first i was asking whether systems that are exempted under clause were the only kinds of systems that might satisfy the registrar <e> <s> the noble lord has in effect answered that question by saying that there could be commercial considerations of the type that he has outlined which would justify expressing the particulars in a more general form as well as by mentioning the example relating to the police that he has just given <e>", "<cs> my lords may i congratulate my noble friend and the noble lord lord mottistone most warmly for the conception of the amendment and for the careful thought that they have obviously put into its drafting which is so clearly in the interests of not just the small businesses to which my noble friend has referred but also the voluntary sector and many individual users of computers who otherwise might have to register under the provisions of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords if a person complains to the registrar and the registrar declines to investigate would that person have the right of access to the parliamentary commissioner for administration <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have thought that the use of the word may in this provision is of crucial importance because the circuit judge as we now have in the clause does not have to allow a warrant to be issued if one of the data protection principles has been breached in a purely technical manner <e> <s> he will look at all the circumstances and if the registrar was foolish enough to bring a trivial case before a circuit judge it would be thrown out <e> <s> so i think there is sufficient safeguard against completely trivial cases being brought before the court <e> <s> while i entirely accept the reasoning of the noble lord lord mottistone behind the amendment i think the point has already been taken care of by the amendment we have made <e>", "<cs> my lords i enter into this argument with the greatest diffidence seeing the legal force behind the amendment <e> <s> but i just wonder whether one might take the point made by the noble lord lord swinfen a little further and look back to the purposes of the clause <e> <s> we are saying that an offence under this part of this act has been or is being committed or that any of the data protection principles have been or are being contravened by the person whose records are to be the subject of examination <e> <s> so that the crooked solicitor mentioned by the noble lord lord swinfen has been the subject of investigation by the registrar and as he said he has been through all the procedures attempting to get at records voluntarily which may be mixed up with legally privileged material <e> <s> i think that he made a very valid point there that it will not be possible to separate out those parts of the data which are legally privileged from those which are not <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord did not answer the question i put to him last week at column that is to say whether the local authorities concerned have the power to make a control order enabling them to assume responsibility for the management of these hostels if it should come to the point of the owners selling them off to private enterprise and thus rendering all the inhabitants homeless <e> <s> could they do that pending the making of a compulsory purchase order by the department of the environment and is that a matter which has been discussed between the boroughs and the right honourable gentleman sir george young from the department of the environment <e> <s> could the noble lord also say a little more about his statement that his right honourable friend would shortly be producing a statement on the future of the units that currently exist in great britain and grant-aided ones throughout the country and on what will happen overall to those <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think the noble lords amendment touches the point i raised the other day on which the minister has been good enough to write to me in the interval between committee and report <e> <s> the question is what is the rule applying to data which are transferred between a subsidiary and a parent company <e> <s> this is a matter which has obvious practical implications for data users who are part of large groups of companies <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord the minister may think it desirable at this stage to give a slightly fuller explanation along the lines of the one he has already given to me in correspondence <e>", "<cs> my lords how can the minister make that qualified assertion when he knows perfectly well that cases have been brought against this country in the european commission of human rights and that at least one of them is still under consideration there and has not yet been the subject of a ruling by the european commission <e>", "<cs> my lords it is very good of the minister to be so forthcoming and to allow me to speak on the amendment <e> <s> i thought however that i would save my remarks until the next amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister said nothing to lessen my alarm about the way in which data can be transferred under this provision <e> <s> for instance if i start at the end of his remarks he said that only per cent <e> <s> of the people on the illegal immigration intelligence unit were actually physically present in this country which means that at the moment you have got names there of people who are resident here most of whom as the noble lord has said are lawfully present <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought the noble lord said that per cent <e> <s> of the people on the immigration intelligence unit computer were resident in this country which means people <e>", "<cs> my lords i was rather hoping that the minister could tell us a little more about the nature of this consultative process <e> <s> although i entirely appreciate what he said about the sensitivity of the questions we are now dealing with it would be right that parliament should have some idea in mind of the nature of the likely regulations that are going to be made by the government while there is still an opportunity of discussing them in the proceedings on the bill rather than wait until the affirmative orders are made at some subsequent time <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall have to study that reply and come back to the noble lord the minister at a later stage <e> <s> at first sight i am not happy that the provisions of clause entirely meet the point because there the secretary of state is given power to <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord the minister is perfectly well aware that i was not envisaging that any future secretary of state would use this power to remove exemption from the systems that are covered by paragraphs <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister confirm that in evidence given by his department to the select committee in another place last week it was stated that the delay in processing applications for discretionary registration had been reduced from to months following the reforms recommended by sir derek rayner and that it was the governments intention to get the period down to months ultimately <e> <s> is not a delay of months susceptible of further reduction by concentrating on the police inquiries which i understand particularly in the metropolitan area are the greatest cause of the delay as well as contributing the largest share to the cost of the exercise <e>", "<cs> my lords if the government are so keen on excluding the british nuclear deterrent from the negotiations which are now going on in geneva would the noble lord say whether there are any circumstances in which the united kingdom might bring this force into the equation and agree to scrap it as part of a balanced force reduction on both sides <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that the policy of the tory government was to diminish the powers of officials to enter private premises of businesses or individuals <e> <s> yet here is the minister coming along and telling us that at the first sign of any trouble with a data user or data bureau the first thing that is to happen is that the registrar will threaten to exercise the powers that have been conferred on him to enter with a search warrant and turn the place upside down looking for documentary evidence of alleged contravention of any one of the data principles <e> <s> as the noble lord lord mishcon has just remarked it is not going to be an easy matter to go through the whole of the files of a <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister replies may i introduce one further minor consideration which seems to me important in the light of his remarks <e> <s> it is deliberately left at large that the data user and the registrar may consider their view as to whether personal data comes within the exemptions here <e> <s> if there is a conflict of opinion between the data user and the registrar as to whether a particular piece of personal data should be exempt from the subject access provisions under clause there is no power for the court to resolve that because it must be the data subject who makes the application which is refused <e> <s> that leads on to the process of an application to the court under the provision that the noble lord quoted earlier clause and in the event of a dispute between the data user and the registrar the registrar himself has no power to ask for a ruling of the court <e> <s> it is only the data subject who has that right of access to the court <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that assurance it is certainly an advance on anything that was said to my noble friend lord wigoder or myself at an earlier stage <e> <s> perhaps i can get one point across to the minister before we leave the subject <e> <s> what people are really concerned about is that these transfers to exempt systems will be taking place as time elapses and nobody will have any means of monitoring them unless there is some kind of provision as set out in the amendments we have drafted no doubt defectively <e> <s> what people will want to know not just the british medical association but i suggest the vast majority of patients and others whose records will be kept is whether when they go and give information to a hospital they can do so in the certain knowledge that the hospital secretary will not be disclosing it to exempt users for all sorts of other purposes <e> <s> they will only know that if some record is kept of the disclosures to exempt systems and the numbers of such disclosures that take place over a period of time <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down perhaps he could answer one question <e> <s> he said very reassuringly that the object in making government departments register as separate persons under the bill was to eliminate the possibility that data would be secretly transferred as he put it between one and another <e> <s> will he give the house a blanket undertaking therefore that no personal data will be transferred between one government department and another except as already provided by statute <e>", "<cs> my lords not immediate <e> <s> under clause the registrar when he issues a notice may require the data user to take <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the minister is so charming and affable that one occasionally loses sight of the fact that he is kept on a very short rein by the mandarins of queen annes gate not least while we have been passing through the stages of this bill <e> <s> if i may say so it is a pity that many noble lords imagined that the data protection bill required a knowledge of computing whereas what in fact we have been concerned with throughout most of the debates have been fundamental issues of civil liberty in which every single member of your lordships house ought to have taken an interest <e> <s> i believe that the noble lord has had an easy passage due to the false assumption made by some noble lords who are not at present in the chamber that they needed to know something about technology in order to take part in these proceedings <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that after this change in the gibraltar ordinance persons born in the territory of gibraltar will no longer necessarily have the right of entry into that territory that this applies also to bermuda but that whereas the gibraltarians have a right of registration as british citizens the people born in bermuda who do not have access to that territory may not be able to get british citizenship or indeed any other <e> <s> does the noble lord the minister not agree that it is necessary to have comprehensive advice available for the agencies who will have to tell people about these matters <e> <s> what information leaflets have the government made available to cabs and others who will have to deal with questions of bdtc status <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord the minister is aware of the particular case of st kitts nevis where there have been anxieties that on independence which will be conferred on the territories later this year there might be a change in the status of persons living in this country <e> <s> will the noble lord the minister give an assurance that those persons will not have their status changed and that they will be eligible for british citizenship in the same way as were those from belize <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the minister aware that such an undertaking has already been given by his right honourable friend the minister mr waddington <e> <s> i am only asking for this to be confirmed on the floor of this house so that others may read of it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the whole house will be grateful to the noble lord lord bethell for raising this important matter and for enabling us in particular to discuss the way in which the home office reached the decision in the case of mr papusoiu and in general the way in which it evaluates claims to refugee status by persons arriving at ports of entry or who may already be in the united kingdom in some other capacity <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord elystan-morgan said that if we were talking about animals there would be a different attitude to this question and i must say that i think it is disgraceful that there is nobody at all on the benches opposite except the minister and the whip <e> <s> apparently little interest is taken by the party opposite in the important questions which the noble lord lord harris has raised and therefore we can hardly expect ministers of a tory government to respond properly to the appeals that have been addressed to them by the noble lords lord harris and lord elystan-morgan <e>", "<cs> my lords there is the instance of the prisoner who when we went to the cells had been there since th november <e> <s> the period between th november and th december is not far short of five weeks <e>", "<cs> no not on this subject <e>", "<cs> my lords has there been any progress whatever since the helsinki agreements were concluded in the matters of human rights some of

after suffering persecution because of his beliefs such as the case of mr shcharansky which the prime minister herself took up recently <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the falklands islands company a wholly owned subsidiary of the coalite company which is registered in the united kingdom <e> <s> would it not be a good idea if the government at least asked the board of coalite whether it is their long-term intention to retain all the land they own in the islands or whether they are prepared to sell off part of it and if so how much so that at least this information would be available to potential purchasers <e>", "<cs> my lords we welcome the statement that has been repeated by the noble lord the minister and the governments belated conversion to the idea of lead-free petrol in particular <e> <s> may i ask the noble lord whether he does not think it would have been a good idea if this government and their predecessor had listened more carefully to the advice <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not have been helpful if the minister could have given the answer about the united kingdom immigrants advisory service councillor in this house when he was asked to do so a few days earlier than mr david waddington gave it in another place <e> <s> will he say whether it is not possible to notify the united kingdom ias refugee councillor immediately after the first interview rather than when a refusal is given bearing in mind that the home office frequently needs to conduct several interviews to ascertain whether a persons claim for asylum is valid and that these may take as much as a week or even longer in some complicated cases <e> <s> will the noble lord say what has happened to the second suggestion that has been made that is that a non-trivial applicant for asylum should have a right of appeal to an adjudicator even though he or she may not be within permitted leave to remain in this country <e>", "<cs> it does not my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure whether the minister is being deliberately obtuse but i did ask him whether the person would have the right of appeal to an adjudicator when he was not within his permitted leave to remain in this country <e> <s> by that i meant whether he would be allowed to exercise that right in the united kingdom and not from romania or from wherever he was deported <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord confirm that in addition to taking photographs of demonstrations of all kinds not just cnd the police sometimes make very detailed inquiries of the organisers and that their questions appear to go beyond what is necessary for the purposes of control of crowds <e> <s> will the noble lord give an undertaking that information obtained in this way or photographs taken of ordinary demonstrations for operational purposes will not be conveyed by the metropolitan police or on their behalf to agents of a foreign power <e>", "<cs> my lords i asked whether the noble lord will give an undertaking that photographs or information obtained about demonstrations by police inquiries will not be conveyed by or on behalf of the metropolitan police to agents of any foreign power <e>", "<cs> we on these benches thank the noble lord the minister and welcome his statement so far as it goes in endorsing the recommendations of the report of the alvey committee <e> <s> can he remind us exactly when it was that this report was received by the government and explain why they have taken so long to come forward with these proposals bearing in mind that if our reaction time is always as long as this we are

has a residual responsibility for looking after the accommodation of many of the people who would be thrown on to the streets if these properties were closed <e> <s> does the minister also agree that it is possible that the government may be asked to approve a compulsory purchase order on the properties and that if they were prepared to express their willingness to do this it might concentrate the minds of those on the other side who are negotiating <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister confirm that the initial interview with this person took place in april and not in june as he has just said <e> <s> is it not scandalous that it should take more than two years to process an application for asylum from whatever country the person may come bearing in mind that he has all the disadvantages of an unsettled status in that he cannot look for a job settle down or begin to make a new life in any other

these claims for asylum <e> <s> i ask this bearing in mind that in pakistan recently laws have been promulgated which increase the so-called islamic penalties which make the evidence of a woman equivalent to half that of a man and which have excited the wrath of the bar associations up and down the country leading to the detention of many distinguished lawyers and politicians <e> <s> are these factors taken into account in looking at the claims for asylum of people from that country <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister agree that there is no question of the people whose freedom was secured by the hijack to which he refers having been in any way concerned with the commission of that terrorist offence and that this is proved by the fact that the home office has granted asylum to other persons who were also liberated as a result of that hijack <e> <s> is it not because we like to keep in the good books of general zia that we are making life so difficult for these particular applicants <e> <s> is not the attitude of the united kingdom to violations of human rights generally across the world conditioned by the stance of the government concerned in the struggle between the super-powers <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble marquess agree in case there is any misapprehension in peoples minds that the soviet union might equally leave ethiopia as it left somalia that there

noble lord took pride in appearing before the all-party parliamentary penal affairs committee last year and <e>", "<cs> my lords could not the contractor if he submitted the lowest tender and it was rejected for whatever reason be it political or otherwise complain to the district auditor and could not then the councillors who rejected that lowest tender and preferred the higher one be surcharged

on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords if we decided to sign the council of europe convention to which the minister refers it would be some time after that before the thai authorities could make up their minds whether they wished to adhere to the treaty as they could do if they so wish <e> <s> in the meantime is the noble lord aware that the prime minister has expressed concern on behalf of the government about british citizens serving long sentences of imprisonment in thailand <e> <s> for example a person is serving years for simple possession of more than grams of a scheduled drug <e> <s> does not the minister think that if the thai authorities are prepared to enter discussions about bilateral exchanges as they have informally indicated they would be it would be worthwhile setting in motion such arrangements in parallel with the multilateral ones <e>", "<cs> my lords irrespective of what we decide on multilateral exchanges is the noble lord saying that we will not enter into bilateral arrangements with any other country whatsoever <e> <s> if there is an unwillingness on the part of the thai authorities to accede to the council of europe convention but inquiries establish that they would be prepared to enter into bilateral arrangements as they have done already with some nations belonging to the council of europe which may also sign the convention does the noble lord not think that this would be worth doing in parallel <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the minister confessed that he is a simpler man than the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor <e> <s> i do not know about that but he is certainly more likely to act under the direction of sir humphrey appleby a character who figured in our discussions on the previous second reading because he clearly is alive and well and working in the home office <e> <s> we frequently see his hand in the activities of the noble lord the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords is it entirely a question of money <e> <s> can the noble lord say whether any calculation has been made of the cost of uprating pensions to the full amount in countries such as canada and australia compared with the savings that would be made to the national health service by reason of it not having to treat these elderly people <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mishcon referred to discussions taking place at a cbi conference and advice of a certain nature being given to the participants <e> <s> the question is whether it would be possible to escape from the obligations that one would otherwise have under the bill as easily as is now being suggested <e> <s> i rather thought the minister was agreeing with that when he went so far as to say that even contingent intentions would be excluded from the bill because the example that he gave of the sales managers who would receive an increase in their salaries if a certain level of output was achieved does go rather further even than the phrasing in subsection <e>", "<cs> in that case i do not agree with the minister <e> <s> there is one category of collection which might cause great difficulty if the amendment were to be accepted and that is the case of a retail outlet which will ultimately be connected with the clearing banks <e> <s> a person may buy petrol or groceries <e> <s> through the terminal in the petrol station or the supermarket his account may be debited with the amount that he spent <e> <s> i am talking about what may well occur in the future as the technology advances <e> <s> as i see it the person who conducts that transaction would be a collector of data but he is not a data user within the meaning of the bill because he does not intend to process it <e> <s> the data goes down the line into the joint stock bank to which the customer belongs and there the amount of the purchase is debited to his account <e> <s> the processing takes place on the premises of the bank and not in the premises of the supermarket or the petrol station <e> <s> as i see it if the amendment of the noble lord lord mishcon were to be accepted those retailers who are simply acting as collectors but who are not doing any processing would be caught by the bill <e>", "<cs> i should like to raise a point of which i hope the noble lord the minister has had notice <e> <s> it is a point which i had originally sought to raise by means of amendment no <e> <s> which was not moved as it was thought more convenient if the matter could be dealt with on the question whether clause shall stand part and that is what i am now proposing to do <e>", "<cs> not the latter <e>", "<cs> i am sure that it is my fault that i had such difficulty in explaining myself to the noble lord the minister but he entirely missed the point that i was seeking to make if i may respectfully say so <e> <s> the pile of sheets of paper that he spoke about which were intended to be processed and which he said were covered by the bill because of that these sheets containing as we both agree information which is machine-readable using optical character recognition equipment owned by companies such as insurance firms are data <e> <s> they are personal data and they are held within the meaning of clause because the company intends to process them <e>", "<cs> i have listened to the noble lord lord mcintosh <e> <s> and i think that i can answer his question <e> <s> what he said was that he disagreed with the provision in paragraph in part ii of the schedule which states that <e>", "<cs> i think the noble lord said in his first speech that the information could not be regarded as having been obtained unfairly if it came only from published sources and if the purposes of the bbc or any other publishing organisation were served by the collection of information from newspapers and journals then the protection which would have been given to them by paragraph <e>", "<cs> i am absolutely mystified by that reply from the minister because he spent three-quarters of his speech saying why the committee was not necessary and in the final quarter he suddenly said by the way you can have a committee anyway <e> <s> the minister <e>", "<cs> the noble lord said that external advice was desirable and that was certainly a repetition of something that he had said on a previous occasion <e> <s> but then he said that the methods proposed by the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones or his noble friend opposite did not form the right way to go about it <e> <s> he said that a committee of this kind would be inflexible <e> <s> but a non-statutory committee would equally be inflexible <e> <s> we are talking about whether there should be in the bill itself some formal requirement for advice-giving machinery whether in the form as has been suggested in amendment or in some other way <e> <s> i think that the noble lord was less than fair in criticising the exact wording of the amendment on the grounds that it did not spell out everything in detail <e> <s> i should have thought that that was a merit of the amendment and that what we could have discussed this afternoon was the general principle of the matter <e> <s> it remains to be seen whether there is any general agreement since i suspect that perhaps the noble lord lord elton does not carry with him the whole of the party opposite in the remarks that he has just made <e> <s> i say that because as i know a great many of them have been influenced by the arguments not just in this chamber <e> <s> let us be clear about that <e> <s> we are not talking about solely what the opposition parties think regarding an advisory committee or even what the former members of the lindop committee think about the necessity of having such a provision written into the bill <e> <s> we are talking about the views of a very substantial body of expert opinion <e>", "<cs> i support the principle of this amendment but i wonder whether the probblem we face is not the drafting of subsection of the clause <e> <s> as i understand the minister the home office for example as a data user would define separately the purposes for which each of the data banks in the home office is intended <e> <s> in each case there would be a separate description of the personal data to be held on each of those data bases a separate description of the person or persons to whom it is intended to disclose <e>", "<cs> i shall not press this matter <e> <s> having heard what the minister has to say i shall want to return to the subject in greater detail at report stage when i hope that more of your lordships will be here to take part in the discussion <e> <s> i would only say at this point that the ministers supposed difficulties about absolute compliance with an amendment of the kind <e>", "<cs> the difficulty that i have with the ministers reply is that first he says that it is in the interests of the data users to lodge separate registrations in respect of each purpose for the reasons that he has given and that in any case even if they do not lodge separate registration applications these will be clearly identifiable as groups of particulars ranged under each of the purposes that the data user wishes to employ <e>", "<cs> we shall be coming back to this subject at a later stage but may i ask the noble lord to consider the analogy of the health and safety at <e>", "<cs> i think the example the minister has given illustrates the case very well <e> <s> in the case of the debtor there are four stages there is the reminder the angry reminder and the solicitors letter before you come to court <e> <s> here we have only the one step the registrar having failed to get a response has then to go to the circuit judge to get an entry warrant <e> <s> what we said on the previous occasion was that this was an enormous sledge-hammer to crack the nut and we wanted an intermediate procedure which would assist the registrar in discharging his duties <e> <s> the fact that he has not got a power such as that contained in this amendment seems to me a very serious defect <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord is certainly not a piccolo but a much more resounding instrument of the orchestra if not the whole orchestra in himself as we have heard in the last three amendments <e> <s> i am most grateful to him for the comprehensive and lucid way in which he has replied to this amendment <e> <s> i should like to consider more carefully over the next few days what he has said about the possibility of two simultaneous actions in respect of inaccuracy and defamation <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i was not even going so far as the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> i was not demanding that some other person should have the right periodically to scrutinise these records but i was simply asking that when the minister signed the certificate which is mentioned in clause he should at least notify the registrar that he proposes to do so and that the registrar who would have a suitably qualified person on his staff would give any advice within his power <e> <s> it was part of my submission that as the lindop committee recommended the registrar must have a person with the highest possible security classification as a member of his staff to perform these duties as indeed the minister reminded us is the case in other countries <e> <s> however i shall not press that <e>", "<cs> i certainly do not want to delay your lordships when there are so many more important amendments to consider later on <e> <s> perhaps i may ask the noble lord lord elton whether the certificates which he has explained are maintained within the department presumably in the secretary of states office will be accessible to any scrutiny whatever or whether they will only be wheeled out as i put it in a case where someone has sought to access the data and it is discovered that it is covered by a certificate under clause <e> <s> will it only be when somebody asks for forbidden data that the existence of the certificate is discovered or will there be a list which the registrar or the public may access in the department <e>", "<cs> i should like to give the matter some further thought and perhaps discuss this again on report <e> <s> in the meanwhile <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord for the information and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> to make one remark on the words of the noble lord lord swinfen it is not necessary for computers to be linked for information to be transferred from one to another <e> <s> it can be done by other means as the noble lord lord swinfen will be aware <e> <s> we are talking here about the subject access provisions <e> <s> we shall come on to the subject of transfer of data from one system to another when we discuss clause <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones has already said most eloquently everything that needs to be said about subject access <e> <s> i need add very little to the remarks that he made because i am sure the committee would like to reach a decision <e> <s> it is about the fourth time that we have discussed the matter and it is unlikely that at this late stage i could produce any new points that the minister has not yet considered <e>", "<cs> who said that <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord can tell us who said it because nobody in this committee has ever made such a claim <e>", "<cs> that is something quite different <e>", "<cs> if that is all the noble lord the minister has to say then i am extremely disappointed <e>", "<cs> that is certainly a relief because it will shorten the discussion on the next amendment when we come to consider the question of nondisclosure as it affects immigration records in particular <e> <s> but even so the noble lord has really not given any guidance to the data user he has simply repeated the phraseology we find in the bill that the data user must have reasonable grounds for believing that any of the purposes mentioned in subsection are prejudiced if he is to hand over the information <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will allow me the difference is that when the data is on a floppy disc instead of in manual records a wrong decision by a data user renders him liable to proceedings for contravening the provision in clause <e>", "<cs> of course i am perfectly happy to defer to the advice given by my noble friend so particularly since i do not feel we have reached a satisfactory conclusion on this <e>", "<cs> the noble lord the minister could have saved himself the trouble because i was about to say to my noble friend lord donaldson that i felt there was weight in his advice and particularly because i felt that we had not reached a conclusion on this argument and it would be desirable to return to it on report i was going to ask your lordships permission to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord the minister for his further assurance on that point <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am so sorry <e> <s> i do apologise <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> goes with amendment no <e> <s> and i withdraw it <e>", "<cs> the noble lord the minister is very skilled at producing far-fetched examples <e> <s> i think that in referring to customers buying rat poison he has excelled himself since one could hardly imagine that the police would be capable of dealing with such a vast amount of information <e> <s> but it is a useful illustration from one point of view in that the data user who had such a large number of customers would presumably print out that information from his computer or he would transfer to the police a disc or a tape which contained that information <e> <s> if he did that it would be very simple for him to provide a copy of it <e> <s> just as he had printed out the names he could print out two copies of the names <e> <s> i admit that it would involve him in a minor additional expense but i do not think that the administrative burdens that it would impose on the data user would be all that great <e>", "<cs> i assure the minister that i shall be at my desk throughout the whole of this summer <e> <s> i shall be delighted to hear from him and to enter into discussions about how the principle behind this amendment can most readily be achieved <e> <s> with that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord for his reply and for mentioning the rights of appeal which i ought to have dealt with in my opening remarks and which i think are very generally to be welcomed <e> <s> where a person is denied access to his medical or social works record obviously there ought to be some procedure for him to go to the registrar or indeed to a court of law <e> <s> that sounds like a very useful provision <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that that takes care only of newspapers it does not seem to take care of broadcasting <e> <s> obviously we shall have to look at the technicalities of it and see whether what the noble baroness has said about the interpretation of clause would apply to broadcasting and to tapes as it would apply to documents <e> <s> as i understand it the subsection to which she referred me in clause concerns only the preparation of texts and it would not apply for example to the use of tapes which are subsequently to <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that this is a point of fundamental importance but perhaps i can illustrate what i mean so that the noble baroness can understand it slightly better than i did on the first occasion <e> <s> if you have an article which has appeared in <e>", "<cs> i do not feel that it would be undesirable as the noble lord said but i shall not prolong the argument at this hour <e> <s> i intend to pursue the matter on report but now i ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> before we take leave of this amendment may i say how very much we appreciated the kind and generous words of the minister about the work of the opposition <e> <s> encouraged by these completely unmerited encomiums we shall quadruple our efforts at the report stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord the minister agree that lord jaunceys examination of fluoridation which extends to a -page report convinced him that this is the best tried public health measure in the history of the world and that although fluoridation of water is beneficial nevertheless the law does not permit the addition of fluoride to water <e> <s> bearing these facts in mind is it not essential that the position of local authorities be confirmed as a matter of urgency bearing in mind also that over the past years the government themselves have spent million on assisting local authorities to fluoridate water <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that following the cessation of fluoridisation in kilmarnock the dental caries rates reverted to those in the control town with which it has been paired and that it lost the benefits it would have had if fluoridisation had continued <e> <s> does the noble lord agree with the judgment of lord jauncey that no adverse effects on the health of individuals who drink fluoridated water have been measured <e> <s> in view of the fact that successive governments have been committed to this programme over the past years as the noble baroness said will they now hurry along this examination and introduce legislation in the next session <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems to me from a study of the discussions that took place as a result of lord mottistones amendment that he had a point <e> <s> i am delighted that the minister has accepted it as valid and taken action at this stage of the bill <e> <s> i should like to ask one question for the purpose of clarification <e> <s> if one has a system that is not primarily designed for word processing but is used in the normal course of a business for accounting and so on and one uses text processing software on it then that is the situation intended to be covered by this subsection as i see it <e> <s> the most common application likely to occur under the subsection is where the data user has the names and addresses of recipients of letters on file and he calls up those names and addresses for use in conjunction with pre-prepared text for the purpose of sending out an identical or similar letter to all the persons on the list <e> <s> if he uses the names and addresses for that purpose and for no other it seems to me that he would not be processing in relation to that data <e> <s> i should he grateful if the noble lord would confirm that my understanding is correct <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the minister obviously has been employing his time to very good effect during the recess <e> <s> we warmly welcome what he has done here in the recasting of the clauses and particularly clause which was necessary as a result of what had been put to him by the noble lord lord mishcon so briefly in committee <e> <s> i want to ask him just one question and that is in relation to clause where the data subject can ask for rectification and erasure and the noble lord has described what happens if the data user fails to record the fact that he has received notice from the data subject that data is inaccurate in respect of him although it has been received in that form from a third party or from himself <e>", "<cs> my lords i only want to say a few words in support of this amendment because i think the ground has been very adequately covered <e> <s> i think the criticisms the noble lord the minister advanced on the previous occasion have been very thoroughly and effectively dealt with by the noble lord who drafted this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords if the registrar wanted some advice which was not covered by the wording of <e>", "<cs> a flippant illustration <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to codes of practice i hope that in reply to this amendment the noble lord the minister will not do what he did last time and that is to ask a series of questions which he knew could not be answered because of the rules of report stage <e> <s> it was inconvenient to have the noble lord fire off a barrage of interrogatives as he did knowing that none of us who had already spoken was going to have the opportunity of replying although there was a perfectly good answer which was that the case that the minister was constructing was one against the advisory committees as a whole <e> <s> i hope that he will not construct a case against codes of practice as a whole by asking a similar series of questions on this amendment because in other fields codes of practice have been extremely useful <e> <s> i mention as one example the health and safety at work act with which the noble lord is no doubt familiar <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mishcon is saying that it does in fact happen <e> <s> i think the codes of practice would not be irrevocable they could be changed as a result of experience and as a result of cases that were brought before the courts <e> <s> but they would certainly be of enormous assistance to data users in enabling them to comply in detail with the data protection principles <e> <s> if that is what the government think then let us give the status they would have by putting into the bill that the registrar shall be responsible as set out here for making and publishing those advisory codes of practice instead of leaving it as it would be if the white paper were followed to the letter that the trade associations professional bodies and so on produced codes of practice <e>", "<cs> my lords i only want to say this because i think my noble friend may not have an opportunity to cover all the ground <e> <s> the adoption problem which the noble lord mentioned is really not relevant to the amendment under consideration because that is covered speaking from memory by clause <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend has reminded us we had a discussion on some of these difficult problems when we covered the order-making powers in clause at the previous stage <e> <s> the minister then said that those provisions had been included to allow full consultation to be undertaken before with a view to deciding what restrictions on the right of subject access there should be if any in relation to medical and social records <e> <s> one can appreciate that when the bill first saw the light of day it would have been impossible to define the limits on subject access <e> <s> therefore as originally drafted it was necessary to give the secretary of state an unfettered discretion to restrict that right where personal data were held for carrying out social work in relation to the data subject if the secretary of state considered that otherwise the carrying out of that work was likely to be prejudiced <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to welcome the ministers concession on this clause <e> <s> i should not have felt it necessary to say more had it not been for the provocative tone of the minister in moving this pair of amendments <e> <s> the minister has really invited us to say something about the manner in which the debate was conducted by the phraseology that he used and particularly the term fog of misunderstanding which the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones has already quoted <e> <s> i do not know whether the minister was intending that the epithet should be <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems to me that the advent of computers is forcing us to consider a subject which has been dealt with in an entirely <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friends and myself i also would like to say a warm thank you to the noble lord the minister for the care he has always given to the points we have raised during the long proceedings on this bill both during its previous incarnation and on its latest appearance in this house <e> <s> we thank him for the immense care that he gave during the summer recess to some very important questions of principle which had divided us during the proceedings in committee before we dispersed <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister quite accurate in saying that people have choice in sacking the contractors and moving to other contractors if they are dissatisfied with the service they get <e> <s> no such choice exists where the service is in the public domain <e> <s> if the service is carried out by the local authority they have the ultimate right to terminate the use of in-house workers and go to contractors <e> <s> while that possibility exists is it not a strong incentive that the refuse collection departments of local authorities should provide the best possible service to the ratepayers <e>", "<cs> my lords of the people who voted in synod for this motion can the minister say how many were women <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say how many people have actually left the falklands islands permanently during the period when the britons arrived there and how many people who are ordinarily resident in the falkland islands that leaves as at todays date <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords has not the foreign secretary said in correspondence with a number of people that there was a substantial build-up of indonesian troops in east timor <e> <s> has the noble lord studied reports that the number of such troops may amount to between and and that helicopters and planes are being deployed in the attack on the people of east timor which does the noble lord agree <e> <s> was clearly premeditated <e> <s> will he bear in mind the fact that the international committee of the red cross was prevented from operating in the territory from july onwards just before the attack took place <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the total number of people who have perished in east timor since the occupation by indonesia in is estimated by competent authorities at between and <e> <s> bearing in mind this enormous carnage committed by an aggressor nation on this tiny territory does not the noble lord think that reasons of economic self-interest pale into insignificance <e> <s> will he reflect on the remarks that he has just made to the house when next the question of american arms sales to argentina occurs because surely there is a parallel there <e> <s> in both cases aggression was committed on a small and defenceless people but in one case the government are saying that the americans should not supply arms to the aggressor but are busily supplying arms to the aggressor in the other situation <e>", "<cs> my lords when the facts are reported to the benefit authorities both in the case of refusal to take up a place on a scheme and premature termination as the noble baroness says that they sometimes are is a copy of the notice that is sent to the benefit authorities served on the claimant so that he or she knows what case is made against him or her and can therefore properly present a case before the tribunal <e>", "<cs> my lords do not the answers that the minister gave earlier refute the absurd statement by the noble lord lord beloff that the duty of governors is to govern and that the duty of students is to study bearing in mind the importance the minister attaches to the governors studying their own responsibilities <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the ministers forthcoming reply to the question <e> <s> may i ask whether she does not recognise that it may be difficult for the incoming government of argentina to take the first step in normalising diplomatic relations with the united kingdom <e> <s> will the government perhaps consider making a joint approach with argentina to the secretary general of the united nations that he should use his good offices in devising a solution that is acceptable to the people of the falklands and takes account of the legalities on the question of sovereignty <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully recognise that the opinions of the people of the falkland islands should be of enormous importance in determining the political future of those territories <e> <s> may i ask whether the government agree that tests conducted by the british government will not be seen as impartial among world opinion and that this is an additional argument for doing as we suggested that is inviting the secretary general to use his good offices to arrive at a solution including consultations with the inhabitants of the falklands themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords in his original reply the noble and learned lord said that per cent <e> <s> of the expenditure on magistrates courts comes from central government funds which means that the remaining per cent <e> <s> is financed by the local authorities <e> <s> in fact he did not answer the noble baronesss question as to what effect the restrictions on local government spending had had on that per cent <e> <s> i wonder whether he would address his mind to that question <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that we are most grateful for the help that she has given to mr keith carmichael and particularly for the representations that have been made at the highest possible level that he should be allowed to come back to britain for medical treatment <e> <s> has she studied the report by the consultant traumatologist who said that mr keith carmichael was suffering from a compression fracture of the spine which caused him excrutiating pain <e> <s> if it is not possible to arrange for mr carmichaels repatriation immediately could he not at least continue to be treated by the consultant in whom he has some confidence and could he not be allowed the physiotherapy on a daily basis which the consultant has said is necessary if mr carmichael is not to suffer permanent incapacity in his future life <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that there is a feeling that american citizens in saudi gaols requiring medical attention have received somewhat better treatment than our own prisoners and that one such person was recently transferred to the king faisal specialist hospital for treatment <e> <s> could we not make additional representations that mr carmichael be treated in that hospital where proper orthopaedic facilities are available <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the rights enjoyed by british citizens overseas does the noble baroness recall in relation to the final part of the <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the answer which the noble baroness gave to my noble friend lord banks since when did the government take unto itself the power to dictate what should or should not be discussed in your lordships house <e> <s> would not the noble baroness reconsider her refusal to give my noble friend figures of the maximum loss that could be sustained by a tenant <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount lord buckmaster has given us the opportunity to talk about a substantial cross-section of the british population bearing in mind that strictly speaking one could even include the adherents of the established church as being in a minority now as well as the other denominations he mentioned such as the methodists the jews and of course the catholics <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister give an assurance that when funds are received from the eec in respect of education as for example <e> <s> in the case of migrant workers an equivalent sum is not deducted from the amounts available through the department of education and science for example by a reduction of the money that they would have received under section of the local government act <e>", "<cs> my lords what representations were made by the government to the broadcasting authorities to allow mr heseltine to expound nuclear policy on all the channels of radio and television <e> <s> is the noble earl aware that no producer would have invited mr heseltine to express those opinions if the decision had been based on public interest alone <e> <s> is the noble earl further aware that if such pressure is brought to hear on the broadcasting authorities then in the end we are no better than the soviet union <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord the minister confirm as he told me in a recent answer to a letter about the floor area of cells in dispersal prisons that the floor area has in fact been reduced in prisons constructed most recently and that there was no reason for this in terms of the standards which prisoners should enjoy <e> <s> will the minister also say what he considers should be the minimum temperature which is experienced by prisoners in the dispersal system and why he recently suggested to me in a letter that if prisoners did not like the cold in the strip cells at parkhurst they should put on more clothes <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords if it would involve disproportionate expense to publish a list of the records does that mean to say that there is a vast number of them held in the foreign and commonwealth office <e> <s> is the noble baroness aware that when i spoke to the records administration office of the pro yesterday i was told that a number of documents were still being retained but a decision was expected to be made shortly on their continued retention by the foreign office depending on the political situation <e> <s> will the noble baroness say what changes in our relationship with argentina have to be accomplished before these documents will be returned to their rightful place <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister not agree that with as few as records withdrawn from the public record office it would not be a very significant job with the aid of computers to keep an up-to-date list which would be available for inspection by any member of the public who is unfortunate enough to trundle all the way out to kew only to find that the documents are missing <e> <s> is this not an occasion which the government are using for reclassifying documents that have already been released to the public in some cases many years ago <e> <s> since documents such as document / have been withdrawn in this manner by the foreign office does that not indicate that our case is not as strong as we should like the world to believe <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord give any indication of the set off against the public expenditure of million which has to be incurred in respect of road accidents admissions to hospital of people suffering from alcoholic psychoses and cirrhosis of the liver death from accidents in the home industrial accidents and other adverse consequences not forgetting that per cent <e> <s> of the total number of murders are committed through the influence of alcohol <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord be good enough to address his mind to the question put to him by my noble friend which was not about the private sector but was about the percentage of goods purchased from british sources by government departments and other agencies for which the government are responsible <e> <s> can the government say what that percentage is <e>", "<cs> my lords i was unfortunately not able to be here when your lordships were discussing the parole system in general the other day or i would have had a few things to say about the home secretarys rule by decree in altering the parole system without the authority of parliament <e> <s> i echo the remarks of my noble friend lord donaldson of kingsbridge and unreservedly welcome the order which was advocated at some length as the minister points out when we were talking about the criminal justice act <e> <s> we are only pleased that after this lapse of time which may be longer than some of us would have hoped the minister has been able to bring forward an order which as he says makes a substantial difference to the prison population and will help to relieve pressures on it <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friends i too should like warmly to congratulate the government on introducing this bill and on doing it so promptly to give effect to our signature to the council of europe convention on the transfer of sentenced persons which as the noble lord told the house was opened for signature in march <e> <s> there has been no time lost in coming forward with the legislation we are now considering <e> <s> it is a fairly rare event that i am able to express wholehearted appreciation of something done by the home office and it gives me genuine pleasure to be able to do so twice on a single day as i have been able this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister say what proportion of the young people coming forward for training at these information technology centres are from the ethnic minorities and whether the government will take advantage of the provisions in the race relations act which provide for special training to be given to the ethnic minorities when they are under-represented in that profession <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of the statistics given this afternoon which were predictable does the noble lord not think that a heavy responsibility rests on those noble lords who secured the defeat by two votes of a bill which would have accomplished the compulsory wearing of seat belts six years ago <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble lord seen the text of the new advice given by the health education council which is that to be absolutely safe a woman must not drink alcohol while she is pregnant or while she is contemplating pregnancy <e> <s> has the noble lord seen the evidence that was presented to a recent conference held at the british medical association where evidence was presented by in particular some general practitioners from glasgow showing that indeed small quantities of alcohol drunk during pregnancy had an effect on the birth weight of infants <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not agree that pregnant ladies are unlikely to see the advice in a publication placed in the library of your lordships house <e> <s> therefore will not the government take steps to make sure that the health education councils excellent booklet is as widely disseminated as possible and that in particular the paragraph referring to drinking during pregnancy is prominently displayed in the surgeries of general practitioners <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord confirm that the health and safety at work act does not apply to young persons undergoing training in youth custody establishments after sentence by a court and are the government satisfied that proper arrangements are made for the safety and protection from injury of the young people in those establishments <e>", "<cs> i am so sorry my lords <e> <s> i was talking about young persons sentenced by the courts to periods in youth custody centres where they may receive training as part of the rehabilitation process <e> <s> clearly they are not employees and the health and safety at work act does not apply to them <e> <s> i was asking the noble lord what provisions the government have made and whether they are satisfied with the protection of those young persons in youth custody establishments <e>", "<cs> my lords in respect of doorstep selling i wonder whether the noble lord the minister has noticed recent experiments by companies such as unigate in the doorstep selling of alcoholic drink <e> <s> in view of the damage that has been done by alcohol in this country to which attention has recently been drawn by mr mccartney does not the minister consider that the eec should discourage the pernicious extension of outlets which is represented by such a practice <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl be careful therefore if and when the scheme reaches target entry not to describe it as a success <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister knows perfectly well that parole is being automatically denied to the classes of person referred to by the home secretary in his speech to the tory party conference <e> <s> is the minister aware of the remarks made by the prison chaplain in parkhurst which were quoted in yesterdays <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the noble lord agree that the prison officers association made representations to the secretary of state on the lines that i have mentioned and that they feel a continuing anxiety about the possibility that serious disturbances may result from the psychological pressures on these prisoners whose expectations have now been dashed <e> <s> does he not think also that when the courts originally sentenced those persons they did so in the expectation that parole would be considered on its own merits by the statutory authorities constituted for the purpose and that the secretary of state by usurping those powers has created a dangerous situation <e>", "<cs> my lords how can the noble lord say that local authorities are capable of making decisions for themselves when they are lining the pockets of developers but not when they are trying to do good for the people who elected them <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say whether there is any monitoring of the take-up of these schemes at the technology centres as far as the ethnic minorities are concerned <e> <s> if not how will the government measure the degree of help which is being given to young people from the ethnic minorities by the technology schemes <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the minister aware that it is not just a question of newly-qualified staff not being able to find work <e> <s> difficulties are also arising in the case of married women who leave the profession temporarily to have a family and who then wish to return on a part-time basis <e> <s> will the minister look into the availability of work opportunities for those people whose skills would otherwise be wasted <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords has the minister read the report of the policy studies institute and particularly those sections of it in volume which deal with the consumption of alcohol by the police and particularly by the cid <e> <s> would he accept that since the research on which the psi report was based was undertaken after the regulations to which he has referred were promulgated they clearly are not working since there are many horrendous anecdotes in that report of excessive consumption of alcohol by police officers during working hours <e> <s> does he not think that some special instructions are warranted by the secretary of state in view of the revelations in this report <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister accept that while there may be many other professions apart from the police where alcohol is a particular hazard because of the stresses that their activities involve outside their working lives in the case of the police we are according to the policy studies institute dealing with a serious incidence of the consumption of alcohol during working hours <e> <s> that was made plain by the policy studies institute by saying that in the case of the cid it is an integral part of their working lives <e> <s> does not the noble lord accept that this is not a matter for research but a matter for firm instructions from the commissioner and from senior officers that drinking while on duty will not be tolerated in the cid any more that it is in the uniformed branch <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not agree that the problem of homelessness does not affect one particular borough westminster camden hammersmith or fulham and that therefore whatever arrangements replace the present ones there will have to be an authority that covers the whole of greater london <e> <s> does he agree that the choice therefore is between an authority which is elected such as the present glc or an authority which is not elected such as is the implication of the governments proposals <e> <s> does the noble lord not think that the people of greater london as a whole should have some say in the provision of these important services for the homeless <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness agree with the statement of john stuart mill that all silencing of discussion is an assumption of infallibility which the government are taking to themselves in this case in that they will not allow the ventilation of arguments with which they disagree but that in doing so they arouse the hostility of the people of britain who think that if they are being prevented from listening to an argument then the governments case must be a bad one <e> <s> and is it not the best way of convincing the outside world that our assertion of sovereignty is false that we are not prepared to allow free discussion on all the issues involved <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that she has treated the house this afternoon with insolent disdain <e>", "<cs> which is wholly uncharacteristic of her and which is also quite unacceptable <e> <s> will the minister say whether she is talking about a small number of items as the noble lord lord belstead said in the question to which i referred or whether it is a thousand items as she has said this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the united kingdom the only country in the eec to vote against giving aid to nicaragua <e> <s> is this not quite incompatible with the broadcast of her majesty the queen and would the government change their policy on aid to nicaragua so as to fall into line with our european partners on this matter <e>", "<cs> i think the trouble is that probably any word we chose would have had some other meaning in statute <e> <s> with respect to the noble lord however that does not necessarily rule it out for all times because there are cases where the same term has different meanings in different acts <e> <s> one that i always think of is ordinary resident which has a completely different meaning for the purposes of the income tax acts than for the purpose of the immigration acts as the noble lord will be aware because it crops up many times in the home office <e> <s> the fact that the term transferee has a meaning in the law of property does not <e>", "<cs> i want to support what the noble lord lord mishcon has said because i think that there are cases the noble lord the minister will be aware of some of them where foreign citizens in our psychiatric institutions will find it extremely difficult to act in an informed way over the choice that they have to make when this bill becomes law <e> <s> certainly they will not be able to understand the provisions of the convention on the transfer of sentenced persons and it will be necessary as is indeed envisaged for somebody to exercise the power of choice on their behalf <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord will have heard the minister say that cases may well arise in which there is the commission of further offences by the individual in between the time the secretary of state first agrees and the time the transfer is due to be exercised in which case obviously the person will have to go through the process of trial and so on <e> <s> if that is the only case that the noble lord wants to advance in which the secretary of state would wish to use his discretion i wonder whether that matter could be written into the bill <e> <s> perhaps the wording might be <e>", "<cs> obviously i shall consider very carefully what the minister has said but i think that the kernel of my remarks still remains that although i gave particular illustrations with which the noble lord has dealt there may be others which could be produced <e> <s> the whole nature of the amendment presupposes that the circumstances will be very unusual that we cannot envisage them at this stage otherwise we would be able to write them into the bill and that the minister is not bound to use this discretion he does so only if in all the circumstances in spite of the fact that the person does not have the close ties or connections with the united kingdom which the minister briefly described at the end of his remarks it would be appropriate to admit him <e>", "<cs> i certainly do not want to introduce all these people that the noble lord described who are suffering under oppressive regimes overseas <e> <s> it might be nice to be able to bring them all back here but that was not the intention of the amendment as the noble lord understands now <e> <s> there certainly are going to be borderline cases <e> <s> without wishing to tempt providence by saying that the home office has been generous in its treatment of certain individuals i should like to draw the noble lords attention to the fact that certain commonwealth citizens who had been admitted here as dependants but who had never acquired british nationality because they were not registered by their parents and who have been sentenced to terms of imprisonment overseas which have resulted in their absence from the united kingdom for a period of over two years and who have thus not qualified to come here as returning residents under the immigration law as it stands have nevertheless been readmitted by the secretary of state in the exercise of his discretion <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord the minister for his offer to write to me <e> <s> we could save quite a lot of trouble if we do not have to take up individual cases of prisoners who serve sentences of more than two years overseas and are therefore dependent upon the discretion of the secretary of state to agree to their return to the united kingdom even though they were given indefinite leave to remain for instance as dependent children prior to the commission of that offence in some foreign country <e>", "<cs> may i <e>", "<cs> i only wanted to ask the noble lord a very brief question about the outward-going prisoners <e> <s> when he spoke about terrorists i wondered whether and it seemed to me possible from the way he expressed himself the minister was envisaging that the secretary of state would refuse his consent to a transfer in the case of whole classes of persons convicted of certain types of offence <e> <s> i do not know whether or not i was right in that <e> <s> but obviously in the case of a security risk you could not send a prisoner back to the country from which he was sent as a spy to the united kingdom <e> <s> i can understand that <e> <s> it would be a very good reason for not repatriating him <e> <s> but in the case of the terrorist i do not see that any such general rule applies and it would be unfortunate if we decided that anybody convicted of an offence which would prove rather difficult to define if the minister were to make a general rule was to be excluded from the benefit of the bill <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord for that clarification <e> <s> i shall assume that everybody else will interpret the bill as he does and that there is no doubt as there was in the minds of those who advised us about the matter being entirely clear <e> <s> however i am very happy to accept the assurances which the noble lord has given to the committee i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mishcon has referred to the problem of remission <e> <s> this is extremely important because prisoners will want to know exactly where they stand before deciding whether to take advantage of the transfer arrangements <e> <s> as i understand it the period which a prisoner has served in a country overseas if it is a party to the convention will be governed by the remission arrangements in that country <e> <s> in other words to take lord mishcons question about the person who was sentenced to years imprisonment and has served four years imprisonment in an overseas country then he will not necessarily attract the additional one third towards the sentence which would be appropriate in the case of a sentence being served in the united kingdom <e> <s> as i <e>", "<cs> in answer to an earlier intervention of mine the minister said that there was nothing in the bill about the treatment of special categories of prisoner and that during the course of our proceedings he had said nothing about the singling out of special categories <e> <s> but what he has now said in response to the noble lord lord mishcon makes me feel a little anxious because in regard to terrorists he said that we must guard against those individuals being treated as though they were heroes when they were welcomed back to their countries of origin <e> <s> that is of course an argument which applies to terrorists in general and means that one does not examine a particular prisoner <e> <s> one says to oneself that if anyone who has committed an offence that falls into this class is sent back home it is possible that when he lands in dublin or dun laoghaire there will be a large reception committee to cheer him on as he goes to the irish prison and that therefore this would render it undesirable that anybody who is an irish citizen and <e>", "<cs> i am of course delighted to do so and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> once again i am extraordinarily grateful to the minister and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am still none the wiser on the powers of the minister <e> <s> it says that the minister may make such arrangements <e> <s> it does not say how he is going to compel the prisoner or these hypothetical uncles or aunts to make the payments if they are not prepared to do so <e> <s> the minister has already said that he is not going to hold up the issue of the warrant so that there is no bargaining power there if he goes to the prisoner and says you have these resources in the united kingdom so you are well able to pay the cost <e> <s> in those circumstances everybody would agree that it is only reasonable that the prisoner should pay if he has these assets in the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> i thought that there must be something that i had spotted although it was not immediately apparent on the face of clause that in the last resort the minister would have the power to recover these charges <e> <s> but i now see it is only a request which is going to be made to the prisoner and/or to the persons acting on his behalf which the minister has clarified could be his relatives <e> <s> we have probably gone as far as we can in this discussion this evening <e> <s> in the meanwhile i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> we are not only talking about the cases surely where an applicant has successfully requested the secretary of state to transfer him either to or from this country <e> <s> we are talking about the total universe of applications made by individuals who are otherwise suitably qualified under the terms of the treaty <e> <s> in other words they have more than six months left to serve they have exhausted their rights of appeal and so on <e>", "<cs> yes that is an overall figure which the noble lord gives me of the number of persons who are citizens of commonwealth and foreign countries respectively in our prisons as at that date th april each year <e> <s> i think the minister said that there were about british prisoners in overseas prisons at any one time <e> <s> it is unbelievable that we could be thinking in terms of only two or three cases from that universe of applicants who are suitably qualified <e> <s> i should have thought that the report would be a slightly more weighty document than the noble lord originally had in mind <e>", "<cs> but it is <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that this is not the right place for me to be pressing the point on the minister but he correctly divined the purpose of the amendment that whereas something is not an offence in the united kingdom it should not appear on the criminal record of the person being repatriated <e> <s> it may well be that what is needed here is an amendment to the rehabilitation of offenders act <e> <s> which could be dealt with in other legislation <e> <s> i will obviously need to study the rather complicated remarks of the minister and to think about how this can best be tackled before we come back to it on report stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> in thanking the minister for that reply may i also take the opportunity of echoing what was said by the noble lord lord mishcon and paying my respects to the national council for the welfare of prisoners abroad not only for the advice they have given us on this bill but also for the invaluable work they have done over the years in trying to help prisoners abroad in promoting the cause of prisoner transfer treaties and in looking after the interests of individuals who may have nobody else to assist them and who are serving very long sentences in harsh conditions in overseas countries <e> <s> on a vestigial budget they do a fantastic job and their work in advising your lordships on this bill has been an extremely good example of the effectiveness of a small pressure group <e> <s> i am most grateful to the noble lord for his remarks on this amendment and for the courteous and helpful way in which he has received the points we have made during the course of the committee stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords while commending the efforts of the government in relieving the load on small businesses does not the arithmetic of the noble lords answer indicate that forms may still be sent to these people <e> <s> do they not have an enormous amount of work to do in trying to comply with the demands of the government even after the efforts of the year for which he has given figures <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the slaughter of dogs and monkeys in order to study the effects of bullet wounds is repugnant to the vast majority of people in this country and that the attempts to cover up what is happening in ministry of defence establishments are viewed with contempt <e> <s> is there much point in having the home office inspectorate when these things are allowed to occur <e>", "<cs> my lords is it true that one of the options being looked at in the case of greater london is the replacement of the glc by another elected authority which will take over the remaining functions not to be transferred to the boroughs <e>", "<cs> my lords do not the courts have power to distrain on the assets of people who fail to pay fines <e> <s> if they do not have any assets what is the point of sending them to prison anyway <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord answer the first part of my question as to whether courts do have the power to distrain on the assets of those who fail to pay fines and why have they not used that power in the case of the people who went to prison <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> but my lords is the minister aware that every day on the border of nicaragua there are armed incursions from the neighbouring countries which are financed trained and armed by the cia <e> <s> is the minister further aware that the terrorists are attacking from the air as well by helicopter and plane and that recently they have been laying mines in nicaraguan ports and that this is part of a sustained attempt to undermine the legitimate government of nicaragua in which nato ammunition is being used <e> <s> is the noble baroness aware that when nicaraguan armed forces were in action against these terrorists they found that ammunition was being used carrying the symbol which the noble baroness mentioned <e> <s> does she not think that since nato is meant to defend the west the free world it is highly improper and wrong for such ammunition to be used to undermine a friendly government <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the fact that the ammunition conforms to nato standards indicate that it will have been manufactured in a nato country <e> <s> if not could the noble baroness say in what other countries apart from those which belong to nato such ammunition is manufactured <e> <s> if it is manufactured in a nato country does she not think that an inquiry into the manner in which it reached the hands of these terrorists is justified <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord confirm that some impressive results have been achieved in scotland by measures to reduce the consumption of alcohol at and around football grounds and does not that experience provide a lesson for the authorities in england and wales <e>", "<cs> my lords when we first made the agreement with the soviet union on the detention of mr hess was there no provision in that agreement for varying or revoking it <e> <s> if not what would be the consequences if the united kingdom and the other western powers unilaterally denounced the agreement and liberated mr hess by themselves without the consent of the soviet union <e>", "<cs> my lords is it the governments understanding that the weapons being used by iraq in the conflict with iran were manufactured by the iraqis themselves <e> <s> if this is so does it not indicate that measures to control should not be limited to the super-powers but that the important question to which the international community must address itself is how to restrict the technology of manufacturing these weapons and the transfer of that technology from the advanced countries to nations such as iraq <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am very grateful to the minister for the care with which he has considered the points that were raised at committee stage not just on his amendment but on all the cases where he agreed to look at what was suggested by your lordships in committee <e> <s> we are most impressed with the work that he has been doing and are grateful to him for the attention that he has paid to the points that we raised <e> <s> on this one i am very happy about the way that it is expressed except that i think following what the noble lord lord mishcon has said it might have been a good idea if there had been some link between this bill and the mental health act <e>", "<cs> my lords we are talking about people who have close ties with the united kingdom and not about just any old foreigner who wishes to come back and serve the rest of his or her sentence in the united kingdom <e> <s> as the noble lord lord elton is no doubt aware some cases have already been submitted to his colleague mr david waddington of people who did remain overseas for more than two years because they were serving sentences of imprisonment there <e> <s> the minister was good enough to exercise his discretion in their favour and to readmit them notwithstanding the fact that they did not qualify as returning residents under paragraph of the rules as the minister has said <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously i am not entirely happy with the ministers reply <e> <s> it is a matter that ought to be pursued in another place and therefore at this stage i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord the minister for the careful way in which he considered amendments nos <e> <s> and which we moved at the committee stage and for the way in which he has embodied them in his amendment <e> <s> that part of it is extremely satisfactory to me if i may say so and i hope to my noble friends as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether the noble lord is living in the victorian era or whether he remembers the remark of one of his right honourable friends predecessors sir william harcourt who said after being told of the way that prisoners were putting on weight <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may help the noble lord <e> <s> as the noble lord lord elton referred us to the convention i have been looking it up and article says that <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be appropriate if i said one or two things about amendments nos <e> <s> and at this stage <e> <s> i must first thank the noble lord for his efforts to meet us half way on these points even if i am left a little confused about how to reconcile some of the things that the noble lord has said and the amendment we now have on the marshalled list <e>", "<cs> my lords before we leave this bill may i say what a pleasure it has been to work on a <e>", "<cs> my lords if the proposed stolport in the surrey docks area comes into operation will the movements between that stolport and heathrow count towards the total of movements <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say how there can be any sensible planning in the national health service as regards the intake of people into the training schools when the government have no information about the numbers who are at present out of work <e> <s> it is unsatisfactory for the minister to say as he did in answer to an earlier question that unemployment among female nurses does not matter simply because they refuse to move into the areas where the work is available <e> <s> that is a highly sexist comment <e>", "<cs> my lords there are two questions which need to be considered <e> <s> the first concerns whether or not the decision not to allow a prisoner to come home should be communicated in writing <e> <s> the noble lord the minister has indicated in the letter to which the noble lord lord mishcon referred why there may be some difficulty here that the matter is not entirely in the hands of the government and that such a decision would have to be conveyed to the prisoner in a foreign gaol by the authorities which have control over the arrangements there <e> <s> this is something which the minister or his colleagues at the home office could not deal with <e> <s> but as i have pointed out on a previous occasion the convention is absolutely clear <e> <s> it does say that the sentenced person shall be informed in writing of any decision taken by either state on the question of his transfer <e> <s> therefore there is in the convention an obligation on the government to try to convey such information to the prisoner even if they are dependent upon the good offices of another state for the final delivery of that communication <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say something that is almost equally important to this argument <e> <s> if the circumstances in which a request for repatriation is refused are rare the very fact that the prisoner is refused will indicate to him that he is under suspicion <e> <s> if he is part of some foreign international spy network and his application to the secretary of state is refused he is tipped off and so are those hypothetical friends with whom he is in league <e>", "<cs> my lords are there sound practical reasons for doing it this way round rather than the other way that is to say accepting the amendment of the noble lord lord mishcon and if the doubts that the government have prove to be well founded then to put down an amendment which will be necessary in any case in another place to give effect to the principle to redraft what has been done by your lordships this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords may i echo what has been said by my noble friend lord mishcon and my noble friend lord donaldson and in particular to say how extraordinarily grateful we are to the minister for the care and attention that he has given to the amendments which have been moved by your lordships on all sides <e> <s> it really has been an example of inter-party co-operation and of the efforts of your lordships to put on to the statute book a bill which probably has the approval of per cent <e> <s> of the people of this country <e> <s> it is a model of the sort of legislation that parliament ought to be enacting <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble baroness has had an opportunity to look at the numerous pages of advertisements for jobs in journals such as <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness said that there were several thousand refugees in belize from el salvador <e> <s> she did not give the figures from guatemala <e> <s> i wonder whether she could say what information the government have been given by the authorities in belize about the numbers crossing the borders from guatemala what deductions they draw from those figures about the deterioration in the human rights situation in guatemala and whether that confirms the report recently made by the american watch committee of a serious downgrading of the human rights situation in that country <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble baroness lady young has not got the figures for refugees in belize from guatemala now i wonder might she give those figures to us on another occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords in comparing private tenders with in-house costs will authorities be asked to bear in mind that many of the overheads associated with the in-house conduct of these services will still have to be borne by the regional health authorities even though those services are contracted out <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl recall the recommendation of the royal commission on environmental pollution that there should be no commitment to a large programme of nuclear fission power until it has been demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt that a method exists to ensure the safe containment of long-lived highly radioactive waste for the indefinite future <e> <s> since we still have not solved this problem will the noble earl make certain that no firm commitment is given to fast breeder reactors or to any other major programme on a european scale until this problem has been solved <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister remind the house whether aid is being provided either directly or through the eec to the drought stricken areas of eritrea which are occcupied by the eritrean peoples liberation front and whether consideration will now be given to enlarging the amount of any such aid in the light of the recent defeats of the ethiopian armed forces by the eplf and its consequent assumption of responsibility for a larger area which is stricken by drought <e>", "<cs> my lords has the minister any information about the times of day when these attacks occur <e> <s> if there is a correlation between pub closing times and peaks in the numbers of assaults is it not a reasonable inference that alcohol is a mediating factor in these offences <e> <s> if that is so will the government look carefully at any proposals for extending licensing hours in england and wales to correspond with those in scotland such as have been put forward by an honourable member in another place <e> <s> in particular will the government ensure that the trade unions representing transport workers are consulted before they reach a final decision on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord realise that the peers data base from which the figures that he gave the house were no doubt derived is kept on the glc computer <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister realise that whatever may be the governments excuses for extending this invitation to mr botha a great many people in this country both black and white feel that their own freedom is undermined by his visit and not just that of the african national congress <e> <s> the visit is offensive to many tens of thousands of people black and white of this country who abhor the doctrines of apartheid <e> <s> does the minister not agree that mr bothas visit will be non-conducive to the public good to the same extent in the minds of many people as that of the libyans who were recently expelled <e>", "<cs> my lords frequently information is proffered by government ministers in the form of a letter written to the noble lord who has put the particular question <e> <s> since there may be a wider circle of noble lords who are interested in the answer to the question may i ask the minister whether he would consider it useful to have in this house a procedure whereby the information offered by a minister could be circulated in the <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister agree that apart from the cases of confait and <e>", "<cs> may i briefly intervene in this debate in order to point out that the noble lord

gauleiters to run all these local services <e> <s> is not that the end of current thinking in the ministers party <e>", "<cs> my lords is not one of the main reasons for the buoyancy of the tourist trade the fall in the value of the pound which has had disastrous effects on every other area of the economy in terms of the increases in prices of raw materials and finished goods whereas the tourist trade is the only trade to benefit from this weakness in the pound <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not say that <e> <s> i said one of them <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a long-established principle of our

my lords when the american envoys visited this country to make representations to her majestys government about the special launch-aid given to the european airbus in particular the proposed million
