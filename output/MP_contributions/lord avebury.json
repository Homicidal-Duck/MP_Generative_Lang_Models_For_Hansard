["<cs> my lords would the minister agree that it is not really very instructive to look at the overall totals of staff employed in departments and that you have to see how many people are <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister really able to say that valuable technical conclusions were reached in a forum where most of the soviet participants by all accounts were not scientists at all but kgb officers <e> <s> can the minister say whether there was any response whatsoever to the forthright and encouraging statement made by the noble lord lord todd or whether the government will still continue to press for the release of distinguished scientists like shcharansky and sakharov before they continue with exchanges of the kind which took place in hamburg <e>", "<cs> my lords while warmly endorsing the tributes that have been paid to the noble lord the foreign secretary and the governor lord soames may i respectfully agree with the noble lord that we cannot claim to have achieved ultimate success until a stable government are in power in zimbabwe <e> <s> would not one method of helping to ensure the success of the government which will take office under mr mugabe be to renew the offers of aid which have been made previously by her majestys government and in particular to make an exception of the policies of reducing the number of overseas students that we shall have at our universities by promising mr mugabe that we shall continue to take increasing numbers of zimbabweans at our universities whose skills will be so desperately needed especially if some of the whites leave as they are bound to do <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the existence of reserved lines and the threat of a possible motorway construction causes a blight affecting property values in the area and that many people in the vicinity of the proposed m motorway extension have been thereby prevented from selling their houses except at ridiculously low prices for many years <e> <s> in these matters certainty is what is required and therefore once the department has considered the representations that have been made they should put an end to all schemes for the indefinite future <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord agree that it is not only the soviet invasion of afghanistan which should prompt us to consider declining to attend the olympic games in moscow but also the soviet assistance to the repressive regime in ethiopia which is murdering and persecuting many thousands of citizens in eritrea and the ogaden and also the intensified persecution of dissenters within the boundaries of the soviet union itself <e> <s> will the noble lord not agree therefore that the advice given to the british olympic association that they should not take part in the games would not be rescinded simply as a result of the soviet union agreeing to the carrington plan on afghanistan <e> <s> the soviet union would have to show willing on these other matters as well <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord say why it is that if it is the customers who object to the information being released we follow a different rule in these matters from that of the united states <e> <s> will the noble lord say what examples there are of arms sales being prevented other than the very minor case of the armoured cars which we did not in the end sell to el salvador <e> <s> in particular why are the government continuing to sell arms to argentina a state which has been condemned by the state department in the united states and in respect of which there has recently been a report by the organisation of american states confirming that torture has been used universally as an instrument of policy in that country <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister not aware that an honourable friend reputedly put down a question on the order paper in another place concerning the sale of arms by this country to <e>", "<cs> the minister said there was nothing in the bill about the powers of governing bodies a point that was touched on by the noble baroness lady david <e> <s> would it not be desirable for the committee to direct its attention to this subject while we have the opportunity in debating this amendment <e> <s> we seldom look at the powers of the governing bodies and if we let this opportunity pass during the proceedings on this bill there may not be another chance of returning to it for many years <e>", "<cs> will the noble baroness remind us whether the william tyndale school which was the school i was thinking of had governing bodies and whether its powers were in theory sufficient to deal with the crisis that arose there <e> <s> what was the sum aspect of the dispute other than the articles which led to the impasse <e>", "<cs> i should like to say one more word before we conclude on this amendment <e> <s> it seemed to me that the noble baroness lady david was aiming at parity of treatment between the primary and secondary schools <e> <s> if the government are really prepared to think in terms of the local education authorities approving the statutes of both primary and secondary schools this could have been a way round it that nobody had thought of before this debate <e> <s> one possible solution would be for this amendment to be withdrawn on the undertaking that on report stage the noble baroness would bring forward an amendment that would give parity of treatment by causing the local education authorities to have the responsibility for both sets of articles <e> <s> i do not know whether this would be acceptable to the noble baroness lady david and her colleagues but certainly it would achieve that part of what she set out to do <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that the noble lord lord belstead has missed something rather than the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge <e> <s> he has missed the perfectly clear distinction which exists between the making of the arrangements for the admission of pupils to a particular school on the one hand and the publication of those arrangements so that parents know what they are on the other hand <e> <s> as i understand it the noble lord lord donaldson has not said that the arrangements for the admission of the pupils shall be taken away from the governors of aided or special agreement schools but simply that when once the governors have come to such an arrangement for the admission of pupils it will then be the responsibility of the local education authority to publish them <e>", "<cs> may i be helpful and put another suggestion which i think will satisfy the minister and my noble friend <e> <s> why not have a duty to publish laid on the governors of the aided or special agreement schools and on the local authorities <e> <s> in that case the governors of the aided schools could as is suggested send out the particulars of the arrangements for the admission of pupils to a wider area but they would also be available in the comprehensive document which would be distributed by the local education authority to the parents within the area of the local authority itself thus satisfying both requirements <e>", "<cs> may i say how useful it is to have the notes on clauses and to thank the government for providing them <e>", "<cs> it would be unpopular to enter into a discussion on the minefield of examination results at this late hour because so much has been said and written about the interpretation of examination results that very long speeches would be made if we were to embark on that subject <e> <s> but may i put one thought to the noble baroness for her to take on board during the consultations which she said will cover this subject as well as all the rest <e> <s> if i may say in passing it seems a little peculiar to me that at this stage the government have such definite ideas about the publication of examination results when as the noble baroness has told us she has not yet even started on the process <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble baroness was diverted by the speech of the noble lord lord shinwell so that she was not able to give an answer to the question i asked earlier on <e> <s> i do not want to risk trespassing on the rules of order by going back to an amendment which has been disposed of <e> <s> but since the point has been raised in connection with the capitation fee i think i may properly say that i entirely agree with the remarks to which your lordships have listened <e> <s> there can be perfectly valid differences in the expenditure between one school and another and i can very well picture that in a school with substantial laboratory facilities the amount that would be properly spent per child would be very much higher than in a school where the main subjects are in the field of the arts <e> <s> if therefore the amendment moved by the noble lord lord stewart of fulham were to be accepted the parents would need certain additional information <e>", "<cs> the noble lord may not be surprised that the amendment was tabled nor i suspect will he be surprised that his explanation has failed to satisfy the committee <e> <s> it leads to a <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord allow me to interrupt him <e> <s> if it is pupils and million that means per pupil which is slightly above his figure <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord hunt is right since the noble baroness said that some comprehensives i am sure that she did not mean all of them have to tell the colleges that they will be forced to lower their standards because they have not enough gifted pupils in the sixth forms <e> <s> well why is that <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness did not say that <e>", "<cs> she said that inorder that the entrance requirements of the colleges should he met it was necessary for the colleges to lower their requirements so that the comprehensives could provide the pupils to the standard that was required for admission <e> <s> if lord hunts argument is followed it will be even more difficult for the comprehensives to attain the standards that are required for admission to the colleges <e> <s> none of the students who are coming up to these colleges will come from the comprehensive sectorthey will all come from these special schools to which the noble baroness and her colleagues wish to divert the more able pupils <e> <s> then we shall be dividing society in a manner which i should not have thought anybody wanted into classes according to which school they had been to <e> <s> dividing children up in that way is going back years i should have thought <e> <s> we are going back to the rigid divisions we had immediately after the act came into operation <e>", "<cs> i am delighted to hear that and i am sorry to have detained your lordships with a speech the latter part of which was largely unnecessary hut it will have been valuable to get on record a reassurance from the noble baroness on the upper limit of million which presumably is in cash terms and not in pounds <e> <s> in other words the million is not going to be adjusted when we come to to take account of inflation <e> <s> it is important to have got this assurance on record from the noble baroness to underline what is not seen once the bill passes through your lordships house and becomes an act <e> <s> the financial memorandum gets forgotten <e> <s> to have these words on record is a very valuable assurance and satisfies me that the speech i have just made is not a complete waste of time <e>", "<cs> would not the noble lord agree that when we were talking earlier of handicapped children the point was made very strongly that unless there were strong indications to <e>", "<cs> it is because we live in a harsh economic environment that i had hoped that this scheme would commend itself to the government as an improvement and as one which would enable us to get back on our feet <e> <s> however at this late hour i shall not press the amendment but instead i shall withdraw it in the hope that perhaps we can return to it at the report stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords surely one issue of general importance which should not be deferred to the unstarred question which the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge intends to put down is the interference by the government in the bbcs proposal to raise the licence fee <e> <s> is it not a fact that if the bbcs request had been granted there would have been no question of having to cut any of the orchestras as they are being cut now <e> <s> will the minister take this one back and reconsider the refusal of the government to allow the bbc the revenue it needs <e> <s> would that not be in accordance with the general policy followed by the conservatives of loosening the reins of government and allowing a greater degree of freedom among bodies such as the bbc which hitherto have been subject to too great a degree of government control <e>", "<cs> my lords has the minister observed the allegations in the <e>"]
