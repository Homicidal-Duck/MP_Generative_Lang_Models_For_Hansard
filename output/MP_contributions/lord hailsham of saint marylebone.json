sentence should be imposed <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not important to remember that the question of whether or not to prosecute in any given case is not truly a government responsibility but a

doing do <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that notwithstanding the remarks that have fallen from the front bench opposite the great majority in this house is full of admiration for the way in which he answers questions <e>", "<cs> might it not be that my noble friend who proposed this amendment or my noble friend who replied to it have not really applied their minds to the problem of which of the other subsections of this clause would apply to a roll-on roll-off ferry which went to sea with its doors open <e>", "<cs> with great respect to my noble friend he has again overlooked the fact that what occurs in subsection is expressed in the subsection to be subject to the matters in subsection <e>", "<cs> i also agree with my noble and learned friend lord wilberforce and my noble and learned friend lord denning in his second view <e> <s> one of the very first maxims in law that my father taught me using his old-fashioned schoolboy pronounciation of latin was <e>", "<cs>

than homicide <e> <s> that cannot be altogether overlooked in this debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i would have agreed with every word that my noble friend has just said but for one fact and that is that i do not believe that life imprisonment means anything at all at the present time <e> <s> it is an indeterminate sentence which nobody can understand <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not conceivable that our ability to digest further legislation might be improved if we got on with the copyright bill <e>", "<cs> the period of years begins from the death of the author and if we live longer it will be the better for us all <e> <s> however when one is dealing with intellectual property one must consider two points first when the article becomes the property of mankind or of the nation or of language

<e> <s> the works of gilbert and sullivan are now part of english literature and there is no particular reason why the descendants of gilbert and sullivan if there are any should continue to enjoy a monopoly <e>", "<cs> this may not be the appropriate point at which to raise the matter but i gave my noble friend the minister notice some time ago that i had been approached by the owners of a periodical which very largely makes its living by the use of a composite team engaged in literary work in which it is almost impossible in its very nature to identify the particular author of the particular words that occur even in a particular sentence <e> <s> if my noble friend would indicate that either now or at some other time we can have an answer to the point i <e>", "<cs> if one considers a serial or soap opera such as the archers the earlier episodes date back to the time <e>", "<cs> i hope i may be forgiven for saying that i vastly prefer the approach of my noble and learned friend lord denning to that which we have just heard on the amendment in the name of the noble lord lord ardwick <e> <s> i believe that in principle it is misguided to try to turn what must be a question of fact and degree into a question of law by definition <e>", "<cs> that raises a question of policy of rather a more difficult kind than would appear from the simple and admirably concise way in which the amendment has been moved <e> <s> i should like to draw to the attention of the committee what i believe is involved in it <e> <s> there was a recent decision admittedly a controversial decision of your lordships house in its judicial capacity <e> <s> happily i was not involved in it and i can speak with complete impartiality <e> <s> the matter has raised a good deal of controversy in the professional press <e> <s> in clause one finds that copyright in relation to an artistic work <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may make a suggestion here <e> <s> i do not believe if i have divined correctly what has fallen from the various noble lords who have played a part in the debate that there is any difference here about the question of policy <e> <s> there is obviously a problem connected with draftsmanship <e>", "<cs> i should like to express a certain amount of doubt in this matter because i think we must remember that we are dealing with the granting of a monopoly as well as a right of property <e>", "<cs> may i ask my noble friend a question <e> <s> i think it would be more convenient as well as more courteous on my part if i asked him to find out the answer and let me know later <e> <s> but there is a question in relation to copying which occurred in the course of my professional practice many years ago which i do not think has been answered to my satisfaction and to which the anwer ought to be known in any serious consideration of the philosophy of copyright that is the use of parody <e>", "<cs> my lords is not my right honourable friend the prime minister

european matters that they should learn to keep their financial house properly in order <e>", "<cs> i was in that case <e>", "<cs> while i commend the attempts from the opposition front bench to improve the language of the bill i respectfully agree with my noble and learned friend lord denning that the one thing we do not wish to result from this new legislation is a flood of actions on bad copyright for the courts to decide <e> <s> they will only be authoritatively decided if they reach the house of lords and a decision is made there <e>", "<cs> it is clearly ungrammatical <e>", "<cs> i am half american myself <e> <s> however the one thing that i do not admire about the americans is their tendency to become a nation of hypochondriacs and litigants <e> <s> i should have thought that the amendment would undoubtedly develop litigation on a scale hitherto unheard of in this country in that particular field for the reasons which my noble and learned friend on my right and the noble and learned lord lord denning have put forward <e> <s> we are told that it includes only the well-known jurisprudence <e> <s> what else it would include is known only to the all-knowing <e>", "<cs>

answer but it is not yet in the bill <e>", "<cs> i just put this up for my noble friend on the front bench <e> <s> as i read the amendment in the names of my two noble friends it is not basically necessary in the bill as it stands <e> <s> an abstract is an extremely familiar and well-known form of enabling the scientific or other community to know what is contained in a wide range of different journals <e> <s> i would not dispute at all anything that my noble friend has said about it <e> <s> but as i understand it it is not copying under clause unless the copyright of the original work is infringed by clause <e>", "<cs> but those are not copyright <e>", "<cs> on a point of order the noble lord was called and was not here and his amendment cannot therefore be moved in my submission to the committee <e>", "<cs> i should like to endorse what my noble and learned friend on the cross benches has said <e> <s> as my noble friend on the front bench knows i have been approached by the publishers of a reputable magazine <e> <s> today i received a further letter from an association of magazine publishers <e> <s> they are disturbed even at the extent to which the bill goes in its present form <e> <s> it may be that their fears are groundless because they are complaining about the terms in which the government have replied to their representation <e> <s> however i think that if the amendment were passed they would certainly have legitimate ground for disquiet <e>", "<cs> my lords at the risk of being accused of statistical fatigue i should like to ask my noble friend whether it is a fact that the expectation of life in this country has steadily improved throughout my lifetime <e>", "<cs> legislation <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord williams of elvel said i raised this issue at an earlier stage of the discussion and therefore i will not take the committee back to what i said then <e>", "<cs> i share the view of my noble and learned friend on the cross-benches that the amendment is not an improvement on the draft in the bill <e> <s> the underlying fallacy in the case of the noble lord lord monkswell is that an element of consumer protection can be introduced in a clause that is designed to protect intellectual property <e> <s> the sharp blades in a rotary mower are dangerous and there are various provisions both in the law of tort and in the criminal law which protect people or ought to protect people or are designed intentionally to protect people from the dangerous construction or design of materials <e> <s> but you cannot use a property right in

shall not be considered to be intruding in this debate <e> <s> i noticed that the weather forecast today predicted not merely fog but frost and i hope that if i am slightly cool towards this amendment

lord lord mischon that the committee was not being told and that nobody mentioned that we had had a legal aid scheme within the general responsibility of the lord chancellor since <e>", "<cs> i notice that the noble and learned lord did not add it to the duties of the lord chancellor <e>", "<cs> let me say at once that what i said was that my noble friend was entirely innocent <e> <s> i was rather intent upon the opposition front bench as i thought i had made it clear that it was rather odd that the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones had not asked for a definition of his duties having held

board were to die that might prevent the appointment of somebody who was thought suitable <e> <s> for example if one of the two solicitors were to die or be run over by a motor car the lord chancellor

and learned friend <e> <s> i believe that there is a distinction between enlarging the jurisdiction of the court and restricting it <e> <s> it is perfectly true as my noble friend lord renton has said that the high court jurisdiction is very largely the creature of the supreme court act and therefore it is a creature of statute <e> <s> it is in fact a court of almost unlimited jurisdiction <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may point out to the noble lord the chairman of committees the fact that i think noble lords sitting behind me really intended to divide the committee but that they said not-content when they meant to say content <e> <s> in the circumstances perhaps the question could be put again <e>", "<cs> perhaps my noble and learned friend will bear with me if i reiterate what i said to him on the previous amendment <e> <s> there is all the difference in the world between restricting the jurisdiction of the high court and enlarging the jurisdiction of the county courts <e> <s> the purpose of the judicial review is mainly to enlarge the jurisdiction of the county courts in order to move work from the high court to the county courts <e>", "<cs> i rise to say a very few words on this issue <e> <s> with great respect to the noble lord lord mishcon who always puts his case with such persuasiveness i ask the question if only rhetorically what does he hope to get out of this amendment if it were to be accepted <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to my noble and learned friend on the cross-benches <e> <s> but with that sole exception they cannot do it unless both parties consent <e> <s> the chance of any lord chancellor let alone the present one with his wisdom in his right senses making the order which is prohibited under the amendment restricting defamation cases to the high court to where in practice they are already restricted is just about equal to that of an icicle in june <e> <s> i wonder what he hopes to gain out of it <e>", "<cs> i agree with almost every word that has been spoken so far about <e>", "<cs> at second reading of the bill i made two observations which are relevant to the present discussion <e> <s> this bill contains about pages and schedules <e> <s> there are two quite separate purposes behind the bill <e> <s> one is to give effect to the civil justice review in so far as it pertains to the county court and the high court jurisdiction practice and procedure <e> <s> the other is to alter radically the constitutional structure of the legal profession <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether it has occurred to those who tabled the amendment that there is an increasing consumption of low-alcohol and no-alcohol beverages which are called wine and beer <e> <s> reading the amendment one must of course remember must one not <e> <s> that those beverages are not made in the ordinary way without alcohol but in the ordinary way with the alcohol and the alcohol is then taken out <e> <s> if the amendment were accepted in the form in which it is drafted one would have all the bad e factors in low-alcohol and no-alcohol wine and low-alcohol and no-alcohol beer as one would if they were fully alcoholic <e> <s> i should rather take my poison with the alcohol <e>", "<cs> i should like to ally myself with the remarks of the noble earl lord halsbury and my noble friend lord middleton <e> <s> i think that there is something illogical about subsection b of this amendment <e> <s> i do not believe that anything is to be gained by calling people names <e> <s> the last thing i would do is to call the noble viscount either a crank or a troublemaker <e>

previous years those serious accidents bear to the number of vehicles registered on the road <e>", "<cs> this is highly technical stuff and i am not in a position to criticise or endorse everything

been omitted <e> <s> i wonder how it was that the bill came to be presented on second reading for enthusiastic endorsement in principle when so much required to be done before it reached committee <e>", "<cs> this is a mystery which is only understood by scots lawyers <e> <s> but there is a distinction <e> <s> i speak from my experience <e>", "<cs> i am not the person who is competent to speak about scottish law but i think the noble lord will find that if evidence in scotland is insufficient it does not and cannot prove the case whereas evidence in england can prove the case notwithstanding the fact that if it were controverted it might not be sufficient <e>", "<cs> we appear to have the answer on a piece of paper <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend recall that a highly radical government in passed pages of public general legislation and that practically no government in recent years at least in the past years has passed fewer than pages of public general

remarks of the noble and learned lord lord ackner <e> <s> the rules relating to costs are fairly well understood by the profession and by the judiciary <e> <s> to alter them in this way in a part of the bill primarily concerned with transfers between the high court and the county court is an imprudence and might lead to a good deal of confusion <e> <s> does my noble and learned friend consider it

expression legal representative will not be confined to members of the legal profession <e> <s> a certain amount of redrafting will be necessary if that is intended <e>", "<cs> as the matter has been referred to i should like to endorse what my noble and learned friend has just said about the function of the lord chancellor <e> <s> not only do i accept from him that he would never act in the way suggested but i assure the chamber that i never so acted nor has anybody with my permission ever so acted <e> <s> i can also say with confidence that my father who was twice lord chancellor would

and learned friend is aware that i make no bones about it <e> <s> however i wonder whether we are not straying from an orderly way of discussing the provisions <e> <s> i happen to be against the phraseology of clause even if i agreed with every other provision in part ii <e> <s> i do not believe in general objectives stated in the statutes <e> <s> my noble friend lord peyton was absolutely right in some of the points he put in his brief but excellent speech <e> <s> this is setting about reform in the wrong way <e> <s> i do not believe that we are discussing the matter in an orderly way

to my noble and learned friend <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say in one sentence that we must not lose sight of the fact that it is not only barristers and solicitors who are in question in this part of the bill it is also the avowed intention of this part of the bill rightly or wrongly and for this purpose i must assume rightly although that does not necessarily represent my opinion to allow other professions and members of other bodies not the law society not <e>", "<cs> i shall again speak briefly <e> <s> of course technically we are only speaking about the number of members of the advisory committee <e> <s> however that has perfectly properly allowed a number of excellent speeches to be made about amendments which follow as to its possible composition <e> <s> i do not conceal from my noble and learned friend the fact that <e> <s> i am against this structure <e> <s> i think that the variety of speeches which have been made show cumulatively the kind of danger into which he has fallen by adopting this structure <e>", "<cs> i hope that in giving that undertaking my noble and learned friend will also bear in mind that that illustrates the point that i sought to make <e> <s>

as often as i prosecuted <e> <s> i am sure that that is the truth about advocacy <e> <s> i have only one point to add <e> <s> we must never forget that our bench our judicial bench is recruited from successful practitioners <e> <s> it is vital that they should have experience of more roles than one <e>", "<cs> i should not perhaps have entered into this discussion but for the fact that the noble lord lord mishcon made a reference to me and what he said <e> <s> i beg him to remember even at the cost of repeating something <e>", "<cs> i never accuse the noble lord of misinterpreting what i say either deliberately or inadvertently <e> <s> however by way of a footnote to what he said i have to say that what i was then arguing was that there should be a greater interchangeability between the

time that i remember <e>", "<cs> will my noble friend also forgive me for intervening <e> <s> i dealt with that matter at very great length at the last sitting of the committee <e>", "<cs> my lords in

northern ireland and recognise the fact that the communal difficulties there are not the only cause of the economic troubles <e> <s> further will he also recognise that cure of the economic troubles might assist in resolving the communal differences <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may just say to my noble friend that obviously no one ought to take lightly the fact that the government or ministers

this as a straightforward moral issue <e> <s> i believe a conditional fee of the type proposed which is only one example of the contingency fee although not the worst to be inherently immoral <e> <s> it undermines the whole ethic of advocacy the whole ethic of the legal profession <e>", "<cs> if my noble and learned friend will forgive me before he finally sits down i wish to put on record that the point i was making was not that the arrangement under the clause was unavailable to defendants but that it was virtually useless to defendants against a vexatious frivolous or blackmailing

confidentiality <e> <s> i am sure that he was right to do so and that the committee will be extremely interested to hear what safeguards will be proposed by the secretary of state when it comes to the confidentiality of the information obtained before or after the grant of a loan <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to bully my noble friend about this but there is a point about which i should like a little more precision than i have had in my own mind <e>", "<cs> my lords cannot my noble friend who made a good pedantic legal point realise that this is an anomaly <e> <s> will he communicate to his right honourable friend the secretary of state that the feeling in this house is almost certainly unanimous except for his brief unfortunately <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to interrupt my noble friend but surely the words over the age of mean that one is over the age of on ones th birthday plus one <e> <s> indeed one could say that one is over the age of at ones birth hour plus one <e> <s> one does not have to wait until ones th birthday to be over the age of <e> <s> one is over the age of after ones th birthday <e> <s> i should be astonished to hear a lawyer seriously argue to the contrary <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask my noble friend one question <e> <s> if i am wrong and i am just as fallible as anybody else -does he agree that it is purely a drafting point and that the wording of the amendment can be changed so as to give effect to what most of us believe is the existing situation namely that you become on your eighteenth birthday and after midnight you are more than <e>", "<cs> my lords turning to a slightly differest aspect of the matter can my noble friend tell me what apart from insurance pension schemes of the police and the criminal injuries compensation board are the sources of compensation available to innocent members of the public who may have suffered personal injury or damage <e> <s> what are the remedies available to those who have been hurt or damaged in the course of an incident of this kind <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend recall that the matter is regulated by statute namely the european communities act <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that the true constitutional position is that responsibility to parliament rests with the home secretary and him alone <e> <s> however if he were to take operational command of a situation such as that which we have all witnessed through the media he would be a very unwise home secretary <e>", "<cs> my lords is section fortified by criminal penalty for breach <e> <s> if so who are the policing and prosecuting authorities responsible for taking proceedings <e>", "<cs> i hope that the committee will forgive me for intervening in this scottish domestic dispute <e> <s> ever since the act of union there have been many reasons why the scots have desired to have their own separate system of law <e> <s> that system has served them very well to the present day <e> <s> i venture to suggest both to my noble and learned friend on the front bench and to members of the committee who have spoken in this debate that the institution of marriage should be common to both parts of great britain <e> <s> it is not really conducive to respect for the institution of marriage to have different periods of time affecting the continuance of marriage and divorce <e> <s> perhaps the way forward is to try to keep the two periods in step with one another <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether we are doing ourselves justice in this debate <e> <s> we are discussing a change in the law of scotland on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i am interested in original sin and i hope that i may be forgiven whether or not i am a forgiving person <e> <s> however i hope that we can get down to the kind of argument advanced by the noble and learned lord lord morton of shuna in support of the amendment or go in the other direction and destroy his argument <e> <s> to use the amendment as a curtain raiser for the second reading of the bill which is before this place is abusing the time of this place <e> <s> we have now been discussing the amendment for nearly minutes and i believe that we should return to its merits <e>", "<cs> my lords has my noble friend observed that with the exception of the single supplementary question from my noble friend lord harmar-nicholls every supplementary asked during this question time has involved pressure to expend further sums of money <e> <s> on the assumption that each of those suggestions was worthy is it not also clear that all of them cannot be fulfilled <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that any change in economic policy takes between two and five years to work through to the economy and that therefore the precise date in the original question totally lacks relevance to anything <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not be better if we awaited the report which as my noble friend has said will shortly be forthcoming before we attempt to establish points <e>", "<cs> my lords do i not detect an element of <e>", "<cs> my lords as a member of gods holy opposition may i ask my noble friend whether the campaign lobbying against the proposed reforms of the shops bill some years ago was not among the most disreputable and ridiculous which christian churches which are unable to agree about almost anything managed to put on <e>", "<cs> my lords while agreeing with my noble friend that all legitimate procedures should be enlisted can she advise me whether if all else fails the local ombudsman is available <e> <s> can she advise me whether if that did not work judicial review would be available <e>", "<cs> my lords i confess at once that i put my name down to speak in the debate with great hesitation and as i hope the <e>", "<cs> including mine if the noble lord remembers <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that the noble lord is doing me justice <e> <s> i defined what i said as just laws enacted by a freely-elected parliament <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will not do me the injustice of pretending that i meant something else <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord will allow me to intervene <e> <s> has it not occurred to him that the reason for that is very simple <e> <s> we have not incorporated the jurisprudence of the european convention into our own law because it is a fundamental principle that one cannot go to the european court until one has exhausted the local remedy <e> <s> the reason we have been arraigned before the european court is that one can go from this country straight to the european court without going up the staircase of local remedy <e> <s> that is exactly why my noble friend lord alexander and i said what we did in our respective speeches <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble and reverend lord who has just spoken i too spoke in the last debate <e> <s> i have not changed my mind in the interval but i shall try not to repeat myself <e> <s> however in one respect i shall repeat myself <e> <s> i want to express again in the presence of the noble and reverend lord my absolute horror of the crimes which were committed against his people in the so-called holocaust and even more during the long history of persecutions to which they have been subjected over the centuries by persons of varying religions varying faiths and from various geographical distributions <e> <s> i should also like to express my absolute detestation of the most irrational and unlovable doctrine of anti-semitism which i simply cannot imagine a civilised or educated human being entertaining for one moment <e> <s> i think it is right that i should begin what i have to say by expressing that view <e>", "<cs> that is wicked <e>", "<cs> are we second-class citizens <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that if there is the vast volume of people eager for higher personal taxation as postulated in the original question i can give them a nice list of reputable medical charities which they can support to great public advantage by putting their hands into their pockets <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the point which the noble lord lord stallard has been making in his last two supplementary questions simply underline the necessity of keeping inflation down <e> <s> further does not my noble friend agree that without looking further than the benches opposite if the labour party want to make themselves intellectually respectable they should <e>", "<cs> my lords for the less instructed among us can my noble friend explain what the gdp deflator is <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend accept that many people in the house think that in view of the rapid change and flux of events in the international world we should applaud the governments caution before rushing into over-hasty decisions <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that in ancient times those areas of greece and turkey which now produce tobacco were once covered with beautiful carbon dioxide consuming woodlands which could also be made employment intensive <e> <s> perhaps that should be brought to the attention of the appropriate members of those great countries <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a mistake to use question time for a general economic debate <e> <s> is not the purpose of oral questions to obtain information <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend encourage the oxford university press or some other appropriate body to issue a concise dictionary of technical terms in current use by eurospeak in translatable english <e>", "<cs> i should like <e>", "<cs> i want to speak against both of the amendments <e> <s> i should like to say a word in favour of dogs and dog owners and against both the amendments of which that spoken to by my noble friend lord mancroft is marginally less offensive <e>", "<cs> my lords for the benefit of the less well-informed among us will my noble friend say in a single sentence what are the proposed underground crossrail links <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the uncertainty of the gulf crisis is it not reasonably obvious even to the nave that it is right for oil companies to keep their stocks up and that in order for them to keep their stocks up they have to consider the replacement price <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask the leader of the house a question <e> <s> when we have a private notice question is it not still a question <e> <s> is it not entirely wrong for it to be turned into a statement <e>", "<cs> my lords i promise to be very brief <e> <s> i cannot avoid the impression especially from the fullness of the notes from which they were delivered that most of the speeches in this debate had been prepared almost <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to address my remarks not only to the house but also to my noble and learned friend on the woolsack <e> <s> i hope that the noble baroness who spoke so eloquently from the cross-benches will not accuse me of holding human life in any less respect than she does <e> <s> i am quite aware of what my noble friend who sits behind me referred to when he spoke of the bond which can exist between the heavily handicapped child and its parents and what wonderful examples of love and care they can show <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know how serious is serious <e> <s> i know that i am handicapped <e> <s> i walk on two sticks <e> <s> that is not incompatible with my life so far as i know or at least so far <e> <s> i do not believe that i can answer my noble friends question <e> <s> all i am saying is that the amendment is under debate <e> <s> i find it unacceptable unless my noble and learned friend on the woolsack tells me that it can make some sense and if so what that sense is <e>", "<cs> my lords the word serious is a matter of degree <e> <s> i was born with six fingers on my right hand and no joint on my two thumbs <e> <s> i do not regard that as serious <e> <s> it has not done me much harm in the event <e>", "<cs> my lords really really really <e> <s> not one word of the previous two speeches to which we have listened has had the smallest relevance to the amendment under discussion <e> <s> my noble and learned friend lord brightman made a conclusive and absolutely convincing speech <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness ask a question <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not be a good thing if we all doubled our subscriptions to that admirable charity <e> <s> would not that raise more than <e>", "<cs> my lords i put a specific matter to my noble and learned friend <e> <s> he will be aware of course that it is a feature of the divorce law in england and probably elsewhere in the united kingdom that before a court grants a dissolution of a marriage it has to be satisfied as to the care and maintenance of the children otherwise the parents do not get their final decree <e> <s> i did not understand from the statement whether what has been said this afternoon will interfere with that feature or whether it will be retained in its present form <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure what a car-boot sale is but is the noble lord aware that it is quite clear that it is not market overt at whatever hour it is held <e>", "<cs> my lords i continue to be of the same opinion as i was in the original debate though on that occasion i was in a minority <e> <s> i will come to the merits in a moment because i do not want to spend my time arguing at great length about the constitutional proprieties <e> <s> i would just say that ever since the th century the commons have asserted their right in financial matters <e> <s> this house has in practice conceded it except on a few very unfortunate occasions <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry but i must interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> the point i was trying to make was that the dog was not in fact registered although registration was not then in force and is not in force now <e> <s> however if such a scheme had been in force whether or not the dog was registered it would still have been impossible to trace the owner because the dog was not wearing a collar <e>", "<cs> another way is not to do it <e>", "<cs> my lords before the right reverend prelate sits down perhaps may ask him whether he has looked at the marshalled list and seen commons reason a <e> <s> it is not merely the direct charge of a tax over which the commons claim superiority of jurisdiction it is an increase in the revenue <e> <s> this proposed tax is a local one <e> <s> if the right reverend prelate will consult <e>", "<cs> my lords are not the public policy implications of the merger currently under consideration by the iba <e> <s> will they not again come under public consideration by the monopolies and mergers commission and probably by the licensing authority when it comes into effect <e> <s> furthermore is it not wise not to fish in troubled waters in the meantime <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that the total obliteration without the smallest justification of a recognised member of the united nations by another if it were allowed to pass without resistance would bring the whole fabric of international law into disrepute <e> <s> would not the churches be a great deal more respected in this country if they realised the clear moral and legal implications of what has happened <e>", "<cs> my lords under article of the treaty of rome is it not possible for the courts to ask the opinion of the luxembourg court about whether our law is consistent with the treaty <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not remarkable in view of the solicitude expressed by the noble lord lord jenkins for iraqi casualties both those killed and those disabled that nothing is said regarding british casualties or those of their allies <e> <s> presumably they will be working either under chapter of the charter of the united nations or under article <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that these intricate matters of argument on both sides are better reserved for argument in debate rather than oral questions <e>", "<cs> a bloody shovel <e>", "<cs> my lords has my noble friend noticed that all the questions from the opposition benches are designed to show that things are worse than they are <e> <s> does he not agree that this rising cry of stinking fish is somewhat discreditable <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that the obliteration without excuse of one member of the united nations by another contrary to the united nations charter is something which must be prevented at all costs irrespective of purely financial considerations <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend accept that her refusal to indulge in speculation at this stage is to be heartily applauded not only on this side of the house
