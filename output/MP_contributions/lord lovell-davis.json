["<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while appreciating the position in so far as the government and the iba are concerned may i ask the minister whether he is satisfied with the present situation whereby large non-local companies among them some major canadian broadcasting organisations owning radio stations in canada and the united states hold equity in a number of british independent local radio stations and does he not consider that this represents something of a threat to the independence and local nature of the stations <e> <s> secondly and here i should declare some interest in that i would not have been aware of the position had i not been associated with a company intending to be involved in this field may i ask the minister whether he would tell the house if he and his right honourable friend the secretary of state approve of the practice whereby some of these outside companies not only hold equity in the local radio stations but also act as agents selling national advertising time for the stations generally on a sole agent basis from which they earn substantial commissions that is to say they are both agents and operators <e> <s> should they not be told to be either radio station owners or agents of advertising but not both <e>", "<cs> my lords while appreciating what the minister has said could i ask him whether he and his right honourable friend the secretary of state might at least review the situation so far as the state of participation in independent local radio companies is concerned <e> <s> it was after all the noble lords government who established inde <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord sheffield has told you i intend to talk on the committees report on energy conservation <e> <s> the two specific community proposals referred to us for scrutiny are draft directives on the indication by labelling of the energy consumption of domestic appliances and electric ovens and the second four-year energy research and development programme for <e> <s> however i should point out that the committee have gone wider than these proposals and have taken them as an opportunity to conduct a general inquiry into the communitys conservation policy specifically its rational use of energy programme <e> <s> we feel that this is justified in the circumstances and indeed the labelling proposals themselves are sufficient reason <e> <s> they are not exactly impressive signs of the commissions labours <e> <s> the two draft directives on the labelling of domestic appliances simply propose a standard form of labelling and secondly apply specific standards only for domestic electric ovens not even the accompanying hot plates and grills just ovens <e> <s> if this is the only tangible result of over four years of work we have little reason to throw our hats in the air and shout carry on europe <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very pleased to be the first to congratulate the noble earl lord yarborough on his maiden speech especially on his temerity <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to start by shooting down one of the many canards this government has launched into the air and incidentally wing another <e> <s> the first is that the massive price rises proposed for gas and electricity are being set primarily in the cause of conservation the key factor as the secretary of state said in yesterdays debate in another place <e> <s> anyone with any awareness of the massive and complex problems that face us in continuing to fuel our industries our homes our means of transport our whole developing future recognises the need for the efficient use of energy <e> <s> it is also clear that without a realistic pricing policy to reinforce the message attempts at energy conservation will be largely wasted <e> <s> your lordships know this so does the british gas corporation and so apparently do the government <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a question that the government obviously must answer <e> <s> they are not intervening in any positive way in the british steel dispute they are allowing the steel industry to get into an appalling condition and they are standing back from it <e> <s> however they are quite prepared to intervene in this matter because it is simple and it fits in with their monetarist policies <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry i did not hear the noble lord <e> <s> will he repeat his question <e>", "<cs> my lords do not know what the noble lord means by the monstrous indignities of them lying open i am afraid <e>", "<cs> my lords in that respect is the minister satisfied about the extent to which this scheme is being publicised <e> <s> can he give the house some idea of the steps which the government are taking to publicise it <e> <s> because many of us must fear that a great many people do not know the details or possibly even of the existence of the scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the noble baroness the minister agree that the amended guidelines should prohibit the use of public funds in the form of interest-free loans and the working time of public administrators to support private fund raising agencies since this is a principle to which this house has objected successfully throughout the life of the modern civil service <e>", "<cs> my lords in taking over from my noble friend lord kennet who is prevented from being on the front bench this evening i share the concern of my noble friend lord ritchie-calder that nothing in the bill should in any way restrict or inhibit scientific research in the deep sea <e> <s> it may be that the noble earl lord gowrie can assure us that the definition of exploration in the bill clearly limits it to an economic purpose and in no way affects scientific research <e> <s> i hope that the noble earl will be able to do so <e> <s> certainly this needs to be made absolutely clear <e> <s> in that respect at least i am glad that my noble friend has put forward his amendment <e> <s> it or some other refinement may have to be considered if the bill in fact could affect scientific research <e>", "<cs> my lords at the committee stage of the bill the support of noble lords on these benches was offered to the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran when he moved his amendment to ensure that companies given licences should assume direct responsibility for the safety health or welfare of the personnel they employed on underwater operations <e> <s> consequently we too are pleased that the minister on giving the matter the consideration he promised has decided to make the bill specific in the matter of safety health or welfare by this addition to subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment raises for the first time in the consideration of the bill the novel and interesting idea of designating areas of the deep seabed which would be protected from the depredations of mining activity and it has much to commend it to the house to the reciprocating countries and to the world as a whole <e> <s> scientific research in the deep sea has been going on for some time but as technology improves it has a long way to go yet <e> <s> as science advances we must have undefiled areas for it to explore and as my noble friend lord ritchie-calder said there is in the united states act a section along similar lines referring to stable reference areas <e> <s> if we too open the way for protective measures no doubt it will prove easier to gain the co-operation of other reciprocating countries in achieving the end which my noble friend seeks through the amendment which i support <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord kennet will be particularly pleased by this government amendment as indeed i am since as the minister has just pointed out my noble friend at the committee stage raised the matter of the inequality introduced into the bill by following what the noble earl the minister described as standard home office policy <e> <s> quite apart from the desirability of not creating further grounds for imprisonment while accepting that it is necessary to safeguard certain information the provision for imprisonment was as i suspect the minister himself began to feel during the committee stage rather more drastic than was necessary and did seem discriminatory <e> <s> its deletion is welcome <e>", "<cs> my lords when this house last met on the day it rose for the easter recess the noble lord lord denham in response to an inquiry by my noble friend lord wells-pestell referred to two statements which were about to be made in another place <e> <s> one of these as has already been mentioned this afternoon was a statement on telecommunications monopoly in which the secretary of state talked about the competitive arrangements covering apparatus which could be linked to the telecommunications network and the removal of british telecommunications monopoly on giving their approval of such apparatus <e> <s> he went on to point out that he was that day publishing the beesley report welcomed its free market recommendations as one might expect and as one might equally expect threw cold water on professor beesleys to me more important recommendation that the restraints on british tele <e>", "<cs> my lords my contribution to this debate will be brief but i hope that it will be useful because i wish to raise an important question to which i hope that the minister can provide an answer when he sums up this very interesting debate for which we are greatly indebted to the noble lord lord vaux <e> <s> noble lords may recall that in i introduced in your lordships house a debate on the report of the committee on child health services chaired by professor donald court <e> <s> i should like to draw your lordships attention to two recommendations from the court report both of which were discussed in that <e>", "<cs> my lords when this bill was first announced the secretary of state said that it represented the biggest programme of privatisation ever to come before parliament <e> <s> in my view it also represents potentially the most disastrous programme of privatisation ever to come before parliament <e> <s> what is more it will be implemented by a government whose financial acumen in such matters hardly inspires confidence <e>", "<cs> i would take issue with the noble earl who has just spoken <e> <s> it seems to me that this is a matter which was very extensively covered in the second reading debate and there was a great deal of disquiet over the whole of your lordships house about it <e> <s> it seems to me astonishing that any noble lord who has pledged himself to less government should be prepared to troop through the lobby against such an amendment in support of an extension of any secretary of states powers <e> <s> what is meant by the secretary of states powers <e> <s> it seems to me that it means major decisions made behind governmental and that means departmental doors which need not be put forward at all for any parliamentary scrutiny as my noble friend lord strabolgi has said <e> <s> we are talking about the disposal of public assets and massive ones at that and i believe that this amendment is vital to safeguard the public interest and to ensure that we reserve our right to know what is happening behind those doors <e>", "<cs> if the minister would give way he is repeating what ministers have said in another place and what i believe has already been said here that they have no intention of privatising transmission and distribution <e> <s> the fact remains that we are discussing the bill as it stands and we are talking about the powers that can be used and they exist <e> <s> i would like to repeat what my noble friends have asked what is there in the bill which lays down the safety requirements that should be in the bill <e> <s> because we are talking about the powers this bill gives to supply <e> <s> it is not good enough for a minister to talk about this possibly happening only where there are tied cottages <e> <s> it can happen in other situations as well <e>", "<cs> i should like to support my noble friend <e> <s> as a minister who was responsible in this house for energy under the last government i had the opportunity of visiting many research and safety centres of the british gas corporation which as my noble friend lord ross said probably has the greatest expertise of any corporation of its type in the world <e> <s> it has the best knowledge of its own system and installations <e> <s> are the government saying that it is not worth ensuring that the greatest experience available is brought to bear in such matters as we are discussing <e>", "<cs> the conservative party manifesto said <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will give way i can give him an answer to that immediately <e> <s> before i do so i should like to quote almost the last words the noble lord lord strathcona and mount royal speaking for the party opposite said <e>", "<cs> i shall not delay the committee on this matter important though it is <e> <s> the governments resistance to the amendment it seems to me exposes one of the basic flaws in the bill that is the lack of parliamentary accountability for the major decisions that will be involved in implementing it <e> <s> i think that the government are defending what in this case is plainly indefensible a total disregard for the public interest <e> <s> the noble earl lord mansfield may have referred to rhetoric and hyperbole <e> <s> nonetheless he cannot escape the fact that this is a vitally important matter <e> <s> asking for the affirmative procedure to be used is at least an advance on the negative procedure <e> <s> it seems to me that it is not really asking for much and i am surprised that the government will not accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps it is not surprising that i should intervene in a matter which concerns energy conservation <e> <s> i suppose that i have spoken more in your lordships house about energy <e>", "<cs> my lords the ministers reply has dealt a heavy blow to my touching faith in ministerial pronouncements <e> <s> in listening to the noble lord lord skelmersdale i cannot help reflecting as the red indian said white man speak with forked tongue <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble earl will give way <e> <s> if he will read my speech in <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble earl has said we have debated this particular clause in great detail <e> <s> it is true but we seem to have had little effect upon the government <e> <s> the noble earl has said that the opposition are aiming to thwart the process <e> <s> we are not aiming to thwart the process <e> <s> what we are trying to do is to protect the public interest and ensure that parliament may fully consider how the secretary of state proposes to use the powers given to him by this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to congratulate the noble lord lord kings norton and his colleagues on sub-committee f on the full and careful report which is before us today <e> <s> at the same time since there is always a need to justify the continuing existence of this house i should like to underline the value of the work carried out by the select committee on the european communities and its sub-committees <e> <s> there is no other body at westminster which undertakes the close and detailed scrutiny of the variety of proposals and draft legislation which pours like a paper flood from brussels <e> <s> and i doubt whether there is anywhere such a reservoir of experience and expertise to stem this flood and calmly analyse its contents <e> <s> it is a function of this house in which we can take some pride <e> <s> members who regularly visit the commission in brussels and the european parliament will also know that the reports which emanate from the select committee command attention and respect <e> <s> i sometimes feel that we and our colleagues in another place undervalue this special contribution that members of this house make to our membership of the community <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a certain irony in the fact that we are today debating energy policy when as far as i can see the government have no energy policy unless surrendering to market forces and privatising sections of our national oil and gas industries to both of which my noble friend lord strabolgi has referred with scorn can be called a policy <e> <s> otherwise the department of energy which in the present economic climate should be one of the most active and important departments of state seems to have become an archive for reports and recommendations some of which never see the light of day once they have disappeared inside thames house <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble baroness lady trumpington for that reply <e> <s> the purpose of this amendment as i am sure she appreciates very well is to redefine the new description of cable use as one of the restricted acts under the control of the copyright holder <e> <s> the matter of definition is a key element in this bill <e> <s> i feel that something along the lines of my amendment or the suggestion put forward by my noble friend should be considered <e> <s> it was my intention to draw attention to this matter <e> <s> i am very glad the noble baroness has heard me <e> <s> i think the matter should be given further consideration <e> <s> at this stage i shall not press the matter but beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord the minister for what he has said i hope i have followed and understood it <e> <s> i certainly recognise the difficulties <e> <s> these are very complex issues all copyright matters are and i will not delay your lordships at this stage by going further into that area <e> <s> they are vital to copyright holders and to everyone involved not least because the bill should make the situation absolutely clear wherever it can if only to avoid unnecessary litigation in the future <e> <s> failure to achieve clarity is going to lead us into great complication <e>", "<cs> my lords i too would like to congratulate my noble friend lord ennals for initiating this most important debate and on the forceful way in which he opened it <e> <s> this is a vast and complex subject of which he has experience and knowledge to a far greater degree than i have <e> <s> that is why i shall confine myself this evening to one aspect of the health service but one which has become and will continue to be increasingly important as the population and patterns of care change <e> <s> i refer to care in the community <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that informative and fairly encouraging reply <e> <s> is he able to tell the house what progress has been made in funding the new museum and whether the necessary approvals are being expedited since developers tend to get impatient once they start work on a project <e> <s> will he seek to encourage the developers in this particular area to give their fullest support to the scheme so that this year which appropriately is industry year may see the founding of londons new museum in docklands <e>", "<cs> my lords before commenting on the report i should make it clear to your lordships that although i am a consultant to companies and associations which have made their own responses to the green paper the views i wish to express in this debate are my own <e>", "<cs> my lords the subject of this debate framed as a deceptively simple-sounding question to the government is not only important of itself to speech therapists those who have embarked with some understandable trepidation on the qualifying course and to many thousands of our population who will desperately need speech therapy to live or to regain a full life it is also important in that it raises the question of the support or lack of support the government give to services other than crisis-intervention services which a constantly reorganised and increasingly restricted national health service is attempting to provide <e>", "<cs> my lords i start by saying that i wholly accept the implication of the motion brought before your lordships this afternoon by my noble friend lord cledwyn of penrhos that manufacturing industry is important vitally important to the economic prosperity of our society so much so that i do not intend to argue the case <e> <s> what i should like to do is to consider why our manufacturing industry has declined so dramatically and indicate some of the lessons that that process of decline offers us for the future <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e> <s> if he reads <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that this has been a very valuable debate and i should like to thank all noble lords who have taken part and made such important contributions to it <e> <s> i should like to apologise for exceeding my allotted time by about two minutes but i mistakenly understood that i was permitted to speak for minutes <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome for two reasons the initiative taken by my noble friend lord ennals in launching this debate <e> <s> the first reason has clearly been stated by noble lords from all parts of the house <e> <s> there is grave concern about the state of what was once one of the brightest jewels in the crown of this society our national health service <e> <s> the second reason is that it gives me an opportunity to emphasises again the concern for child health services and the anxieties expressed by myself and other noble lords during the short debate on this subject on th october last year <e>", "<cs> my lords i hold no brief for either side in the present unhappy situation which exists in cyprus but i am concerned as i believe is every member of the house with terrorist threats here <e> <s> will the minister tell the house whether records of similar threats made to advertisers or organisations displaying advertisements exist and whether the government issue specific advice and guidance as to how companies should react when they are subjected to such threats <e>", "<cs> my lords i have never believed that out-and-out competition is the best basis for a national energy policy <e> <s> during my time as a junior minister in the department of energy i advocated as government spokesman on energy in your lordships house an integrated energy policy <e> <s> in those days the mid-s i seem to remember that there was a good deal of agreement on all sides of the house that an integrated policy balancing one source of supply with another was the sensible approach to our energy needs <e> <s> the reasons were and i think remain clear <e> <s> we were and still are dealing with finite resources <e> <s> we conceived it a s the proper role of government to secure the appropriate efficient reasonably priced and safe production and distribution of energy while at the same time conserving and not wasting the vital supplies of coal gas and oil on which our whole economy society and very civilisation depend <e>"]
