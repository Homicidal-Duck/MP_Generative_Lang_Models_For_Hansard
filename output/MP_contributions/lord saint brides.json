["<cs> my lords like others of your lordships it is possible that i may not be able to be present during the closing moments of this debate and if that happened i beg the indulgence of your lordships <e> <s> may i also say what a privilege it is for me to take part in this debate the same debate as the noble lord lord home of the hirsel the noble lord lord stewart of fulham under both of whom i served as an official and also as the noble lord lord gore-booth an old colleague and former chief of mine in india and elsewhere to whose thoughtful speech we all listened just now with admiration <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords who have spoken i was much impressed by the conviction and forthrightness with which the noble and gallant lord lord hill-norton spoke to us earlier in this debate <e> <s> it is about the global threat of which he spoke that i shall try to deal succinctly in my speech <e>", "<cs> my lords misconceptions and misunderstandings arise even in the best regulated alliances and there are two at the moment in our transatlantic alliance which i should like to mention <e> <s> the first and the less grave of them has already been touched on by the noble lord lord stewart of fulham and it is widespread in america <e> <s> it is that we the european members of nato are ourselves contributing scandalously little to the common defence while leaving the main burden to be shouldered by the united states <e>", "<cs> my lords the sub-committees report is a shrewd and thorough one and its authors have served the house well <e> <s> britain was a latecomer to the eec and its aid arrangements <e> <s> in consequence it has been an uphill struggle to make our influence felt in working a system which in its original form that is to say during the yaound epoch was devised without us <e> <s> we have done well to secure its extension to so many anglophone territories but even so it still does not cover three very large anglophone ex-colonies of britain india pakistan and bangladesh whereas it does cover virtually all the french dutch belgian and ex-italian colonies <e> <s> it follows that britain needs to be especially careful to ensure that the direction of our global aid flows is not for this reason distorted <e>", "<cs> my lords by comparison which the noble lord lord rhodes and others who have spoken so far in this debate my own first-hand acquaintance with china is both slender and recent <e> <s> but not long ago some of us had a most interesting conversation with the prime minister of china in beijing <e> <s> some of the points he then made to us and some of our reflections on what he said are i believe relevant to this debate <e> <s> i hope that your lordships will forgive me if i take up some time to tell the house about them <e>", "<cs> my lords with your lordships permission i shall start by taking issue with the noble lord lord harris of greenwich as to whether the american raids on libya are likely to have proved counterproductive or otherwise <e> <s> colonel gaddafi spoke some defiant words at his press conference yesterday <e> <s> but to put the matter at its starkest for him to have made an enemy of the most powerful nation in the world the united states an enemy that has now twice shown that it is prepared to use military force to hit libyan targets must in the colonels cooler moments daunt even him <e> <s> it must certainly have brought misgiving to his more sober fellow-countrymen who have libyas long-term interests at heart <e> <s> to this extent it can surely be claimed that americas long-delayed act of retribution has probably succeeded for the first time in creating a substantial deterrent to future acts of gaddafi-sponsored terrorism <e>", "<cs> my lords of all the problems that we have had to face in the course of winding up a <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble baroness lady seear reminded us it was an ill day for south africa and for the world when in the national party with its racist ideas replaced the smuts government and introduced an avowedly white supremacist regime <e> <s> it was underpinned as we all know by creating the system of institutionalised injustice which we know and abhor as apartheid <e> <s> it has taken the nationalists all this time to realise into what a blind alley they then led their country and to begin to dismantle some of apartheids less essential but still iniquitous manifestations like the mixed marriages act the pass laws and now it seems perhaps also the group areas act <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall begin by paying a tribute to the noble lord lord brockway for the sincere and eloquent speech to which we have just listened <e> <s> there are some points he made with which i strongly disagree and indeed having looked at this matter as objectively as i possibly can i must say that i believe that the government have acted rightly and sensibly and in a way not designed to obstruct legitimate visits to this country but to make the whole process more manageable by our own authorities and less harassing and less uncertain for the would-be visitors <e>", "<cs> my lords i look forward to hearing how the noble lord the minister will respond to that forthright lively and eloquent speech <e> <s> however i hope that the noble lord lord annan will forgive me if i do not follow him into that area of the world but rather revert to another theme of the gracious speech namely east-west relations <e>", "<cs> my lords like previous speakers i very much welcome the action of the noble lord lord thorneycroft in initiating this debate <e> <s> at the next general election the british people for the first time will be asked specifically to say whether or not they wish to maintain this countrys independent nuclear deterrent so between us all we had better get the answer to this question right <e>", "<cs> my lords like other speakers in the debate i am a layman <e> <s> but i am considerably <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the noble baroness lady young was quite right in saying during her speech that the agreement which we signed in with the chinese was a good and fair one that is on the important assumption that the regime in power in beijing would continue to be a pragmatic and moderate one which did not renege on its promises <e>"]
