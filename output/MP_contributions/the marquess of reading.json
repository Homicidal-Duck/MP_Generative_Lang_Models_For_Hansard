["<cs> my lords in the shadow of this appalling event i beg the indulgence of the house to make my maiden speech <e> <s> my apprehension at addressing your lordships is outweighed by the importance that i attach to this debate <e> <s> i shall try to be brief and to the point <e> <s> briefly i want to concentrate on the moral status of the embryo <e> <s> the manipulation of human embryos especially for experimental purposes depends for its moral validity on the nature of the human embryo itself <e> <s> clearly if the embryo is not a human person with the right to life such manipulations are ethically justified <e>", "<cs> my lords when your lordships house debated the warnock report towards the end of last year attention was mainly focused upon the matter of the human embryo <e> <s> at that time i had the honour to make my maiden speech and i too feel the deepest concern at the faltering and inconsistent treatment proposed by the warnock committee for individual living growing human beings <e>", "<cs> took the oath <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my thanks to the noble duke for bringing forward this bill <e> <s> i made my maiden speech in this house in the warnock report debate and in a way i regret having to speak again on the same subject <e> <s> the repetition only serves to demonstrate the governments delay in bringing forward legislation on the matter <e> <s> we have been promised legislation since and three years later we are no further forward <e> <s> i ask the house to resist the amendment of the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby <e> <s> it is no good relying as the noble lord suggests on the speculation that legislation on this subject will definitely be included in the next queens speech <e>", "<cs> i should like to speak in favour of the amendment standing in my name <e> <s> i should especially like to say how concerned i am about the fact that the bill appears to discriminate against the children <e> <s> i understand the dangers outlined by the noble and learned lord on placing the words by donation on the birth certificate <e> <s> however if the child is either suspicious or his parents advise him that he is a product of aid or of ivf or if the child at the age of wishes to know the identity after counselling i cannot understand why he should not be able to identify the donor <e> <s> perhaps we are in danger of discriminating against the child in favour of the donor <e>"]
