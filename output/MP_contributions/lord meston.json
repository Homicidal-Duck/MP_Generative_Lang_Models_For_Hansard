["<cs> my lords in addressing your lordships house for the first time it is my hope that i shall be as brief and uncontroversial as is this bill <e> <s> this bill is welcome <e> <s> clearly considerable thought has gone into its drafting and it fulfils two objects <e> <s> first it fills the gap which may have been exposed in the law relating to kidnapping <e> <s> secondly it replaces the prolixity of section of the offences against the person act which requires proof of fraud or force <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that i too am not able to support the amendment <e> <s> all age limits are arbitrary but is too low <e> <s> this is a good bill and to reduce the age to would diminish it <e> <s> children do not cease to <e>", "<cs> it seems that this point derives from the definition of abduction which is taking without <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome these clear and constructive amendments <e> <s> this particular amendment really reflects the realities of the position of the court faced with an application to make a consent order <e> <s> i certainly hope that the prescribed information will encourage the parties to reach a consent order having put all their cards on the table face up and so minimise costly attempts to impugn consent orders <e> <s> but certainly this amendment and indeed all the amendments are welcome <e>", "<cs> my lords may i respectfully support this amendment which clearly enhances this bill <e> <s> i speak not only as someone with some experience of criminal law but also as someone who has had the unnerving experience of having to participate in an identification parade <e> <s> surely it is important that a bill which attempts to codify and clarify the law relating to criminal evidence should tackle this sensitive and important area of identification evidence <e> <s> it is notorious that a witnesss belief as to what he or she has seen can become a certainty as to what he or she has seen <e> <s> i suggest that it is particularly important that parliament should provide some basic immutable rules which govern the courts in this difficult area <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been a truly fascinating debate <e> <s> i hope the lawyers have all avoided the temptation to say that these problems are medical and that the scientists have avoided the temptation to say that these problems are all legal <e> <s> but there is as the noble and learned lord lord denning pointed out a legal vacuum <e> <s> your lordships debate has shown that there is no moral vacuum <e> <s> in particular the noble marquess the maiden speaker demonstrated with his clarity of thought and expression what many of your lordships clearly felt <e> <s> my own recent experience of the same ordeal reinforces my congratulations to him <e>", "<cs> my lords as your lordships have all observed the need for reform is clear <e> <s> it is also clear with respect to the noble and learned lord lord cameron that it is not a question of simply overhauling the machinery but a question of rebuilding the machinery as cork in its undiluted form recommended <e> <s> only then can the law deal with the diversity of provisions for corporate and personal insolvency and with the accretion of piecemeal legislation dating back to the last century <e> <s> if the noble and learned lord lord denning finds the present law abstruse it truly must be <e> <s> like him and the noble lord lord hutchinson i endeavour to steer clear of it if i can but i cannot always avoid it <e>", "<cs> your lordships committee has to consider the rival attractions of three versions of clause and i would respectfully say that the governments flexible attitude is welcome <e> <s> your lordships have stated the objections and i shall not repeat them but there is one risk upon which your lordships have not touched and that is the risk that clause in its present form could be used by the unscrupulous as a blackmail weapon <e> <s> the other defect of clause in its present form is that it deals only with the compulsory liquidation <e> <s> the government say that that is a deliberate omission to encourage voluntary <e>", "<cs> we on these benches would also agree with the idea that it would be wrong for past creditors to pay for the protection of possible future creditors <e> <s> the wider public interest involved makes it proper that the public purse should bear the costs where necessary in the circumstances envisaged by this new clause <e> <s> for those reasons we support this amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to your lordships for your observations on this amendment <e> <s> the duties of a receiver to third parties were explained and enhanced by the noble and learned lord lord denning in a case called <e> <s> i think <e>", "<cs> the amendments proposed to clauses and had so far as i was concerned a much narrower intention than the noble lord lord lucas gave me credit for <e> <s> they were really consequential upon the amendment to clause which has now been withdrawn the position being under the bill that a secured creditor who had power to block an administration order by appointing a receiver but chose not to do so and chose not to exercise his power could not then claim the benefit of his security during the administration period <e> <s> that is what the bill provides and that is clearly fair <e>", "<cs> the arguments have all been ventilated and i shall not repeat them <e> <s> apparently we must leave it to esther rantzen but with some disappointment i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for his invitation to study <e> <s> i will not promise to do it tonight <e> <s> i am aware of the subsequent clauses and i question whether they entirely cover the point which was discussed in the cork report on this topic <e> <s> indeed i could question the argument that a clause of this nature would discourage investment in small companies because of course <e>", "<cs> i too should like to support the principle of this amendment <e> <s> in practice it is very important for creditors to know what is going on and to know that as soon as possible <e> <s> the crucial point is that they have the information <e> <s> perhaps the timing is less important although it is equally important that they should have as much information as possible within a stipulated time limit <e> <s> in particular one thinks of employee creditors who have lost their jobs as a result of a liquidation and who need to know where they go from there <e> <s> they need to know whether anything is coming to them and if so how much and when <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord for his indications <e> <s> i am always open to criticism as to my drafting and in view of his comments i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> that is correct <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the governments view <e> <s> i question whether the terms of this amendment would make it more difficult for creditors in practice i doubt that it would <e> <s> the purpose of the amendment is to tighten the already expressed purposes of the clause <e> <s> however this is a complex area and as the noble lord has surmised i would not want to press the amendment now although i may wish to reconsider the matter at a later stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i too support the amendment for all the reasons which have been fully expressed by noble lords who have spoken <e> <s> in anticipation of a possible response from the government i suggest that the proposal would not prevent or limit investment in companies large or small by proprietors of those companies who will continue to enjoy limited liability <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord agree on a purely practical point that it is unsatisfactory to grope around this bill looking for a definition of shadow directors only to find that there is not one <e>", "<cs> we too would welcome the indication from the government and sympathise with the sentiments expressed by the noble and learned lord lord denning <e> <s> one has to remember that this is intended to be a reforming statute and therefore one should start with a clean slate and question the fundamentals which is what the cork committee did <e> <s> one should start therefore from the position that all creditors share equally in the misfortune of being owed money by an insolvent individual or company <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord for his most detailed and helpful reply <e> <s> the intention of the amendment or amendments was not to weaken the rehabilitative provisions of the bankruptcy discharge clauses in this bill but really among other things to deal with the hard core of bad first bankruptcies <e> <s> such bankruptcies are certainly rare as the noble lord has already said nevertheless they are perhaps deserving of special consideration <e> <s> the intention of the amendments was also to take account of the fact that not all second bankruptcies are blameworthy <e> <s> however i am most grateful for the noble lords observations and indeed his concession in respect of at least one amendment <e> <s> having listened carefully to what he has said i of course beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for all those observations <e> <s> i certainly agree with the minister with all the confidence that i can command that the present state of the law is unclear <e> <s> whatever else my amendment or the bill in its present form achieves it achieves certainty <e> <s> at this stage i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful for that indication and for the support which i have received from all quarters of the committee <e> <s> if i may respectfully say so i am particularly grateful for the lucid explanation of the law from the noble and learned lord lord denning <e> <s> this is indeed a very important amendment it is important that we get it right <e> <s> i should be the first to concede that the wording is not perfect and i hasten to exonerate anybody else behind the scenes because it is my wording and perhaps i was not as fresh as a daisy when i drafted it <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord is right that i am indeed disappointed <e> <s> i had hoped that the theory and it is only a theory of crown indivisibility would not prevail as apparently it has not prevailed in the question of crown preference discussed earlier <e>", "<cs> one feature is perhaps welcome that the law of bankruptcy at last catches up with bishops <e>", "<cs> my lords in many respects this bill is more important than the child abduction bill which was passed last year and it is indeed welcome <e> <s> in part that is because if there is one thing worse than child abduction it is international child abduction in part it is because the problem is growing as the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor has said <e> <s> these cases fuel themselves and they fuel the fears and tensions of marital breakdown <e> <s> to consider a case i heard of recently it is hard to imagine anything more chilling than for a mother to return home to find her children have disappeared and then to receive a telephone call from the father saying that they are all in south america <e> <s> the children in these cases will probably already have suffered the trauma of the breakdown of their parents marriage <e> <s> they are then uprooted from all that is familiar and important to them <e> <s> their world is turned upside down and they become strangers in a foreign land <e> <s> however resilient the child that experience must be confusing frightening and in the long term damaging <e>", "<cs> my lords in practice i come across the legal aid charge in matrimonial litigation almost daily <e> <s> i understand the sentiments of this amendment but i do not find it easy to support it in its present form <e> <s> there are cases in which the cake is small enough even if the parties remain married <e> <s> it becomes almost impossibly small when they become divorced even before they start running up the costs of litigation <e> <s> the impact of typical costs of let us say becomes an almost intolerable burden <e> <s> indeed the system under which the legal charge is presently operated does not always allow the court to perform its basic task of meeting the fundamental need of the <e>", "<cs> there were indeed many welcome features in what the noble lord lord lucas had to say but having listened to the noble lord lord bruce i wonder whether we should have brought our running shoes or our sleeping bags this evening <e> <s> your lordships may well have been bewildered by the <e>", "<cs> i take the noble lords point and i shall say no more other than to add that if we are not to have automatic disqualification and one can understand the arguments it is all the more important that we should widen the discretion for disqualification and strengthen the provisions concerned with wrongful trading <e> <s> i have listened with great interest to the proposals put by the noble lord lord lucas and i await with interest the details of them <e>", "<cs> my lords on amendment no <e> <s> i too had hoped that there would be some general guidance as to the considerations which would lead one to consider a director unfit <e> <s> having said that i see from amendment no <e> <s> in the name of the noble lord lord mottistone that there are some very helpful guidelines set out <e> <s> i hope that they or something like them will be accepted <e> <s> i also hope that they are not so clear as to deprive me of too many refreshers <e>", "<cs> briefly i have only one observation to make related to amendment no <e> <s> concerning the proposed upper time limit for disqualification <e> <s> all these time limits are inevitably arbitrary but i recollect that the cork committee recommended an upper limit of years <e> <s> i accept that that would be wholly exceptional and would only deal with the very small hard core of people who were not fit to be let back into the commercial ring for a very long time <e> <s> they would not be prevented from trading but they would be prevented from trading behind a corporate veil <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord permit me to make one point clear <e> <s> i thought i had made it clear that the beauty of clause is that it does not do that <e> <s> it says that the court shall consider the matters listed and that the matters to be considered shall include <e> <s> that does not preclude the consideration of any other relevant matter <e>", "<cs> as regards amendment no <e> <s> surely the noble lord is realy proposing a distinction without a difference <e> <s> the expression ought to is familiar to lawyers and the noble lord lord lucas drew the correct analogy with the law of negligence <e> <s> if i ought to have seen the bus which ran me over then surely also i <e>", "<cs> perhaps i should indicate that when this matter does come forward again we on these benches at last i can use that expression will support the amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may briefly share the reservations expressed by the noble and learned lord <e> <s> it is important to remember that in this country the courts are never bound by the wishes of a child they are just one fact to be taken into account in a custody dispute <e> <s> the weight given to the wishes of the child depends on the age of that child <e> <s> it is also notorious that children in these situations have a number of defence mechanisms <e> <s> either they clam up completely or they express their views in a coded message which it takes the skill of a welfare officer to discern or sadly they feel that they have to express their loyalty to the parent they are with by means of an exaggerated hostility to the other parent <e> <s> one sees that all too often <e> <s> it is a very real and genuine feeling on the part of the child but in fact it is not always representative of what is in its best interests <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for all those observations and indeed for the support i have had <e> <s> i apologise if i inadvertently referred to our not ratifying the convention as a whole <e> <s> we may be ratifying the convention as a whole but we are not seen to be enacting the convention as a whole <e> <s> my first reaction was that of the noble lord lord mishcon that some error had taken place and something had been left out by mistake <e> <s> i would indeed support his suggestion as to an appropriate amendment to clause to which we have been referred <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support this amendment which seems to me to add a valuable clarification to the words of clause and to be an aid to the interpretation of the clause <e> <s> i thought that i had been very quick in spotting that clause referred to reasonable step whereas clause referred simply to step but the noble and learned lord lord denning was ahead of me and i agree with everything that he said <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to echo that remark and in general support any amendment which chips away at crown preference <e> <s> the expression collector taxes is not a term of art <e> <s> i believe that a person who pays and receives vat makes a mistake if he ever regards that money as his own <e> <s> he is only a temporary caretaker of the money and is already a debtor to the government subject to whatever slight set-off he can claim <e> <s> i am told by the noble and learned lord lord denning that i am wrong in that interpretation <e>", "<cs> my lords i support this amendment as a sensible compromise <e> <s> i apologise if i have been the source of an over-simplification <e> <s> the point i was trying to make was that to remove crown preference does not automatically benefit those at the bottom of the ladder <e> <s> it may or may not benefit them depending upon the number and the size of the other secured creditors who are on the middle rungs of the ladder <e> <s> perhaps that is by the by in the context of this amendment <e> <s> it is certainly a sensible amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may join in thanking the noble lord lord lucas and the noble and learned lord the lord advocate for the trouble they have obviously taken in dealing with the enormous number of amendments which have been put forward during the course of the bill <e> <s> i venture to agree that it has been considerably improved during its passage through your lordships house albeit the genesis and progress of this bill have called into some question the whole mechanism of law reform in this country <e> <s> it is a matter of particular regret that the government were not able always to accept the recommendations of the cork committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to support the bill <e> <s> in its present form it will enact some of the least controversial recommendations of the warnock committee <e> <s> since the committee produced its report we have had to grasp a great range of expressions in the field of surrogacy commercial surrogacy domestic surrogacy surrogacy for convenience and last resort surrogacy <e> <s> the report has provoked a public debate but i venture to suggest until <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like respectfully to echo those sentiments from the noble and learned lord <e> <s> i much regret that i was unable to attend the committee stage of the bill but clearly it was a most stimulating debate <e> <s> perhaps i may say also with respect that i admired the restraint of the participants in not pressing their amendments though i suspected and i gather rightly that they were saving their ammunition for a later more broadly based attack <e>", "<cs> my lords may i too welcome these amendments <e> <s> anything which extends geographically the principles and procedures of this legislation must enlarge its usefulness <e> <s> children are abducted to and via the channel islands and other such places where there is sometimes a diluted respect for our laws and it must be in the interests of such children that the practical and legal problems faced by those who try to trace them are minimised <e> <s> in this context i too hope that the government will actively consider legislation in accordance with the law commissions recommendations for the mutual enforcement and recognition of custody orders within all the jurisdictions of the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support this group of amendments <e> <s> the integrity and competence of insolvency practitioners is absolutely vital <e> <s> it is important however that we ensure that insolvency practitioners or the phrase insolvency practitoner is not just an impressive label for an unimpressive package because without competence at ground level the whole edifice of this legislation falls to the ground <e>", "<cs> my lords we are getting in a terrible muddle and i think that we may be amending amendments which have not been moved <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand this amendment it proposes a very serious alteration in the existing law of landlord and tenant and a very serious inroad into the freedom of contract between landlord and tenant which has stood for many years <e> <s> as i anticipate the governments answer notwithstanding the presence or absence of any decided case law the fact of the matter is that the court has power to grant relief from forfeiture <e>", "<cs> my lords i venture with some hesitation simply to add this <e> <s> the noble lord lord <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may echo that <e> <s> i cannot help feeling that we are falling over the words normal reasonable and special and banging our toes in the process <e> <s> if a special payment is required in the sense of an extra payment but it is required as part of the normal terms not only is that reasonable but it seems to me to be in the spirit of what both noble lords wish <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to make further provision with regard to the marriage of <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i must say that i am most grateful to all noble lords who have spoken in the debate and particularly to the most reverend primate the archbishop of york and the right reverend prelate the bishop of ely who explained the wider principles involved and gave a good and clear indication of the position of the bench of bishops that they will support the bill but go no further <e> <s> it is right and i should make it clear for the avoidance of doubt that the bill in its present form will apply not only to people who happen to meet in adult life as almost strangers and come to find that they have an artificial restriction upon their marrying they may know each other very well <e> <s> the important factor is that they should not have formed part of the same family structure during the minority of one of them <e>", "<cs> my lords i read it as a general statement of principle referring to the court in general whatever sort of court it is <e> <s> but i shall of course read the noble lords speech more fully and if necessary correct myself at a later date <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> in fact they do not raise an identical point but a similar point <e> <s> subject to the better view of your lordships committee i would prefer to deal with them separately <e> <s> if that is satisfactory i shall simply speak at this stage to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> these are slight and technical amendments to remove unnecessary potential restriction on the recognition of marriages to be covered by this bill <e>", "<cs> i am very much obliged to the noble and learned lord for his expertise in this matter and <e>", "<cs> i hesitate to intervene at this stage but the noble and learned lord lord denning clearly indicated at second reading that he opposed this bill root and branch <e> <s> of course we all respect his strength of feeling in this regard <e> <s> clearly these amendments are wrecking amendments <e> <s> however naturally the noble and learned lord wants a serious discussion as to whether the law should remain as it is as to whether the law should change at least as far as this bill would allow and the minority of the committee reporting under <e>", "<cs> i resist the amendment on a limited basis <e> <s> if i may explain why that is so i do not want the <e>", "<cs> despite the formidable advocacy of my noble friend lady seear i cannot accept her amendment in this context <e> <s> i am most grateful to the right reverend prelate the bishop of birmingham for his exposition and development of the minority report position and i should like to adopt every word that he said <e>", "<cs> i suspect that that question was directed as much at me as at the bench of bishops <e>", "<cs> we have heard a debate about what i regard as a red herring in the context of this bill the involvement of the court <e> <s> it does not matter what label you put on it <e> <s> it may be a family court it may be some other court but at the end of the day you are asking the court to be involved in deciding whether people should or should not get married <e> <s> as to the defects of that idea i can do no better than refer your lordships to the excellent speech of the noble lord lord boston in one of the earlier debates on th march at col onwards <e>", "<cs> i was grateful to the noble and learned lord for having given me some notice that he would raise this point <e> <s> i hope i can now furnish him with an answer <e> <s> i am told that procedural alterations would be required and they would be very complex <e> <s> it would apparently be very difficult to deal with the challenges that might be created by a marriage proposed under this bill <e> <s> secondly i am told that the rubrics of the <e>", "<cs> my lords before moving on to the amendments in the marshalled list may i thank the noble and learned lord for that indication <e> <s> i welcome the proposed extension of this bill should it become law to scotland <e> <s> i accept that the drafting involved may not be entirely straightforward <e> <s> there are differences in the legislation relating to marriage in scotland and to marriage in england <e> <s> one example which comes to mind is that in england you are only expressly prohibited from marrying your grandmother <e> <s> in scotland they felt it necessary to prevent you from marrying your great-grandmother which says something either about the scottish climate or scottish caution <e> <s> i know not <e> <s> i am grateful for that indication from the noble and learned lord the lord advocate <e> <s> i would hope also having dropped a hint at second reading to repeat that hint now that perhaps it might be felt appropriate and practical to extend this bill to northern ireland as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble viscount and to the noble and learned lord for their observations <e> <s> the difficulties which we have faced with the wording of this particular part of this bill have not been inconsiderable <e> <s> i think that they go to show that reasonable people can differ reasonably about what certain words can mean <e> <s> it is important that we get it right it is important at the end of the day that the words in the bill are a help and not a hindrance to those who have to interpret them <e> <s> whether or not the noble viscount is prepared to give me the indication which was suggested just now i am nevertheless at this stage prepared to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for giving fair warning of these amendments at the committee stage <e> <s> we have been able to consider them long and hard in the intervening period and i should say now that i am prepared entirely to accept the principle of this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords in considering the bill i suggest that it is necessary first to analyse what the act already achieves and then to see what more this bill seeks to do and why <e> <s> the act as it now is cut out the commercial middleman and quite rightly so <e> <s> the reasons for thoroughly opposing any commercial third party element were well ventilated in your lordships debates both on the report of the committee chaired by the noble baroness lady warnock and on the bill as it then was <e> <s> the risk of exploitation by and of the parties involved are all too obvious <e> <s> the act as it stands is widely drawn <e> <s> it catches arrangements with a promise or understanding of any payment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may also respectfully urge noble lords to reject this amendment <e> <s> if the united kingdom is to incorporate the convention it should incorporate the relevant articles in full and that as i understand it is what this bill intends <e> <s> in appropriate cases with if necessary appropriate safeguards the courts at all levels and in all types of proceedings should be able to have regard to and give effect to the convention <e> <s> the courts should be able to consider alleged breaches of the convention and provide remedies where deserved <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to all noble lords who have ventured to support the amendments <e> <s> as the noble and learned lord lord simon said this is indeed a last chance to get it right <e> <s> i hope that this amendment does get it right <e> <s> the noble and learned lord is also correct in saying that it is a compromise <e> <s> there is now in a sense a dual test <e> <s> i was anxious to accommodate those who suggested as the minimum age for the type of marriage in question without redefining the concept of child of the family <e>", "<cs> my lords i too accept the amendments both in principle and as they are drafted <e>", "<cs> my lords i simply accept these amendments with gratitude and indeed i accept the explanation for the amendments given by the noble and learned lord <e> <s> though my heart may be in the highlands my knowledge of the law is firmly south of the border <e> <s> i thank the noble and learned lord for these amendments which of course bring scotland into line under this bill <e> <s> i should also like to thank those responsible for the extensive drafting involved <e>", "<cs> i hesitate to interrupt the noble and learned lord but i did not speak to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i did not do so deliberately because although on the marshalled list amendments nos <e> <s> and appear in my name in fact they <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords may i briefly thank all noble lords who have spoken both this evening and throughout the passage of the bill <e> <s> it is i hope a useful bill with its origin in the report <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may now return your lordships to consideration of the family law bill <e> <s> i should like to join in thanking the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for his detailed introduction to this bill which is indeed a complex but important measure <e> <s> part i of the bill is most welcome <e> <s> it introduces overdue reform in the area of recognition and enforcement of child custody and related orders within the national jurisdictions of the united kingdom <e> <s> it is the unadulterated product of a law commission report and indeed complements recent legislation in relation to child abduction <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i shall be acquitted of impertinence for venturing to participate in this debate in which so many noble and learned lords and elegant leaders of the bar are taking part <e> <s> my only excuse for so doing is that as someone who endeavours to hack a living on the less rarified lower slopes of the law i can at least declare an interest in the outcome of anything concerning barristers legal aid fees <e> <s> i hasten to join with the noble lord lord elystan-morgan in conveying to your lordships the deep and continuing concern of the junior bar in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords we must thank and congratulate the noble baroness lady lane-fox for introducing the bill to your lordships house and for her exposition of it <e> <s> indeed we must also congratulate the honourable member for westbury mr dennis walters for his skill and tenacity in taking the bill through another place <e>", "<cs> i support this amendment <e> <s> on second reading noble lords on all sides were <e>", "<cs> i do not intend to press the motion that clause should not stand part <e> <s> indeed i should like to say that i am particularly grateful to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor

lord that i speak i am sure for the whole family bar when i say that we would hate to be deprived of the pleasure of litigating against his daughter <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord ennals for his authoritative support for the amendment <e> <s> i must admit that i am a little disappointed at the governments response although i appreciate the welcome of the noble baroness for the spirit of the amendment <e> <s> i venture to suggest that the new clause would not have imposed an onerous duty on a local authority and would simply have provided a general framework <e> <s> but as the noble baroness reminded us there is an excellent precedent in the lambeth model which shows what can be done and such procedure can be successfully set up <e> <s> we shall have to await the white paper <e> <s> she will understand that this is no more than a probing amendment <e> <s> i have no wish to overburden or to jeopardise the bill <e> <s> i beg to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> surely the answer to the question of the noble baroness lady trumpington is yes in circumstances in which the father is a ship passing in the night and the grandparents are potential mainstays for the child in question <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as i am concerned the noble and learned lord has certainly bought good-will with these amendments <e> <s> we are grateful for the amendments which remove any doubt as to the extent of the powers given under clause <e> <s> at the committee stage the noble and learned lord vigorously removed most of the misgivings and many of the misapprehensions about clause and we were also grateful for that <e> <s> nevertheless misgivings will perhaps remain at least until we in fact see the rules under clause in operation <e> <s> but it would not be right to debate the matter further and it would certainly not be right to delay the passage of this otherwise very useful bill <e>", "<cs> i would venture to suggest that my amendment no <e> <s> could stand whatever happens to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> is concerned with parliamentary power to amend what might in itself be an amending statutory instrument <e> <s> it is really on a different point altogether <e>", "<cs> i had a small bet with myself that somebody would mention the government of burma act and indeed in the same year there was a government of india act so both were right <e> <s> one has to keep a sense of proportion about subordinate legislation <e> <s> in many respects it is a necessary evil <e> <s> but what i have proposed in this amendment is not unprecedented <e> <s> there is a fairly respectable list of acts which have conferred on parliament a power to amend <e> <s> it fell into disuse not because it was a bad procedure but because it was potentially inconvenient to the executive arm of government <e>", "<cs> my lords i join in welcoming this important piece of law reform one which is none the worse for its swift birth after a long gestation period if that is not an inappropriate phrase to use in this context <e> <s> it is the result of many years of debate <e> <s> the law commission produced its working paper and two very thorough reports <e> <s> it is reassuring to know that even the law commission can have second thoughts especially second thoughts prompted by the scottish law commissions work on the same topic <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether in moving this amendment the noble lord considered why the bill as expressed limits the direction to parties to the proceedings <e> <s> the position is that a blood test is an infringement of a liberty and when a piece of litigation ensues in which somebodys paternity is in question it is often part of the game and i speak as someone who has conducted affiliation and paternity proceedings of one kind or another over a number of years to allege a number of other candidates for paternity <e> <s> sometimes there is quite a formidable list and quite an extensive inquiry has to be undertaken <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may take up one point of the noble and learned lord lord denning that is the position of the husband who makes the considered decision with his wife to agree to her undergoing artificial insemination by a donor and agrees with her to take on the full responsibilities of parenthood for the child which she is to bear <e> <s> the husband presumably makes that decision in the knowledge of the practical and legal consequences <e> <s> i suggest that it <e>", "<cs> i simply suggest that when a man enters into a considered decision to take on the responsibilities of parenthood it would be quite unfair to the child and the mother to allow him to repudiate that agreement at some time after the event <e>", "<cs> i oppose this amendment <e> <s> one of the great advantages of the second thoughts that the law commission had in its second report was that it withdrew the awful expressions marital and non-marital which seem to me to have little more to commend them than the expression love child used by the sunday newspapers <e>", "<cs> my lords i was only going to say that again the noble lord lord kilbracken has given a great deal of thought to this <e> <s> certainly on one reading of clause as drafted it might be thought and this is certainly my interpretation of it as a humble lawyer that it was necessary for the person alleged to be the father or mother to be already a party to the proceedings <e> <s> i think that is implicit in the words at the end of clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for his sympathy <e> <s> i had hoped to push him a little further down the delicate path he described himself as having trodden <e> <s> this bill has the intention of providing a broad framework for children who are born after the bill becomes law <e> <s> science is not standing still <e> <s> as always the law must try to catch up <e> <s> i of course accept what the noble and learned lord says <e> <s> it may mean that there will have to be amendments to the bill at a later stage possibly after we have considered further legislation resulting from the warnock report <e> <s> however with a certain degree of reluctance i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i urge your lordships to allow clause to stand <e> <s> indeed i hope that it is a clause which sets a precedent <e> <s> i remind your lordships that the bill in general and this clause in particular is concerned with the welfare of children <e> <s> it provides a legal framework only and it attempts to remove unnecessary legal disabilities <e> <s> the law commission recognised that it ought to tackle aid and aid children but again only in the context of providing a legal framework <e>", "<cs> my lords with all respect to the noble and learned lord i question what his amendment adds <e> <s> he prefaces the amendment with the expression unless the contrary intention appears <e> <s> a contrary intention does appear in clause which deals with aid cases <e> <s> clause deems the consenting husband of the mother to be the lawful father of the child produced by the process of artificial insemination by third party donor <e> <s> in most of those cases the natural father will be an unknown donor <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord is right <e> <s> there is a rule preventing manuscript amendments being put forward on third reading <e> <s> i do not understand the rule and if we can waive it today so much the better <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble and learned lord in inviting your lordships not to accept the amendment <e> <s> it raises serious questions <e> <s> it is important in a civilised society that we should have a reliable system for the registration of births but it is also now recognised that it is terribly important to most of us if not all that we should know something of our roots <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord seeks in the amendment to introduce two new elements in clause compulsory counselling and clear positive evidence of unconditional consent <e> <s> in a sense he is seeking to introduce what already happens as a matter of practice <e> <s> to some extent therefore it might be asked why not make it a matter of law <e> <s> equally it can be said that it is not necessary because almost certainly it happens in every case in any event <e>", "<cs> my lords surely this amendment is premature <e> <s> it is right that the warnock committee recommended a statutory licensing body but there is no certainty that it will in fact come into existence <e> <s> it is simply one of the options <e> <s> the consultation paper <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may join in saying that this was a good bill when it was introduced into your lordships house and it remains a good bill after its passage <e> <s> i should like also to join in paying tribute to the noble lord lord kilbracken for the <e>", "<cs> my lords in the unavoidable absence of my noble friend lord wigoder i should like to join in thanking the noble earl for his detailed introduction of this important order <e> <s> i would also wish to join in paying tribute to the noble viscount lord colville of culross for his report on the operation of the act during <e> <s> as one would expect from the brief opportunity i have had to study it the report is a lucid and stimulating document which provides clear guidance to this house and also perhaps more importantly in this context to the government <e> <s> i would certainly join in asking that the government pay particular attention to the call for rationalisation in the final paragraphs of the report under the heading broader considerations <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to express gratitude at the introduction of these regulations by the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor <e> <s> i suppose that i must declare an interest as a beneficiary of the legal aid scheme as a lawyer not yet as a litigant i hasten to add <e> <s> redrawing the upper limit of legal aid eligibility is always important because it affects the marginal cases those people of modest means who require advice and assistance who are often taxpayers themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords as has already been said this is a very disparate bill and at second reading one must be selective about what one says particularly at this stage of the evening when everything one wanted to say has already been said and said much better <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we should all like to thank the noble lord lord gisborough for the introduction of this important bill and his careful explanation of it <e> <s> shortly after the falklands war a friend of mine who served as a doctor in the army medical services described to me the circumstances of three soldiers who were lying in adjacent beds in the hospital in woolwich <e> <s> one had been on duty in an open vehicle travelling along a road in germany <e> <s> an unlit french tank came in the opposite direction with its barrel pointing to the side into the roadway rather than straight ahead <e> <s> the barrel caught the british soldier whose neck was broken and who was rendered tetraplegic <e> <s> that soldier would receive a disability pension and what i think is still called the war pension but would have no lump sum <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend lord mcgregor for his perseverance and ultimate success in securing a debate on this topic <e> <s> the motion has been awaiting the ballot for debate for such a long time that it encourages one to hang on to ones premium bonds <e>", "<cs> i am not entirely satisfied although i am grateful to the noble earl the minister for his undertaking to look at the matter to the extent he has indicated <e> <s> of course rape is a peculiarly horrifying and brutal offence but it is not alone in the canon of horrifying and brutal offences <e> <s> indeed i thought i indicated one or two which might be considered to be on a par <e> <s> the fact is if one seeks to compare the trauma undergone by a victim of rape with the trauma of the victim of incest or buggery it is perhaps hard to draw any logical distinction <e>", "<cs> i oppose this amendment <e> <s> the anonymity of defendants in rape cases was not a recommendation of the heilbron committee as i understand it <e> <s> it was added in the words of the noble and learned lord lord hailsham during the passage of the act by a male chauvinist pig committee stage in another place <e> <s> it is not a logical comparison to say that because the victims are entitled to anonymity so should the defendants <e> <s> the correct comparison is between the defendants in rape cases and the defendants in others cases <e> <s> defendants in other cases are not entitled to anonymity and there is no logical reason why defendants in rape cases should be singled out <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble earl said in introducing the motion the problems here are problems of scale <e> <s> nobody knows that better than lawyers <e> <s> perhaps i should include the noble viscount lord dilhorne in that category as he plods to remote county courts conscienciously carrying all the law that is or might be relevant to a typical case say under the rent acts and arrives at the other end with one arm much longer than the other <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel that i should begin by declaring an interest as a lawyer who receives income from the legal aid fund as it is presently constituted <e> <s> the immediate problem with the bill is that it contains no clear statements of principle or of purpose <e> <s> the explanatory memorandum and the long title contain bland statements to the effect that the bill revises arrangements for legal aid <e> <s> clause launches straight into definitions and much of the bill simply provides enabling powers for as yet unseen subordinate legislation <e> <s> one has only to look at clause to see expressions such as regulations may specify regulations may provide regulations may prescribe and the lord chancellor may <e>", "<cs> my lords this brief and clear bill deserves a welcome <e> <s> it attempts to deal with the mischief of the landlord who delays either through dilatoriness or for tactical reasons <e> <s> if a tenant keeps his side of the bargain by asking for consent in the proper way it ought to be incumbent upon the landlord to give his answer within a reasonable time <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment <e> <s> i hope that the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor does not feel that the duty such as it is which would be imposed on him by the amendment would be too great a burden <e>", "<cs> perhaps it will assist at this stage if i indicate that in the expectation that amendment no <e> <s> will be moved as well as amendment no <e> <s> and in the hope that they will find some support i do not intend to move amendments nos <e> <s> and at this stage <e> <s> i hope also that as amendment no <e> <s> provides a place will be found on the board and indeed in the bill for a barrister member <e>", "<cs> i am sorry but would the noble lord repeat the subsections to which he was referring <e>", "<cs> i hope that i am not making anything mandatory <e> <s> it is subject to the approval of the lord chancellor and it is therefore intended that committees should not have to be set up in every area but only in those of which the lord chancellor approves as suitable for such committees <e> <s> they certainly will provide positive assistance to the hoard in such areas <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord irvine of lairg for his support <e> <s> this amendment was intended to provide a precise and useful requirement albeit in a hybrid form as the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor has put it to the benefit of both the board and the public on the basis that local committees know what is best required in their individual areas <e> <s> i am reassured by the indication of the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor that the power under clause b can be used to provide grounds for committees if that seems appropriate <e>", "<cs> with respect perhaps i may take up that last point and support it <e> <s> this is an important amendment <e> <s> i suggest that the extension of legal aid in some form or other to tribunals would be valuable and possibly cost-effective <e> <s> i have some experience of industrial tribunal cases <e> <s> i suggest that to enable legal representation in more cases certainly before industrial tribunals would lead to more cases being settled or abandoned when they are utterly hopeless as indeed far too many of them are <e>", "<cs> my lords the report of the committee under the chairmanship of the noble baroness lady warnock started in effect by recognising that most people want limits of some sort and that doctors and scientists involved in these areas themselves want some measure of certainty <e> <s> indeed they are entitled to a measure of certainty <e> <s> they are entitled to a workable legal framework and the time is approaching for the law to provide it <e>", "<cs> it would be most helpful if the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor indicated the areas envisaged under subsection and the persons envisaged under subsection <e> <s> as regards the areas which might be excluded under subsection i wonder whether it is intended or expected that there would be an abrogation of the rule that under a legal aid certificate solicitors can and indeed must complete the conveyancing work necessary to put a court order into effect <e> <s> that is commonly the position after a matrimonial property case <e> <s> likewise as to subsection what category of person is envisaged <e> <s> clearly it is a matter of concern to the committee before making up its mind on this amendment <e>", "<cs> i agree that the amendments do not deal with the nub of the problem as it particularly affects matrimonial litigation <e> <s> as has been indicated in some respects matrimonial litigants are in a better position than other legally aided litigants <e> <s> they have a exemption if what they receive is simply cash <e> <s> if they receive a dwelling-house the operation of the charge is suspended <e> <s> in effect that can be an open-ended interest-free loan secured by the charge which they can carry over to a substituted property <e> <s> a matrimonial litigation is expensive <e> <s> it involves an area of the law which is discretionary <e> <s> investigation into finances even in the simplest cases can be quite <e>", "<cs> i wish to express an opinion on this matter from the point of view of an advocate rather than a judge <e> <s> if the noble and learned lord is correct it is not only extremely difficult for the judge to decide whether the financial hardship is severe it is very difficult to persuade a court that financial hardship is severe <e> <s> it is very easy to demonstrate financial hardship but very difficult to persuade a court that it is severe <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment and in so doing declare an interest as someone who is in receipt of legal aid from his professional practice <e>", "<cs> of course i accept the noble and learned lords point <e> <s> i shall not dwell further on clause save only to say that there is concern about it <e> <s> as the noble and learned lord has said that is reflected in future amendments therefore i will not anticipate those <e>", "<cs> very briefly i support the amendment in the interests of retaining control by the courts for each of the three broad reasons advanced by the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones <e> <s> like him i am somewhat comforted to know that there will now be an affirmative resolution procedure in these matters <e>", "<cs> in supporting the amendment i suggest that the widgery criteria enshrine important factors <e> <s> i know that the bar considers that the widgery criteria should be expressly preserved in this way <e> <s> the exclusion of the criteria would give the competent authority under the bill an unfettered discretion particularly so if clause stands as has been agreed under the previous amendment <e>", "<cs> to say that there may be an appeal procedure is thoroughly uninformative and unsatisfactory <e> <s> i support the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> all these matters are on that side of the borderline which i suggest would require affirmative resolution <e>", "<cs> i support this important amendment <e> <s> it is important that those who think that this is just a lawyers bill talked about by lawyers should know that the amendment has the authoritative support of the noble lord lord benson <e> <s> those who consider that this is a matter of so-called special pleading by lawyers as distinct from other publicly paid bodies should note that it is only the lawyers who are a publicly paid profession without the kind of advisory committee proposed in the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment <e> <s> it is not clear what exclusions are envisaged in subsections and of clause <e> <s> it must remain a concern that those matters are not spelt out <e> <s> the fact is that flexibility can be misused and if we cannot have the principles clearly stated on the face of the bill then there should be some mechanism for governing the powers as proposed in the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i also wish to support the amendment <e> <s> the argument put forward by the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor in committee was that the problems of the unassisted party who succeeds against a legally aided litigant should diminish in numerical terms with the power to be given by the bill <e> <s> that would enable the unassisted potential opponent to make representations to the board at the stage when the granting of legal aid is being considered <e> <s> as the noble and learned lord lord ackner has illustrated that seems to be a two-edged argument <e> <s> if the board rejects the view of the unassisted party and grants legal aid to someone who then goes on to fail before the court in the face of the opposition of the potential opponent the unassisted opponent must have an additional grievance under the proposed system <e> <s> his grievance can only be increased if he is told that although he has suffered hardship he can have no redress against the legal aid authorities because he cannot demonstrate that his hardship is sufficiently severe <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with those last words <e> <s> speaking for myself any loss is appreciable <e> <s> the hardship caused by the present law arises from the use of the word severe and the difficulty in proving severe hardship as distinct from ordinary hardship <e> <s> if the word severe was removed a great deal of the injustice which has been talked about would be eradicated <e>", "<cs> my lords although it is right to say that there are distinctions between practitioners who receive fees and those who receive salaries and therefore have the benefit of advisory committees many legal practitioners dependent upon legal aid work receive a fee that is finite it has a ceiling upon it and their livelihood has a ceiling upon it <e> <s> they are therefore not really in an equivalent position to practitioners who enjoy privately-paid work <e> <s> they are in a position equivalent to those receiving salaries without the security of those who have salaried employment <e> <s> it is for that reason among others that i believe the proposed committee would be so useful <e>", "<cs> my lords although improved the bill remains as the noble and learned lord <e> <s> lord elwyn-jones said essentially an enabling bill which confers wide powers and promises a great mass of as yet unseen regulations <e> <s> throughout the bills passage that state of affairs and method of legislation has been justified by the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor in the name of flexibility <e> <s> therefore the concern must remain that such flexible and wide powers could be used or misused in the future in ways that are restrictive of the legal aid service that is restrictive of the availability of legal aid or restrictive of the type of representations to be made available <e> <s> i hope that those fears are misplaced <e>", "<cs> my lords we owe a debt to the law commissions for the thought that has clearly gone into this bill <e> <s> indeed the shortness of the bill reflects the conclusions of the law commissions that comprehensive legislation was not called for in areas in which the law was either developing or had already developed satisfactorily <e> <s> my only regret is that it did not touch upon the bewildering topic of the law relating to marriages on ships which i have never understood and simply brings to my mind humphrey bogart on the african queen <e>", "<cs> my lords any adjustment in the financial eligibility for legal aid needs careful scrutiny <e> <s> the upper financial limits should remind us that legal aid is a service not just for the poor but also for those of moderate means people who pay taxes and who will expect to make an assessed contribution to the legal aid fund <e> <s> we should also remember the force of the statement in the report of the royal commission on legal services under the chairmanship of the noble lord lord benson in which it is said that an upper limit of eligibility is inevitably arbitrary and may operate unfairly on persons who fall just above the line <e> <s> people in that marginal position may be forced to abandon their legal rights and in personal injury cases in particular it can mean that instead of recovering the damages to which they would be entitled they become a burden upon the state and upon other taxpayers <e>", "<cs> i wish to support the intentions underlying amendments nos <e> <s> and which i <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl sits down is he saying that the governments view is that there is some information held by social workers which is sensitive and therefore should be protected and that there is some other category of information held by social workers which is to be regarded as not of a sensitive nature and should therefore not be protected <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful for the support i have received for this modest amendment especially for the point made by the noble lord lord monson <e> <s> he indicated as indeed i think a lawyer would that reasonable people can differ reasonably as to what is reasonable <e> <s> nevertheless that is not a reason for not including the words in the bill <e> <s> frankly i am most concerned that the government feel because their advice is to the effect that this is governed by the <e>", "<cs> the simple fact is that the availability of the electoral register to the registration officer for the purposes of the community charge will be a deterrent to electoral registration <e> <s> i suggest that that is not a flimsy supposition it is a fact <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter that in many ways the idea that people will not register to vote because they will be tempted in that way to try to avoid the charge is not a particularly attractive or credible proposition <e> <s> i emphasise the phrase try to avoid the charge because of course the charge may be enforced against them in other ways <e> <s> but the fact is and it is a cynical fact that we must consider people as they will behave and as they are likely to behave not as they ought to behave <e>", "<cs> i am reminded by my noble friend that he deleted their names not the people <e> <s> they were <e>", "<cs> the fact is that the minister said that the example that i cited only went to show what misconceptions there still were about the workings of this bill and how it will work <e> <s> if there are misconceptions i am bound to comment that it must be the fault of the government <e> <s> but in the real world parents will feel liable to pay for their children who are coming up to the age of <e> <s> in practice in the real world they will all be paying out of the same family budget <e>", "<cs> i may say that i am not consciously speaking to those amendments <e> <s> the amendments to which i am speaking are concerned purely and simply with the question of whether or not the register can be copied or sold and used by commercial organisations <e> <s> i am not sure that the matter is covered by amendment no <e> <s> e but if so i wish to cover the same ground <e>", "<cs> so be it <e> <s> the amendments standing in my name are particularly concerned to prevent the sale or other commercial use of the register <e> <s> there is a very genuine worry that under the bill a power may be given to the registration officer to sell the register to outside organisations quite unconnected with the collection of the community charge <e>", "<cs> dealing with the last point first it will not be expressly stated on the register but the ethnic origins of any household may well be apparent simply by looking at the name <e> <s> it is not my foremost argument i hasten to say <e>", "<cs> the noble earl is right <e> <s> it was not made clear that amendment no <e> <s> was not being moved having already been spoken to <e>", "<cs> in support of the spirit of this amendment surely the bill should make it clear if it is not entirely clear whether a day means a period of hours or whether it means the hours of daylight <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may briefly support this amendment <e> <s> women and it is usually women who are in those refuges are not there by choice <e> <s> they do not wish to stay there a moment longer than they have to but very often they are at the lowest ebb in their lives <e> <s> it would be a humane gesture by the government to accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to deal with a point made by the noble lord lord renton <e> <s> if a code of practice was not needed in some form or other i doubt that the government would have indicated in committee that they were in the process of cooperating with the data protection registrar in preparing a code of practice for the purposes of registration officers <e> <s> i understood the government to be saying that in committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to speak to my amendments nos <e> <s> and and join with the noble lord lord mcintosh in suggesting that amendment no <e> <s> would make better sense if it incorporated amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> therefore it would read in the way that the noble lord lord mcintosh described namely that the regulations should provide that the registration officer may not supply a copy of the register to any person <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey withdraws the amendment and since i shall probably not be here tomorrow formally to move the crucial amendments nos <e> <s> and perhaps i may add my thanks to the minister and the government <e>", "<cs> i hesitate to intervene <e> <s> however i believe that the noble lord lord trafford is under a misconception if he thinks that the landlord will automatically be taking on not just the tenant himself but the wife or the mistress or the lover of the tenant or whoever he or she may bring into occupation <e> <s> he speaks as though when the relationship breaks down and the tenant leaves the landlord has no right to be heard at all in the following proceedings which would enable the tenancy to be transferred under the matrimonial homes act the matrimonial causes act or the new family law reform act <e> <s> that is a misconception <e> <s> the established rules of the court provide that in such circumstances the landlord is notified of the application and has the right to be heard as a fully competent party before the court <e>", "<cs> as i understand the obligation in the amendment it is simply to give notice to the other possible occupier <e> <s> however if i am wrong perhaps i shall be corrected <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to all members of the committee who have spoken on the amendment and for the authoritative albeit qualified support of the noble lord lord jenkin <e> <s> i am glad he survived both his pupillage and his harassment however that should be correctly pronounced <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful for the noble earls quick response and for his open mind <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> in view of that response i venture to think that perhaps the protection from eviction act may need to be improved <e> <s> i was endeavouring to close what i perceived as a loophole bearing in mind that if it is reproduced in a criminal statute a criminal statute will be construed in favour of the defendant <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister agree that the reason lenders are not deterred and <e>", "<cs> my lords concentrating on amendment no <e> <s> i suggest that this amendment is useful in replacing the awkward word calculated <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the government for taking up the point which i raised in committee <e> <s> it should provide an encouragement to landlords to repent even if that comes at the fifty-ninth minute of the eleventh hour <e> <s> i am very grateful <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to the noble lord he suggested that this would enable the landlord to avoid all liability <e> <s> i do not understand that to be the position <e> <s> he will avoid liability for the particular form of punitive damages arising under the bill <e> <s> he will not avoid liability for ordinary compensatory damages for example if he drags matters out <e> <s> the more he drags matters out the more compensation he will have to pay as he would in any other case <e> <s> he simply avoids one particular category of damages <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that the government have introduced a measure of flexibility and discretion into this part of the bill <e> <s> but it will still expose both landlords and tenants to potentially expensive and complicated litigation <e> <s> however i believe that some measure of balance has been restored <e> <s> nevertheless i repeat the point which i made in committee a point which in some ways would meet many of the arguments of the noble lord lord mcintosh <e> <s> that point is that the bill is deficient in this area because the whole question of aggravated or punitive damages for tenants would almost certainly not have to arise if the government had grasped the nettle and given the courts an express power to reinstate unlawfully evicted tenants <e> <s> however that has not been done but the amendment improves what was hitherto in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords while i accept that last point to some extent the fact is that the government appear to recognise that there is a device of sham agreements for holiday lets but at the same time are not doing enough to close the loophole <e> <s> it was to deal for example with the bogus holiday lets on a successive basis that this amendment included a maximum period for any such genuine holiday because it is absolutely right that the exclusion provided by clause should only cover genuine holidays <e> <s> evasion will continue <e>", "<cs> that must be right <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful for the noble earls response and i accept his invitation <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches are also grateful to the noble and learned lord for his explanation of this bill <e> <s> your lordships may have heard it somewhat cynically observed that children cannot be too careful in their choice of parents <e> <s> we should realise that parliament cannot be too careful in legislating to protect children from the difficulties which children do absolutely nothing to create <e>", "<cs> my lords i intend to speak only about the operation of the consumer credit act and how it affects the most hard-pressed debtors <e> <s> the forerunner of that act was of course the crowther report which looked at the whole matter of modern consumer credit in its widest context <e> <s> it echoed j k galbraith when he stated what we now realise to be the obvious <e> <s> he wrote that consumer demand comes to depend more and more upon the ability and willingness of consumers to incur debt <e> <s> he pointed out that advertising and emulation which create demand operate both on those who can afford to incur debt and on those who cannot <e> <s> that is the price we pay for a higher standard of living <e> <s> however there is also a price to be paid for example as a result of increasing house values <e> <s> houses cease to be seen as homes but are portrayed as a source of cash <e> <s> that is a very dangerous trend <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to noble lords for their support in this debate at least of the sentiment underlying this amendment <e> <s> accept that the wording of the amendment leaves something to be desired and if i come back to the matter at a later stage it will be with improved wording <e>", "<cs> this amendment begs the question of when a child has sufficient understanding to make an informed decision <e> <s> i understand the noble baroness to have made a conscious decision to leave out any specific age as is sometimes done in other jurisdictions <e> <s> however the amendment assumes that the child will reach an age when it can think as an intelligent adult <e> <s> it must be recognised and it is recognised in practice that the wishes of the child and the best interests of the child do not always coincide <e> <s> that is why the wishes of even teenage children are not conclusive in these cases <e> <s> it is well recognised that children can form an exaggerated hostility to one parent sometimes consciously or unconsciously instilled by the other parent <e> <s> when one arrives at what the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale described as an invincible repugnance there have been cases where the court comes to question the suitability of the parent who has instilled that repugnance however much the child says that he or she wishes to remain with that parent <e>", "<cs> i wonder what this amendment adds to the existing power of a court and to the power which is preserved in the bill to invite the assistance of a welfare officer who will report to a court <e> <s> in every case a welfare officer is the ears and eyes of the court and can speak to the child and transmit the wishes of the child to the court <e> <s> he can also speak to the school obtain school reports and so on <e> <s> i wonder what this amendment suggests in practice <e>", "<cs> the problem touched upon seems to me to be aggravated by subsection which provides that <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for that invervention by the noble and learned lord <e> <s> obviously it struck me that the answer might be found in the word solely but even so that there was some room for further clarification of the bill in that respect <e> <s> therefore i join in asking the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor not entirely to cease consideration of this point <e> <s> i suggest that it will make the clarity of clause that much greater <e> <s> there is a potential for some measure of confusion particularly by those who wish there to be confusion in these matters <e> <s> one can think of the unreasonable parent who on finding that an adoption order has been made transferring all responsibilities for the child away to the adopters latches on to clause and <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble and learned lord will confirm that this provision derives from the common law prohibition on selling children <e> <s> as he said it was restated in the children act <e> <s> the importance of this provision in the bill may well be in relation to formal surrogacy arrangements and things of that kind which the law should intend to discourage <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for that response <e> <s> of course i accept that in the situations i described there are other options open to deal with the situation <e> <s> however i should have thought that the purpose of the amendment was to add a measure of consistency to the law and not to rule out the choice of guardianship in such circumstances if considered appropriate <e> <s> of course that is not to say that the court would grant the appointment of a guardian in those circumstances because it still has a discretion whether or not to make that order <e>", "<cs> surely the answer to this amendment is the practical one which has just been mentioned <e> <s> in an ideal world whenever arrangements for children have to be considered in court there would be a welfare officers report to assist the court <e> <s> but to impose a mandatory requirement for a welfare officers report in every case would place an impossible burden upon the welfare officers to the detriment of those cases where the welfare officers report is needed and needed quickly <e>", "<cs> very briefly i wish to support the amendment wholeheartedly because of my experience of a wardship case in which i was involved only last week <e> <s> the only outside agency in the circumstances of the case in which the child was suffering at the hands of very inadequate parents was the nspcc <e> <s> the grandparents became involved and there was an all-round family dispute <e> <s> the nspcc produced swift perceptive and very valuable reports which enabled everybody to reach agreement and more importantly to reach the right solution <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble and learned lord for his offer to consider the matter <e> <s> on that basis i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> that last indication from the noble lord lord mottistone encourages me to take the same position <e> <s> i must say that i am most grateful for the support that i have received in respect of the amendment <e> <s> moreover like the noble lord lord mottistone i am somewhat disappointed at the response to it <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment <e> <s> the contact order replaces the access order which is familiar to the courts <e> <s> at present there is a distinction which is clearly understood by lawyers and parties to the litigation between visiting access and staying access <e> <s> the bill should make it clear that that distinction is preserved and that the court is empowered to make a contact order of either variety <e>", "<cs> this was in the nature of a probing amendment <e> <s> i dispute the argument that in all circumstances an application after one year would be premature <e> <s> as the noble lord has just said one year can be a very long time in the lifetime of a child <e>", "<cs> i accept that this is a balancing exercise <e> <s> i am encouraged that the noble and learned lord has expressed the view which i share that there is a danger in over-limiting the categories of people who can apply <e> <s> i am encouraged to know that in a sense he regards the provisions of the bill as simply a starting point from which the position can be expanded <e>", "<cs> with great respect to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor surely proposed application does not mean the application for leave because if one looks back to subsection a it is clear that a proposed application means a proposed application for the order under clause rather than the proposed application for leave to apply for an order under clause <e> <s> nevertheless the point made by the noble and learned lord must be right in the sense that an application itself can be disruptive to a childs life <e> <s> that is what the court must consider when deciding whether to grant leave <e>", "<cs> yes or course <e> <s> that situation is provided for in the bill by means of the contact order <e> <s> the noble baroness may remember the amendment which was accepted yesterday whereby the terms of a contact order under clause were extended to permit a child not only to visit the person named in the order but also to stay with the person named in the order <e>", "<cs> i have to say that i am disappointed <e> <s> the amendment is to deal with a relatively rare state of affairs as we all acknowledge <e> <s> it is also to deal with the possibility that these arrangements may become less rare <e> <s> i am very grateful for the support i have received throughout the debate in your lordships committee on the amendment <e> <s> no one seems to have questioned the principles stated in it <e> <s> of course the checklist appears at the beginning of the bill <e> <s> and the amendment as i sought to explain seeks to supplement the checklist in order to deal with the specific principles which should be considered <e> <s> it is not a question of dictating to the court what it should do simply what it might particularly want to consider given a certain state of affairs <e>", "<cs> in answer to that particular point that seems to me to fit more easily with the contact order rather than the residence order <e> <s> it is a form of access in present terms <e> <s> it is what at present we describe as weekend staying access <e> <s> but to return to the particular point with which i am dealing at the moment i am still a little upset that the noble and learned lord having described the amendment as a complication went on to describe it in his last remarks as an obstacle <e> <s> the intention was not to create an obstacle but simply to highlight particular considerations and to enlarge upon particular considerations which may be found in the checklist in particular unusual circumstances which the court may have to deal with <e> <s> but he has given me a fair indication that i might put forward an amendment to the checklist in due course on report <e> <s> i shall take the noble and learned lord up on that and on that basis i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> leaving aside for the moment the question of removal from the united kingdom it is inconceivable that a court would change a childs surname against the wishes of that child <e> <s> it is usually the other way round it is usually the child who wishes to have his or her surname changed so that at school he or she has the same name as stepbrothers or half brothers <e> <s> that is the usual reason <e> <s> in those circumstances it is a question of whether or not the childs wishes are complied with <e> <s> it seems inconceivable that a change could be made against the childs wishes <e>", "<cs> i do not feel very strongly about the matter <e> <s> i look forward to the litigation that will be engendered <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> of course i shall do that <e> <s> i do not intend to encumber the bill in any way <e> <s> i do not think it matters terribly whether what i have suggested or something similar goes in the bill or in the rules of court <e> <s> what is important is that on the face of any court order the terms on which general leave to remove a child for a given period is to be granted under the provisions of this bill are clearly stated <e> <s> it is in a sense a detail but an important one <e>", "<cs> in order to introduce consistency it may be necessary to make a consequential amendment to the matrimonial causes act <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i agree with the noble lord lord renton <e> <s> clause replaces the supervision order which has been familiar to practitioners for many years <e> <s> it introduces the requirement of consent <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord that that requirement introduces a weakness into the provision of the bill <e> <s> i believe that it is wrong to prevent the court from making a supervision order whatever one chooses to call it simply because the parents will not consent <e> <s> the more unreasonably they withhold their consent or withdraw it the more the court may believe that the family needs a degree of supervision or assistance <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for that indication <e> <s> will the noble and learned lord examine the possibility of giving power to relax or waive the conditions in circumstances which do not necessarily involve the wholesale reassessment of the means of those concerned <e>", "<cs> i support the intention behind the amendment <e> <s> it provides a shorter definition which in itself is beneficial <e> <s> it seems valuable in that it concentrates on the effect rather than the nature of the disability <e>", "<cs> we wish to support the amendments <e> <s> the use of the word may in the subsections of clause wholly enfeebles the clause <e> <s> as has already been said nothing need be done at all <e> <s> a local authority does not even have to think about providing the services which are referred to in those parts of the clause now under consideration <e> <s> for that reason we support any amendment which reinforces the duties which should be imposed <e>", "<cs> likewise i support the spirit of the amendment <e> <s> i wonder whether there is in existence anywhere any statistical evidence as to how many children go into care at present simply because their mother it is usually the mother is homeless <e> <s> one does not need to repeat the problems of such people because they are so obvious <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for that indication <e> <s> of course the considerations under clause are considerations of whether the duty to provide accommodation arises <e> <s> by the time we get to clause we are considering how the duty should be exercised <e> <s> what my amendment proposes is certainly not intended to be onerous for local authorities <e> <s> as the noble and learned lord indicated it is stating what local authorities ought to be doing but sadly experience suggests that they do not always do that <e> <s> however having said that i am again grateful to the noble and learned lord and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment <e> <s> the scenario that the noble and learned lord outlined of the drunken parent turning up is all too familiar to those who deal in this field <e> <s> he suggested several reasons for a requirement of at least hours notice <e> <s> i suggest another good reason is to prepare the child for the return <e> <s> if a child has been away from home for three months he or she will have settled down <e> <s> it should not be right for a parent to turn up possibly out of the blue and the worse for wear and suddenly to demand and being enabled to demand the removal of the child at any hour of the day or night <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the explanation of the governments view <e> <s> this is a difficult area but it still seems to me that there is a curious logic in specifically providing for children over who decide to leave home but not unless the compulsory provisions involving a court order are invoked in the particular circumstances for children under who decide to leave home <e>", "<cs> it was not the intention of the amendment to give the guardian ad litem an additional responsibility while the child is in care <e> <s> it was intended to give the local authority an obligation to consult and not be bound by anything which the guardian ad litem may say <e> <s> it was not intended to bind the guardian ad litem to take on any additional duties <e> <s> i hope that that is clear <e> <s> there is not meant to be an onerous obligation on either party <e>", "<cs> this was in the nature of a probing amendment <e> <s> i recognise the wording of the bill as in effect a restatement of the existing law but it was suggested to me that this amendment would be a means of improving the ethos of local authority child care <e> <s> having heard the arguments of the noble and learned lord which i fully understand and respect i beg leave to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> i also should like to support the amendment not least because one would like to think that the drawing up of a plan of the kind that is proposed is what happens already in practice <e> <s> it is very important to avoid what the noble lady lady kinloss has described as a child drifting in care <e> <s> one knows from experience that children do drift in care and the line of least resistance is often taken <e> <s> those in local authorities who are responsible for children often do not think ahead or think ahead far enough <e> <s> it seems to me particularly important that there should be some such provision in the bill if the ability of the courts to intervene and to give directions as to what should or should not happen to a child is to be limited <e>", "<cs> they were very good pages <e> <s> this is something which i wish to see in the bill <e> <s> any positive statutory encouragement to consider the wider family should be supported <e> <s> i prefer not to see it in regulations <e> <s> i am afraid that there is a tendency to overlook the wider family it is a tendency particularly prevalent among younger social workers <e> <s> they do not consider all the options <e> <s> often there are uncles aunts grandparents and so on who are ready willing and able to step in but who are simply overlooked <e> <s> the consequence is that local authority social workers often create difficulties for themselves in the long run <e> <s> accordingly although it adds to the bill we support the amendment <e>", "<cs> as reference has been made to amendments nos <e> <s> and and as it seems to me as it did to the noble lord lord mishcon that amendment no <e> <s> entirely produces the effect which i certainly intended to produce in my amendments i suppose i ought to support it <e> <s> clearly the purpose of my amendments and therefore also of the amendment moved is not to add anything to the <e>", "<cs> i have to admit that i have never come across the problem which was identified by the noble baroness in explaining the amendment <e> <s> i felt considerable surprise when she suggested to the committee that the wardship jurisdiction had been effectively eroded to the extent she suggested <e> <s> but if there is a problem it must be addressed though i am by no means sure as to the scale of the problem <e> <s> in the vast majority of cases in particular those cases in which there is any apparent difficulty the ward will <e>", "<cs> that is what i understood her to go on to explain and certainly that is right <e> <s> but be that as it may it is still a surprising proposition <e>", "<cs> i share some of the dismay expressed as to the grouping because the amendment which has just been moved deals with the form of the review <e> <s> the noble lord lord mishcon advocates and i support the view that the review should be in the form of a properly constituted meeting <e> <s> to my mind the separate questions as to participation in the review are covered by the first part of amendment no <e> <s> and amendment no <e> <s> and the separate question of representation at review is dealt with by amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> as the noble lord lord mottistone said the second part of amendment no <e> <s> concerns a separate question altogether that is advising the child of the right of application to the court <e>", "<cs> i too support the amendment <e> <s> during the passage of the children and young persons amendment bill in the summer of i put forward a probing amendment much along these lines <e> <s> the argument then and i think the argument now is that there should be a specific complaints procedure to deal with matters which may be relatively trivial or serious that need to be ventilated and redressed but which perhaps are not appropriate matters to put before the court <e>", "<cs> i support this amendment which is an almost verbatim version of amendment no <e> <s> but i wish to develop the arguments a little further <e> <s> it <e>", "<cs> with respect to the noble and learned lord i think that my amendment adds the requirement to give due consideration whereas amendment no <e> <s> takes out the words in the bill and substitutes the requirement to give consideration <e> <s> for that reason i suppose i ought to prefer mine and indeed on balance i think do <e> <s> but with respect to the argument of the noble and learned lord it does not strike one reading it that having regard to the findings is as strong as a specific provision requiring consideration to be given to providing redress <e> <s> certainly my impression is that the strength to which he alludes simply is not there in the bill <e> <s> of course not every representation is a complaint and not every complaint will require a redress <e> <s> it is for that reason that both amendments simply require consideration to be given to providing redress <e>", "<cs> i should like to support what has just been said in particular with respect to the noble lord lord mottistone preferring amendment no <e> <s> a because it seems to me that emotional abuse although that is a phrase which is sometimes used is more generally referred to as emotional deprivation <e> <s> emotional deprivation which is not perhaps so easy to describe as a form of abuse nevertheless would fit within the definition suggested by the noble lord lord mishcon <e>", "<cs> the timing of the noble lord lord irvine of lairg is impeccable <e> <s> moving an amendment of this type at this time at night means that there are fewer magistrates to take offence at what he has just said and at what i am about to say because i support everything that he has just said <e>", "<cs> we on these benches would wish to support the amendment <e> <s> the arguments have already been thoroughly canvassed <e> <s> the need for adequate training is self-evident <e> <s> the inadequacies of the present position are as has just been said set out in one of the shortest and most compelling chapters of the cleveland report <e> <s> we therefore support the amendment <e>", "<cs> i too should like to express sympathy with the amendment <e> <s> i share the astonishment of the noble lord lord seebohm particularly at the nottingham university figures which reveal among other things an extraordinary amount of violence inflicted on babies of under one year of age <e> <s> however like the noble lord lord campbell of alloway i question what if anything an amendment in this particular form would achieve <e>", "<cs> speaking for myself i am a little disappointed that even at this stage the noble and learned lord is not able to speak with a little more precision appreciating that we are about to travel into fairly uncharted waters <e> <s> clause contains the potential for much good <e> <s> it means that care proceedings are no longer confined to the magistrates court and the general object as expressed by the government is to ensure that the right case starts or at least finishes in the right court <e>", "<cs> i share the concern of the noble lord lord campbell of alloway in this respect and join in hoping that the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor can do something to allay his fears even at this hour <e> <s> if the magistrates court is to be the point of entry and that in itself is a matter of concern will there be provision for the advance disclosure of documentation to enable those who have to make the decision about the appropriate forum for the case to make it properly and to <e>", "<cs> i support the underlying intention of this amendment and speak to it in connection with our amendments nos <e> <s> and which i believe have effectively the same purpose <e> <s> we feel some concern at the fact that yet again clause is a rule-making provision and one in which it is difficult to have confidence when what is to come is unknown <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful for the support i have received both from the noble lord lord mottistone and from the noble lord lord campbell <e> <s> i am particularly grateful to the noble lord lord campbell for supplementing what i inadequately sought to express and in particular for giving examples which i had not given of some of the situations which are giving cause for concern <e> <s> it was never suggested by me that this clause seeks to destroy the wardship jurisdiction <e>", "<cs> i had not intended to speak but feel in relation to this amendment that i must do so <e> <s> i do not know the nature of the complaints that have been received about the official solicitors operation in these cases but from my own experience i do not agree with the criticisms of the official solicitor his staff or the reports that are produced <e> <s> the official solicitor and his staff seem to me to serve children extremely well and their reports serve the courts extremely well <e> <s> the fact that the official solicitor does not act simply as a mouthpiece for the child enhances rather than diminishes the role of the official solicitor as a guardian ad litem <e> <s> it does not prevent the official solicitor acting as a medium by which the voice of the child is heard by the court in these cases <e> <s> if that is a matter which is to be removed by this amendment it is an amendment which i could not possibly support in this form <e>", "<cs> like the noble lord lord prys-davies we are concerned that the problem of guardians ad litem being seen to be independent has not been addressed <e> <s> in an ideal world such guardians would operate independently whoever was financially responsible for them <e> <s> it is not an ideal world <e> <s> now is not the time to develop the argument in answer to the noble and learned lord <e> <s> i therefore beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to speak only briefly in support of this amendment in so far as it concerns the question of child abduction <e> <s> i entirely agree with what the noble lord has said about the willingness of the police in this country and the courts in other countries to act more speedily if there is a piece of paper conveying custody rights of some sort or another upon the party who is seeking to enforce those rights <e> <s> but i was particularly shocked to hear him suggest that there may be some unwritten rule that the lord chancellors department somehow gives up if a child has not been retrieved after a year <e> <s> i have never heard that said before <e> <s> i certainly hope that there is no such unwritten rule <e> <s> i hope that the noble and learned lord will take the opportunity to deny that suggestion <e>", "<cs> my lords i had thought that all your lordships were too young to declare an interest as grandparents <e> <s> the noble and learned lord quite rightly said that the present provisions to some extent are restrictive and arbitrary <e> <s> nevertheless we must be careful not to replace those provisions with other provisions which in a different way are unduly restrictive and arbitrary <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with everything the noble and learned lord has said about the importance of the childs wishes and the importance of respecting and requiring adherence to the childs wishes when the child is in a position to make an informed decision but i have never heard of a case in which a childs name has been changed in the face of objection from that child <e> <s> even if the child expresses mixed feelings as to whether or not his or her name should be changed the court will not change the name and will err on the side of caution and quite rightly so <e> <s> the usual position in these cases is that the childs wishes provide the general impetus for an application to change his name <e> <s> the child will come home asking why he is not called the same at school as his half-brothers or step-brothers and that prompts an application to the court <e> <s> i wonder whether in practice the written consent of the child in cases involving a change of name adds anything of substance to what happens <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that point <e> <s> i was looking at the matter purely from a forensic point of view <e> <s> when it is before the court the wishes of the child are the determining factor in that case <e>", "<cs> my lords in response to the last point i should say that the requirement is not to tie people up with red tape <e> <s> the bill already provides a considerable loosening of the present requirements <e> <s> as things stand even if one wants to go for a day trip to the isle of man or the channel islands one needs not only to inform the other party but to get his or her consent <e> <s> i recognise the common sense of the basic general entitlement to take children abroad if there is no possible objection <e>", "<cs> my lords it is indeed an important matter and an important problem <e> <s> i shall of course look at the drafting <e> <s> for that reason alone i shall think in terms of coming back on third reading <e> <s> i am grateful for the support i have received from the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale <e>", "<cs> my lords the very moderate terms in which this amendment has been moved and the very moderate terms in which it is phrased make one hesitate before sounding a word of caution <e> <s> but anyone who has read anything about the topic of trans-racial fostering and trans-racial adoption will have realised that it is an extremely sensitive and controversial area <e> <s> perhaps we ought to think carefully before providing for any regulation in primary legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that as i hope i indicated <e> <s> this is a very moderate amendment <e> <s> it does not lend support to any form of dogma about these matters and one should recognise that <e> <s> nevertheless we should be careful about being seen to lend too much weight to those who are more dogmatic than the mover and supporters of this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we are all grateful to the noble and learned lord for his explanation of the amendments and what they seek to achieve <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment particularly in so far as it provides for a period of notice to be given before a child is removed from what we presently call voluntary care <e> <s> if a child goes into voluntary care for a predetermined period for exampletogive the mother a period of respite or to enable her to undergo an operation there is generally speaking little risk that the child will be removed from care without agreement <e> <s> but there is still a risk especially if the father is estranged <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble and learned lord says these are matters which are or should be central to the needs of the child <e> <s> accordingly i suggest they should be on the face of the bill <e> <s> the reason i sought to have them on the face of the bill is that the evidence apparently suggests that there is a failure to give due consideration to these aspects of childrens needs <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment <e> <s> it is obviously right that local authorities should be encouraged to look first to the childs wider family <e> <s> if that is to work it is also important that foster allowances or something similar should be available to the wider family which is prepared to assist the local authority <e>", "<cs> my lords in a sense this is a matter of semantics <e> <s> i invite your lordships to accept the argument of the noble baroness lady faithfull that the expression foster carer is less emotive and less confusing <e> <s> we hope to hear from the noble lord lord redesdale what with his experience he thinks <e>", "<cs> my lords strictly speaking the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale is right <e> <s> even if all the details were not set out in clause regulations could still be made which covered all the subjects dealt with in clause without those regulations being vulnerable to attack as having been made <e>", "<cs> my lords this is an important series of amendments especially amendment no <e> <s> which seeks to introduce into the bill what was clearly deliberately left out that is to say the child assessment order <e> <s> if the concept of the child assessment order is not included in the bill we shall be left with the emergency protection order only to deal with the type of situation that the noble lord lord mottistone has described <e>", "<cs> my lords this is an attractive amendment particularly if as the noble baroness suggested it fills one of the gaps left by the curtailment of the wardship jurisdiction <e>", "<cs> my lords assuming that the noble duke is not going to take up the invitation just offered to him i must start the first of what is a long list of speeches <e> <s> i shall endeavour to be brief <e> <s> i oppose the bill and i support the reasoned amendment of the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby <e> <s> but in doing so in such a sensitive area i do not presume to speak for any of my noble friends <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it there is some significance in the -day period <e> <s> i understand that some scientists may speak in terms of a longer period <e> <s> i do not know what is right <e> <s> i support the view of the noble lord lord houghton that we need to be informed <e> <s> if the noble earl waits he will hear the suggestion i have to make as regards how we should proceed with this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to join in thanking the noble and learned lord for his introduction of these orders and regulations <e> <s> it is important that we continue to have an opportunity to consider such orders <e> <s> those of us who were present during the debates on the legal aid bill as it then was will well remember the concern as regards what regulations and orders should or should not be the subject of the affirmative resolution procedures <e>", "<cs> my lords i too wish to thank the noble lord for his introduction and explanation of the orders <e> <s> i am only able to examine them from the perspective of an english experience of similar provisions most of which have been in force in england and wales since the act <e> <s> the provisions have filled a gap in providing financial relief after overseas divorces <e> <s> they have added a greater sense of realism to ordinary domestic financial and property disputes <e> <s> they focus on the acquisition of the earning capacity and the desirability of a clean break if at all possible <e>", "<cs> my lords in attempting to wind up this debate it is not possible after so many speakers to make the kind of speech that one might have made nearly hours ago <e> <s> however i declare an interest as a practising barrister and as someone who wants to remain a practising member of the independent bar <e> <s> i do not apologise for so doing <e> <s> to those noble lords who have criticised the force of reaction of the bar and of the judiciary i shall only say that it reflects the strength of feeling not just at the proposals contained in the green papers but also at their manner of introduction <e> <s> having heard that that reaction is not just that of the bar but also that of the highest judiciary in the land <e> <s> i hope now that all will realise that it is not the product of self-interest but that it is the product of far deeper considerations <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches also would like to thank the noble and learned lord for his explanation of the draft order <e> <s> in fact as i understand it it simply proposes an amendment to the act long awaited by those who want to pursue defaulting greek debtors <e> <s> i do not wish to trouble the noble and learned lord to give us even edited highlights of the report of the greek professors which is referred to in paragraph of the order or even to pronounce the names of its authors <e> <s> it is to be hoped that this will be a further aid to the interpretation of the statute in a rather remarkable if not unique form of drafting <e>", "<cs> my lords we join in thanking the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for his eagerly awaited statement <e> <s> we are thankful now to have the considered view of the government to set against the green papers that were published in january <e> <s> i for one am particularly grateful for the comparative table in annex b to the white paper which is most helpful <e> <s> it enables us to compare the proposals in the white paper with those in the green papers <e> <s> it may enable some of us to put the latter where many wanted them to go in the first place <e>", "<cs> before the minister replies is it intended that there should be a right of appeal from the single chairman to the full tribunal <e> <s> in important matters such as jurisdiction cases a chairman may decide that an application is out of time and that time should not be extended <e> <s> in my view there should be a right of appeal to the full tribunal <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness is right the tribunal has no power equivalent to that of the high court to declare someone a vexatious litigant <e> <s> i have had experience of people who have brought to tribunals numerous claims and who cannot be stopped however vexatious <e> <s> she is right in saying that there is a problem <e> <s> perhaps there should be an equivalent power enabling the tribunal to allow such people to continue only with leave <e> <s> that may be a solution but it is only part of the solution to the problem <e> <s> the fact that there is a problem is beyond doubt and i support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords it was indeed only a question of time during todays debate before this question arose <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> the whole question of transracial fostering and adoption is altogether too delicate for primary legislation <e> <s> we know that some local authorities have certain guidelines which are intended to meet the interests of the child especially when he or she becomes an adolescent <e>", "<cs> my lords i too wish to support the measure <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> is valuable so far as it goes but amendment no <e> <s> a is a particularly useful addition to it <e> <s> it addresses a problem repeatedly raised in this house when the bill was before us the first time round <e> <s> i hope that such agreements become if they are not already a standard procedure <e>", "<cs> my lords i also wish to welcome the undoubted improvements to clause and in particular the reference to the suffering of harm as a continuing state of affairs <e> <s> however the very fact that these amendments have to be produced supports the view that it is too difficult to produce a comprehensive watertight statutory code of criteria for care and that it is too dangerous to remove the safety net of wardship <e> <s> however i know that that battle has been fought and lost and i shall not pursue it now <e>", "<cs> my lords the question as to whether there should be any child assessment at all as the noble lord lord mottistone has reminded us was a matter of some controversy and difficulty at the earlier stages of the bill <e> <s> what has now been produced in amendment no <e> <s> strikes me as a carefully calculated compromise and none the worse for that <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord prys-davies mentioned the fact that there has been an argument put forward which i think he dismissed that there was no room for quality control <e> <s> he will know having i suspect received much the same literature as i have that there are two matters of particular concern <e> <s> first there is the <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble and learned lord indicate the timescale for the review of adoption law which he mentioned <e>", "<cs> my lords amendment no <e> <s> runs to five pages and is one of the worst examples of the complaint made by the noble and learned lord lord simon at the beginning of todays proceedings <e> <s> it is most unsatisfactory to legislate in this way particularly about such important matters in a bill whose provisions we hope will last for a long time <e>", "<cs> my lords five years ago we had our first debate on this topic <e> <s> we have had three more since then <e> <s> it is quite clear that there are some who oppose research on the basis of their beliefs and they will never be convinced by the arguments based on the value of research however great that value is perceived to be <e> <s> i suggest that those who oppose <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may break with convention by adding a fourth set of congratulations to the noble lord lord byron who has been a friend for many years <e> <s> like at least one other noble lord who is to speak we understand that he crossed from the bar to the solicitors branch of the profession <e> <s> i suspect that the bar council missed a trick it could have scored a very powerful point by establishing what both noble lords would now charge in their present opulent practices <e>", "<cs> i too should like to support this amendment <e> <s> dealing with the last point it seems to me that none of these criteria whether or not the words in the amendment are added binds the lord chancellor to do anything <e> <s> it strikes me that he may ignore them all completely <e> <s> i hope that he will not do so <e> <s> however subject to that observation this is a necessary amendment <e> <s> it is entirely right that there should be some reference in this part of the bill to <e>", "<cs> i support this amendment which has the same moving spirit as amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the amendments are clearly not intended to wreck or inhibit the bill but rather to ensure that it works as the civil justice review intended <e> <s> we heard at second reading and we have heard again today the widespread misgivings about the capacity of the county court system to cope with its existing workload let alone with the burden imposed by this bill and by the children act <e> <s> we also heard from the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor about the extra resources to which reference has just been made <e> <s> we can only suspend our judgment about those and see how they will work in practice <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for his response and indeed for the support i received in connection <e>", "<cs> while the provision for striking out is drastic i envisage that it will be used only sparingly <e> <s> i suggest that the answer to some of the points made by the noble lord lord hacking is to be found in amendment no <e> <s> tabled by the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor <e> <s> it will properly qualify the circumstances in which proceedings will be struck out <e> <s> they will be struck out only if the court is satisfied that the person bringing the proceedings knew or ought to have known of the requirement which he has overlooked <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment <e> <s> as the noble lord lord campbell of alloway said it ought to be inconceivable that an order for costs should be made without the party concerned having the opportunity of being heard <e> <s> as i understand it the provision suggested by this amendment is not only fair <e> <s> it is also entirely consistent with the existing provision which is applicable when one applies for costs against the legal aid fund for a successful unassisted party <e>", "<cs> i oppose the suggestion that clause should stand part of the bill <e> <s> i do not apologise for doing so because this is regarded not just by me as a matter of great importance <e>", "<cs> with respect i share some of the misgivings which have been expressed about clause or clause as presently drafted <e> <s> according to a side note to clause it applies to small claims but it does not say anywhere how large or small a small claim is to be and to certain other cases <e> <s> in fact as the noble and learned lord lord ackner has said those certain other cases could be very large and important <e> <s> for example a claim in a county court for the recovery of an amount due under a contract could provoke a massive counterclaim <e> <s> certainly under the rules as they now are the case <e>", "<cs> i speak in support of the amendments of the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> his amendment no <e> <s> overlaps amendments nos <e> <s> and which stand in my name <e>", "<cs> of course that is right <e> <s> it is a question of making sure that the bill carries that into effect <e> <s> like the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale i should like to think that what i seek to introduce into the bill is inherent in the powers of the county courts as they stand <e> <s> if there is any doubt about that the powers of the judge to control his court ought to be in the broadest possible terms <e> <s> he should not have his hands tied by a limited statutory power <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor has explained the mischief at which clause is directed <e> <s> we all understand the mischief <e> <s> but as several noble and learned lords and noble lords have pointed out the mischief generally speaking is adequately dealt with under the courts existing power in relation to costs and the disciplinary powers of the professional bodies <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful for that indication as regards the intention in this respect <e> <s> this was only a small probing amendment dealing with a technical point <e> <s> i am pleased that it has been <e>", "<cs> i support amendments nos <e> <s> b and c because clause ensures that the bar councils regulations and rules are deemed approved <e> <s> as the noble lord lord renton said that was the promise contained in paragraph of the white paper reiterated in paragraph which reads <e>", "<cs> i hesitate to interrupt but members of the committee should be aware that the amendment proposed by the noble lord lord mishcon is as good as far as it goes but i do not believe that it goes far enough <e> <s> clause will still have the potential to erode legal aid <e> <s> financial eligibility for legal aid is not determined by the legal aid board but by the treasury <e> <s> although the new clause proposed by the noble lord lord mishcon will bind the legal aid board it will not bind the treasury in determining eligibility for legal aid <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to repeat what has been said about the amendment which i agree should be a last resort rather than a substitute for the cab rank rule <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble lord lord mishcon would consider improving the wording of subsection in order to impose a duty on the law society to find a suitably qualified and able practitioner as quickly as possible <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful for that indication <e> <s> it seems to be designated as a distinct office under the bill in clause and in the schedule <e> <s> on the basis that it will be considered i am happy to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i believe that is the difference between the noble and learned lord and myself <e> <s> what he describes as greater flexibility could create greater uncertainty <e> <s> i have studied the governments position in the white paper <e> <s> i wish to consider the matter further <e> <s> at this stage i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am very sorry to take the noble baroness by surprise <e> <s> the grouping was not of my choice <e> <s> i very pointedly did not speak to this amendment when speaking to the other two <e> <s> at this stage i shall do no more than ask the government to look at the matter again <e> <s> the wording could be improved <e> <s> indeed i venture to suggest that it can only be improved <e> <s> meanwhile i beg leave to withdrawn the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to all noble lords who have spoken in this short debate <e> <s> i am particularly grateful to the noble lord lord mishcon for his questions <e> <s> it seems to me that the phrase <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am particularly grateful for the support i have received to these amendments <e> <s> like the noble lord lord renton i looked at them in terms of trying to impose a presumption in favour of the status quo <e> <s> i am also reassured that the noble and learned lord the master of the rolls does not find this clause easy <e> <s> it seems to me yet again to beg the question of when any question may arise as to whether a provision is deemed to have been approved <e> <s> frankly it is a tortuous clause <e> <s> it is a matter which will need to be looked at yet again but meanwhile i beg leave to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel i ought to declare an interest as a recipient of legal aid fees as a practitioner i am proud to say on the cab rank although i shall never be able to stand there in the sort of shoes to which the noble and learned lord lord ackner has referred <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble baroness for her explanation of the bill and its somewhat chequered history <e> <s> it has indeed become a rather difficult and confusing bill <e> <s> reading it as it has come to this house one realises that it no longer lives up to its long or short title because it was truncated towards the end of its passage through another place <e> <s> on reading the law commissions report one realises that what is now left is the law commissions draft bill <e> <s> as always the law commissions recommendations are the product of thorough consultation and careful reasoning <e> <s> on reading the briefing material of the national consumer council and consumers association one realises that they disagree with the law commissions on one important point about the right to reject goods and that they disagree with each other about the usefulness of enforceable consumer guarantees as originally proposed in the bill <e>", "<cs> i support these amendments <e> <s> they take the law beyond that which is applied to the sale of goods <e> <s> for example they give protection to people who are given goods rather than having bought them <e> <s> as the noble lord lord williams has said they introduce a voluntary scheme which should raise standards <e> <s> i recognise these amendments as a well-meant modified version of what caused the bill to founder in another place <e> <s> i assume from government amendment no <e> <s> that the government are against these proposals <e> <s> my only concern is about the practical politics of these proposals <e>", "<cs> i did not intend to suggest an indefinite time for rejection <e> <s> with respect to the noble baroness her reference to the limitation act was not correct <e> <s> i doubt whether anybody would keep an apple for five years and then try to take it back to the shop <e> <s> perhaps that example demonstrates that the longer the right to reject is left the harder it will be to show that the defect complained of was there at the time of purchase <e> <s> however if the defect was there from the outset and is serious and the purchaser acts promptly why on earth should he not have his money back <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to know that i struck a chord with at least one other noble lord in the chamber <e> <s> i am also grateful to the minister for his view of the issue <e> <s> i should like to consider the issue a little further <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret to say that i was not consulted about the groupings <e> <s> with respect they are separate topics <e> <s> i am happy to talk to amendments nos <e> <s> a and b together if that is convenient to the government front bench and also to amendments nos <e> <s> d and e in due course but i hope i am not being tiresome in not wishing to be confined to the groupings on the list because it is not convenient or manageable to deal with the matter in that way <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not intend to press either amendment at this stage <e> <s> the aim of amendment no <e> <s> a was to protest at the confusing concepts in the bill and to draw attention to the illogicality <e> <s> as the noble lord said public libraries and other public buildings of that kind can be just as untidy and littered as a shopping centre but a shopping centre can be caught while a public building cannot be caught <e> <s> that is illogical <e> <s> i do not understand the governments position but i do not propose to press the amendment at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i am reassured <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the burden if that is the right word to be imposed on local authorities by this amendment was not meant to be great <e> <s> the intention was to ensure that the interests of neighbouring traders were looked after <e> <s> for example at one extreme they may need to be protected from the over-zealous trader cleaning the street at awkward times from the point of view of the business of the neighbouring trader <e> <s> at the other end of the spectrum traders may need to be reassured that something is being done so as to prevent them taking action either through the courts or otherwise <e>", "<cs> my lords we should be grateful to the government for dealing with this issue in this very carefully produced amendment <e> <s> it meets a need in a few specific cases <e> <s> it is consistent with the suggestions contained in the warnock report and i therefore venture to suggest that it is consistent with common sense <e> <s> the only question i ask the noble and learned lord is whether and when regulations may be expected under the proposed new subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the situation caused by a shortage of clerical staff to process the increasing number of applications to tribunals <e> <s> is that situation hindered by the present embargo on the use of part-time tribunal chairmen <e> <s> will those problems be further increased when the government activate the power to extend the jurisdiction of the tribunal however welcome that extension may be <e>", "<cs> my lords this is an opportune moment for the question to be raised <e> <s> there was nothing obtuse about what the noble earl said or in his valuable suggestions <e> <s> it has become a matter of concern that the european commission is preparing to bring charities that is to say the non-profit making voluntary sector within the ambit of the treaty of rome <e> <s> i question the appropriateness of bringing british and irish charities under the unfamiliar regulatory control of what is essentially an economic community <e>"]
