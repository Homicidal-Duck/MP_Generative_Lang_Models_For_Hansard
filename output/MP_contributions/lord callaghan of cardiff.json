["<cs> my lords permit me first to express my thanks for the kindness and the courtesy shown to me by noble lords on all sides of the house since i entered your lordships house <e> <s> i ask that it be extended to me again for a short time this afternoon <e> <s> i rise of course to add my very warm congratulations to those who have negotiated this treaty and to call attention to some of the possible consequences <e> <s> as a welcome historical footnote perhaps i may point out that the terms of the treaty go further than was envisaged when we met at guadeloupe nearly nine years ago <e> <s> our objective then was to secure the withdrawal of the soviet ss missiles from europe <e> <s> now under this agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords no one could be discourteous to the minister for the very painstaking way in which she answers our questions <e> <s> however i do not think that her amiability can disguise the fact that many of us feel that this is a most discourteous manner of proceeding <e> <s> if the issue is so important and it is it involves the abolition of the largest and most important education <e>", "<cs> like the noble lord lord prior i had not intended to speak <e> <s> however i feel that i cannot let this occasion go without expressing how profoundly wrong i believe the government are in this matter <e> <s> i believe that i should state my view <e> <s> i always understood that the view of successive governments was to hold the balance fairly between the employer and the employee <e> <s> because of what has happened in recent years the government have felt impelled to take action <e>", "<cs> my lords i was going to say that i am overcome but i am deeply grateful <e> <s> great ormond street hospital is waiting for me to telephone the result of this debate <e> <s> it will receive it with tremendous satisfaction knowing that the government have accepted the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i might have known that the former lord chancellor knew him well <e> <s> perhaps i had better be careful what i say <e> <s> i am not sure that he has been produced in a play that has been written specially for him by sir james barrie <e> <s> at least let us give that distinction to the noble lord lord charteris <e> <s> it accounts for a great deal in his character that i have come to like and admire in the years since <e>", "<cs> my lords i soon discovered when i came to your lordships chamber that one of the pleasures was to listen to the noble lord lord dainton talking about education <e> <s> he has certainly not disappointed us this afternoon <e>", "<cs> i rise to support the amendment moved by the noble baroness lady david <e> <s> i have great sympathy with what was said by the noble lord lord joseph about the absolutely vital significance of the core subjects which i differentiate as he does slightly from the foundation subjects for the reason of flexibility that has been called in aid by the noble viscount lord eccles <e> <s> while i agree with him that this is a very important amendment i feel he does less than justice to those who are putting it forward and especially to the teachers unions <e> <s> i have no connection with the teachers unions or with anyone else except parents and grandparents <e> <s> but my experience such as it is from visiting schools and from the voluminous correspondence that i like so many members of the committee have received is that this objection is shared not merely by teachers unions which have something to fear but by a great many people who are concerned with the changing patterns of education <e>", "<cs> i think that that intervention comes very appropriately from the floor of the committee because for years i have listened to the former lord chancellor the noble and learned lord lord hailsham telling me that it is the socialists who believe in bureaucracy it is the socialists who wish to regulate everything it is the socialists who wish to ensure that everyone operates on the same pattern at the same time that there shall be no departure from it that we wish to grind the people down in equality <e> <s> it is quite insufferable he used to say <e>", "<cs> i was surprised to hear that the minister of state for defence procurement is to reply to this debate <e> <s> i see that the noble lord lord beloff has already fled the field <e> <s> the minister is present but is apparently not training her guns on us for the moment and only the noble baroness lady young is left to defend the indefensible <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will permit me to interrupt him i must say that the final decision in that case as in these other cases rested with parliament <e> <s> in the case that the noble lord mentioned the decision was to be taken by parliament <e> <s> the vote was to be an advisory one <e> <s> they had to secure a certain majority but at the end of the day it was for parliament to take the decision <e> <s> that is not so in this case <e>", "<cs> i feel i must <e>", "<cs> <e> <s> i believe that this is not only a very serious matter but one in which the government are failing to take into account both the history of landlord and tenant and the experience of a great many people <e> <s> in a way we are all dogged by our experience of these matters <e> <s> for myself i never lived in a house which i could call my own subject to a building society for about the first years of my life <e> <s> however it is not my personal experience with which i am concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that those figures are totally irrelevant <e> <s> it is a fact that the guarantees that were then given on behalf of the workforce of south wales have been more than justified and it is because fords expectations have been exceeded that it has now brought this tremendous new venture which is of the greatest significance and will provide for the production of engines every year to south wales <e> <s> if we can spend money at that rate as a sprat to catch a mackerel let us have many more sprats <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may mix the cooking metaphor does it not also show that in addition to the fact that sprats can catch mackerel the proof of this pudding has been in the eating and that it is the success of the first venture which has brought the second <e>", "<cs> my lords i confess that i have never understood the fiendish complexities of the rate support grant <e> <s> i am filled with admiration for those like my noble friend lord mcintosh who are able to give us such a powerful <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged to the noble lord for what he has said <e> <s> i believe that this is a matter where party differences should be put to one side <e> <s> as i said in my city there are no party differences over the matter <e> <s> putting party differences to one side there should be a certain relationship between the actions of government their word and what happens afterwards <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will permit me to intervene i fear that i do not know what the alternative rules are <e> <s> i wish to suggest yet another way out if these are not the alternative rules <e> <s> when a local authority has closed its accounts and has even sent them to the district auditor but because of the requirements of ministers up to th july it had not forwarded them to the ministry why should that authority not be recompensed <e> <s> why should not the government accept that <e> <s> ministers will need no more information <e> <s> the information is there has been there and was there at the time <e> <s> the fact was merely that it had not been received by the ministers who had asked for it by a later date <e> <s> what is wrong with a simple solution of that sort <e> <s> we know that there are councils in that position <e> <s> why can the government not play fair <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will allow me that does not mean a thing <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry <e> <s> with respect it does nothing of the sort <e> <s> the rules contained in the bill are precisely those under which the city of cardiff loses million <e> <s> the legal experts in cardiff have examined this everybody has looked at it and that is the maximum amount to which they are entitled <e> <s> i say this to the noble lord in great friendship all he is offering me is soft soap there is nothing in it <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much regret that i must begin with an apology to the noble lord who will wind up this debate <e> <s> alas some time ago before this debate was arranged i undertook an engagement <e> <s> it is not unconnected with this subject and i trust that i can be excused <e>", "<cs> my lords i am interested because the noble lord has twice stated that the introduction of the kind of proposals that the noble lord lord brocket puts forward offends in <e>", "<cs> oh <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord refers back to perhaps he could tell us what was the figure of unemployment in and when he hopes to reduce the present governments total to that level <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that he is totally incorrect and that in fact he inherited a falling figure of unemployment <e> <s> is he not aware that the fall continued until vat was raised to per cent <e> <s> in the autumn of <e>", "<cs> correct <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord think that the stoking-up before the election contributed to the present fall <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down perhaps he will allow me to say that i take it that we are to assume that his reference to seeing something in bigamy is a purely theoretical concept in view of the fact that he and lady houghton will be celebrating their golden wedding next saturday <e> <s> i congratulate them both <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e> <s> i only wanted to ask whether they were to be read as a serious contribution to history or as a work of fiction <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give the noble lord the answer to his question <e> <s> it is not for me to do so <e> <s> however it would not have prevented him going to the prime minister of the day who took office in and giving him his views then would it <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to pursue this matter too much <e> <s> however i must say in view of the references that have been made that my understanding was that mr heaths government had carried this matter on <e> <s> by the time i attained the office that i was very proud to hold so much had been committed that i was told as one usually is that it would be more wasteful to stop it than to continue it <e> <s> so it went on <e> <s> i am sure other noble lords have had that experience in other areas <e>", "<cs> my lords on this difficult question where the arguments are not one way or the other cannot the government help those of us who are rather simple about these matters by telling us the criteria by which the government judge whether the time is ripe <e> <s> is one criterion the level of the exchange rate <e> <s> is one the degree of productive capacity in this country <e> <s> is one the level of interest rates <e> <s> what combination of these or other factors will tell us and enable us to judge as well as the government whether the time is right <e>", "<cs> would a proposal to abolish the house of lords be regarded as undermining parliamentary democracy or enhancing it <e>", "<cs> the noble viscount lord whitelaw made as usual a very persuasive speech <e> <s> it would have been even more persuasive to me if he had not misread the amendment <e> <s> he referred consistently throughout the whole of his speech to the difficulties and pressure to which a committee of parliamentarians even of privy council status would be subject <e> <s> that is not what the amendment says <e>", "<cs> if the noble viscount will contain himself he will find i come to that and to many other points <e> <s> it should be worthy of note by the committee that this amendment has a most remarkable pedigree <e> <s> perhaps it is worthy of notice that in their concern the government have wheeled on the noble viscount lord whitelaw in order to defend their position <e> <s> i note that the amendment contains the names not only of members of the labour party but also of a member of the conservative party a member of the sld and indeed of an independent member of this chamber <e> <s> in other words all the major elements in the committee are represented by the proposers of this amendment <e>", "<cs> i never expected to hear the government chief whip encourage me <e> <s> he is my friend for life <e> <s> i undertake to read all his novels in future <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> i said deliberately that i supported the principle of the amendment <e> <s> because it is the only one i shall vote for it <e> <s> if the government were to indicate that they accepted the principle of the idea then i repeat as i said earlier that i believe there is room for discussion to answer some of the questions some of which i must say i regard as ninepins put up only to be knocked down and decide what form the committee should take <e>", "<cs> my lords with the condemnation of the scheme which has been expressed time after time from the benches opposite is it not appropriate that we should remember and those of us who put the bill through the house of commons years ago will remember that it ended a system of corruption nepotism harsh brutality and arbitrary behaviour by port employers and introduced one which gave back self-respect to many docks families who i had the honour to represent for many years <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> not only do i remember him at the time i was parliamentary secretary to the ministry of transport <e> <s> he was far more than a staff captain he was the quartermaster general for a very considerable period and knew a very great deal about transport <e> <s> that was the reason for his appointment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord refers to the per cent <e> <s> increase in the amount payable to the health service since but is he aware that with the rise in the interest rates this morning the increase in the cost of interest is also up by per cent <e> <s> since <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a limited but lengthy recollection of some of the dock ports of the country especially the one which i have represented for over years <e> <s> i must say to the noble viscount lord st davids that clearly his recollection is at fault or that he never knew the situation which existed before there were welfare facilities particularly medical facilities in the scheme ports <e> <s> i feel that it is an abuse of language to talk about removing a privilege as the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter did <e> <s> i hope that the minister will be able to satisfy us that the port medical facilities which were brought in under the scheme will continue or some satisfactory alternative arrangements will be made <e>", "<cs> the lower reaches <e> <s> i do not believe that there were many docks in existence there or that the noble lord came across many dockers among his constituents <e> <s> i did i saw what happened when people were injured especially early in the morning <e> <s> i do not know why injuries seemed to take place in the docks early in the mornings perhaps people were not properly awake at that time <e> <s> the use of the dockers hook and the various other implements that were employed resulted in the men suffering relatively minor injuries but injuries that would put them off work for the rest of the day <e>", "<cs> i always allow the noble lord to do so because the more he says the more he will reveal that he has a warm heart and a realistic mind but a total incapacity to understand the situation in the docks <e>", "<cs> very easily my lords <e> <s> i was coming to that point because i thought it was one of the weaker points of both the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter and the noble viscount lord st davids <e> <s> i justify it on the simple ground that it is not a privilege it is an essential <e> <s> i said that my knowledge of docks was limited i do not know what facilities exist in the non-scheme ports <e> <s> i hope that the minister can tell us what those facilities are <e> <s> unless he can give us a satisfactory answer i hope that the noble lord lord rochester will pursue the amendment into the division lobby <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister allow me to intervene <e> <s> that is a very lengthy and comprehensive list <e> <s> however in the docks there are a number of port medical centres <e> <s> i did not hear those mentioned <e> <s> has the minister any information and if he has not will he find out whether under the health and safety regulations it would be the intention of the employers to maintain the kind of port medical centre that exists in certain ports now whether in all the non-port schemes i do not know which were set up under the scheme and have been of immense benefit to all the employers as well as to the employees <e> <s> will the dissolution of the scheme mean the dissolution of those port medical centres <e>", "<cs> i beg the noble lords pardon <e>", "<cs> my lords as it is the case that the government often give selective statistics as the minister has just done would the noble earl care to compare the deficits in with the assets so that we get a true figure <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect that does not answer my question <e> <s> the noble earl has compared a low figure in when this government came to power on the asset side <e> <s> would he now give the corresponding figures on the side on which we owe money to overseas countries <e>", "<cs> my lords is it fair for the minister to come to this chamber and cast such aspersions without having the complete figures at his disposal <e>", "<cs> my lords that simply is not true <e>", "<cs> i wish to say quite shortly how much i support the amendment and the speeches that have been made in its support <e> <s> like the noble lord lord wedderburn who moved the amendment i should much prefer to see these clauses out of the bill <e> <s> they are a return in some ways to the kind of attitude which was forgone by the conservative party when people like winston churchill put his name and his hand to reforms of this character <e> <s> without chopping logic with the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter for i have long since learnt that that is not a very remunerative operation for any of us because he is adept and skilful at these things i should have thought that his complaint against the amendment is that it reflects a certain conservatism on the part of the opposition and that he would have been in support of it or has he too deserted his conservatism <e>", "<cs> i am not aware that the amendment says anything of the kind <e> <s> what it says is <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the minister for giving way <e> <s> there are about <e>", "<cs> it is true <e>", "<cs> i really cannot accept what the minister says that there is no exploitation among young people <e> <s> there is exploitation <e> <s> there is exploitation among particular groups of young people which i know especially those who either were not born in this country and who have come here because their parents have arrived here or those whose parents were born here but are themselves in depressed and very poorly paid occupations <e> <s> i assure him that there is exploitation of many young people <e> <s> i am not saying that that applies to as many as or but the exploitation is there <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend gets to his finally did he understand from the minister that there was any single body whether on the employers side the management side or trade union side in favour of the governments proposals <e> <s> all the cases i thought i heard the minister reproduce indicated that they were opposed to the government on this repeal in regard to hours for young people <e> <s> did my noble friend receive a different impression <e>", "<cs> i hope that my noble friend will not pursue that line or the government will introduce an amendment to make it legal <e>", "<cs> i agree with my noble friend lady lockwood <e> <s> there is more here than the question of sex equality <e> <s> there is a question also of freedom <e> <s> i should like to put an example to the minister and hear his reply <e>", "<cs> i hope that the government will take this amendment seriously <e> <s> it seems that the proposal they have made is likely to create friction rather than to improve industrial relations <e> <s> you may have a very active and able trade unionist employed in a firm or company that does not recognise a union <e> <s> he may still remain a member of his trade union <e> <s> as part of his responsibilities he may be called upon to represent other fellow workers in a particular area <e> <s> as i understand it to insert the offensive words that he can only act in relation to the trade union recognised by the employer means that he is not then able to represent people who are engaged in another firm <e> <s> i do not know why the noble lord lord strathclyde should laugh at that <e> <s> this situation can arise in the case of smaller trades unions where officials have to represent people across a number of concerns <e> <s> that has always been the case and such a procedure has been carried on so far as i know without any great friction <e>", "<cs> my lords i happen to be patron of a housing association in cardiff and i should just briefly like to tell the house that this matter is arousing considerable feeling <e> <s> there is a feeling that sharp practice has been involved here <e> <s> it seems to me to be utterly wrong to introduce this measure so quickly and i am told without consultation <e> <s> i do not know whether that is true but that is what has been reported to me <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister will be aware from the attention with which his answers have been received that there is a considerable degree not only of sympathy but of uncertainty regarding the position of the government <e> <s> do the concessions that he announced already apply to the pre- war widows apply also to the post- war widows <e> <s> if they do is not the whole point made by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter namely the disparity between pre- and post- the one that matters <e> <s> i believe we are speaking for a great many people in this house so will the minister go back and look at this matter again <e> <s> there are other ways in which concessions can be made to see whether the position of those before and those after can be reconciled <e> <s> that is the point <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the minister to be saying that it is a question of cost because he also refers to priorities <e> <s> i am well aware of that and that is why in my first budget as chancellor of the exchequer in i relieved many of the difficulties of war widows by easing the burden on their earnings <e> <s> i regarded the problem as a top priority <e> <s> if it is a question of cost i ask the minister whether he will look again at the situation in order to see whether there is a way of introducing a change by stages <e> <s> it has been done before <e> <s> as the noble lord lord mayhew said the problem is alas one that will diminish as time passes <e> <s> i believe that the minister would be doing the whole house a favour if he looked at the matter again told the treasury to produce the arguments and if it is a question of cost asked the treasury to find some graduated scheme to meet the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i follow the noble lord lord home immediately in saying as he did that one of the greatest sources of trust <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his last reply <e> <s> however will he look into the history of the subject and recognise that we fought very hard for britain to secure this project <e> <s> we did so on the basis that it was a long-term project and we were willing to provide certain facilities because of the advantages that it would bring <e> <s> without putting too fine a point on it it would be rather a breach of faith if having fought hard for it and having secured it we were in any way and the minister has not suggested this to back away from the undertakings that we gave <e>", "<cs> no no <e>", "<cs> my lords i must make it clear to the noble earl if he has not already realised it that the advantage of being a former prime minister is that one is treated with the same respect as one had when one was prime minister but that one does not have the red boxes <e> <s> one has all the advantages without any of the disadvantages <e> <s> on the noble earls major point will he take it from me that having thought a great deal about this i find a great deal of truth in it <e> <s> i do not think that either the united states or the federal republic of germany is any less democratic than the united kingdom because it has an independent central bank <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may thank the minister for the letter which he sent to me in reply to mine <e> <s> his letter indicates that the improvements that are to be made in april will <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not detain your lordships but i heard my noble friend <e>", "<cs> no my lords parliament did <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord lord campbell is in any doubt about proceeding with the bill i should like to encourage him to do so <e> <s> i genuinely believe that he is doing more for good industrial relations than anything that has been said today from the government front bench <e> <s> i sincerely believe that the government would be wise to accept a similar amendment and allow the bill to pass <e>", "<cs> my lords i think everyone will agree that this has been a most interesting and i trust useful debate <e> <s> there have been many shades of difference of opinion but if one had to point to the basic difference it has been between optimists and pessimists <e>", "<cs> there is a tactic well known to the home office and every other department equated with the home office <e> <s> it is one i am sure the noble and learned lord lord hailsham has practised in the past <e> <s> if there is a legislative gap a slot to be filled and no immediate government bill the home office can always be relied upon to come forward and provide one <e> <s> it has a cupboard full of bills ready to be brought forward at a moments notice <e> <s> i dare say that that is what happened on this occasion <e>", "<cs> the minister is quite right to doubt whether i intended to be very helpful on the last occasion i spoke <e> <s> my purpose here is purely to seek information <e> <s> this seems a very desirable provision <e> <s> the noble earl said that it would apply to our territorial waters and to the high seas on request from another state or another flag registered in that state <e>", "<cs> i must apologise to the noble earl <e>", "<cs> i fully understand the point that we can operate on request within our own territorial waters or on the high seas <e> <s> i am sorry if i did not make my question plain <e> <s> can we operate in the territorial waters of another country which requests us to do so <e> <s> i am thinking especially of some of the smaller countries in the west indies which are independent members of the commonwealth and which have their own territorial waters but which do not have the necessary facilities to prevent some of the drug smuggling going on at <e>", "<cs> my lords are we likely to have any further recantations from confessed sinners such as the noble viscount lord whitelaw <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the house will not object if i underline what my noble friend lord cledwyn said namely that the whole country will be united behind whatever steps the government find themselves able to take and that the president of iraq should understand that there is a united view in this country that to carry out this sentence would offend and deeply offend everyone in this country <e> <s> we wish the government well in their efforts <e>", "<cs> i shall not take more than two minutes of the committees time in what i have to say <e> <s> it may be that the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter is correct when he says that if we have more information it will influence opinions <e> <s> however i should like to report to the committee the fact that although i am no expert i have a small connection with the university of wales <e> <s> it is a peculiar institution because it was founded initially on the small subscriptions of slate quarrymen in wales and was built up literally without funds or foundations from a very small beginning <e> <s> because of that fact it has a very peculiar constitution <e> <s> it is not merely made up of distinguished academics although they play a substantial part in the constitution of the court of the university of wales which is a very lively body <e> <s> it also includes very well-known people in the public life of wales for example businessmen who certainly are not particularly influenced by what students say and members of trade unions in their representative capacity in wales <e> <s> and trade unions play a significant part in that respect <e> <s> there are many academics and representative of arts culture and the libraries <e> <s> indeed almost every facet of wales is represented in the court <e> <s> there are also some students involved but only a handful no more than half a dozen out of <e> <s> they attend the meetings and debate matters as we tend to in wales very passionately <e>", "<cs> my lords i associate myself entirely with what has been said but i have one reservation <e> <s> the noble lord said that students would be sent back without completing their courses <e> <s> how many students are there in that category <e> <s> does it include students who are due to take their examinations in a few weeks time <e> <s> what purpose will be served and what benefit will be gained from sending back those young men and women who will no doubt be the leaders in their country in some or years time and might well be our friends <e> <s> is it right to visit the consequences of the crime which has been committed by the government of iraq upon presumably innocent young men and women who are doing nothing more than studying in our country and to whom we have been glad to offer hospitality <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the minister and to the house <e> <s> i clearly misunderstood him <e> <s> i thought that he was referring to all students not just military students <e>", "<cs> we all thank the noble baroness <e> <s> i am sure although she is anxious to safeguard her own position that she does not intend to talk to her right honourable friend unless it is to try to persuade him to accept the per cent <e> <s> i guess although she would not say so now that she has been convinced by the arguments from both sides <e> <s> i believe that we should reinforce her on this point <e> <s> it would be helpful if she were able to go to her minister and say that not only was she expressing the views of those who spoke but also of those who did not speak and that those who did not speak expressed their view in the division lobby in order to support her in her splendid choice <e>", "<cs> is the noble lord saying that his vote would not follow his voice on this matter <e> <s> i am sure that he would not wish to convey that impression to the committee <e> <s> i am sure that his vote would follow his voice <e> <s> i believe that members of the committee sitting in the chamber are as convinced as the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter by the arguments adduced <e> <s> i have no hesitation in assuming that the matter would be carried <e> <s> even if it were not carried the noble baroness having said that she intends to go back to the minister on this matter will naturally do so <e> <s> the noble earl lord caithness shakes his head <e> <s> if we decide to vote and the matter is not carried is that the end of it <e> <s> is that what the noble earl is saying <e> <s> is he saying that the noble baroness will not go back to the minister although she has been convinced by the argument <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to associate myself completely with what has been said by the noble earl by my noble friend lord mishcon and by the noble lord lord harris <e> <s> however i should like to ask one or two questions <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to the noble earl i hope that he will not as he has twice this afternoon continue to say that the decision is the sole responsibility of the commissioner <e> <s> the home secretary has a responsibility for preserving law and order <e> <s> without interfering with the commissioners responsibilities is it not the responsibility also of the home secretary and that responsibility has been carried out on many occasions irrespective of party by winston churchill onwards and backwards to discuss such matters with the commissioner and offer his opinion as to location route and so on <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may intervene briefly <e> <s> the noble lord lord harris raised an important question about the dreadful activities relating to drug money and the way in which huge sums are laundered <e> <s> however perhaps i may say that my noble friend lord bruce of donington hit the nail on the head when he spoke of the ease with which those transations can be laundered if that is the word and the difficulties of the banks in keeping up with what is happening in the millions of transactions which take place every day <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord allow me to intervene <e> <s> am i correct in understanding what he is saying about united states law to mean that the president of the bank in london and the chief executives in london could be held to be guilty of an offence under united states law if any employee in florida were to commit an offence against united states law of which they were entirely ignorant <e>", "<cs> my lords the guilty mind <e> <s> i thank the noble lord i do know that much <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the lesson to be learnt from the remarks of the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter that he should not make a wholesale condemnation when apparently he referred only to a small minority <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i shall give way to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i was happy to give way to the noble lord who gave me such good advice many years ago when he was chairman of the parole board <e> <s> one of the questions asked by my noble friend was not adequately answered <e> <s> if before the incidents at strangeways any of us had been told that it would take days to recover one of her majestys prisons we should have regarded that with absolute incredulity <e> <s> while it is right to concentrate on the fundamental underlying causes should we not also look at the tactics which were followed <e> <s> perhaps we should do so especially in view of the continued reference that has been made to the governors proposal to recover the prison after two days <e> <s> i am sure the minister will agree i that the -day lapse of time will cause profound <e>", "<cs> my lords do the government and the noble lord not think that there is some relationship between germanys membership of nato and closer political union however that may be defined <e> <s> i should have some sympathy with the prime minister if she showed exasperation about the failure to define it <e> <s> are there not two real dangers for europe <e> <s> one is that its politics should be renationalised the second is that germany should stand independently <e> <s> is it not at least possible that germanys membership of nato will to some extent become dependent upon achieving a closer political union <e> <s> otherwise is it not likely that if germany is denied a closer political union and finds that membership of nato will become a cause of great disturbance with the soviet union to which its relations are very closely tied we could then have a germany that would be independent free floating and without political union <e> <s> can the noble lord the leader of the house say whether the government have in mind the fact that there is a close connection between those two in the ultimate resort <e>", "<cs> i shall be brief as i am neither a lawyer nor an ecclesiastic but someone who merely tries to apply a modicum of common sense to what has been put to us <e> <s> i was not able to be present at the last debate <e> <s> but i feel that this is one of the most important questions which your lordships will have to decide <e> <s> for that reason i <e>", "<cs> my lords i am one who has benefited from treatment at st thomass for which i am extremely grateful <e> <s> does this cut result in a worsening of the service to the patients <e> <s> has there been any lessening in demand by the patients or is it alleged that there is inefficiency in their treatment <e> <s> how can it be justified that after years of this government we should have to reduce health services in one of the poorest areas of london <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to state my view of the constitutional position <e> <s> i am a strong upholder of the supremacy of the commons in our affairs <e> <s> this house is unelected and unreformed although i do not say that the position would be the same if my party were to reform it and it must be very careful before it challenges what is done or said in the commons <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand the noble lord if this house were to vote against the bill tonight it could be introduced again at the beginning of the next session and become law within a month <e> <s> i understand that the government hope to get this bill through by july <e> <s> if the bill were defeated tonight presumably the delay in implementing this measure would be only the time between july when the government hope to get their bill and december when presumably the house will again admit the bill into the new session for one month <e> <s> is that correct <e>", "<cs> my lords surely the noble earl recalls that the rate of inflation today is higher than it was at the time that the green paper was issued by the labour government <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that the noble baroness had risen to respond to the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter by saying that as the department of education and science is on the other side of westminster bridge a taxi was already speeding across the bridge with printed copies and that we should adjourn for minutes to enable them to arrive so that we could proceed <e> <s> why does she not say that <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble viscount agree that the house will have heard with interest the reply to my noble friend lord prys-davies that it is difficult to say what additional resources have been devoted to this programme <e> <s> is he aware that the general opinion in wales is that the so-called initiative consists of mr peter walker adding up the total cost of the schemes introduced by his predecessor now the noble lord lord crickhowell publishing the result and hoping to claim it as a great propaganda victory <e> <s> will he agree that it is a publicity gimick that has gone wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble baroness for that reply <e> <s> however is she aware that it will be widely regarded as disappointing because it contains nothing new following the report of the wooding committee which stated that provision was totally inadequate for our national needs <e> <s> we only have the part funding of new lectureships <e> <s> which of the recommendations of the wooding committee do the government disagree with and why <e>", "<cs> my lords i yield to no one in my admiration of the noble baronesss capacity to reply and to do so at such a speed that my slow mind has not been able to take in the response <e> <s> that was a lesson which was taught me many years ago <e> <s> she has certainly learnt it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that if de tocqueville had continued the thought expressed by the noble lord lord carrington he would have gone on to add that in a democracy where people and members of parliament are free to speak their minds a government can only be strengthened by the kind of debate which is taking place in this and another place this afternoon and that the expression of our opinion here is bound to strengthen the government in the policies which they are following <e> <s> so much then for de tocqueville <e>", "<cs> my lords in his categorical reply was the minister taking into account the fact that last week the american congress cut out of the pentagons budget expenditure for that purpose <e> <s> if he is so certain that it is necessary what will he do if that disagreement persists and congress has its way <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord colnbrook for his remarks but reflecting on what has happened over the past years perhaps i should have asked the commons to <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord but he seems to be forgetting that his government were in charge when inflation soared to that figure <e> <s> when i left office inflation was at per cent <e> <s> it rose very quickly afterwards because sir geoffrey howe doubled value added tax <e> <s> if we are going to have comparisons let us have some fair ones <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by adding my congratulations to my noble friend lady castle for her maiden speech <e> <s> running through many of the themes of todays speeches it seems to me that we have experienced a rather fresh breeze <e> <s> i do not know whether she is already having the effect on us that she had on the european parliament but certainly the robust frankness which she expressed in her speech seems to have been reproduced in the speeches of others <e> <s> for myself i must say that i am beginning to feel rather at home <e> <s> i trust that i shall be able to continue in that particular vein <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not mean to say that <e> <s> in any event i apologise to mr heath and congratulate the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords all right i shall give one or two more examples <e> <s> i am always ready to yield to a little encouragement <e> <s> i was told that interest rates were high under a labour government <e> <s> i agree that they were inhibiting growth and development <e> <s> they were per cent <e> <s> today they are even higher at per cent <e> <s> where is the fundamental transformation there <e> <s> where is the economic miracle that i was told about by mr kenneth baker on the radio this morning <e> <s> the mortgage rate is per cent <e> <s> when we left office it was per cent <e> <s> personal savings were about per cent <e> <s> today they are about per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> as for the health of this <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not be appropriate if the minister were to reply to the noble and learned lord lord hailsham with the immortal words of adlai stevenson if they will stop telling lies about us we will stop telling the truth about them <e>"]
