["<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that satisfactory answer and i hope it will not take too long we do not want any more disasters <e> <s> some major ones have occurred there <e>", "<cs> as a simple honorary sheriff of some age and having discussed this bill with certain other sheriffs in the north of scotland and the highlands i still think this is a good clause <e> <s> we know that it does not lay out any further penalties for vandalism they are quite heavy for malicious damage but the point is that malicious damage sounds extraordinarily legal and a lot of people do not understand it <e> <s> everybody in the united kingdom understands the word vandalism and i think that is one of the benefits of this particular clause <e>", "<cs> i must answer that if i may <e> <s> i think it is very largely up to their parents to understand it in many cases <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his answer but it is not entirely satisfactory <e> <s> may i ask whether the government realise that the original charter of the north of scotland hydro-electric board was devised largely for the benefit of the highlands and islands and that has not taken place <e> <s> we have to a large extent been absorbed by the south of scotland electricity board and our headquarters have been moved out of our area <e> <s> in fact the savings that could be made in the administration would probably <e>", "<cs> may i ask the minister whether this particular section and various scottish peers may be speaking to it applies to the police in scotland <e> <s> while i am not in it any more i have been in local government a very long time and i have therefore been on police committees and i should like to know because very often the positions are quite different <e>", "<cs> before the minister answers this point may i say that i feel that i have some right to speak <e> <s> since leaving out the war years when i was doing something else i have been in local government in fact i was convener of my county <e> <s> we have all been talking about opposition and parties <e> <s> now we in the highlands do not let party politics enter our local government at all and we are very much the better for it <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to thank from my heart all the speakers that have taken part in the debate <e> <s> it has been a most useful debate with constructive speeches from every side of the house <e> <s> what has been said in the debate may prove to be extremely useful when the report comes out <e> <s> we shall be interested to see what the report contains and perhaps we shall make a noise about it if we do not like it <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend sits down would he not agree that ireland has done very well without adders since the days of st patrick <e> <s> i cannot entirely agree that they are a completely disappearing species <e> <s> i can assure him that in ross and cromarty i can show him quite a lot if there is a decent summer <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support my noble friend <e> <s> i come from the gaelic-speaking area which is not necessarily the hebrides either <e> <s> in many places in the highlands there is still a very considerable knowledge and use of the gaelic language <e> <s> it is not spoken to the same extent as when i was a boy but it is still used to a great extent <e> <s> so far as the welsh language is concerned i understand that the greatest number of welsh speakers abroad were all down near tierra del fuego and patagonia <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say a few words on this <e> <s> the noble lord lord ross knows very well that i live in the far north and that i have been on education committees in local government for some considerable time although i am not any longer <e> <s> i would put one point of view <e> <s> where you get say the south-western coast of sutherland or wester ross you have a boarding scheme of sorts already and it is not always very satisfactory <e> <s> those children have to come in a long way in the case of sutherland to golspie or to ding-wall in the case of ross and cromarty <e>", "<cs> i want to join in on this one because i am thinking particularly of the highland region which is a vast area <e> <s> i do not think the region in that case is suitable for issuing these licences <e> <s> it is done much better under the districts for the reasons we have just heard <e> <s> in the more concentrated regions there might be a case but for a huge region like the highland region such a change is not on and i prefer to see it done by the districts <e>", "<cs> my lords we are most grateful to my noble friend lord perth <e> <s> he has gone through the main points very thoroughly indeed and so i shall not detain your lordships for long <e> <s> however there are just one or two points that i should like to make <e> <s> there is an idea which rather follows on from what the noble lord lord mackie of benshie was saying about the localised museum <e> <s> it might be possible to have some travelling exhibitions <e> <s> we know that in edinburgh a considerable number of things are never seen or never shown because there has never been room to do so <e> <s> some things might be lent even to the local museums <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend the minister whether he is aware that when the north of scotland hydroelectric board was formed it was formed with the definite undertaking that it would be for the benefit of the highlands <e> <s> unfortunately that fact has been forgotten for a number of years but is my noble friend aware that the closure of the corpach pulp mills and more latterly the smelter at invergordon is very largely due to the appalling <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that some time ago i asked a question about oil spillage in the minch <e> <s> the answer was not very satisfactory <e> <s> i was told that it was something to do with the laws of the sea <e> <s> is he aware of the danger not only to birds but to people living both on the islands and on the mainland <e> <s> is he also aware that the oil spill could have been very much worse had it been further north where it would have been completely closed in in what is very nearly an inland sea <e> <s> will he ask his noble friend to look more carefully into the question of oil vessels usually sailing under flags of convenience which makes the situation even more dangerous using the minch <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend the minister <e> <s> i am delighted to see that somebody knows the part of the country i am talking about <e> <s> i should like to ask my noble friend another question <e> <s> many years ago before the first world war my father started the first hydro-electric scheme in britain for the benefit of the highlands so that they would have cheap power <e> <s> this was carried on but he had to give it to the scottish power company and it was carried on by them as it was when the first hydro-electric board was formed when that great man tom johnson was secretary of state <e> <s> then quite suddenly without any particular reason all this was altered <e> <s> it was taken away <e> <s> one thing that was also taken away was the headquarters which were supposed to be always in the highlands <e> <s> they are now in edinburgh <e> <s> apart from that <e>", "<cs> my lords the headquarters are not in the highlands and are well out of the hydroelectric area <e> <s> what is more the highlands do not get the benefit which they were supposed by all the founders to get <e> <s> i should like my noble friend to give me some answer to this if he would <e>"]
