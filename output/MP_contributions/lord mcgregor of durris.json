["<cs> my lords the bill introduced by my noble friend lady wootton makes no sudden change in the law it brings as she says a long history to a logical conclusion <e> <s> although we have been chipping away for more than half a century at the foundations of the impediments of affinity we are always and rightly slow to change the law affecting family life <e> <s> this is in part because most of us find changes in this basic social institution very disturbing <e> <s> may i remind your lordships of some of the changes that have occurred in this social institution in the past half century <e> <s> we often talk as though marriage is on the point of collapse <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble earl will allow me i shall come to divorce in a moment <e> <s> some per cent <e> <s> of the population marries nowadays <e> <s> it marries at much younger ages than in the past <e> <s> it remains married for very much longer and out of every couples that marry do not divorce <e> <s> if it be said that divorce is an indication of the weakness of the institution it must be remembered that the huge quantity of divorce that we now have is partly a reflection of the establishment of near equality before the matrimonial law <e> <s> it is a reflection of the much greater quantity of marriage and it is also a reflection of the much higher quality of married life <e> <s> i think that a good deal of divorce results from the fact that some marriages fail to live up to the high expectations of the spouses <e> <s> lastly of course a huge quantity of divorce does not in any way reflect a situation in which the population are refugees from marriage quite to the contrary the highest marriage rates in the country are among divorced persons <e>", "<cs> no my lords i was not suggesting that at all <e> <s> i think that what institutionalists argue is that the greater good for the largest proportion of members of society will result from maintaining the integrity of the institution <e> <s> those who think differently argue the case simply on the basis of experience which suggests that caring for the happiness of individuals strengthens not weakens institutions <e> <s> it is an argument as i see it which must be conducted entirely in terms of the social consequences of the changes in the law that are made <e> <s> the trouble is that we know far too little about these social consequences and sometimes we know far too little because they are extremely difficult to measure <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be hard to over-estimate the importance for ordinary citizens and for society of the subject raised with great legal authority and clarity by the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale <e> <s> during the last years there have been far-reaching changes in the effect which marriage has upon the property of spouses because the law governing matrimonial property in part reflects and in part helps to shape the communitys attitudes to the family and to relationships within it <e> <s> today this law has a vital bearing upon the social situation and status of a woman and upon the most widely spread form of property <e> <s> indeed family property is the <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the first occasion on which married womens property was discussed in your lordships house was in when lord brougham presented a petition signed by a group of literary ladies as they were then described which included mrs gaskell eliza fox elizabeth barrett browning and some other signatories and it was reported that parliament received the petition <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord ardwick has given us the opportunity to discuss where we should draw the line between the freedom of the press to contribute information and comment to public discussion and the constraints upon publication necessary to ensure the fair and proper administration of justice <e> <s> justice requires that a trial should not be endangered by prejudicial publication <e> <s> freedom of expression requires the minimum practicable uncertainty about the legal constraints upon publication which have to be observed <e> <s> as the noble lord lord wigoder pointed out these public goods are of crucial importance to all citizens and not only to lawyers newspaper men and broadcasters <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so i said that the committee concurred with the home offices view that the five-year period was too long and the committee certainly did not and i do not think that i did in what i said make a fetish of overriding administrative convenience <e>", "<cs> my lords i echo what every speaker has already said in expressing my gratitude to the noble lord lord birdwood for initiating this debate <e> <s> there have been authoritative contributions concerning the performance the economics and the general distribution of the press <e> <s> i do not propose to attempt to traverse ground which has already been covered so admirably <e> <s> i intend to spend a few minutes discussing what seem to me to be two major threats to the freedom of the press at the moment <e>", "<cs> this amendment provides an apt illustration of the platitude that rights can be enjoyed and protected only if they are restricted <e> <s> the difficulties of making a wise accommodation between freedoms and responsibilities are sharply clarified in the relations between the press and the institutions of justice <e> <s> a free press and a fair and honourable administration of justice are among the bases of democracy <e> <s> to the extent that this amendment hears upon their relationship it has an importance which goes far beyond the case from which it stems the details of which i intend to ignore <e>", "<cs> my lords the report of your committee carries on page a remarkable table which shows the frequency of radiological examinations per thousand of the population among most of the developed societies <e> <s> it demonstrates provided that the data are accurate that the netherlands has nearly three times the frequency of examinations as does great britain switzerland has exactly three times and germany has four times the british frequency <e> <s> your committee had no evidence that the explanation for britain being at the bottom of this league was to be found in public meanness or public thrift rather to the contrary that the low rate was held to be evidence of the superior protection of citizens in this respect which has been stressed by both the noble lord lord seebohm and the noble lord lord richardson <e>", "<cs> my lords it gives me singular pleasure that i am the first of your lordships to congratulate the noble lord lord marley on his maiden speech <e> <s> it was vigorous crisp practical and elegant and it has sharpened our disappointment that the noble lord has denied the house the benefit of his contributions for so long <e> <s> we are pleased that his silence has finally been broken <e>", "<cs> my lords it is apparent that we are debating a difficult issue <e> <s> whatever the demerits of your sub-committees reports may be obscurity is not among them <e> <s> i should like to join with the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale in expressing my thanks and i am sure those of other committee members to the noble lord lord seebohm the committees chairman for the skill and ability with which he guided our discussions <e> <s> i found the speech of the minister the noble lord lord glenarthur narrow disappointing and depressing <e> <s> he referred to what he called the pragmatic view of the government that nothing is wrong and also stated that little is known about part-time workers <e> <s> yet he did not hesitate to make confident and highly speculative assertions about the effect of implementing proportionality between full-and part-time workers upon the willingness of employers to employ part-time workers <e>", "<cs> my lords abortion touches peoples notions about life and its origins their religious faith their beliefs about marital and sexual relationships their emotional experiences and their views on morality and law <e> <s> in short few subjects define so sharply the nature of a persons outlook <e> <s> accordingly present attitudes to abortion are passionately held as matters always of conscience and often of faith <e> <s> as is so often the case in the sexual area when it comes to deriving rules or guidelines for practical behaviour different consciences reach different and frequently contradictory conclusions <e>", "<cs> since its inception the national poor law imposed a separate and special system of family law upon those within its care <e> <s> patches of that family law still survive as noble lords have pointed out <e> <s> the people in the workhouse under the act whose children had been removed from them on the grounds that they were irresponsible share many of the characteristics of those affected by this system today <e> <s> nowadays most of them or at least about two-thirds of them are lone mothers one parent families <e> <s> they are often the least educated the worst informed and the least literate of our fellow citizens <e> <s> not only do they suffer all those disadvantages but in this particular system they are stripped of their parental rights in circumstances in which as noble lords have pointed out many of them have no understanding of the procedure under which it is done or the purposes for which it is done <e> <s> this seems to me not so much an issue of social policy as an issue in the realm of what the fashionable rhetoric describes as <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships house is indebted to the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale for this opportunity once again to debate family property in the context of the law commissions report on the implications of the case of <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble and learned lord able to say whether the recommendation of the committee on one-parent families the finer committee that conciliation facilities should be available in all courts handling family matters is supported by the findings of the bristol research <e> <s> in particular does that research disclose any savings in the cost of administering family justice as a result of conciliation facilities being available <e>", "<cs> twenty one minutes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i must declare an interest in that i am the present chairman of the advertising standards authority an office in which i have followed three members of your lordships house the noble lords lord drumalbyn lord tweedsmuir and lord thomson of monifieth <e> <s> my intention is to discuss the motion of the noble lord lord hale but i shall not enter into any controversial matters concerning the propriety or impropriety of government advertising in the circumstances or for the purposes that i understand the noble lord lord hale to have in mind <e> <s> but i am grateful to him for giving me the opportunity to clarify the position of the asa on an issue which enters public discussion from time to time and about which there is some misunderstanding <e>", "<cs> my lords as president of the national association of consumers advice bureaux i must declare an interest before reaffirming the complete agreement between the noble lords right honourable friend and the association as to the basis on which the independent review should be carried forward <e> <s> is the noble lord aware of the satisfaction which will be felt among the many full-time and voluntary workers in the service throughout the country at the return of our funding to the normal basis throughout the current financial year <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that the cabs pleasure at the setting up of the independent review arises in part from <e>", "<cs> my lords if i made a mistake i was doubtless misled by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords the squalid episode which my noble friend lord harris of greenwich has enabled us to discuss and i thank him as have all other speakers for giving us the opportunity highlights once again a recurring theme of anxiety about the conduct of the press <e> <s> subsequent speakers can only echo my noble friends compelling opening speech <e> <s> in particular nothing further need be said about the appalling irresponsibility displayed in that instance by some newspapers <e>", "<cs> my lords the issues with which this bill deals touch deeply held and often conflicting views about family life and about the relationship between private and public morality and therefore raise strong feelings <e> <s> for example feelings have been aroused among women who have feared happily mistakenly the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor has reassured us on this point that the bill was intended to strengthen the husbands hand against his wife in respect of maintenance <e> <s> i do not regard this debate as a proper occasion for contributing to such discussions nor do we in the alliance regard the proposals of the bill as a subject for party politics <e>", "<cs> i wish to state to the committee a laymans argument in favor of this amendment <e> <s> it is of vital importance to the community and to the general law that the law regulating family relationships should be respected and it will not be respected unless it is regarded as fair <e> <s> and to be regarded as fair it must be understood <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> i wish to say a few sentences in support of what the noble lord lord mishcon has just urged about family courts <e> <s> i do so against a background in which the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor declared himself in your lordships house some three years ago in terms <e>", "<cs> in view of the sympathetic response of the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor and in view of the expectations that we may have of the report of the booth committee i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords it is hardly necessary to add anything in giving strong support to these amendments beyond saying that the need for them is underlined by the steady increase in the occupation of women and by the steady spread of occupational pension schemes <e>", "<cs> my lords with great trepidation i venture in disagreeing with the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale to attempt to answer his question about why conduct should only be taken into account when it is exceptional <e> <s> my answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble and learned lord <e> <s> one reason why the word exceptional is in the amendment is that it is in line with ordinary peoples experience <e> <s> when one hears people talking about the collapse of a marriage of people they know or to whom they are related they nowadays talk along the lines of saying well it is impossible to make any judgment it is six of one and half a dozen of the other <e> <s> that is the view that sensible outsiders generally take except in circumstances where the behaviour of one or both of the spouses has been extreme or pathological <e> <s> for <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house <e>", "<cs> i see <e> <s> what i hoped might be possible would be for us to withdraw the second part of the following amendment and to follow the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones by accepting what he has just said <e> <s> i should like to make some comments on the general research that is proposed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble and learned lord on the woolsack for his friendly response to the amendment which we said at the beginning we intended as a matter for consideration not for division <e> <s> i very much regret that the amendment invaded his dressing room <e> <s> i think it is fair to point out that the amendment has been slightly reworded from the one that we originally put down for the committee stage and that all the changes have been made to conform with what the noble and learned lord on the woolsack said in committee <e> <s> as now couched the amendment carries some of his own phrases <e> <s> perhaps some of the further discussion that the noble and learned lord mentioned can take place at third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords like other speakers i am exceedingly grateful to the noble lord lord vaizey for giving us the opportunity to debate this significant very important and i think very difficult question <e> <s> i speak with great hesitation because my knowledge of unesco is slight and recent as compared with that of other speakers <e> <s> my involvement has arisen in respect of lord vaizeys fourth and fifth questions about the threats to the free flow of information and human rights <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish briefly to thank the noble and learned lord on the woolsack for his willingness to promote research into an area of ignorance which caused the law commission considerable anxiety <e> <s> it may well be that in a few years research in england will catch up with that being done in scotland <e> <s> there appears to be a notable discrimination between the two countries in that the lack of resources which has bedevilled this work in england does not seem to have affected the scots who are able to produce a steady stream of admirable research on this subject <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to look very briefly at marriage breakdown as one of the segments affecting choice to which the noble baroness lady burton referred <e> <s> most women and most men too for that matter marry and therefore choice within and in respect of marriage is crucially important to the subject that we are now discussing <e> <s> that choice has widened enormously during this century <e> <s> at its beginning the bonds of marriage were bonds indeed legal theological social and economic <e> <s> when a parent said to a daughter who was about to marry you are making your bed and you must lie on it that was a statement of fact <e> <s> once married only the rarest of women could escape <e> <s> today the bonds of marriage have dissolved into the ties of choice and the basis of choice is nothing stronger nor weaker than loyalty <e> <s> external compulsions no longer have the power to compel <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no party view of this measure on these benches beyond the unanimity with which we welcome the endeavours of the honourable member for luton south and the noble lord lord nugent in this house for tackling what is on any showing an urgent and difficult problem <e> <s> i must at the outset declare a connection though i do not think that it amounts to an interest in that about a year ago i was asked if i would consider becoming chairman of a video standards council modelled on the advertising standards authority <e> <s> i agreed in principle subject to the approval of the council of the advertising standards authority <e> <s> however although that body agreed nothing came of the invitation because the proposed council was never established <e>", "<cs> just so my lords <e> <s> the noble lord lord mishcon has raised a rather obvious point to which i intended to address myself later <e> <s> if he will be so kind as to be patient with me i shall come to it <e>", "<cs> my lords i speak from a double interest as honorary president of both the national association of citizens advice bureaux and the national council for one parent families <e> <s> it is therefore no part of my intention to make political party or even controversial points <e>", "<cs> i would find it helpful in making up my mind about lord houghtons amendment if the minister could say something about the manner in which it is proposed that this subsection should be applied <e> <s> to the uninstructed eye nothing is easier than to discern some extremely difficult points of application in the subsection quite apart from the fact that the meaning of the phrase to any significant extent is by no means clear <e> <s> but on any of the parts of the subsection one can imagine the difficulty of any body deciding whether or not a tape should be exempted <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord would say what the proposed charge for classifying a video will be and also tell us what the present charge is for classifying a film <e>", "<cs> i find it difficult to understand why the labels of existing videos cannot be overstamped <e> <s> but even assuming that they cannot be in respect of new videos the clause as it stands certainly gives the power to require the package and the video to show its classification but it confers no power to require that the classification should be legible <e> <s> that is the main purpose of the amendment put down by my noble friend in respect of all printed advertising <e> <s> there is no requirement of a particular size of print because printed advertising varies so much in shape and size that it would be unrealistic to make such a requirement but there is a requirement of legibility <e> <s> that is enforced according to circumstances <e> <s> it has been emphasised by the noble lord lord nugent and the minister that a main purpose of this bill is not to establish pre-censorship but to enable purchasers to know what they are buying <e> <s> it therefore seems entirely in line with the intention of the promoters of the bill to put in a requirement as to a particular size and type on the spool itself and on the package <e>", "<cs> i shall not take up the time of the committee by rehearsing the arguments with which the amendment has already been opposed because i support them all <e> <s> if the noble lord lord mishcon will forgive my saying so the point that he made was a lawyers point cogent as such but not touching the reality or experience which i have had of children of that age <e> <s> it should also be added to what has already been said that at the age of there is a very wide difference in the degrees of maturity exhibited by children <e> <s> and not only is there a wide difference in the range of maturities <e> <s> the same child may differ very considerably from day to day <e> <s> it seems to me that all the arguments point to selecting the age of as the safe decision <e>", "<cs> with the leave of the committee i should like to speak not only to this amendment but also to the amendments to clause and clause <e> <s> i should like to deal with one major point in these amendments which seek to delete references to journalistic material from the bill <e> <s> what is the justification of the privileged exemption of the professions protected in the bill <e> <s> the principle seems to stand on the necessity to protect interests vital to society <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree that it might be helpful if he were to indicate to the proprietors of newspapers in particular of tabloids in fleet street that the publication of gambling sheets is a poor basis for arguing that vat would be a tax on knowledge <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble and learned lord agree that a not too distantly related aspect of the criminal law of treason is the law of sedition <e> <s> in the current atmosphere particularly in the coalfields of great britain would it not be prudent for the law officers of the crown all four of them to have a review and careful consideration of the law relating to sedition <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not add directly to what has already been said about section of the act <e> <s> i wish only to comment on one aspect of the legislation proposed in the motion of the noble lord lord wigoder <e>", "<cs> my lords this report though having the title <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to declare an interest as president of the

second reading debate <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to take up time by traversing the ground already covered by the noble lords lord graham and lord beloff <e> <s> i should however like to say a few sentences in support of the principle contained in amendment no <e> <s> za <e> <s> the noble lord lord beloff stressed the importance of history <e> <s> it would be an impertinence to address the noble lord the minister on the subject <e> <s> it is nevertheless worthwhile repeating what sir keith joseph said last year about the importance of an element of national not nationalistic history being an inescapable part of any balanced school history course if pupils are to understand how shared values have been developed in their own society <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord the minister agree that there has been nothing incompatible between the maintenance of a free press and the recently achieved informal agreement among chief constables and editors in respect of kidnapping and terrorism within these islands <e> <s> might it not well be worth considering international action in respect of the reporting of such events <e>", "<cs> my lords robert alexander the chairman of the bar council but <e>", "<cs> my lords the education system is a filter through which children pass on their way to the labour market <e> <s> no country would survive for long if it were to neglect

critical and informed eye to the assessment of the policies and promises of politicians <e> <s> an electorate in a stable democracy must have learnt its letters <e> <s> but a mature society demands more than competent workers and informed voters <e> <s> it must equip citizens with the means of access to the cultural heritage not only of their own country but of the civilisation of which they are a part <e>", "<cs> this is a very important amendment <e> <s> it is important in principle <e> <s> yesterday the house discussed higher education and from the government benches the importance of science natural and applied and of technologies was heavily emphasised not only for its economic but for its total implications <e> <s> here we are as the noble earl has just said putting harriers in the way of the acquisition of knowledge by sixth formers <e> <s> this is the sort of barrier which affects the attitudes of parents and of people being taught <e> <s> i am told that undergraduates are already entering medical schools and biology departments without any experience of dissection and that the situation is deteriorating <e> <s> this is not the way we enter into new educational attitudes and i very much hope that the noble lord the minister will accept the amendment of the noble lord lord adrian <e>", "<cs> some noble lords appear to think that inspectorates of this nature are there for the purpose of prosecuting <e> <s> they are not they are there for the purpose of persuading <e> <s> they have worked in that way since they were first introduced in the s <e> <s> far from moving inspectors around as though they are likely to be corrupted by contact with the people with whom they are working the basis of their work is friendship and respect <e> <s> i think that

waste <e> <s> the waste will not in any way promote the objects of the bill <e> <s> waste in this area is to be deplored <e> <s> in the university of london alone the capital cost of this bill and

costs of buying unnecessary animals whose additional purchase and additional use in laboratories will add nothing to the objectives of the bill <e> <s> the minister has been so reasonable and so balanced in his judgments in discussions of the amendments that i wish to ask him whether he will reconsider this particular clause and look with some blessing on this amendment <e>", "<cs> surely the argument of the noble lord lord adrian is compelling <e>", "<cs> with the permission of the committee the noble lord lord beaumont of whitley has had to leave the chamber <e> <s> he asked me on his behalf and with the leave of the committee to indicate that his remaining amendments are not be moved <e>", "<cs> my lords there is some public anxiety that this amendment would introduce a most undesirable restriction upon the considerations which the secretary of state bears in mind in determining whether or not and on what terms to grant a project licence <e> <s> as i understand it the

amendment will be happy to pay attention to what the noble and learned lord lord denning has said <e> <s> speaking as a layman it seems to be easy to add to the amendment a phrase to the effect that in no circumstances would anything that the lord chancellor did in discharging the duty or obligation be actionable <e>", "<cs> i am grateful the noble and learned lord is right <e> <s> i was speaking of civil legal aid where the problems are different <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that some of us who support very strongly the need for extending and improving the <e>", "<cs> my lords we are discussing where the line between creative work and the rights of employees should be drawn <e> <s> the whitford committee considered this point and said as a general principle that employers must be able to expect that if they engage someone to produce copyright work as part of his day-to-day work and pay him to do this then they and they alone should be entitled to the use of that work

amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> the bill as originally drafted provided that the right to be identified as an author and the right to object to unjustified modification of a work would apply to the

lordships select committee was in no way concerned with the rightness of abortion as such but only with its propriety at a gestational age of more than weeks the subject matter of its report is still very difficult to handle calmly <e> <s> the committees chairman the noble and learned lord lord brightman has expounded lucidly and succinctly the conclusions of the committee which he guided and led superbly <e> <s> i do not intend to traverse the general ground or to examine more than one of the reasons for its conclusions <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be helpful if the minister could explain why the points that the noble lord has just raised are not covered by the phrase or other radiation <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his exposition of the regulations <e> <s> i do not intend to take up the time of the house beyond stating my interest in my capacity as chairman of the advertising standards authority <e>", "<cs> my lords ideally the media serve democracies as the chief institutions in a market place where day-to-day information news and ideas are exchanged <e> <s> they inform their readers about the world and interpret it to them <e> <s> they stand as sentinels scrutinising concentrations of public and private power <e> <s> they act as a means of communication among groups within the community thus promoting social cohesion as well as social change <e> <s> from a political point of view the most important function of the media is to provide the main channels along which information runs reciprocally between government and the governed <e>", "<cs> my lords from the point of view of the quality of life in hong kong after the implementation of paragraph of the joint declaration is of central importance <e> <s> the paragraph declares that the hong kong special administrative region government <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to press the amendment the noble and learned lord having indicated i hope i understood his indication correctly that he has it in mind to make regulations which might in the future lead to a procedure different from that which is followed at the moment which in its procedural aspects is well known to be defective <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am very happy to beg leave to withdraw the extensive amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords it is with trepidation that a layman must rise to speak on the work and organisation of the legal profession in a debate to which many of the most distinguished lawyers in the land are contributing <e> <s> nevertheless the government have said <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister said that last year million was paid in motoring fines <e> <s> can he give the figure of the total number of unpaid fines during that period <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome greatly the ministers statement that the government attach great importance to a self-regulatory press council <e> <s> i welcome also his statement of the governments reluctance to see any form of statutory intervention from which he would expect to see grave dangers to the freedom of the press <e> <s> i find that very encouraging <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs for giving the house an opportunity to examine the continuing importance of the family and to consider the social provision made for it <e> <s> of its continuing importance there need be no doubt <e> <s> one of the very few generalisations that is true of human societies is that all have a family institution which prescribes conditions for sexual relationships child bearing and child rearing and ensures in the course of socialising the young the transmission of ethical and cultural values across the generations <e> <s> for us it is also the unit within which men and women find themselves best able to satisfy not only their sexual needs but also the need for sympathy mutual aid and intimacy <e>", "<cs> my lords what the noble and learned lord on the woolsack in his lucid thorough even-handed and helpful opening described as the drafting innovation of clause of this critically important bill is central <e> <s> it presents the legislator with a choice of permitting or renouncing research on the human embryo <e> <s> like the noble lord lord ennals i speak for myself alone <e>", "<cs> my lords we must recognise that the debate on this bill does not centre on issues of right or wrong but is directly an exploration of conflicts of values <e> <s> views derived from the beliefs of the roman catholic church are necessarily opposed to abortion though even in that church there are differences of opinion <e> <s> the mainstream of protestant theology and the moral tradition to which it has given rise permits abortion under careful legal regulation and generally approves the provisions which were embodied in the act <e> <s> but again there are disagreements among those in that tradition <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to know that <e> <s> but i am now exceedingly puzzled to know what is the purpose of the noble dukes amendment <e> <s> before i sit down i shall seek to attempt to demonstrate to the noble duke exactly why i think that he and his co-religionists are attempting to impose their views upon those of us who do not accept them <e>", "<cs> no my lords i am not suggesting any such thing <e> <s> i based what i said in respect of the conduct of abortions on the very extensive evidence which is printed in the report of the select committee <e> <s> the committee received a great deal of evidence from gynaecologists and obstetricians <e>", "<cs> my lords i greatly welcome the assurance given by the noble baroness lady elles <e> <s> however it never entered my head that such language or i hope such thoughts would have been present in the mind of any noble lord who has contributed or listened to the debate <e> <s> but assuredly such thoughts such violence such lack of charity and such contempt for opponents are widely present <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to intervene briefly <e> <s> i was attempting to say to the noble duke simply that in respect of this issue there is a conflict of values and that he as a member of the minority wished to deny facilities to me and to a majority of people in this country who wish to have them <e> <s> on the other hand for our part we do not wish to impose anything that is repugnant to the conscience of the noble duke or his co-religionists <e> <s> that is precisely the point that i was making <e>", "<cs> i share many of the anxieties of the noble lord lord ennals about these amendments <e> <s> in the first place they will introduce a new form of discrimination against women <e> <s> the bill as amended would exclude unmarried infertile women from certain treatments involving embryo research but would give unmarried men who can benefit from such treatments access to all the facilities <e>", "<cs> it should be said that the membership of the present interim licensing authority under the chairmanship of dame mary donaldson covers all the categories of persons mentioned in amendment no <e> <s> and includes many more besides <e> <s> it is important to note that the interim licensing authority has established itself very firmly as a body having achieved public confidence <e>", "<cs> i am chairman of an independent self-regulatory body which enforces a code of practice upon all print advertising <e> <s> nobody would wish to appoint a group or persons of monolithic unity of view to any such body <e> <s> however if it is to work at all there must be a consensus of opinion <e> <s> in the case that i have in mind there must be a consensus that self-regulation is a method of achieving the task superior to statutory regulation <e> <s> in any such body if consensus cannot be built among the members the job which the body exists to undertake simply cannot be performed <e>", "<cs> i wish to underline one point which the noble lord lord ennals made in moving the amendment <e> <s> i refer to a quotation which he also used from the third report of the voluntary licensing authority published in <e> <s> at page paragraph the authority states <e>", "<cs> as the noble viscount said many noble lords voted for the continuance of research on the footing that the strict control established by the voluntary licensing authority would be continued by the new statutory authority <e> <s> as the noble earl said it is self-evident that if the new authority is to do its job effectively and fulfil the expectations of members of this chamber it must at least establish annual inspections and do so on the basis of a fully qualified inspectorate <e> <s> it is only on that basis that public confidence in the regulation of research of this nature can be fully established <e> <s> i very much hope that the noble baroness will be able to accept the noble viscounts amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to underline the point about administrative delay made by the noble lords lord rea and lord houghton <e> <s> in a dozen or so years experience as president of the national council for one parent families i have been concerned with what may be the most tragic group of girls who suffer the regrettable consequences as my noble friend lord winstanley described them of abortion the very young the and year-olds <e>", "<cs> my lords the bill has compelled many lay members of your lordships house to make considerable intellectual efforts to understand points of view with which they disagree <e> <s> i have done my best to understand the point of view that underlies the amendment proposed by the noble lord the chief rabbi <e> <s> i read several times the essay that he wrote on the status of the embryo in jewish tradition in a book of essays edited by the reverend professor gordon dunstan to whom the noble lord lord walton has already referred <e> <s> i should like to state two difficulties that i have with the position <e>", "<cs> my lords i understood that in introduction the noble lord lord jakobovits said that he was speaking to amendments nos <e> <s> and and i am most concerned that they should not be neglected in the discussion <e> <s> i am sorry it was amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> if the noble baroness will permit me i shall continue with my lecture but it will be exceedingly brief <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment moved by the noble earl <e> <s> clearly the more information that is made available in the annual reports of the authority for the public more educated public opinion will become on an area of very great importance both medically and morally <e> <s> i therefore hope that your lordships house will strongly support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the principle of the amendment as strongly as i opposed the principle of the amendment tabled by the noble lady lady saltoun at committee stage <e> <s> this is a happy extension of a principle which has now been part of english law for more than half a century <e> <s> it is greatly to be welcomed <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree strongly with the noble baroness lady warnock <e> <s> i do not see how the amendment could be enforced <e> <s> if it were to be enforced it would as she said be done only by turning clinicians and workers in clinics into private inquiry agents <e>", "<cs> my lords there is all the difference in the world in that and giving counselling in proper circumstances in a proper setting by people who are properly qualified to give it <e> <s> the amendment makes no reference as does the previous amendment to proper counselling <e> <s> it would inevitably drag questions of status into the issue and if the noble lord lord prys-davies is correct in his interpretation of article of the european convention on human rights it would cause major difficulties <e> <s> i am at a loss to understand what benefits the amendment would confer which are not much better provided by the amendment to which the house has just agreed <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to add to any of the arguments save to press again a question which i put to the noble baroness in committee and which the noble earl lord jellicoe has asked again this evening <e> <s> i should like to know why the government have decided as regards the charging methods to disregard the very forceful and cogent advice on the consequences and difficulties of charging from the only body the interim licensing authority which has experience in that area <e> <s> i shall be very grateful if the noble baroness will help me on that <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask the noble lord what principle lies behind the amendment <e> <s> my understanding is that in england people may marry with their parents permission at the age of and with the permission of the summary court if the parents refuse <e> <s> i understand that a summary court rarely refuses permission <e> <s> for all i know there may well be circumstances in which a married couple aged or might require treatment which involved what the amendment prohibits <e> <s> i do not understand the principle that is embodied in the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to welcome this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i supported the noble viscount in committee and i support him now <e> <s> the authority is the key to securing public confidence in the operation of the bill <e> <s> therefore it must be clear that if the authority does not have the capacity to appoint the sort of inspectors that the noble viscount mentioned its utility in this respect must be diminished <e> <s> in my view anything which would imperil the ability of the new body to secure public confidence would be tragic <e> <s> i very much hope that the noble baroness will feel able to accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am grateful to the noble and learned lord for the amendment which provides a very acceptable <e>", "<cs> my lords at this stage in our consideration of the bill i feel that we should discharge some debts of gratitude <e> <s> first our thanks go to the noble baroness lady warnock for the report of her committee which defined many of the significant issues of this tangled subject in such a manner that they could be determined as they had to be determined by public policy <e> <s> her report was certainly the forerunner of the white paper of <e>", "<cs> my lords it is my privilege to congratulate on behalf of the whole house the noble lord lord morris of castle morris on his illuminating elegant witty and very informative speech and to say how we all look forward greatly to his future contributions to our debates <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the results of tests carried out <e>", "<cs> the difficulty with what the noble lord lord rees-mogg has just said is that the council will certainly be able to say that that is inappropriate for it <e> <s> however no regulatory body can face complainants with the mere statement that the complaint is inappropriate <e> <s> reasons will have to be given <e> <s> reasons cannot be given unless an inquiry is made into the complaint <e>", "<cs> in my search for reassurance i have listened with great care to what the minister said <e> <s> however surely there is a fundamental difference between programmes and advertisements <e> <s> it is that before the advertisements appear on the screen they have been subjected to precisely those standards although not only those standards which it is the purpose of the council to apply to ordinary programmes <e> <s> the standards to which the existing regulatory machinery applies are also so tight that there are and have been no complaints about advertisements on the grounds of their sexual violent or obscene content or their use of bad language <e> <s> therefore there surely is a fundamental difference <e> <s> i cannot see that it is part of the same concept <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl for saying that he will consider what has been said <e> <s> on that basis i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords will the right reverend prelate give the house his evidence that <e>", "<cs> my lords it was both of us <e>", "<cs> my lords it is late but i wish to make a few very brief comments on one or two speeches
