["<cs> my lords i think i might begin by helping the noble lord lord aylestone out of a dilemma <e> <s> he was worried i believe about a definition of good taste and decency <e> <s> in the writers guild of great britain our definition of good taste and decency is the man who would never dream of drinking a glass of vintage port without having his trousers on <e> <s> that needs thinking about <e>", "<cs> i hesitate and i know it is at my peril to go against the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones but i think he ought to be a little consistent in his attitude <e> <s> i remember when the noble and learned lord sat on the woolsack and once or twice we raised questions of amending the law because there was some fault in it <e> <s> he said we must wait for a proper review of the entire law and then it will all be put right <e> <s> now he is standing up and proposing that we should take one small area and impose <e>", "<cs> of course it did not <e> <s> of course it was the view of a writer and a group of producers who put forward a view <e> <s> had the noble baroness done it would it have been any better <e> <s> would it not have been biased <e> <s> but at least we have to have programmes of this kind <e> <s> if we do not we shall have jellyfish television which is worth nothing <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord give way <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down may i thank him for his courtesy in giving way <e> <s> he mentioned the death of a princess and he stated i hope he meant it that it was his view that it was a gross distortion <e> <s> dull it may have been but you cannot say it was a distortion without consulting the writer who i think tried to do a very honest job <e> <s> had you had a similar film about the soviet union or about china or about some country that we were not heavily dependent upon for oil there would not have been the same outcry <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment moved by the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very sorry that i have to oppose this amendment <e> <s> i abstained from voting on the last amendment of the noble lord lord hatch because i do not believe that one should impose obligations on the broadcasters and i oppose this amendment for much the same reason <e> <s> i was terribly shocked <e>", "<cs> my lords many noble lords have said that television is the one media which most people watch that it is their one channel of news <e> <s> the implication i listened very carefully is that television should take on this onerous task <e> <s> i never cease to be shocked by the immodesty of some people in parliament <e> <s> can we not all be honest and say that sometimes our proceedings are so boringly dull as to send us all to sleep <e> <s> when i think of parliament in relation to broadcasting i have to tell your lordships that to broadcast every single day some report of the proceedings of parliament would do for television what the boston strangler did for door-to-door salesmanship <e>", "<cs> it is not going to have enough money <e> <s> i can assure noble lords that it is going to be begging for more money and that it will be coming back to parliament for more money within months to two years <e> <s> when it comes to making international programmes i can tell noble lords that they are made at enormous cost <e> <s> if the fourth channel had to follow the guidelines laid down in for example the last amendment the cost would be out of all proportion <e> <s> therefore i beg parliament and your lordships please stop trying to impose more obligations on broadcasters <e> <s> this is a very good bill which lays down the broad outlines for the fourth channel <e> <s> please let them get on with it <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e> <s> will he give me <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that your lordships will be surprised to hear me say that i rise to oppose the amendment <e> <s> i have the greatest sympathy with the noble lord lord nugent of guildford and with the feelings behind the amendment because i know that there are a number of people who are occasionally offended and sometimes offended in depth by some of the programmes that are presented on the bbc and the itv companies network <e> <s> personally i believe that some of those programmes are absolutely necessary <e> <s> i speak as a small creative worker in the vineyard of television when i say that sometimes we have to extend the confine of peoples thinking to move them forward not a yard but an inch <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble viscount give way <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble viscount give me the name of the producer and of the director of the play that he described earlier where there is a naked young lady running down the street <e>", "<cs> my lords i think this is a very reasonable compromise and on behalf of creative writers i welcome it very much and thank the noble lord lord belstead for the care and attention he has given to this problem <e> <s> i can only say to the noble lord lord drumalbyn that it is not just a question of verifying the facts <e> <s> of course all responsible writers in fact all writers when they are embarking on a major programme of this sort are conditioned to the maximum to researching and investigating the facts <e> <s> there is no question at all about that <e> <s> in fact if they were not so conditioned the television companies or the bbc would intervene to see that they were <e> <s> one then enters another area beyond the five years we were talking about where one is discussing the motivations and where the writers concept of history must intervene <e> <s> it is a perfectly fair thing that this should happen <e> <s> first one establishes the facts for example that there was an invasion of suez and that a certain number of countries were involved <e> <s> but the argument about what was the motivation for the suez episode can go on and will go on for the next hundred years

may i intervene for one moment <e> <s> i have not had an opportunity to read the report so i cannot comment on it but i should like to ask the noble baroness whether she would say one other thing which follows on directly from what the noble lord lord winstanley has said <e> <s> as your lordships know we have recently been debating the broadcasting bill during which there has <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to provide disqualification of persons with criminal records from practising as security officers <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill he now read a second time <e> <s> may i say by way of preface that in introducing this bill it is no part of my purpose to attack or denigrate the security industry <e> <s> it has its ragged edges and its unsavoury underbelly and i shall come to this later but by and large it occupies an honourable position in our society and plays an important role in the struggle against crime <e> <s> many security guards are in the front line in this struggle and one can only commend them for their courage and dedication courage and dedication which i may add is often poorly rewarded <e> <s> i heard only the other day of a security organisation which had been successful in detecting an ira man and reporting him to the police and much of that kind of good work goes on with the security companies <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord boston of faversham and the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge for their warm support and for their very positive sometimes critical approach to this bill <e> <s> i am sorry that the noble lord lord belstead trotted out some of the same arguments slightly retreaded that we have had on this queston over the last few years for example the old one that to pass a bill of this sort would be to confer or would seem to imply that we were conferring some official recognition on the security organisations <e> <s> i do not think that it would confer any more recognition on the security organisations than we confer now <e>", "<cs> my lords in the spirit of christmas will the noble lord himself undertake and ask others not to use the word confidentiality which has no basis whatsoever in the english language <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord is aware that the decision to move ahead with satellite broadcasting will be warmly welcomed but i wonder also whether he would comment on one particular very important point of principle that arises out of this <e> <s> for over years the bbc has in return for a licence fee given the best product available to those people who have paid the licence fee <e> <s> now however in this proposal we have a change and a change of very deep principle <e> <s> we are now going to create first- and second-class viewers of the bbc <e> <s> in the past you could expect that the bbc would provide you with the best films at its disposal <e> <s> in the future you will not get those best films at least on the first run unless you pay the satellite broadcasting fee the subscription service fee <e> <s> this is a very radical point of departure for the british broadcasting corporation and for the government and i find it one which has alarming possibilities <e> <s> it leads to all kinds of questions of advertising commercialisation of the bbc and so forth <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble lord would care to comment on that <e> <s> because it is causing some concern in the circles in which i move <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join other noble lords in thanking my noble friend lord lloyd of hampstead for introducing this debate which is very timely <e> <s> i have also to declare an interest in that i am an author and the owner of a copyright <e> <s> i am also chairman of the authors lending and copyright society which collects royalties and other sums of money for authors from various parts of the world and from various organisations <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may interrupt the noble lord does the size of the problem really matter <e> <s> is it not a question of principle <e> <s> if something is being stolen do not you stop it being stolen whether it is or l million <e>", "<cs> my lords i spent last saturday afternoon at gatwick airport waiting for an aeroplane that had been delayed three times <e> <s> when it eventually arrived five hours late your lordships may imagine that it was a heartwarming experience and i feel rather the same today as i stand up and find that public lending right has at last come before the house in its final form <e> <s> it has been a very long haul not only for me but for my fellow authors and we are i am afraid in danger of being drowned in euphoria about this particular scheme <e> <s> i do want to join in the general congratulations offered to the minister for producing an efficient scheme a scheme which has taken some consideration of the criticisms that authors have put forward and which i hope will work in fact i am sure it will work <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords who have spoken i applaud the motives of my noble friend lord jenkins in putting forward this bill particularly his concentration on the needs of the poorer sections of the community in relation to the licence fee <e> <s> but <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord allow me to interrupt <e> <s> i have never had any constituents but i move around the country doing extensive research with ordinary people for the programmes that i write <e> <s> i think that they are as much constituents as the constituents of any mp <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord allow me to intervene <e> <s> i am sure he is making a most stimulating speech but cannot hear a word <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is not near enough to it <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to introduce a bill to amend section of the copyright act so as to extend the definition of authorisation of infringement of copyright <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords it is just over a year ago since i last addressed your lordships on the subject of copyright <e> <s> on that occasion i said if your lordships will allow me to quote <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to all noble lords who have spoken today <e> <s> i must say that this afternoon i felt that i had one of my greatest triumphs when the noble lord lord mishcon said that there were certain clauses in this bill that would make lawyers tremble <e> <s> it has long been my ambition to make lawyers tremble and if this bill goes a small way towards achieving that lifetimes ambition then i shall be delighted <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join in the greeting that has been given to the noble viscount <e> <s> i speak as somebody working within television <e> <s> of all the ministers who have had responsibility for television it would be the general view that the noble viscount was the most enlightened <e> <s> i find myself <e> <s> too in a curious position today because i usually speak from the heights of the back-bench from which lofty position ministers look very small and remote <e> <s> now i find that they look large and menacing <e> <s> however i am determined to be brave and to press on <e>", "<cs> that is what i heard my lords <e>", "<cs> anyway my lords there is an enormous market for vtrs and that represents great competition to cable <e> <s> there must be a frontier to expansion and i suspect that the cable audience will be drawn largely from existing audiences and as we have heard already the implications for the bbc and especially for itv are very obvious because of the withdrawal of advertising and the consequent effects on standards particularly in the case of commercial companies <e>", "<cs> my lords it falls to me to congratulate the noble lord lord layton on a very eloquent and persuasive maiden speech <e> <s> i do not think he would expect me to accept all his arguments but i hope we shall hear a great deal more of the noble lord not necessarily on films but on other subjects <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will allow me to intervene i should like to ask him to bear in mind that gandhi was financed one-third by america and a little more than one-third by the indian government and it took sir richard attenborough something like years to raise the finance to make that movie <e> <s> moreover it has had a restricted showing in american cinemas simply because of the point i <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister quote one noble lord from this side who made such a statement <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord aylestone for introducing this question <e> <s> it is one of absolutely vital importance <e> <s> the noble lord has covered the ground so well that all i will do briefly in view of the time and the inclement weather is underline one or two of the points he has made <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord saying that there is no legislation available to the british government which will enable them to take the principal not the aiders and abettors to court and that the act we have been discussing is not relevant and will not help us <e> <s> what way is there of taking the principals behind laser and caroline to court <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not a believer in astrology and i very seldom read my chart in the stars <e> <s> however this morning i did happen to glance at mine and it said something like this this is the perfect time to prove that you have a remarkable sense of the ridiculous about certain setbacks or losses <e> <s> also you are aware that a new and more advantageous agreement can be made <e> <s> it is in that spirit that i approach this particular debate i hope that a new and more advantageous bill will arise out of your lordships discussions tonight and in committee <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e> <s> films are made at elstree and shepperton and i think there is a studio still operating at twickenham <e>", "<cs> i indicated at second reading that the idea behind the amendment has my sympathy <e> <s> i am however sorry to have to depart from my noble friends in saying that the amendment cannot have my support <e> <s> i would add in parenthesis that i noticed that the noble viscount lord mersey and the noble lord lord lloyd of hampstead quoted from <e>", "<cs> with respect my noble friend is wrong because channel is supported totally by subscriptions from the itv companies and so the money comes indirectly through the itv companies <e> <s> i believe this is wrong <e> <s> one of the arguments that has been advanced is that the payments made for films shown on television are unfair that they are too low and sometimes they are too rigged <e> <s> i do not believe that for a moment <e> <s> i believe that as has been said there is a pretty free market in films <e> <s> i cannot really believe that the americans are so stupid as to sell films at low prices when they could get better prices for them <e>", "<cs> having briefly wandered into indian country i am delighted to be back in the fold and to support this amendment on the basis that it is a <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble lord is using selective facts with respect <e> <s> i would draw attention again to the point which the noble viscount lord falkland made <e> <s> one can hire a pre-recorded video for one night for or over a weekend for <e> <s> one may ask a dozen people round to see it as many young people do over the weekend <e> <s> many young married couples with children hire video cassettes rather than go to the cinema <e> <s> if one goes to the cinema however it costs or a seat or in the west end it is or <e> <s> there is a tremendous discrepancy there <e> <s> the market is booming now <e> <s> i believe that the penetration of video recorders into homes in this country now is between and per cent <e> <s> it seems to me that this is an area which would get the government off the hook <e> <s> i wonder why they do not grasp the opportunity <e>", "<cs> i am positive that this amendment must appeal to the government and that the noble lord the minister must accept it because it would not cost the government any money <e> <s> all we are proposing in this amendment i congratulate the noble viscount lord falkland on bringing it forward is simply some proposals to reorganise and tighten up a proposal the government have already put forward about the consortium <e> <s> i recognise that it is too late to go back to the nffc to those days <e> <s> we have the consortium <e> <s> what these amendments express are some very reasonable suggestions and ideas as to how it can more suitably serve the british film industry <e> <s> moreover they are amendments which have been echoed in the cinema trade press in various articles and various forms <e> <s> i hope therefore that they commend themselves to the government <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will give way i have had assurances from thorn-emi that they will not interfere with the chief executive and that he will have complete independence <e> <s> one has to believe in the good assurances of these people <e> <s> would the noble lord the minister be prepared to approach them and ask them if they would object to the appointment of one other independent director on the board <e> <s> i think the noble lord would find that they would agree <e> <s> if the minister did that and if they did agree that would be immensely helpful <e>", "<cs> i want briefly to support amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> when i first read the draft of this bill there was a phrase there that struck terror to my heart and i am <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships will remember that in committee i asked the noble lord the minister a direct question as to whether he would consult the participants in the consortium to see if there was any objection on their part to an independent director <e> <s> i look forward very much to hearing what he has to say in that respect because i think he said he would go down that road <e>", "<cs> my lords i find that reply rather frightening <e> <s> in my mind it casts a shadow of gloom over the new consortium <e> <s> what is frightening is that they themselves have said they would not welcome an independent director and i find that rather strange <e> <s> they would welcome an independent director <e>", "<cs> my lords i have two brief points to make <e> <s> first the noble lord lord lloyd mentioned the bbcs contribution as being miserly <e> <s> in fairness to the bbc since it seems a national hobby today to knock that magnificent institution it has to be said that they have their own training facilities and in fact had them long before the national film school existed <e> <s> having made that minor negative point i want strongly to support everything that he has said about the national film school <e> <s> the road to chariots of fire and to the killing fields and the other great and successful british films alas <e> <s> and this was not mentioned earlier was largely financed by american money although they were made by british producers <e> <s> the road to those films stretches straight back to training in the national film school the noble viscount lord mersey said it was the cradle of our talent <e> <s> i therefore strongly support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to congratulate the noble viscount lord mersey on his tenacity and on the way in which he introduced this particular amendment <e> <s> as i indicated in some of our earlier debates it is an amendment that gets a great deal of sympathy from me but i am afraid it is not one that in all honesty i can support <e> <s> i like certain things about it <e> <s> i like the fact that the government should look at the problem again in a years time <e> <s> i like the idea that the government should look at a levy on tapes <e> <s> but i must resist the suggestion that the television companies already giving massive support in one way or another to the film industry should be regarded still as a milch cow to which we go automatically <e> <s> their advertising revenue is slipping <e> <s> as has already been said in other debates satellites and cable are over the horizon and in two or three years time the television companies some of them at least may well be <e>", "<cs> my lords it falls to me to be the first from these benches to congratulate the noble lord lord donoughue and welcome him to these benches and to the house <e> <s> i congratulate him most warmly on his interesting and witty maiden speech <e> <s> i know that we all want to hear him at greater length not too great a length <e> <s> on the subjects on which he is a real expert <e> <s> that is not to say that he knows nothing about football because he was a distinguished member of the chester committee <e> <s> i for one have admired his work in those other fields for a great many years and i look forward to hearing him in more detail <e>", "<cs> i accept that explanation my lords <e> <s> like many other noble lords here i approach the bill with tremendous sadness <e> <s> i have been an enthusiastic supporter of soccer in general and of tottenham hotspur in particular for over years <e> <s> i understand as well as anyone the high feeling that can run on the terraces <e> <s> i can watch any good soccer match and enjoy it with a degree of objectivity <e> <s> i love the skill of the game and the patterns that can be weaved by skilful players <e> <s> but i was born only a mile from the spurs ground and the blue and white of tottenham is in my blood <e> <s> when tottenham is playing it is different <e> <s> i can hear and feel the old tribal rhythms beating in my brain <e> <s> so it grieves me as it does others that this wonderful sport should have reached the shameful position which makes some parts of the bill so necessary <e>", "<cs> i support that but will the minister reply to one of the strong points that the noble lord lord harris made <e> <s> it is that this legislation which is designed to cope with hooliganism at football matches is not really suitable as it stands for extension by a minister or anybody else to other sports <e> <s> the shape of cricket grounds the design of their stands and boxes is totally different from that of football <e> <s> the noble lord made the strong point that cricket can go on for a whole day sometimes three or five days <e> <s> i am not intending a pun but this is a different ball game <e>", "<cs> may i briefly also support the amendment <e> <s> i listened very carefully to the ministers reply at second reading <e> <s> first it seemed to me that his main argument was that it would be unfair to have drinking in private boxes when law-abiding citizens elsewhere in the ground were not allowed to have a drink <e> <s> secondly the minister felt that if those law-abiding spectators in the ground could see through the windows of the boxes someone swigging liquor they would feel badly treated <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord sits down may i ask him to enlighten me <e> <s> i have been puzzled twice this week in connection with the two little words may and will <e> <s> to a simple wordsmith like myself the word may means that you have the right to do something but that you have a choice in the matter <e> <s> the word will means that you will actually do something that you have no choice <e>", "<cs> my lords i join in thanking the noble lord lord annan for introducing this debate <e> <s> i also have to declare an interest in the sense that i am a director of capital radio and i write regularly for television <e> <s> in fact i was working out the other day that i have done series and i am now on my st so both i and my bank manager have to declare an interest in this matter <e> <s> i must apologise to the noble lord lord annan and to those who are to reply for the fact that i shall not be able to stay for the end of the debate <e> <s> had i known years ago that we would be debating this question on this day i would have taken care to have my wedding anniversary on another date <e>", "<cs> my lords i condemn the labour party for doing it as much as any other party and as for the <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not the custom in these debates for the mover of the motion to reply to speeches much as i should like to reply to some of them <e> <s> however i want to thank all noble lords for participating in what i think has been a very useful debate <e> <s> in particular i thank the noble lord lord caradon for his very moving and sincere speech <e> <s> nothing that i or other speakers said earlier detracts from his vision which we all share of a united and peaceful cyprus at some time <e> <s> we may differ about how that may come about but we share the dream <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the motion for papers <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord for his luck in the ballot and for introducing this important debate today in such an interesting way <e> <s> i must begin by declaring an interest in that i am the honorary president of the natural medicine society although i hasten to add that i do not speak on their behalf today but on my own <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord morton of shuna gave a cool but cautious welcome to the bill <e> <s> i should like to give a slightly warmer welcome <e> <s> i think the reason may be that i have been waiting for it a lot longer than he has <e> <s> in fact i feel rather like somebody who has been standing at a railway station on a cold winter morning for a very long time and when the train eventually arrives i do not really care whether it has a buffet car or first class carriages as long as it is there <e> <s> so i welcome the bill and i agree with other noble lords who have spoken about its key importance <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether he would condone the non-payment of television licences <e>", "<cs> my lords i must interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> i object strongly to what he is saying <e> <s> authors do object <e> <s> what he is saying is that authors do not get paid for what they are doing <e> <s> i have no objection to the noble lord taking copies of articles short stories and whatever he likes by means of reprography <e> <s> however there should be some central payment and licensing for that <e> <s> if we do not have that it is theft <e> <s> do not come on with that stuff <e>", "<cs> i do not mind the noble lord disagreeing <e>", "<cs> and you give it away <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has offended me deeply <e>", "<cs> i think that my noble friend is slightly wrong here <e> <s> there could be no copyright in the final object because if one is doing a compilation for example of the second world war or of the life of fred astaire one has to go to other copyright owners to obtain the material <e> <s> that material is vested in them <e> <s> if one wants them to extend the life of the compilation that has been made or if one wants to sell it whoever buys it from the maker has then to go to the original copyright owners once again to obtain their permission <e> <s> no problem arises here <e> <s> the original copyright owners are protected <e> <s> there is no copyright in the compilation in my view quite rightly <e>", "<cs> with respect i think that the noble lord is wrong <e> <s> a compilation is usually made up of excerpts from other copyright material <e> <s> that copyright material remains static for as long as the copyright exists <e> <s> one cannot repeat the compilation unless one has bought the rights of those copyright owners <e> <s> let us take my example of the life of fred astaire <e> <s> one would have to take excerpts from his films <e> <s> one would have to pay the writers the owners of the copyright for those excerpts <e> <s> they would want to know at the time that they were being bought what was to be done with the compilation <e> <s> they might sell the rights to the excerpts for two showings of the compilation <e> <s> there would be no long life to that compilation unless one bought the whole copyright which in most cases would be impossible <e> <s> i do not think a problem arises here because the copyright is protected at the very beginning <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask the government to look at one phrase in the bill particularly on page line the phrase run as a business <e> <s> there is a certain confusion about this and i think it occurs later in the bill in clause <e> <s> what exactly is a public performance <e> <s> for example at the moment if you hire a video tape from your local video shop you are not allowed by the process of hiring to show it in a pub to an audience although we all know that people show it in their homes to audiences <e>", "<cs> i think that we are really making heavy weather of this matter and that we have come back to our old friend compilation <e> <s> if a publisher decides to publish a book about for example the first world war he will first commission an author to write the words and that text will be printed <e> <s> in consultation with the publisher the author may decide that he wants photographs of the first world war which may be in copyright <e> <s> he may also wish to have maps which have to be designed and drawn by an artist <e> <s> copyright for those maps and photographs rests with the people who own the copyright and the publisher will pay for them <e> <s> if it is a childrens book that is being published it may be decided that illustrations are needed and one applies to an artist who will share in the royalties of that book <e>", "<cs> i believe that we have returned to the question of contracting <e> <s> if you ask another photographer to take a picture for you you have a <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to differ from my noble friend on the front bench but i think he has misunderstood the process of film creation <e> <s> film creation begins with the writer <e> <s> somebody comes along and commissions a script <e> <s> in my time i have been commissioned on film scripts <e> <s> on other scripts i have written speculatively <e> <s> however the fact is that the essence of the film begins with the writer <e> <s> the producer is a man who has vision as did richard attenborough with cry freedom <e> <s> he got the whole thing together with the writer and so on <e> <s> to single out the director as this amendment does is a fundamental error <e> <s> film making is essentially a collaborative and collective effort rather like in the theatre <e> <s> however if you search for the wellspring it is the creative writer <e>", "<cs> the present position is that the writer does not have a copyright in the script <e> <s> i have about films which are being shown on television at regular intervals from which i do not receive a penny because they were bought out by my employer <e>", "<cs> what the noble lord does not understand is that when one is a young writer one is screwed into the ground <e> <s> one cannot argue <e>", "<cs> i always write my own blurbs <e>", "<cs> the heart of my noble friend on the front bench is in the right place but i think that he has got this wrong <e> <s> we are getting far too complicated <e> <s> you cannot go into this error <e> <s> you will eventually get the situation where the taxi driver who actually drives the typographer to the printing works will ask for a royalty because he played some part in the creation of the thing <e> <s> no no <e> <s> we know there are authors that there are artists and that there are designers <e> <s> if you go beyond that into typography you get into a forest a nightmare a jungle which i do not think anybody can sort out <e>", "<cs> we are now moving towards one crunch point of the bill which has a great effect on for example clause in respect of which i have an amendment down <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down perhaps i may say that i think there is great sympathy in the committee for the general drift of this amendment in other words that the employee should be given some rights although not a total right <e> <s> irrespective of the wording of the amendment which the noble lord seems to criticise are the government sympathetic to it and will they come hack at another stage with an amendment that will <e>", "<cs> no i am tired <e>", "<cs> that is an apt point <e>

enlightened firm because it allows the copyright to remain with the artist <e> <s> is that so <e>", "<cs> that is commendable <e> <s> i thank those noble lords who have spoken and who have supported the amendment <e> <s> as has been said it is a vital one <e> <s> it was wrong for my noble friend lord howie to return to the dreary business of magazine articles and so forth <e> <s> if he cannot control his own firm he should not complain about his problems in this place <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> in your firm <e>", "<cs> it is a brave man who crosses swords with the noble and learned lord lord denning but may i venture to disagree with him <e> <s> we have a strange situation existing at the moment in europe and we are after all members of the european community <e>", "<cs> perhaps i speak on behalf of myself and the noble lord lord somers <e> <s> as i am proposing to live at least until the year my copyrights will last until the year and i think that that should see out my dearly beloved <e> <s> i should much prefer it to be <e> <s> however in the light of the comment made <e>", "<cs> all my doubts except one have been resolved by the noble and learned lord lord hailsham <e> <s> that remaining doubt is in relation to films and videos <e> <s> i am concerned about the possibility of taking a tiny clip from a major film for use in advertising <e> <s> we have on the box at the moment some commercials that are cleverly clipped together <e> <s> there <e>", "<cs> i rise first to thank the minister for his assurance and secondly to explain my amendment which seeks to remove the word first <e> <s> it is not that i want to put the copyright owner in a position of dictatorship but simply that i should like the government to reconsider the word first <e> <s> there is an implication that a reissue a copy may not have the full copyright and it is therefore that word that worries me <e>", "<cs> what is puzzling me and other noble lords is this <e> <s> why cannot the government say that by the beginning of february they will have an amendment ready <e> <s> that is something like six weeks away <e> <s> as we have heard they have already had many negotiations and consultations <e> <s> why can they not say that <e> <s> what worries me and other noble lords is this <e> <s> is this a government formula for dodging the issue <e> <s> i am not <e> <s> saying that in any way to criticise the minister who i believe is quite sincere in this matter <e> <s> but we have all been here before have we not <e> <s> we all know that there is a formula which says we shall take it back <e> <s> we shall consider it <e> <s> we shall do this and we shall do that <e>", "<cs> i wish to make just a couple of points on this subject <e> <s> after a great deal of thought i am opposed to the amendment <e> <s> one or two points have been wrongly put for example there has been some criticism of the american scheme compared to what might happen here <e> <s> the argument has been that we would not collect much money and that it would all be used up in organisational costs and so on <e> <s> that has nothing to do with it <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to rise once again to oppose my noble friend lord peston <e> <s> i hasten to add that i do not share his academic colleaguesopinion of him <e> <s> his sketch of the source of intellectual property his dream picture of writers and authors drawing on our great culture over the years and therefore creating something which does not belong to them because they have drawn upon our culture is a bit far-fetched <e> <s> one could say that dickens tolstoy or shakespeare drew on the culture of their times but nobody would dream of saying were they living today that they were not entitled to a copyright <e>", "<cs> i hope that i am not opposed to education but i take a firm stand <e> <s> the copyright belongs to the author and creator <e> <s> if somebody wants to copy one page or pages he is very welcome to do so as long as he pays <e> <s> it is as simple as that <e>", "<cs> may not the schools say there is a licensing scheme in operation but we do not want to join it <e> <s> we have heard what has happened in ealing <e> <s> we do not want to join this scheme because we can reproduce as much as we like without it <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the noble earl lord stockton on this <e> <s> i have a great suspicion of this clause arising out of my experience as a writer <e> <s> all my life as a writer i have been cheated by unscrupulous people <e> <s> i have also been treated fairly by a great number of very decent people among whom i am happy to name the noble earl lord stockton <e>", "<cs> if my noble friend will allow me when have educationists ever shown a smidgen of mercy to any of us <e>", "<cs> does my noble friend mean that the author has been raped only once and that the other times do not matter <e>", "<cs> what would you have done or even years ago when there was no reprography <e>", "<cs> i hesitate yet again to oppose my noble friend lord peston but i have some doubts about the amendment for two reasons <e> <s> the first relates to making one copy <e> <s> when <e> <s> every day <e> <s> every other day <e> <s> twice a week <e> <s> i ask my noble friend when <e> <s> the amendment i am afraid is rather flexible about that <e> <s> secondly if there is really need for another copy just one copy for display in the library cannot another copy of the periodical be bought <e> <s> why not <e>", "<cs> i wish to ask the noble lord a question <e> <s> i feel as angry as he does but in an opposite direction <e> <s> is he saying that academic institutions can afford to buy photographic machines machines for reprography and the paper that goes with them but not copies of publications <e> <s> i understand the problems with education <e> <s> i understand about all the cutbacks that have been made and i understand all the difficulties but somehow we have to strike a balance <e>", "<cs> that is totally wrong <e>", "<cs> that is wrong because we are demanding and trying to get through this bill a licensing fee which would enable the author to get his original fee for the article <e> <s> if that article is reproduced times by academics in universities and schools we expect that the author will get some recompense for the times it is reproduced <e> <s> at the moment he does not <e> <s> we are negotiating <e> <s> we have some successful schemes which will enable the author to get some kind of recompense <e> <s> but one cannot say that an author just produces an article once gets his fee and therefore should be happy <e> <s> that is not the situation <e>", "<cs> it may be convenient if i speak to my amendment c which is very similar to the amendment put down by the noble earl lord ferrers <e> <s> my amendment is down in the names of the noble lord lord somers and myself <e> <s> the basic difference apart from the fact that mine is longer and better is that i provide for the government at some stage if necessary to introduce a similar scheme for video <e>", "<cs> tomll fix it will do just as well <e> <s> the fact is if i may say so with the deepest respect that the noble and learned lord is a great and senior professional judge but he is an amateur actor and there are out there a great number of professional actors who are earning a living at what he was doing and who have some concern about copyright <e> <s> they have some concern that the product of their art is being exploited by other people with no return to them <e>", "<cs> we have been talking a great deal about getting the balance right <e> <s> we all want to get the balance right and we all have the normal sympathy for the visually handicapped <e> <s> the government have advanced as one of their most powerful arguments that they are putting the balance on the side of the visually handicapped because they apparently cannot solve that problem <e> <s> they are inflicting a great injustice upon the thousands of composers writers and so on who are involved in this constant ongoing theft of their copyright <e> <s> that cannot be right <e>", "<cs> this is really a question more than anything else to the minister <e> <s> is there not here a problem with something we discussed earlier in the bill about public performance and the definition of what is a public performance <e> <s> we have a growing situation where apart from music being played in pubs often to my horror you now have television sets in pubs and one can stay there and watch plays and everything else <e>", "<cs> i am not entirely convinced by that argument <e> <s> the retransmission need not necessarily be to the same audience <e> <s> you have a classic example <e>", "<cs> i am opposed to this amendment for a very simple reason <e> <s> one of the great glories of our film industry is that over the years we have made some extraordinarily good documentary films going back as far as john grierson <e> <s> i do not see why you should take away from the people who have created documentary films of this kind the kind of right that is included in the bill <e> <s> therefore i think that the amendment is mistaken <e>", "<cs> it is true that freelance writers especially new young freelance writers and directors are at a disadvantage because they are so anxious to have their work on the screen or to have the job that they are prepared to make concessions to the more powerful companies <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am still worried about this and i may have to look at it again <e> <s> as i understood it in law and perhaps the lawyers among us can tell me it is possible to obtain damages for injured feelings <e> <s> is that true <e> <s> so why cannot copyright owners get damages for injured feelings <e> <s> why should they be excluded from the clause <e>", "<cs> i have to bow to superior legal knowledge <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i strongly support the amendment <e> <s> some controversies and a great many differences have been presented to the tribunal <e> <s> to give one example per cent <e> <s> of the turnover of music publishing companies are controlled by record companies <e> <s> they are the major users of copyright <e> <s> warner brothers is negotiating at present to buy chappell <e> <s> if it does and the bid is currently being reviewed by the monopolies and mergers commission the figure will rise to per cent <e> <s> thus one has a conflict where the operator of the licensing scheme which theoretically should be under the control of the copyright owners is in practice controlled by the users <e> <s> that has thrown up a number of problems in the past <e> <s> the amendment would prevent such copyright users from unduly influencing the operation <e> <s> it takes no rights away from them but gives to what one might loosely call the minority certain rights and possibilities of appeal that i think are important <e> <s> the government have set their face firmly against monopoly in the past <e> <s> i therefore hope that they will give the amendment serious consideration <e>", "<cs> the noble lord in an earlier debate said that the amendment was unnecessary because reference could be made to the monoplies and mergers commission <e> <s> has he not just denied that and said that it is useless <e>", "<cs> i shall clarify it when i read hansard <e> <s> i had the feeling that the noble lord was contradicting himself <e>", "<cs> i should like strongly to support the amendments of my noble friend lord mulley <e> <s> there seem to be two issues here <e> <s> the first is the question of needle time which as the committee will be aware is a restriction on the number of records that can be played over the air <e> <s> there is absolutely no reason in logic why this should exist <e> <s> it was introduced on the basis that if the number of records played was restricted more opportunities would be opened up for live musicians to play and therefore musicians would not be put out of work <e> <s> it has not worked that way <e> <s> it is the most luddite of operations <e> <s> here we have this great wealth of music but it can be played for only six seven or eight hours a day <e> <s> as my noble friend lord mulley said independent radio companies are at a disadvantage in relation to the bbc in terms of the charges that are made <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank the noble lord for that reply <e> <s> may i ask him to bear in mind two or three points when he says that he is going to take the matter away <e> <s> the first is his point that the ppl is quite prepared to allow independent radio stations to have hours needle time if they want it <e> <s> most independent radio stations cannot afford that <e> <s> at least a third of them are running at a loss and another half are running at a minimal profit which is not returning anything on the investment of people who put in money years ago <e> <s> it is not entirely due to needle time costs but it is largely due to that <e>", "<cs> i wish to raise rather an important point on this clause because it seems to me that there is a confusion here which i hope that the government will consider <e>", "<cs> what is objectionable is simply that the creator of intellectual material has to be judged on the basis of what fees he has received for previous broadcasts or productions of his work <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the shipping and aircraft companies already make the passenger pay for entertainment on board <e> <s> i do not think the noble lord need be concerned about that <e> <s> we are asking a very simple question here and i must press the government on it <e> <s> british-owned aircraft and ships come i suppose within uk law <e> <s> why should they be exempt from copyright in this bill <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for making that point <e> <s> however if you are going to extend that logically and talk about unfairness you might as well say remove the copyright or the royalties from books exported abroad so that they can compete more equally with foreign competitors <e> <s> the basic point i was trying to make and i am sorry to flog this live horse so much is that up to the territorial limit aircraft and ships would be subject to copyright <e> <s> why should a great liner or a great aircraft immediately it flies out of our territorial waters if it is registered in britain and british owned then be copyright free <e> <s> there is no basis in logic for that <e> <s> i hope that the government will look seriously at this particular point <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble earl for that reply <e> <s> we have heard the record many times before in these debates <e> <s> at this stage i shall accept what he said but it may well be that we shall come back to the subject on report if necessary <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment and the appeal made by the noble lord lord mottistone <e> <s> i gave an example earlier of a servant of the royal mint who had produced designs for various coins <e> <s> that was all in the line of duty as far as he was concerned <e> <s> let us suppose that the royal mint reproduced some of his designs as special coins which it sold to the public at great profit <e> <s> what he had designed was coinage for the use of the public in normal financial transactions <e> <s> however the royal mint went beyond that it made this issue out of which it had considerable profit <e> <s> he received nothing <e> <s> i think that that is morally wrong <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord mottistone that the crown should be treated no differently from any individual manufacturer in such circumstances <e>", "<cs> to refer to the instance that i quoted in the course of his normal duties the servant of the royal mint designed the coin <e> <s> he was happy that it went through the normal coinage <e> <s> he suddenly discovered that some special issue was being made of the coin <e> <s> he went to his master and said this is all very well you are making a huge profit but i have some moral right to this under the copyright law and i have some intellectual property in it <e> <s> is the noble lord telling me that the answer to that servant would be oh no the crown is absolutely neutral <e> <s> neutral towards whom <e> <s> i think it is scandalous and absolutely wrong <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord speak up <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord hardinge whose amendment i support has admitted that it may not he adequately drafted <e> <s> however he has a sound point which is a point of justice for employer and employee <e> <s> that is the point which he is trying to put to the government <e> <s> he is a man of wit and <e>", "<cs> how appropriate it would be and i know the government have no power in this if we could mark it by naming a street <e> <s> i have had some facetious suggestions like hawke highway and so on but it should not be beyond the bounds of possibility to persuade westminster council to rename for example northumberland avenue anzac or australia way <e> <s> northumberland does not have a particular significance or at least not the significance of australia or anzac <e>", "<cs> my lords nothing would please me more and nothing would please the australians more <e> <s> the occasion ought to be marked because we owe them so much as i say from the first world war thousands of their dead lie in flanders <e> <s> we owe them so much from the second world war <e> <s> therefore it is appropriate to make such a gesture <e>", "<cs> my lords chislehurst always comes first <e>", "<cs> some of the statements made in the debate so far are typical of the fog of emotive issues that surround this subject <e> <s> for example the noble earl lord halsbury mentioned that he received a letter from a homosexual saying that homosexuals have brought this upon themselves because they have been too flashy they have flaunted themselves and so forth <e> <s> it is curious that we do not hear too much about the heterosexuals and the way they flaunt themselves <e> <s> i was recently at a film festival and you should have seen the heterosexuals flaunting themselves on the beach and along the promenades <e> <s> why do we have to distinguish in this particular way <e>", "<cs> the noble lord made a very long speech in his own defence and he will forgive me if i continue with mine <e> <s> i maintain and i believe it has been proven that local authorities have a social role <e> <s> thus it is considered right and reasonable for local authorities to provide funds and to support the setting up of counselling services meals on wheels advice centres for battered wives the victims of rape and assault and so on <e> <s> in a wider sense they are responsible for the funding of libraries and civic theatres which may be considered to be a social service <e> <s> this clause which has been hurriedly drafted and pushed through in another place with undue if not indecent haste could lead to one small section of the community being deprived of access to those social services <e>", "<cs> i am sure <e>", "<cs> it is a pleasure <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord give way <e>", "<cs> the noble lord mentioned a particular council <e> <s> will he name it <e> <s> will he then say how much it spent on promoting homosexuality or how much of the total money was spent in counselling services for people with problems <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord give way <e> <s> is he aware that the story he has just mentioned about camden was denied by camden council <e> <s> it wrote a letter to the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble earl for that statement <e> <s> i return his compliment to me by saying how grateful i am for his courtesy and patience through these long debates not only in committee but tonight <e> <s> i am grateful too for the breadth and depth of the reply <e> <s> as i said earlier i do not think that it has the force of law but it will bring some comfort to many people who are worried <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i find myself more in sympathy with the noble lord lord lloyd of hampstead on this amendment <e> <s> i hope that the government will resist it <e> <s> i think that directors on the whole can protect themselves by contract and they do not need special protection in this bill <e> <s> no one need weep any tears here about sir richard attenborough <e> <s> he is thoroughly protected by contract and he does have the credit of a film by richard attenborough <e> <s> if one goes along this road one gets into a quagmire because an author of a film <e>", "<cs> my lords the europeans have always been awkward in this respect <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the government will consider this amendment seriously because there is some force in the arguments <e> <s> about five years ago there was a classic case in the united states of an employee of a big advertising agency who was asked by his employers to write down the philosophy of the agency a task which i have to say horrifies me <e> <s> nevertheless this gentleman wrote down the philosophy of the agency and its approach to business and so forth <e> <s> it was so successful and went down so well that the employers decided that they would publish it <e> <s> it sold millions of copies <e> <s> the employee did not receive a penny but the agency did <e>", "<cs> are there any vacancies <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a tremendous logic in what the noble lord lord kilbracken has said <e> <s> imagine the situation of a novelist <e> <s> that is not as complicated as that of film making <e> <s> the novelist may start a book this year which may take him two years to complete <e>", "<cs> my lords i know <e> <s> however what i am saying is that if it does not apply to books why apply it to films <e> <s> why is it not possible for the same logic to be used <e> <s> that is my point <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the government for bringing forward as promised an amendment concerning rental right <e> <s> they will not be surprised if i say that i feel that there are certain defects some of which have been pointed out by the noble lord lord jenkin <e> <s> i am in per cent <e> <s> agreement with his criticism of the one-year period <e> <s> i follow his instinct that the time limit should be for the entire copyright period <e> <s> if you own a copyright you own a copyright the law says that a copyright is in existence until years after your death <e> <s> however if the government do not go along with that idea the suggestion of seven years is reasonable <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran has adequately put the arguments <e> <s> the matter is very simple <e> <s> in the face of continued piracy over the last few years the industry has developed spoiler devices to be inserted into recordings <e> <s> anti-spoiler devices are appearing on the market in germany and japan and are beginning to come here <e> <s> one action promotes a reaction <e> <s> amendments nos <e> <s> and are designed to put a stop to that <e>", "<cs> my lords of the two amendments which are before us i much prefer that of the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran <e> <s> my noble friend lord williams of elvel seems anxious to dig the government out of a hole particularly in terms of the levy on blank tapes <e> <s> i have no desire to do that <e> <s> the law as it stands is that the taping at home of a television programme and the copying of tapes are illegal <e> <s> that is the law and that was spelt out <e> <s> the government have not come to terms with that by the imposition of a blank tape levy which as we know exists in several other countries <e> <s> we shall have to come back to it and the government will have to come back to it <e> <s> we should not make provisions in this bill to make that illegal act legal <e>", "<cs> my lords the flaw in this argument is that there is no proof of a telephone call <e> <s> the minister gave the example of a play where the producer rings up and says i want to make cuts <e> <s> what proof is there of that telephone call <e> <s> to me that is the big problem <e> <s> i accept that perhaps this amendment goes a little too far in demanding that everything should be written <e> <s> however i have been in circumstances personally where phone calls have been made <e> <s> i could not prove the phone call it was my word against the producers word <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for what he has said <e> <s> i am happy to take second place behind him <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords many years ago in america during the mccarthy regime it was customary and in fact necessary for a speaker to get up and say i want to assure my audience that i hate stalin i hate russia i hate everything to do with communism but i do think that our rates are too high <e> <s> i have to say that i like the noble lord <e> <s> lord callaghan but i think that his amendment is wrong <e> <s> i looked at it in wonder when i read it <e> <s> i thought to myself how great is the power of ex-prime ministers the song is ended but the memory lingers on <e>", "<cs> my lords i must tell my noble friend that one of my greatest friends was tinkerbell <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to differ from my noble friend but i hope that the government will resist these amendments <e> <s> it is tremendously important for an author to have credits <e> <s> he is often underpaid especially at the beginning of his career but being identified as the author of a particular work will make a great deal of difference to his future career <e> <s> as i see it these amendments nibble away at the moral rights already established in the bill <e> <s> i believe that they are totally unjustified and i hope that the government will resist them <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to support my noble friends amendment <e> <s> whenever any noble lord speaks of the rights of authors i feel the tribal drums beating in my heart <e> <s> i therefore warmed to this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords surely my noble friend is speaking innocently <e> <s> is he not aware of the legal profession and what its members can do to words <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i can clarify the point for my noble friend <e> <s> this is a common occurrence for writers and their contracts <e> <s> what one does after writing a tasteless work which i am sure my noble friend has never done and never will and having the good luck to sell it to some idiotic producer is to say in the contract that the producer has no right to alter any part of it without the writers consent <e> <s> even people who write tasteful works like myself put a clause into the contract that no part of the work shall be altered without consent which shall not be unreasonably withheld <e> <s> that is a common occurrence <e> <s> i therefore see no difficulty in the wording of the clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the author would have certain rights <e> <s> it depends how much was butchered <e> <s> an obscene line or two might be taken out here and there <e> <s> but those responsible would have to be stupid to buy the material in the first place <e> <s> the case the noble lord quotes is so rare that it is really not worth legislating for <e> <s> let us take another case and suppose that a very left-wing author <e>", "<cs> my lords i warmly support the noble viscounts amendment <e> <s> the government seem to have got into a great mess on the issue <e> <s> the nettle that should have been grasped in earlier debates is the licence fee sometimes known as a levy on blank tapes <e> <s> the government turned their face against that <e> <s> they were therefore faced with the problem that all over the country there was widespread illegal home taping of television and other shows and they had to solve that problem somehow <e> <s> they have simply opened the gates without any further definition <e> <s> i think that is a nonsense <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble earl the deputy leader of the house for his skilful introduction of the white paper and for giving us the opportunity to debate it <e> <s> he is a skilful parliamentarian <e> <s> he could rise to his feet at any time and convince the house that the north circular road was straight <e> <s> i do not share his enthusiasm for the white paper <e> <s> i found it to be a curious disappointing mixed and rather depressing document <e>", "<cs> is the noble earl aware that not a single drama i am not referring to series like dallas or dynasty has been produced in america during the past years <e>", "<cs> lower standards <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> however is it not true that the posters were withdrawn as a result of bomb threats and that london regional transport as i understand it received something like or letters one of which at least contained a bomb threat <e> <s> further have the government formed an attitude on the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords surely there is a difference here <e> <s> does the minister agree that the government have no responsibility for london transport and no responsibility for publishing and writing and yet they came out in the strongest possible terms against the threat to salman rushdie <e> <s> here was a threat to the travelling public and the government are silent on it <e> <s> is the minister aware that when the salman rushdie case occurred the prime minister insisted that freedom of speech was essential and could not be threatened by force <e> <s> will the government therefore make the strongest representation to london regional transport and other similar bodies and say that it is not the policy of the government and the country to give in to threats of violence <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord shackleton was kind enough to link me with two australians the late lord casey and the noble baroness lady parkes <e> <s> i wish i were an australian <e> <s> i feel that i have been there so of ten that i am one alas i am not <e>", "<cs> my lords i suppose that i should first declare an interest as i still earn part of my living from writing for television and i have done so for the past years <e> <s> in fact it is years ago since i had my first television series broadcast on the bbc and last week i returned from germany where my latest television series is being shown <e> <s> i should point out that for of those years i slaved in the galley for the noble lord lord grade whose maiden speech proved to be so interesting to the house <e> <s> i should also like to apologise to the noble earl for the fact that i cannot stay late this evening <e> <s> i am not taking a mass <e> <s> but i am doing something related to the bill i am actually broadcasting <e> <s> therefore i hope that he will excuse my absence <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that if we wait for a settlement in cyprus the situation with regard to the cultural heritage may become very much worse <e> <s> there is an elected democratic government in north cyprus which happen to be very poor <e> <s> they are doing their very best to preserve the culture <e> <s> because of the special responsibility that britain has towards cyprus would it not be a good idea for the british government to enter into direct talks to see what can be done to save

conservative party ranks <e> <s> how does one avoid that situation <e>", "<cs> with respect to the noble lords lord boyd-carpenter and lord harmar-nicholls i agree with the noble lord lord howie that one-sidedness may be a good debating point but it is totally illogical in the context of this bill <e>", "<cs> history shows us that the amendment is necessary <e> <s> if we go back in history to the iba we can see that on two or three occasions franchises were awarded to certain companies on the basis that those companies would deliver quality <e> <s> unfortunately they <e>", "<cs> i trust that

once he was successful having invested millions he would have to retire when he had per cent <e> <s> of the audience <e> <s> that is not talking about monopolies it is talking about common sense and giving more choice to the viewers <e>", "<cs> i believe that the government have the position just about right with the points system <e> <s> one of the problems with commercial radio in this country has been thank god <e> <s> the enormous strength and tradition of bbc radio <e> <s> that is the reason why commercial radio in this country did not take off with the same velocity as it did in america and australia <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble earl for that reply <e> <s> i am a little concerned <e> <s> i should prefer to support amendment no <e> <s> because what is left out is the human factor which i tried to stress in my remarks on the amendment <e> <s> a small composer is at the mercy of powerful forces <e> <s> he is frightened <e> <s> when i was a young writer i took on commissions at disgusting prices simply because i could not afford to offend the film or television companies <e> <s> there were many people in that position <e> <s> they need a defence of some kind <e> <s> i am concerned about it <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i warmly support these amendments for several reasons <e> <s> i began my career as a writer of documentaries <e> <s> i cannot claim that the first documentary i wrote was a social action programme because it was called how to look after your bren gun <e> <s> that was when i was with the armys bureau of current affairs <e> <s> i had my first experience of how powerful television can be in the early s <e> <s> i wrote a documentary programme called the pattern of marriage <e> <s> it dealt with how young people meet get on get married the problems they meet why they separate and why they divorce <e> <s> i based it on a considerable amount of research in the divorce courts and elsewhere <e> <s> we made six programmes <e> <s> it was my first experience of the power of television <e> <s> we received hundreds of letters from people all over the country <e> <s> the marriage guidance council experienced an increase in its customers of around per cent <e> <s> the whole thing was a marvellous social exercise <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord make it clear that he is talking about the past not the present <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble earl for that reply which presents a chicken and egg situation <e> <s> the subject is important enough to be pressed and to be incorporated in the bill <e> <s> on the other hand i should like to wait and hope that the office of fair trading will report before we meet again in october <e> <s> when the office of fair trading says that it will report in two months that is sometimes not the case <e> <s> i hope that we shall not have to wait until next february when it will be too late to act <e>", "<cs> with that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may first apologise to the committee <e> <s> when i put down my modest little amendment i had no idea that i was taking the cork out of such a bottle <e> <s> i should like to thank noble lords not only for staying up so late but for the valuable contributions that they have made <e> <s> i noticed i hope that no one will be offended by this a certain amount of fear among the christians present <e> <s> they were all very anxious to defend their position <e>", "<cs> i wish warmly to support the amendment <e> <s> i beg the government to rethink their philosophy and go back to their original philosophy <e> <s> it seems to me that this is a complete contradiction <e> <s> from the beginning the itv companies took a big risk and have subscribed to itn for many years to set up a news service to supply them <e> <s> that news service has been eminently successful and is recognised throughout the world as being one of the best news services one can find <e> <s> it is successful therefore the governments reaction is to say let us break it up <e> <s> that our reward for your initiative and your investment <e> <s> that is totally wrong <e> <s> it is like saying a cook should not own his own frying pan or his own gas stove that he can only own say per cent <e> <s> of it <e> <s> it is a total nonsense <e> <s> we have here a marvellous service <e> <s> i wonder why the government want to tinker with it <e>", "<cs> such a person would not get the contractor to cook his sausages would he <e>", "<cs> i know that the noble lord is an expert in this field and i can assure him that mastermind is not safe <e> <s> as a result of the committees decision such programmes can be reproduced exactly as they were invented <e> <s> they can even be shown under the same name as in new zealand <e> <s> there may be recourse in law in terms of passing off and so forth but it would be difficult and costly to establish proof <e>", "<cs> i thank all noble lords who have taken part in what has been an interesting debate <e> <s> i also thank the minister for the few crumbs of comfort that he has scattered in my direction over the floor of the chamber <e> <s> we shall consult him as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> far be it from me to criticise such an august body but it has been known to be wrong in the past so this is not exactly the first time <e>", "<cs> i shall not prolong the discussion further <e> <s> once again i thank the minister <e> <s> we shall be in touch <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot say that i am disappointed by that reply <e> <s> i am rather appalled by it <e> <s> it seems to me that the noble earl courteous as ever has not added one whit to the arguments that he made at committee stage <e> <s> the arguments that he has advanced against the amendment have been shot through with holes by the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls and my noble friend lord peston and i hope that i have fired one or two rounds <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment for a very simple reason <e> <s> the bill is predicated on a premise that is fundamentally flawed <e> <s> it is that there will be sufficient advertising to go around <e> <s> that is not so <e> <s> not only is there bsb and sky but we are now talking of channel <e> <s> the great big cake of advertising is supposed to go all around those various companies <e> <s> the inevitable pressure in the future will be to reduce the value and the cost of programmes to cut down <e> <s> that is absolutely inevitable <e> <s> the pressure therefore will be to get rid of documentaries and other programmes that have been the prize and treasure of british television <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down for the second time while i welcome what he said about the bbc being responsible for documentary programmes and so on may we therefore count on his support when there is an attack on the licensing fee <e>"]
