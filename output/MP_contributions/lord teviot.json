["<cs> my lords bearing in mind that we are on the report stage may i say that the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey spoke briefly to this type of amendment earlier and i wonder whether he is aware that i have also tabled amendments nos <e> <s> a and b <e> <s> they were too late to be included in the last marshalled list <e> <s> i have the new marshalled list today and i wonder whether the noble and learned lord has details of these amendments <e>", "<cs> in that case my lords i should now like to speak to my amendments <e> <s> first i am very grateful that the government have seen fit to move the new clause clause a but my one criticism of it is the inclusion of the word all <e> <s> if the driver is asked to do all that could be expected of him that would put rather too much on his shoulders <e> <s> my amendment provides that <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house is my noble friend aware that that is a classic case this afternoon of taking too many amendments at once <e> <s> i hope that we shall all be able when we are moving our amendments to explain our own points because they are relevant to their own issues <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend lord lyell for having explained all so that when we do make our own speeches we can adjust them accordingly <e> <s> there is one point i should like him to make clear to me which i am afraid is not clear at the moment <e> <s> he has told me and i think that he has also told the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey and the noble lord lord ross of marnock what sporting events are and the difference between soccer and rugger <e> <s> perhaps my noble friend at some time could say what the <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish that i could support absolutely the noble lord lord ross but i am afraid i cannot for two reasons <e> <s> first he uses the words employee or <e> <s> i do not know whether he is aware that the word agent is still left in the bill and that an employee is still an agent <e> <s> so that his amendment means that the driver would still be liable <e> <s> secondly the noble lord talked about it being unfair to place this burden on the driver and i agree <e> <s> when an earlier amendment was being moved he said that the steward on the bus should be responsible <e> <s> i am not sure whether that is a good thing <e> <s> but the driver is not a poor chap and i think that if a driver was listening to this debate he might think that we were being faintly patronising <e> <s> i feel that drivers should have some form of responsibility and should be able to use their common sense <e> <s> i do not think that it should be left to the hirer <e>", "<cs> my lords it falls to me to conclude the very full discussion we have had on this subject bringing out very many points <e> <s> in the light of what has been said by my noble and learned friend that he is going to look at this again i hope he is going to be able to do it either before third reading or before the bill gets into the other placethere is so much to be looked at i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely endorse what my noble friend lord inglewood has said on the amendment standing in both his name and mine <e> <s> my noble friend lord lyell has mentioned that <e>"]
