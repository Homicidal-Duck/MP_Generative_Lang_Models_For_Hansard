["<cs> my lords i beg leave to introduce a bill to provide for the transfer of certain records in the custody of the registrar general to the public record office <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> in doing so i have to declare two interests <e> <s> one is that i obtain my living very largely as a genealogical record agent and the second is that i have had the privilege of serving as a member of the noble and learned lord the lord chancellors advisory council on public records for some years <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to interrupt my noble and learned friend <e> <s> if they went to kew what in fact would happen is that they would be able to inspect the register themselves and obtain the information there without having to buy a certificate which they do not necessarily want <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been a most enjoyable experience this afternoon <e> <s> i shall take with me to the grave the memory of my noble and learned friends loving heart <e> <s> i will deal very briefly with the matters which he raised <e> <s> on the question of open government i did not mean what he said at all <e> <s> he can have my assurance that my views are very conservative <e> <s> on the question of the two locations instead of just the one that is st catherines house at the aldwych and the location at kew at the other end of the richmond branch of the district line they are rather a long way away from each other and it would be inconvenient for people to travel from one to the other <e> <s> but people would be prepared to go there pay a modest fee and be able to look at microfilms <e> <s> they would not have to buy the microfilm they would put it on a reader and then write down the details <e> <s> that would be a very great advantage <e> <s> most of the functions of the general register office are being transferred to southport that was the subject of another of my little battles some years ago with other noble lords but the public search room will remain in central london <e>", "<cs> my lords normally it is customary in your lordships house to pass cursory comment on the speaker who has just spoken <e> <s> i feel that i need to pause for one or two minutes before i go to the text of my speech <e> <s> the noble lord lord gifford spoke of an almost utopian situation <e> <s> he wants to see the police with great powers and everything else and the arguments he produced are very credible <e> <s> but with the nature of the mid-three-quarters of the th century and the awful things that we are surviving in the main that situation is not credible <e> <s> i support a government which submits proposals to free the individual <e> <s> nevertheless i suggest to my noble friend that he follows the questions that the noble lord has put to us <e>", "<cs> my lords adam smith or no adam smith i fully endorse the principle behind this bill in that competition in general is the essential part of a thriving economy <e> <s> i can understand also that it is an important safeguard for consumers and that the strengthening of competition policy will benefit many smaller businesses <e> <s> in the context of business generally all this is laudable <e> <s> my brief intervention is to spell out certain misgivings that i have regarding the bus industry <e> <s> in that context it seems to me that this bill with respect has been drafted without consideration of the practical need and indeed the statutory duty to provide services to the public in that the machinery will become more costly and in some ways counter-productive <e>", "<cs> i am not completely convinced by my noble friends answer <e> <s> he referred to sports grounds but there might be sporting events to which his answer would not apply <e> <s> i also mentioned coaches travelling from england or wales up to scotland <e> <s> i feel that these aspects need more attention and for that reason i still believe the amendment is necessary <e> <s> i will withdraw it if my noble friend will think about the matter again and on report either produce a suitable amendment or give a more convincing argument than he has presented <e>", "<cs> i am most reluctant to withdraw the amendment at this stage <e> <s> i note the remark just made by the noble <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend sits down i really think that in this section of the bill we are being rather what might be called brushed off <e> <s> unless my noble friend can give the faintest indication that we are going to get anywhere i think we have got to begin to make a stand <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend sits down i really should like to ask him this question <e> <s> he brushed off my amendment when i suggested that designated events should be more widely spread and he has also told my noble friend lord inglewood that he is not going to deal with railways <e> <s> before we go any further i think the official opposition really want to know as do i and my noble friends where we are going to go <e> <s> is my noble friend going to deal kindly with my amendment <e> <s> are we going to get anywhere <e> <s> otherwise we shall deal with these amendments subsequently because we feel this point rather strongly <e>", "<cs> i think my noble friend is being parochial <e> <s> he is talking about from cornwall to manchester <e> <s> we have been talking about scotland this is a scottish bill <e> <s> so far as scottish law is concerned they want to do something about controlling sporting events <e> <s> he has reached clause which my noble friend is concerned with and talks about individuals getting drunk when we get to my amendments i do not think that he is going to give me any joy <e> <s> if he does then of course we will go ahead <e> <s> this is not a parish event scotland is part of the united kingdom <e> <s> i think personally these rules might extend to the whole of the united kingdom <e> <s> one cannot think of scotland being great bloggingdon so far as little bloggingdon is concerned <e> <s> the whole thing is important <e> <s> i do not know what my noble friend is going to do in this event but i feel that i should say now before everybody leaves that when we reach my amendment everyone should be here <e>", "<cs> with great respect to the noble lord lord underhill he has asked for the word employee to be struck out of the bill but an employee is an agent <e> <s> my further amendment goes on to deal with the word permit so he has very largely taken the words out of my mouth <e> <s> therefore i shall be much more brief than i should otherwise have been <e> <s> i think my wording might be more acceptable to the government but having said that i cannot wait to hear the opinion of my noble friend <e>", "<cs> with great respect to the noble lord lord mishcon before my noble friend replies there are other amendments which i have down and which i think will suit the bill even better <e> <s> so at this stage i should like my noble friend to keep an open mind before he gives that assurance <e>", "<cs> with great respect to the noble lord lord airedale if you take out the word employee the employee is still an agent <e> <s> i ask him to make his remarks when we come to my amendment which is the next one following which i hope will make the position clearer <e> <s> i shall not withdraw a word of what i have prepared <e> <s> i am afraid that your lordships are going to hear the lot but i shall not be very long <e>", "<cs> before one even begins thinking of withdrawing this amendment i must ask my noble friend this <e> <s> a hip flask can be carried not only in an overcoat but almost without being seen unless frisked in jeans or like material and it is being very unreasonable to expect the driver to be responsible to do that <e> <s> as i mentioned the word permit has a double meaning but if authorised by his employer he can get away with it <e> <s> i do not think my noble friend has answered that <e> <s> i am delighted to have support <e> <s> i shall certainly take note of my noble friend lord renton who has great experience of the other place <e> <s> i am delighted that he has supported me on this issue <e> <s> i certainly shall not push my second amendment but i think that we <e>", "<cs> my noble friend says that he will look at the words authorises and permits <e> <s> i hope that he has accepted the mood of this committee that there is a very great difference between those two words <e> <s> i can cite a huge amount of case law in relation to the word permits with which i could keep your lordships here for half-an-hour but i shall not do so <e> <s> my noble friend has said that he will look at the two words <e> <s> he knows the mood of the committee on this amendment <e> <s> taking that into consideration i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i cannot say that i am very happy about this <e> <s> i should like to ask my noble friend a question which i thought i had explained in my amendment perhaps not very briefly but also not at great length <e> <s> controls already exist for this industry which do not apply to other industries <e> <s> this amendment seeks to exclude this industry <e> <s> the industry is most concerned about this bill <e> <s> although an amendment was not pressed on behalf of the industry in the other place with respect i do not think that many people are aware what the bill really means <e> <s> this industry has taken the bill seriously and is extremely worried about it <e> <s> it believes very strongly that in view of the fact that there exist all these other provisions in the two acts which i have mentioned the bill is not necessary <e> <s> does not my noble friend think that the provivisions contained in those two acts which i explained at some length do the trick as regards competition <e>", "<cs> having drawn my noble friend out a little further i shall study what he has said and if necessary take the matter up at a later stage bearing in mind that he says that this could be done by way of an order <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i accept what my noble friend has said <e> <s> the director general of fair trading will as he said informally discuss the matter with the various ministers of the various departments <e> <s> i do not take the view that my amendments are all that cumbersome indeed it would have been nice to have seen them written into the bill <e> <s> however i shall not press this amendment <e> <s> my noble friends answer was kinder than i thought it would be <e> <s> with that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend very much for his considerate reply <e> <s> he mentioned that there may be scrutiny outside the transport world and perhaps he is referring to a consumer association or the like who are looking into a particular bus service and who might make a complaint to the director general of fair trading <e> <s> if that happened they could do it perfectly well now through the passenger transport executive which does not include london transport <e> <s> i purposely omitted london transport from this amendment because that is responsible to the glc only <e> <s> they have plenty of scrutiny and this consumer organisation could well go to the passenger transport <e>", "<cs> i shall withdraw the amendment but i would like to say very strongly that i do think a record repository is something quite different and i do not really accept the argument that it would narrow the category of other similar institutions <e> <s> i can think of a lot of other similar institutions <e> <s> but this has gone around the mill in the other place and i am not going to waste the committees time by pressing it here <e> <s> i would just say i am sorry it has not been accepted and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for referring to that <e> <s> it does cover it but i would also like to say that again a library is a very different place from na archive <e> <s> a library is very much concerned with books i hate to state the obvious to be referred to either for lending or for reference <e> <s> an archive is a place of primary source and if there are books in an archive they are there only for reference to help with the archives <e> <s> but i do take the point and i am glad that my noble friend has moved this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind that we are on the report stage may i say that the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey spoke briefly to this type of amendment earlier and i wonder whether he is aware that i have also tabled amendments nos <e> <s> a and b <e> <s> they were too late to be included in the last marshalled list <e> <s> i have the new marshalled list today and i wonder whether the noble and learned lord has details of these amendments <e>", "<cs> in that case my lords i should now like to speak to my amendments <e> <s> first i am very grateful that the government have seen fit to move the new clause clause a but my one criticism of it is the inclusion of the word all <e> <s> if the driver is asked to do all that could be expected of him that would put rather too much on his shoulders <e> <s> my amendment provides that <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house is my noble friend aware that that is a classic case this afternoon of taking too many amendments at once <e> <s> i hope that we shall all be able when we are moving our amendments to explain our own points because they are relevant to their own issues <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend lord lyell for having explained all so that when we do make our own speeches we can adjust them accordingly <e> <s> there is one point i should like him to make clear to me which i am afraid is not clear at the moment <e> <s> he has told me and i think that he has also told the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey and the noble lord lord ross of marnock what sporting events are and the difference between soccer and rugger <e> <s> perhaps my noble friend at some time could say what the <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish that i could support absolutely the noble lord lord ross but i am afraid i cannot for two reasons <e> <s> first he uses the words employee or <e> <s> i do not know whether he is aware that the word agent is still left in the bill and that an employee is still an agent <e> <s> so that his amendment means that the driver would still be liable <e> <s> secondly the noble lord talked about it being unfair to place this burden on the driver and i agree <e> <s> when an earlier amendment was being moved he said that the steward on the bus should be responsible <e> <s> i am not sure whether that is a good thing <e> <s> but the driver is not a poor chap and i think that if a driver was listening to this debate he might think that we were being faintly patronising <e> <s> i feel that drivers should have some form of responsibility and should be able to use their common sense <e> <s> i do not think that it should be left to the hirer <e>", "<cs> my lords it falls to me to conclude the very full discussion we have had on this subject bringing out very many points <e> <s> in the light of what has been said by my noble and learned friend that he is going to look at this again i hope he is going to be able to do it either before third reading or before the bill gets into the other placethere is so much to be looked at i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely endorse what my noble friend lord inglewood has said on the amendment standing in both his name and mine <e> <s> my noble friend lord lyell has mentioned that <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords i am most grateful to my noble friend who has explained this order so lucidly <e> <s> listening to remarks by people who state that a census is an infringement on liberty makes me think they are totally unaware of the great importance that is attached to it <e> <s> it is the one time in a decade when over a wide range of issues reliable information can be obtained <e> <s> decisions can be taken on a foundation of near truth <e> <s> here i can see that i am in agreement with the noble baroness lady seear and disagree with the noble lord lord wigoder who i hope will challenge me in light of further remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords it is indeed difficult to follow such a witty speech as that made by the noble baroness lady fisher of rednal and i shall not attempt to do so <e> <s> but like other noble lords i am most grateful to my noble friend lord bellwin for the excellent clear and precise way in which he has explained the somewhat complex piece of legislation that we have before us today <e> <s> also like other noble lords i should like to congratulate the noble lord lord underhill on his maiden front bench speech <e> <s> i think that perhaps i can put the record straight and say that the remark that he attributed to my noble friend lord bellwin on the nationalised industries could in fact be attributed to my noble friend lord trefgarne on the question that the bill do now pass on the british aerospace bill <e>", "<cs> it is rare for a bill of this size not to have a whole host of amendments on clause <e> <s> however there are one or two things to state or even pave the way for the rest of the bill on the question that the clause stand part <e> <s> having had for some years a close and pleasant relationship with the industry i feel that there is much that one can do to improve the bill <e> <s> i can say with great respect to its authors and to my noble friend lord bellwin who has been so helpful that i hope he will see fit to reconsider some of the points that will be raised in the form of amendments and even perhaps to accept some of the amendments themselves <e>", "<cs> i too should like to support this amendment <e> <s> i also recall when the house was considering the transport act that there was doubt over the insurance issue <e> <s> eminent legal opinion has indicated that the mibs undertaking was hardly worth the paper that it was written upon <e> <s> it is a difficult matter to deal with because enforcement is a problem <e> <s> defects do not seem to come to light until a car-sharing passenger is killed in an accident <e> <s> fortunately this has not so far happened frequently <e> <s> this amendment seems to clarify the position in insurance and appears to fit the bill at a time when the practice of lift-giving is being encouraged <e>", "<cs> having listened to my noble friend i must confess that i am not happy with this amendment <e> <s> i do not know what the noble lord lord underhill intends to do about it but i think we should perhaps try to amend it on report stage <e> <s> there are certainly quite a lot of things which need to be done to this clause <e> <s> my noble friend commented on the questions of safety the psv fitness tests and the psv driver and the fact that these vehicles were being allowed to carry school children so why should they not carry adults <e> <s> also it could be said why have psv fitness tests at all or why have psv drivers <e>", "<cs> i hope that when my noble friend replies to this amendment he will give it due consideration <e> <s> it is a very important amendment but it is not an emotive or contentious one like those which we dealt with earlier <e> <s> but if as the bill recognises there is still a need for road service licensing thank goodness <e> <s> it is a mistake to provide loopholes <e> <s> i do not wish to repeat the arguments that <e>", "<cs> i too am happy that my noble friend is taking this back and looking at it again because the express bus side has been something of which the country can be proud <e> <s> express coaches have taken on routes going all over the country backwards and forwards <e> <s> you can get from practically anywhere to everywhere without having to cross london <e> <s> it is one of the most flexible services there is <e> <s> anything that could upset something that is so clearly successful would be a great pity so therefore one is very pleased <e>", "<cs> on this amendment i find myself agreeing with the government <e> <s> i think that my noble friend has very well explained this sort of business about having to tell the commissioners every time you are going to take a party out somewhere <e> <s> this is somewhere where a bit of red tape can be cut out with no harm <e>", "<cs> the case for this amendment or these amendments has been well expressed by the noble lord lord underhill <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will take kindly to this amendment as he has done to others <e> <s> i do not want to repeat what the noble lord lord <e>", "<cs> i apologise for speaking previously to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i should have paid slightly more attention <e> <s> one does not like to get confused but sometimes we try to take two or three things together and in the case of one notable piece of legislation earlier this year we got into the most awful muddle <e> <s> so i apologise to the noble lord but i would say now what i said then <e>", "<cs> i have listened to my noble friend talking about our reforming the law of years ago <e> <s> does he not agree that the act was a very substantial reform and between and now there have been all sorts of other acts so that the -year-old reform argument i am afraid does not hold water <e>", "<cs> obviously i am not going to pursue this amendment <e> <s> however may i thank everybody who has spoken <e> <s> i think they have a certain sympathy with the principle behind the amendment <e> <s> it has been a pleasant generous conversation something one will look at <e> <s> it is nice to know that there are these cosy safeguards <e> <s> on that premise i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i had intended to enter this discussion but as it went on and we had this rather amusing repartee i thought <e>", "<cs> i am still not terribly happy about this amendment but my noble friend has said that he will look at it again <e> <s> my noble friend lord lucas of chilworth has put in a different opinion from those already expressed apart from my noble friend <e> <s> i do not think there is any worry about the perpetuity situation <e> <s> this is a perfectly good and valid amendment and something which we can all do to cut costs <e> <s> this is not the time to decide today <e> <s> it would be better to leave it to my noble friend to look at it again and perhaps even to see him and see whether we can come to some better arrangement <e> <s> on that understanding i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down i think i can give a few words of comfort to my noble friend on this having listened very carefully to what has been said <e> <s> the industry which detests the idea of trial areas there is no other word for that or rather not detest it distrusts the idea of trial areas i do not think feels terribly strongly about this one <e> <s> i think the committee should pay attention to my noble friends long experience <e> <s> also we have listened to other noble lords with long experience in local government saying that consultation can go on and on <e> <s> i think that on <e>", "<cs> my lords on this amendment i entirely agree with the noble lord lord underhill in all that he said regarding the industry and the travelling public <e>", "<cs> i should like to come in briefly here <e> <s> it is said that if the period is two years people will not have a go and make the necessary investment and that is fine <e> <s> but equally if anybody is to embark on something like this they must plan ahead <e> <s> they must know what they are doing even before they do it and they must ensure reasonable success <e>", "<cs> i understood that amendment no <e> <s> was in line with amendments nos <e> <s> to <e> <s> my noble friend is going to look at this so perhaps the period will be a minimum of two years <e> <s> in the words of the noble lord lord underhill perhaps this will be quite satisfactory <e> <s> obviously you cannot have one situation for one thing and another situation for another <e> <s> i hope therefore that noble lords opposite will have faith in my noble friends words <e>", "<cs> your lordships will notice that there is an amendment tabled in the name of my noble friend lord morris and myself no <e> <s> which is in almost identical form <e> <s> the only difference between the noble lord lord underhill and myself is where we think the provision for annual testing of public service vehicles fits into the bill <e> <s> it seems to me that clause deals with general powers of inspection clause with the certification of initial fitness and clause with spot checks <e> <s> i see annual inspection as fitting between the last two <e> <s> no matter the important thing is that the specific provision should be made for annual inspection of public service vehicles not that annual testing is new but with the new european regulations it should now be formalised in primary rather than in secondary legislation <e>", "<cs> in the light of what my noble friend lord mowbray has said i shall certainly afford him details at any rate without names of the two incidents of which i know <e> <s> i take the point that he does not want officials to become over- zealous in any way <e> <s> i could not be more happy with the answer that he has given <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> with that assurance given by my noble friend i can only say that i should like to look at this again and if necessary come back to it on report <e> <s> however i think that he has made his position quite clear <e> <s> in that light i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i entirely agree with the purpose of the amendment and had i spoken before the minister replied to the noble lord lord underhill i apologise to the committee for not speaking then i probably would have spoken at some length on it <e> <s> however in view of my noble friends promise to look at the matter again i need say no more <e>", "<cs> in supporting the amendment i recognise that subsection <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord underhill said this is a most important amendment and a very important clause <e> <s> we want to get some strong assurances from the government because this is very much a crunch amendment <e> <s> i can talk about this because of my own experience in the bus and coach industry <e> <s> in that industry one probably notices points which would not even occur to other people although with great respect to the noble lord lord underhill i think that he has made the case very clearly <e>", "<cs> may i ask for your lordships permission to speak to my own and my noble friends amendment amendment no <e> <s> and at the same time to comment on the amendment which is now before your lordships committee <e> <s> these amendments are clearly alternative to one another and seek to overcome what seems to be a strange piece of drafting in the bill <e>", "<cs> i do not want to weary the committee but i am not clear about this having been in the position myself <e> <s> i must say that the union were extremely kind to me in providing legal services <e> <s> the position at the moment is that if a man is convicted his employer knows about it and also even if you are convicted for speeding which is completely outside your own duty perhaps i am talking completely at cross purposes and if so i apologise one gets a piece of paper from the traffic commissioners anyway saying if you go on doing this sort of thing you might have your licence withdrawn <e> <s> perhaps my noble friend or the noble lord lord underhill can clarify this point <e>", "<cs> like other noble lords i will speak only briefly to remind my noble friend of his cardinal principle that statutory regulations should be avoided except when demonstrably necessary <e> <s> one finds it difficult to see why it should be necessary to deal with this particular issue by way of regulations <e> <s> i suggest to your lordships that so far as this bill is concerned the problems of operators brought together by partnership agreements can readily be covered by the bill itself <e> <s> i hope your lordships will agree with me that by including a definition of the word person which is in amendment no <e> <s> in clause the practical problems which might be encountered in the operation of part i of this bill can be overcome <e>", "<cs> while not wishing to pour cold water on the amendment which has been very well expressed by my noble friend i too share the forebodings or share the idea that has been put forward about the non-psv driver driving a group of people or more <e> <s> i cannot see why it would be an impediment for the drivers of these minibuses larger minibuses or indeed double-deckers to take a psv licence <e> <s> it is not a terribly difficult thing to acquire and i should have thought that it was in the interests of everyone for the driver to go somewhere and take a course and take a psv licence <e> <s> as my noble friend has said we must see how it goes <e> <s> but i should have thought that that was a matter at which he should look immediately <e>", "<cs> i thoroughly agree with what the noble lord lord underhill has said <e> <s> i believe that this clause was in no way discussed in the other place during all their hours of discussion and therefore it is very proper for the noble lord to have raised it today <e> <s> i know there is a need for cutting out administration and perhaps this is a very good way of doing it <e> <s> the noble lord mentioned a number of points and i would only dwell on one namely the conductor being in charge of the bus <e> <s> the badge rather accentuates that point <e> <s> he is very much in charge of the bus and has to deal with all sorts of funny situations <e> <s> there are also times when he may threaten to call or may even have to call the police in dealing with someone who say is intoxicated or not <e>", "<cs> i have hesitated to intervene so far on this but it is an amendment on which i disagree with the noble lord lord underhill and one viewed rather with pessisism by the transport industry <e> <s> i take the point of the noble viscount lord hanworth but i think he ended up by saying that the existing operator should run these services <e> <s> in that case surely the bus companies concerned ought to be responsible for this and so far as i know they do not want to ask british railways to run any trains <e> <s> therefore i would say that it is better to leave matters as they are <e>", "<cs> i cannot be sufficiently strong in my support of this new clause <e> <s> it is the most important amendment we have had this afternoon <e> <s> your lordships will remember the problems of reforming law on drivers hours which started with the transport act at which time during the long recess i conducted my own experiments to support the arguments on the views presented to the house <e> <s> my main memory of driving coaches throughout that summer was the need for flexibility in the law <e> <s> a long days driving might be followed by a short one excursions to the seaside with plenty of time to relax <e> <s> the work could be hard but it had its compensations <e> <s> so i understand the problems of the industry with this very rigid eec regulation <e>", "<cs> the intervention of the noble lord lord underhill was a surprise and a pleasure to me <e> <s> from what he said i think i shall answer the point of my noble friend lord renton first <e> <s> he represented an excellent county the source of so many of our cereal crops and vegetables and of our architectural heritage the county of huntingdon <e> <s> we rush through it frequently on the train it is bounded in one corner by st ives and there is ramsey <e> <s> i can well see what he means i think it was probably represented by the national bus company and it is a small area <e> <s> but i would hate to think how even in that area if it were a trial area the services would be decimated <e> <s> if there is anybody lurking in godmanchester st ives or ramsey they might like to come to the rescue <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down i think he men <e>", "<cs> my lords i find my noble friends reply rather disappointing <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord underhill stated this amendment is very similar to the one which i moved in committee <e> <s> i note that the provisions have been slightly streamlined compared with my own proposals but the amendment is none the worse for that <e> <s> i must thank my noble friend lord mowbray who wrote me a charming letter but i cannot say that in some ways i am any more convinced and i still think that this amendment is very necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord underhill need not worry about nobody supporting him on this amendment <e> <s> i rise with a vengeance <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend replies may i say that i am not desperately worried about this <e> <s> i know that the noble lord lord underhill will put me right but i do not think but since yesterday evening i have given it a little more thought <e> <s> i do not think that it is the maximum period about which we should worry so much as the minimum period <e> <s> it has been announced what we plan to do and i shall probably be dealing with the minimum period very late tomorrow afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i intend to stand up together with the noble lord lord underhill to say how pleased i am with this amendment <e> <s> also if it is in order to do so may i thank the noble baroness on the woolsack for telling us which list we are on <e> <s> that was useful in the case of the last amendments <e> <s> amendments on either list are coming up all the time and it is useful to be told which list is relevant <e> <s> i hope that the noble colleagues of the noble baroness will follow her example <e> <s> with respect i find rather surprising what the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran has said <e> <s> in this particular instance we are discussing psv licences <e> <s> there is another sign that we will be discussing on i think amendment no <e> <s> which is going to deal with taxis <e> <s> may i say that i think that this amendment goes all the way and is thoroughly acceptable <e>", "<cs> my lords again i find it necessary to support the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord lord underhill for expressing all his doubts and for putting forward this amendment which i think is very apt and very right <e> <s> i am very grateful for the adjournment because i have been spending part of it getting advice from the experts <e> <s> on the question of safety i would have thought the local educational authorities might be able to manage to get their vehicles through the annual testing but i ask my noble <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord lord underhill aware when he talks of the possibility of a double-decker vehicle being driven that it might be one of those old double-deckers with a crash gearbox <e> <s> it might not last for many years <e> <s> when i was driving which was not all that many years ago i had a licence to drive all types <e> <s> those who came from london transport were not qualified to drive the old type of bus i was driving because they were used to driving buses with pre-select gearboxes <e> <s> what i say might apply not only to double-deckers <e> <s> we might have people with psv licences coming across these old vehicles for the first time in their lives <e> <s> i am sure that some noble lords will remember driving cars in which to chsnge gear they had to double-declutch rather different from the smart syncromesh gearboxes we have now <e> <s> someone who has had no relevant experience might be asked to drive a double-decker and he might have to change up which is not very difficult but then change down with a standing load <e> <s> he might be starting off on a hill where he has to crash gear from first to second <e> <s> i think that perhaps i have said enough and i believe that the noble lord lord underhill has made his point <e>", "<cs> my lords if i were to treat this in the proper way i should have to take some time in doing so but i do not intend to do so <e> <s> my noble friend lord morris spoke about being able to dress people in uniforms <e> <s> it was not uniforms to which i referred but badges <e> <s> on this point of uniforms some years ago the national bus company gave their drivers and conductors what they thought was a rather smart uniform <e> <s> i may say in this connection that after the uniforms had been issued i called in at a bus cafe which i used to use and asked the lady behind the counter what she thought of the new uniforms <e> <s> she replied that in them the men looked like out-of-work chorus boys <e> <s> one has now come to accept that uniform <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i do not know if i still have the right of reply <e>", "<cs> there is nothing written in this bill that there has necessarily to be a badge whether it is a company badge or some other badge <e> <s> we have discussed this for long enough and i say we should give the other place an opportunity to consider this if it gets there <e>", "<cs> my lords i had intended to speak after the ministers reply but i feel that i must make a few points and i do not propose to weary your lordships or add to the general principle which was so cogently expressed by the noble lord lord underhill <e> <s> what my noble friends have said against the amendment has not convinced me <e> <s> as for training these people which matter was raised by my noble friend lord digby let us first consider the case of the existing driver <e> <s> presumably he would not have any training after all he has been driving these buses <e> <s> he would simply go along for his test and if he did not pass then he should not be driving in the first place <e> <s> for new drivers i cannot see why there should be one system for one set of drivers and another for a second set <e> <s> i suppose regrettably that amendment no <e> <s> we shall have to let go but i feel we shall have to put amendment no <e> <s> to the test unless the minister can give some assurance even at this late hour or can be persuaded to accept it <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add just a word to wish the bill well on its way and to join in the tributes paid to my noble friend lord bellwin <e> <s> i should like also to wish him success with his future bills <e> <s> on this his first bill he could not have been kinder though i still do not think the bill is a very good bill <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to the noble lord lord evans there are quite a lot of us who are not irritated and not bad-tempered and are quite happy for this house to go on for a long time on this bill <e> <s> although the opposition have done very well there are a lot sitting on this side of the house and in all parts of the house who are happy to go on a lot longer <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble and learned friend for that reply and i am extremely grateful to him for the great personal interest that he <e>", "<cs> my lords the third question was whether the feasibility study would look at the long-term future of the nations archives <e> <s> i am thinking of the nations heritage on paper and not of the short-term economic situation <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that i can aid and abet the noble and learned lord opposite in that i can confirm that the public have received excellent assistance both at chancery lane and at kew <e> <s> but may i ask one further question <e> <s> could the tigers possibly be kept off cutting staff at the public record office while this feasibility study is in view <e>", "<cs> finally my lords is my noble and learned friend aware that i entirely reiterate what he has said on the question of the noble lord lord strabolgi <e> <s> there is a very good reason for keeping the nations archives within the realms of the public record office though there is an excellent manuscript reading room at the british library <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always absolutely delightful to follow the noble lord who has just sat down even though he goes at a rate of three thousand revs to the minute with the choke out <e> <s> if one tried to follow him one would fall on ones face very quickly and so i was grateful to the noble viscount lord st davids for providing a slight pause <e> <s> to turn to my own speech like other noble lords i am very grateful to the noble viscount lord sidmouth for putting down this motion <e> <s> we need a transport policy <e> <s> we also need a clear-cut motion such as he has given us to get our teeth into <e> <s> it is most refreshing to be able to let ones thoughts and emotions go in a debate like this when we are discussing transport policy and we are not being ruled by the narrow confines of proposed legislation such as the transport bills of recent sessions <e> <s> we do not want to discuss those arguments again in any shape or form <e>", "<cs> before we move from this point i should like to intervene for the first time in regard to this bill <e> <s> i should like to point out to the noble lord lord houghton that i am a walker as he is but i do not feel we should enter into a sort of preciousness <e> <s> the farmer has one right and the walker has another right <e> <s> these rights of way came about because of the rights of access <e> <s> nevertheless these ancient rights of way are the queens highway just as the mi is so really what we are asking for is give and take on all sides <e> <s> i think this bill is trying to do something which will let the walker walk round and the farmer farm but not having any confrontation or conflict of any kind so that people can work together in a fairly <e>", "<cs> i should like to agree with the noble lord lord melchett <e> <s> i should not have agreed with lord melchett had i not presided over an annual general meeting recently of the county group of the ramblers association when this point came up <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i should like to ask him one question <e> <s> he said that he finds it alien for a man to marry his stepdaughter <e> <s> would he still find it alien for a man to marry his step-daughter if his wife was deceased <e> <s> and i am not thinking of the cases concerning obedience <e>", "<cs> my lords i too spoke on the committee stage and i just wish to mention one point as practically every other point has been covered <e> <s> the only relevant point which i believe has been left out at this stage and which could be mentioned is about the county councils and these footpaths which are just as much a part of the queens highway as any other road and i support this amendment <e> <s> paths go from one county council to another <e> <s> i think that is a relevant point and one that should be mentioned before your lordships decide which way to cast your votes <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no hesitation in speaking on this amendment at all <e> <s> it is rather confusing <e> <s> one starts off with the noble lord lord kilmarnock talking about waymarking <e> <s> he was then backed up by the noble lord lord underhill saying how necessary it was when one got off the main road in the middle of nowhere to know where to go <e> <s> then my noble friend lord moyne and my noble friend lord monk bretton both brought objections straight away <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords as one who has not shot his bolt by having spoken before my noble friend spoke i am very disappointed with that answer <e> <s> i listened to his argument as did the whole house <e> <s> i am afraid that i and i think a few others shall not be able to support the government in their view <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not attempt to follow the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby in his witty amusing but also serious harangue <e> <s> it was very enjoyable <e> <s> i shall be extremely brief <e> <s> like all other noble lords i warmly thank my noble friend the minister for explaining so well all the details of this long bill <e> <s> happily there is nothing for me to say on road passenger transport matters <e> <s> that is a great relief because that industry had enough on its plate last time to last it a lifetime <e> <s> there is however a clause dealing with the taxi-drivers and here i agree with my noble friend lord lucas it is disappointing that we do not go further on that aspect <e>", "<cs> my noble and learned friend has given us a very full reply and before that my noble friend lord inglewood also gave us an extremely good explanation <e> <s> the only point of difference i have with him is that he mentioned that the noble baroness lady stedman might have taken a police brief <e> <s> i do not think that either the police or the noble baroness lady stedman would have produced either <e> <s> i prefer the amendment tabled by the noble lord lord underhill on this matter <e> <s> the only point i should like to take up with my noble and learned friend the lord advocate is that he described the number of cases as small <e> <s> that is an undefined amount let us have some figures <e> <s> i do not think we can just be left with it being small we should have a further explanation on that <e>", "<cs> not moved <e>", "<cs> like my noble friend i did not follow the noble lord lord avebury either but i have followed him to a certain extent <e> <s> the home office records would not get anybody very far because clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the government very much for putting this very small matter right in this bill <e> <s> also i suppose that i must declare an interest because i research peoples forebears not that i was worried about the government being a competitor <e> <s> it is just that i was not sure how good they would be at it especially without training <e> <s> i must also point out that i did not myself discover this <e> <s> it was discovered by a member of the public who took the trouble to read and understand the bill and wrote in <e> <s> it is splendid when people do these things <e>", "<cs> my lords i must thank my noble friend for putting down this very important motion and also for wording it in such a constructive way so that one knows precisely what one is debating <e> <s> also i would like to join with other noble lords in congratulating the noble lord who made his maiden speech he gave us a very clear interesting speech and we hope he will speak again soon <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i even apologise for interrupting <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that he is giving us the most appalling bromide about government costs and everything else <e> <s> in this debate we have tried to suggest something to enliven public transport and to give a bit of initiative <e> <s> my noble friend is going back over the same old ground about cost effectiveness but what we are trying to do is to suggest something to avoid congestion <e> <s> we are only going through what successive governments have tried to do about costs and other things <e> <s> what we are trying to do is to look at a much wider policy <e> <s> i wish that my noble friend would slightly develop his theme on that <e> <s> i have probably not been concise or constructive and i am sure that other people could interrupt him and do rather better than i have done <e>", "<cs> i apologise to your lordships and i apologise also to the official reporter and to the <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may come back on the word elaborate with due respect to my noble and learned friend when it came to wording this question together with the white paper the report and everything else and i of course want him to reply elaborate was totally the wrong word that i was advised to mention <e>", "<cs> my lords this seems something of a hornets nest <e> <s> if my noble friend lady faithfull had not intervened in the speech of the noble lord lord somers i would have done so <e> <s> the only comment that i should like to make on that last point is that there might be a difficulty over the bus service at epsom but there is an excellent train service from epsom <e> <s> for those coming to london and to other of our major cities there is a perfectly reasonable public transport system <e> <s> in many ways it is competitive with the price of petrol if one uses cheap day tickets and what-have-you and take full advantage of these facilities and there is no worry of having to park a car <e> <s> so much for that subject <e> <s> now i shall come to my own speech <e>", "<cs> i also find myself falling between two stools between the amendment and my noble friends answer <e> <s> i appreciate the ministers answer on economic and perhaps political grounds but the national bus company has been going for many years and has built up the coaching side as an integral part of the business <e> <s> my noble friend replies that the coaching side should be given over because it would be unfair for the taxpayer to have to subsidise industries which should be commercial concerns <e> <s> very well but there are a few practical matters we should bear in mind <e> <s> one is the availability of crews working unsocial hours <e> <s> at present we are suffering unemployment and the amount of lost mileage due to lack of crews is very little compared with what it was a decade or two ago <e> <s> we can look forward we hope to the future with a fuller employment situation and then one of the first industries to suffer will be service industries such as this which involve working unsocial hours as must be the case with buses <e> <s> the coach industries either private or public will be all right there will be plenty of people to work in those because a certain glamour attaches to them <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord underhill winds up i should like to refer to one point which perhaps has not been mentioned <e> <s> my noble friend has mentioned that nbc will have per cent <e> <s> well that is fine but it should be stated that at the moment very good arrangements are working between nbc and private companies <e> <s> for instance eastern national and eastern counties have an arrangement with i believe george ewer grey green and with the west midlands and three other companies <e> <s> they all work very well at the moment <e> <s> perhaps one is not thinking as widely as one might but one cannot yet see the point of what is proposed <e> <s> i shall not vote against the government but i shall not be able to vote with them if the matter goes to a division <e>", "<cs> i am afraid i am not very much up into financial affairs <e> <s> i should like an assurance from my noble friend <e> <s> regarding the per cent <e> <s> or whatever it was and that has rather come out in the light of debate it is a fact that no commercial concern in the foreseeable future is going to put a lot of money into the declining industry of stage carriage <e> <s> unfortunately this country unlike most of europe apart from one or two countries still has a declining number of people using public transport <e> <s> the only people who are going to put money into public transport are those who think they can make a quick buck on coach services <e>", "<cs> in order to hurry up the committee i will come in now so that my noble friend can answer both the noble lord lord underhill and myself <e> <s> i am in sympathy with the amendment because one <e>", "<cs> that was a most interesting intervention by the noble lord lord byers <e> <s> but before one gets on to the business about the merits of this amendment on pensions being safeguarded i should like to ask my noble friend this question <e> <s> he may prefer to write to tell me what pension arrangements there are for the non-clerical staff of the national bus company <e> <s> i suspect that there are very few unless the situation has changed very much in the past years <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend replies to the noble lord lord mishcon on the question of parking offences they are usually fairly straightforward <e> <s> you must know when you are guilty and when you are not or usually you must <e> <s> after all there is a single yellow line which means that you cannot park between and on monday to friday or monday to saturday <e>", "<cs> i am terribly surprised to be getting up again so quickly <e> <s> in reply to the point made by the noble lord lord underhill if fixed penalties go further then fair enough <e> <s> he also felt that disqualification for obstructing a clearway was going it a bit strong <e> <s> i believe that my noble friend also mentioned this <e> <s> we have transport bills rather often but we do not often have these sort of sections in transport bills <e> <s> we are dealing with a major problem with congestion on the roads <e> <s> i suppose that directly parking does not affect road safety but it does due to frustration as i have explained <e> <s> i believe that we must look very much further than we are doing already <e> <s> there is also this business about people paying <e> <s> they jolly well do not pay <e> <s> i shall not delay the committee any longer but i shall take my noble friends advice and read what he said he having read what i said <e> <s> perhaps at a later stage we can come back and deal with this matter all over again <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the argument in relation to this and the previous amendment has involved the two front benches bouncing backwards and forwards so to speak <e> <s> i think my noble and learned friend the lord advocate said the tuc probably would be covered though it has been difficult for one to grasp all the arguments because the debate has gone rather beyond the language of the layman <e> <s> the noble lord lord wedderburn is extremely clear in general and i thought my noble and learned friend gave a clear-cut answer <e> <s> if so perhaps we might move to the next business quite quickly <e>", "<cs> in that case i will withdraw the amendment <e> <s> i suppose that i should have given my noble friend notice a little earlier that i intended to bring this up <e> <s> it was a separate point that was dealt with very briefly when we dealt with amendment no <e> <s> and i think it is an important point <e> <s> perhaps i might put it down again on report <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords before the debate on this amendment comes to a conclusion may i say that the noble lord says he is not going to divide the house <e> <s> i am rather sorry that he is not <e> <s> having listened right the way through to all sorts of arguments on the point of integration i think that if there is no integration in some services and the noble lord has not been specific perhaps the point is well worth another amendment on third reading <e> <s> if you do not have integrated services in some rural areas you will end up by having no services at all and that will be dreadful <e> <s> i do not think that that point has been spelled out <e> <s> i hope the noble lord will reconsider it today or we should have another go at this at third reading because i do not think anybody in any part of the house is very satisfied <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say with regard to the question asked by my noble friend lord orr-ewing about bunching or staircasing which was the term that was used that this is not usually the fault of the driver or the conductor but is due to conditions of the traffic involved <e> <s> once we get the traffic situation properly dealt with that will be all right <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that priority must be given to readers to be able to go and get the books which they require in the shortest possible time <e> <s> although i also agree that the round <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be even more brief than i thought i was going to be <e> <s> i think your lordships have listened to a very high standard of debate so far <e> <s> i cannot consider myself in any way technically minded so as to be able to enter into some of the arguments that have been put forward and there is very little room for original thought <e> <s> but i believe this order to be sound comprehensive and sensible and the reasons are simple <e> <s> for one reason the distribution costs in relation to the overall cost of a manufactured product are high <e> <s> perhaps i am oversimplifying this but surely allowing lorries to carry heavier weights will hopefully mean that prices can be held and therefore that inflation can be kept down especially concerning food prices in which respect undeniably i think this government have a very good record <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to provide for the transfer of certain records in the custody of the registrar general to the public record office <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> in doing so i must declare an interest in that i am a genealogist and a record agent <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish at the outset to thank my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor for his remarks <e> <s> as for the question of doctoring in committee i have already been in touch with his department or they have been in touch with me and that will go forward being quite understandable <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to say that i think that this transport bill has much to commend it <e> <s> one therefore regrets that its opponents do not adopt a more balanced approach to it <e> <s> i hope that one is not asking for too much <e> <s> the defence of local policies in the administration of local government is in principle valid <e> <s> however it seems that the practical problems this legislation might cause arise precisely because it does give the last word to the local councils subject only to the courts <e> <s> whatever guidelines the secretary of state of whichever government may provide it will be the councils who decide the level of financial support to be given to the transport executives <e> <s> moreover the basis on which their actions may be justified will be far more realistic than under previous laws as interpreted by the courts <e> <s> it must help the locally elected authorities to be able to justify their policies in the wide terms of overall benefit to the local community in the local circumstances <e> <s> so far so good <e>", "<cs> i must say that i almost take umbrage at the word innocuous <e> <s> we have had plenty of arguments about vexatious but innocuous sounds worse than vexatious <e> <s> however i shall not take umbrage on this occasion <e> <s> i shall read every word that my noble friend has said <e> <s> he has been kind enough to say that he will look into the matter again and i shall be in touch with him between now and the next stage <e> <s> with those comments i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> on this i fully support my noble friend <e> <s> the noble lord lord underhill has been persuasive in moving this series of amendments <e> <s> at first sight i must say i was tempted to agree with them <e> <s> they seem to overcome the danger of this bill as one previously put it in making the executives the whipping boys of both central and local government <e> <s> the co-operation between executive and authority is in preparing a joint plan to ensure that the authorities general policy is fully taken into account <e> <s> however this really cannot be in doubt <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for what he has said <e> <s> after the long deliberations we have had this afternoon i will not delay your lordships because i am sure you will want to go and eat dinner <e> <s> i will read what my noble friend has said just as he will read what i have said and in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord underhill replies i have been more or less driven to my feet <e> <s> i stand by what i said yesterday <e> <s> like the noble lord lord underhill and the noble baroness lady fisher i also went to tyne and wear <e> <s> i think it is this part of the bill dealing with the plans with which they are particularly concerned <e> <s> i do not wish to make a second reading speech on that particular point or to be particularly regional but if my noble friend can look into it that will be splendid <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend replies i should like to answer one or two points made by the noble <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> i said that if central government are to give an opinion they should know about everything that is going on <e> <s> if they do not know what is going on we might as well not have the bill <e>", "<cs> i do not want to add very much to what the noble lord lord mishcon has said <e> <s> he has explained the situation carefully and has also given your lordships the benefit of details of the letter in which the government replied and it was a very good letter <e>", "<cs> i am sure my lords that the noble baroness has made it quite clear <e> <s> i think in those circumstances the answer is yes <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord underhill replies this situation arose in the beeching era when railway lines were closed and bus services were substituted <e> <s> he was dealing with railway lines that were built years ago in the days of railway mania <e> <s> can my noble friend say whether there have been any such <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble and learned friend for his kind comments <e> <s> i thank him very much for dealing with the matter and particularly i thank the officials who have been most patient in producing these highly technical amendments <e> <s> i also thank the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones for his amusing comments i suffer from time to time looking for the name of jones <e> <s> i am sure the joneses of wales will find it very much easier to find their joneses by looking directly at the registers <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to intervene <e> <s> i have listened with interest to all the debates <e> <s> i heard lord underhill move the amendment <e> <s> i can follow his argument when he talks about the situation in regard to the next two months payments <e> <s> however i cannot see what effect the wording of the two amendments will achieve <e> <s> i am not sure of the purpose behind the <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a third time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble and learned friend for those unexpected comments at this stage and i take note of all that he says <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e> <s> in doing so i thank very much my noble and learned friend who in the past has given me assurance especially in and also the noble and learned lord the previous lord chancellor <e> <s> this is a very happy day for me and i thank your lordships very much <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend not agree in view of questions that have been asked that it is right that those who pay their dues should have their views heard whether by ballot or whatever <e>", "<cs> my lords i would say oh good <e> <s> it is nice to hear a voice <e> <s> sometimes one feels one is just talking to cushions <e> <s> is this not another reason for lifting the decision-making process out of local government into the national forum so that oil exploration plans in aonbs if they are to continue to be placed there <e> <s> can be examined at the outset by technical experts and the chances of them growing like topsy can be reduced <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i am hoping that my noble friend has a point in bringing all these lovelies along about overhead power cables chalk pits and all the other things referred to but i cannot say that one accepts those any more than one accepts these <e> <s> the power cables going up have made certain areas quite hideous <e> <s> one certainly does not want any more <e> <s> i cannot let my noble friend get away with it <e> <s> i do not know what is on the rest of his list or whether there will be any more items but i shall listen <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be very brief <e> <s> i very much welcome this bill and i must thank my noble friend for allowing us to be emotional sentimental and reminiscent which is just what i am going to be <e> <s> i am going to join the club because i spent many happy hours if sometimes frustrating ones clambering up <e>", "<cs> my lords i was going to keep fairly quiet until i heard the noble lord lord beswick <e> <s> i agree entirely with all that has been said by my noble friend the chairman of committees <e> <s> this is a most necessary bill which will provide a railway link from the minories from what was fenchurch street to the isle of dogs <e> <s> it will also lead to development of a rather derelict area and that is a most important aspect <e> <s> nobody disagrees at all with that <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend please tell me how many people have been requesting these documents and how many have been refused them <e> <s> that is the pertinent question <e> <s> is he aware that there are many other classes of records and that documents have to go back to departments where they can be consulted <e> <s> we are dealing with a narrow area <e> <s> in respect to the original question can my noble friend say how many people have requested the documents and how many have been refused them <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble and learned friend for moving these orders <e> <s> on the order regarding new towns i have nothing to say but praise <e> <s> railway records however is a subject that has raised some considerable comment concern and even disquiet in the press and elsewhere recently <e> <s> i have done my humble best to understand the complexities of the question and will therefore put forward a view as to how i see the situation as it stands at the moment and make some suggestions as to how this problem can be put right in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i had absolutely no intention of speaking and i agree with the findings of the select committee absolutely but this is rather a sour note at the beginning of an important bill <e> <s> i feel that after having settled the matter of the ticket office and everything else one wishes the progress of the development of london docklands and everything that goes with it well in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords before i start on my own intervention i must mention that my noble friend lady gardner of parkes was obliged to attend a meeting of the special health authority of which she is a member <e> <s> todays meeting is dealing with a particularly urgent matter for which her presence is essential <e> <s> therefore she was unable to take her place in this debate <e> <s> she greatly regrets this and has asked me to explain it to your lordships <e>", "<cs> i am also in sympathy with this group of amendments and agree with my noble friend lord plummer <e> <s> the national bus company through the london country services took over the old green line london transport country service and did a great job <e> <s> in fact my noble friend has mentioned services in <e>", "<cs> i am heartened by what my noble friend the minister has just said that london transport can come in and tender for services <e> <s> i should like quickly to take as an example the services running between croydon and crawley <e> <s> would it be possible for the nbc to run a service between streatham and crawley <e> <s> will the co-ordination allow new and better services to tie up places inner going to outer <e> <s> i think that my noble friend grasps what i am trying to say <e> <s> if that is what my noble friend says this will achieve i feel very much happier <e>", "<cs> this amendment is the same as the last one <e> <s> i do not believe that financial duty or financial objectives are in any way a constraint <e> <s> many years ago i spoke to people who were involved in the management of bus services <e> <s> they sat up all night discussing how a particular route could be made to pay <e> <s> they looked at the means of providing a service for a particular need and they tried to operate that service down certain roads within a certain area in order to accommodate certain people <e> <s> that is the purpose of the clause <e> <s> with all due respect to the opposition i believe that they are missing the point <e>", "<cs> as my name has been mentioned for my contribution on second reading which i made on behalf of my noble friend lady gardner may i say that i agree with everything that has been stated from both sides of the committee <e> <s> this is totally a non-party matter <e> <s> i agree that these clauses have to be considered with the utmost caution and understanding <e> <s> in regard to the point raised by the noble baroness lady denington about identity cards which has been refuted a surcharge would be pointless if a person had no money in his possession and had given a fictitious name and address <e> <s> if we are not to have identity cards a person should at least have proof of his identity or someone who knows that person should be produced <e> <s> all this seems very extreme but it is not an easy matter <e> <s> i am delighted that the government are to take it up <e>", "<cs> i was about to say a few words in support of the noble lord lord tordoff not wishing to delay the committee any longer than is necessary <e> <s> i felt earlier and i know that i was not at my most explicit that the whole theme of this bill is one of extra co-ordination and development of services <e> <s> of course we are not on that particular part of the bill but the noble lord has moved a whole string of important amendments to deal with this <e> <s> as far as national bus company is concerned the company that deals with it is the london country bus company which is known to the locals as the mint with the hole <e> <s> all that i really want is for that hole not to remain quite such a hole <e> <s> i want it to be filled in and developed <e> <s> i think the noble lord will agree with me that in his first explanatory speech on the moving of the amendment he left his best bit to last <e> <s> perhaps not even at the next stage but when another of these amendments comes up perhaps on the next day of the committee which will be on thursday the noble lord could then give us an answer <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank the noble lords lord underhill and lord tordoff for supporting my amendment <e> <s> i am extremely grateful to the minister for giving some encouragement <e> <s> i am sure my amendment has some defects and that what he can produce will be much more effective <e> <s> in the light of that i beg leave to withdraw amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord lord tordoff for his intervention <e> <s> i disagree with my noble friend about the tourist season <e> <s> the most important part of the tourist season is from the beginning of july until the end of august <e> <s> i believe that the amendment should be written into the bill and i am extremely unhappy that my noble friend says that he is unable to consider it <e> <s> whether or not he has any more to say about it i do not know <e> <s> he agrees with it in principle <e> <s> at the report stage i may make a slight adjustment to the amendment <e> <s> i do not intend to let the matter rest <e> <s> for very practical reasons it is a very important amendment <e> <s> at the report stage i shall be armed with further information <e> <s> although i may return with the same amendment i may as i have already said make slight modifications to it <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for what he has said <e> <s> however may i make the point that although <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend for moving this amendment <e> <s> i thought that the amendment i produced at committee stage was very good but his is much superior because it takes in not only british rail but all the other people including the national bus company who might come into this situation <e> <s> the amendment is particularly important to give teeth to the bill <e> <s> one could look at it as a sort of individual in the annual report but it proves accountability <e> <s> i am very pleased that my noble friend thought fit to amend this part of the bill and i am quite sure the amendment will be useful <e> <s> i am very grateful and i should like to thank my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i should first like to thank through my noble friend the minister the parliamentary draftsman for having drafted all the clauses so clearly <e> <s> i would advise anyone who is studying these clauses to start by reading clause then clauses and and then clauses and <e> <s> they will all then fit into place <e> <s> i have received such a good briefing that if i was terribly bossy i could answer all the questions put by the noble lord lord underhill but that is my noble friends job rather than mine <e>", "<cs> my lords unless i am absolutely wrong i believe that any form of season ticket from london transport must have ones photograph on it <e>", "<cs> yes my lords it is fairly new as my noble friend has pointed out <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl is quite correct <e> <s> if he had a season ticket which is partly for british rail and initiated by british rail it would not have a photograph on it <e> <s> but if it was only for london transport he would have to go into say woolworths or wherever to have his photograph taken and then stick it on the season ticket <e> <s> there is not much more to say except that this is very much a new area <e> <s> it is a new concept for all although i was very surprised to see that tyne and wear and manchester are already ahead of london <e> <s> it is high time we followed <e> <s> it will be tough but well worth it <e>", "<cs> my lords i must confess that i was slightly in sympathy with this amendment which the noble lord lord underhill has put forward <e> <s> i think that before one goes too far i should like to ask my noble friend when he replies to explain absolutely what manufactures are permissible by london transport because i gather the number is fairly small <e> <s> one in particular is a cream which will wipe off graffiti <e> <s> they patented and market and i think distribute that themselves <e> <s> that seems entirely permissible and absolutely sensible and should be allowed to continue <e>", "<cs> my lords first i must thank my noble friend for coming back on the manufacturing amendment <e> <s> i shall read all that he says very carefully before considering what to do <e> <s> on this present amendment i am very grateful to him for taking this back <e> <s> all i can say is that i look forward to his amendment on third reading i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend for his kind remarks about myself and for his detailed explanation of the new amendments from which the whole house has benefited <e> <s> i am sure that they are absolutely justified <e> <s> i have nothing to add <e> <s> i shall read the proposals very carefully <e> <s> i am quite sure that the whole industry not only london transport but also the existing competitors will benefit <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to come in here but i think there is one point which has not been covered in this wide-ranging discussion <e> <s> what we are talking about especially is the train side of it <e> <s> the train side of it will not be started until the minister of state is convinced that london regional transport has everything correct for it to go forward <e> <s> one point has arisen where the passenger was unable to get a ticket at a particular station <e> <s> we did not mention it i am afraid to report but it has to be mentioned now and if i am wrong my noble friend will interrupt me <e> <s> the point is that at each of the stations if for any reason the booking office is closed there will be opportunities for passengers to obtain a ticket or for a machine to provide a ticket to prove the station where the journey started <e> <s> i do feel that explaining this should alleviate doubts in some peoples minds as to the fairness of this whole proposal <e>", "<cs> my lords in returning to this question i should like to ask if it is not a fact that last october the government set the chairman a clear and achievable set of objectives for all its businesses <e> <s> is it not a fact that the government have accepted in full the grant claim for million submitted by british railways for grant in <e> <s> we have not heard very much from noble lords opposite about that fact <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend be kind enough to give us some details of accidents that have occurred with coaches and bearing in mind the question of the noble lord opposite perhaps he can also give us details of fatalities which have arisen out of those accidents which is even worse <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that quite a lot of us have been rather loquacious on this subject this afternoon <e> <s> however is my noble friend aware that the noble lord lord underhill got his white paper at pm and i did not get mine until pm <e> <s> they were dutifully sitting on the windowsill in the printed paper office bound but not open at that time <e> <s> so the noble lord was privileged <e> <s> the noble lord was able to ask a lot of very important questions which my noble friend has answered <e> <s> however my questions to my noble friend are much more trite <e>", "<cs> my lords with some embarrassment i have to say that owing to a long-standing engagement i must crave the indulgence of your lordships <e> <s> i shall be unable to remain for the winding-up speeches and my noble friends reply <e> <s> this is the first occasion upon which i have had to leave before the end of a debate <e> <s> i hope that it will be a long time before it ever happens again <e>", "<cs> my lords i have read with much interest your lordships select committees report and i would join with others in thanking the noble lord lord kings norton and his committee for the extensive inquiry they have undertaken <e> <s> i did come myself latterly into the work of the sub-committee and i am conscious of the hard work of all concerned <e> <s> the position was made even more difficult this has been mentioned already by the constant threat of eec proposals while the study was going on <e> <s> ever since then i have felt it is not profitable to study the aspects of this report in too great detail <e> <s> rather i think it preferable to make a few general points which i hope that your lordships and those who represent us in europe will bear in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for interrupting the noble lord on this point but could he indicate what kind of research has not been covered <e> <s> if the noble lord could give some ideas to the department or to others to follow up it would be excellent <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that alterations in escalators and stairs are inevitable and that london regional transport are to be congratulated on the way that they have dealt with the earls court problem <e> <s> they have given every indication that people should change at stations alternative to earls court <e> <s> on the other hand though i am aware that he will not be able to give me an absolute answer there is an unsatisfactory situation at the embankment station when changing from the victoria to the bakerloo line <e> <s> it is rather more important than hyde park corner because the embankment deals with an interchange and you have to go down an unsatisfactory iron staircase rather like an old-fashioned fire escape <e> <s> i have an aged relative who has suffered injuries and that is an area that should be looked into <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask my noble friend whether it is not true that this bill is going to be produced within an hour <e> <s> i should rather like to forget about hereford <e> <s> will he confirm to me that within an hour we shall all be able to sit down and look at any proposals and form our own opinion <e>", "<cs> my lords when i first saw this bill referred to on the order paper i thought that i really must try to support the government on what is a public transport matter especially as i fully supported the need for the original london regional transport bill <e> <s> i congratulate the new london regional transport organisation on the way that it is proceeding <e> <s> through its efforts the ratepayers of <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have had the privilege of serving on the lord chancellors advisory council on public records for nine years would my noble friend confirm that the act of relates to the -year rule while the act relates to the -year rule <e> <s> is she aware that if the noble lord lord gladwyn referred himself to the master of the rolls the chairman of that committee and asked for a review of the situation he might fare slightly better <e> <s> that is the rule of this country <e> <s> it is the rule of the land <e> <s> equally will my noble friend confirm what i think is the case that no post-tzarist regime records are available in moscow which explains why every january russians come here to see what we have opened up after years <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords i am extremely grateful to the noble lord lord somers for introducing this afternoon this interesting debate on the railways <e> <s> when one speaks about railways one does not run out of areas to talk about <e> <s> one cannot possibly say that everything has been said because if there were or speakers there would still be an original point to make <e> <s> i prepared a speech albeit brief but i have ditched my notes and would rather start again and think of what to say <e>", "<cs> my lords some noble lords will know that i am an old bus hack and this transport bill is almost as controversial as the one on which i made my maiden speech years ago <e> <s> it was on the same day of the week and the same date in <e> <s> i must say that i am very pleased that it is my noble friend lord belstead who is leading on this bill <e> <s> he had just then been promoted to the front bench in opposition assisting my noble friend lord nugent of guildford whose wisdom we shall enjoy later this afternoon <e> <s> furthermore on that occasion we listened to the noble lord lord shepherd for minutes <e> <s> i must say that i was in more agreement with him today than i was then <e> <s> lastly i gather that the noble lord <e> <s> lord carmichael was working on that bill for the government of the day in another place <e> <s> on th june in the year i shall hope to be joining all those noble lords again <e>", "<cs> indeed i shall but not at this time there are speakers <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to disturb my noble friends train of thought but he talked about the act and i should like to remind him that there were some excellent cross-country services which went nowhere near london and which have disappeared <e> <s> there was one operated by a private operator of great repute in cambridge <e> <s> the service was called the eastlander and it ran near my noble friends native suffolk <e> <s> there were two spurs one from felixstowe and another from harwich which went straight through to cheltenham and connected with everywhere in the country <e> <s> the national bus company has certainly been very successful but there are many important services which have disappeared because of that bill <e>", "<cs> i rise lukewarmly to support the noble lord lord shepherd <e> <s> he mentioned that the national bus company will come into this situation but he did not mention any amendments to clauses and <e> <s> if he intends to table them i shall support him <e> <s> he also mentioned when deregulation should come into force <e> <s> that does not mean to say that there are later amendments which will deal with certain specific problems <e> <s> clearly he is right to be concerned that deregulation of local bus services should not come into effect until the industry has been reorganised <e> <s> at the very least the situation should have been reached from which it is clear that a proper basis is being established for the competition which may follow deregulation to be sustained on a fair basis <e> <s> fairness of competition is a major plank of government thinking and undoubtedly the bill makes repeated reference to this fact <e>", "<cs> my name is also to this amendment <e> <s> i can only say that one looks forward to my noble friends assurance that there will be amendments which will make the transition period for local authorities much easier <e> <s> i should like to add only this very brief comment <e> <s> it is that not only should they make the transition easier for local authorities but should also do so for the general public <e> <s> so far the general public has not been mentioned <e> <s> the general public may be in great confusion over this transitional period <e> <s> maybe my noble friend was thinking that the local authorities were operating on that publics behalf <e> <s> with that the noble lord lord carmichael will have to make his assumption <e> <s> we shall just have to wait to see what my noble friend offers <e>", "<cs> i hesitate to interrupt my noble friend who is so distinguished and who has dealt with transport matters for so many years but i must draw his attention to the amendment <e> <s> the amendment says <e>", "<cs> i agree with every word of the outstanding speech made by the noble lord lord shepherd <e> <s> much has been mentioned by various noble lords about the hereford trial area <e> <s> i shall concentrate on the city of hereford <e> <s> noble lords have mentioned the fact that there was per cent <e> <s> less subsidy <e> <s> the noble lord lord shepherd referred to the fact that what happens under the bill is not the present situation <e> <s> that is perfectly correct <e> <s> however i must make one or two comments as i am one of the few people who have visited hereford admittedly last september but that might have been a period when there was more competition and more in line with what the government are seeking <e> <s> since then it has very much declined <e>", "<cs> following the noble lord lord mountevans i rather think that it is opportune for my noble friend lord belstead to answer the question of the noble lord lord shepherd <e> <s> i am perfectly happy to continue with saying a few words on this amendment myself but before i do so i think that my noble friend should say a few words to answer the point of the noble lord lord shepherd <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down and the question is put perhaps i may say that i absolutely agree with what he said and i enjoyed the speech of my noble friend the minister <e> <s> however when he talks about keeping the tyne and wear metro and the <e>", "<cs> i want to say very little about this amendment <e> <s> i too like the noble lord lord shepherd shall be interested to hear the governments response <e> <s> i do not think that cambridge and norfolk would be quite the examples to use i should think that perhaps the highlands of scotland might be one example where it is possible to have miles between bus stops <e> <s> i think that probably my noble friends from north of the border might be able to help me by saying that if there are miles between bus stops you can call it a bus stop if it is at some bothy which is only used in the summer <e> <s> if that is so it is not a credible bus stop it is what might be called fudging <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to interrupt my noble friend lady elliot but my noble friend has referred to me and has touched on a point which i never even thought of mentioning <e> <s> he has talked about encouraging operators to go around villages <e> <s> i think that operators will be delighted to go around many villages so long as the people are there <e> <s> i should also like to tell him about my experience as an operative many years ago <e> <s> the public are very trying in this respect <e> <s> if they are made to go around lots of villages or to do many detours they will say i cant be bothered to do this <e> <s> they will find some alternative form of transport and will not support a service <e>", "<cs> we have now got to a stage where we are considering a whole series of amendments on which one has to decide whether to speak or not to speak <e> <s> i had decided the latter but i have now come to speak <e> <s> one must support anything to do with safety <e> <s> my noble friend lord de la warr mentioned the traffic commissioners staff <e> <s> i hope that the people who are going to inspect the vehicles are not going to be the same staff who report the faults <e> <s> that would be dreadful <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for what he has said even though i do not agree with every word of it <e> <s> i shall of course beg leave to withdraw my amendment but i made my noble friend aware earlier that i had found a pair of amendments which dealt with just that situation in the case of the london regional transport bill <e> <s> there was something similar in the greater london council powers dealing with a specific london question and it was the government which finally came up at third reading with that pair of amendments <e> <s> it is very interesting to hear my noble friends comments and i shall read carefully what he has said and then make an assessment <e> <s> i am grateful to him for those parts that he has agreed with and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i fully support this important amendment which is one of the most important amendments we have <e> <s> it was interestingly and fairly introduced by the noble lord lord shepherd <e> <s> however it is rather a pity that the attendance in the committee is rather thin at the moment <e> <s> this is a worthwhile compromise which will smooth the transition to deregulation <e> <s> it does not make the mistake of looking at tendered services in isolation which would be quite easy to do <e> <s> it also does not wreck the bill by stopping deregulation rather it forms a bridge between the final phase of deregulation and the final adjustment to a free market <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state has agreed that when there is so much uncharted territory ahead it is prudent to make the first reconnaissance and then to allow a <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend sits down can he please tell me about the figure of million <e> <s> in the white paper the figure of million is given <e> <s> is this something fairly new <e>", "<cs> i shall also follow that <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i shall look into paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been an interesting afternoon <e> <s> i wish that we were discussing football or any other sport without it being tinged with violence <e> <s> i join other noble lords in giving a welcome to the noble lord lord donoughue who made a most interesting and relaxed speech without a note <e> <s> we hope that we shall hear him many times and possibly even in committee if he can face it <e> <s> i am quite sure that he can give excellent contributions there <e>", "<cs> i have no intention of pressing the amendment but i am very glad about what my noble friend has said with regard to forthcoming legislation <e> <s> this is a very sober moment in our discussions which have been quite technical <e> <s> i am grateful for what my noble friend has said <e> <s> i shall read the report of what he has said just as he will read the report of what i have said <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> may i say a last word <e> <s> my noble friend explained clearly the difference between scottish and english law <e> <s> i shall read carefully the report of what he said which i am sure is absolutely correct <e> <s> but i hope that drivers who are confronted by this situation will have good employers who will back them up and that they will not be caused any embarrassment <e> <s> all legislation is about people and i feel for the drivers of vehicles who may be confronted by this sort of situation <e> <s> i thank my noble friend and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank all noble lords who have taken part in this debate particularly the noble earl on the liberal benches who paid tribute to the taxi service especially in london <e> <s> i am sure everybody will be very pleased to hear those words <e> <s> as regards what was said by the noble lord lord mcintosh i intended to ask my noble friend that very same question <e> <s> i do not say that one has had a definite answer <e> <s> one has been told that it will be sooner rather than later and quite soon <e> <s> one was hoping to get something a little more definite but alas <e> <s> one has not <e> <s> the noble baroness with her great experience of the county of london has also made some excellent points and has said that there is an urgent need for legislation <e>", "<cs> perhaps my noble friend will look at clause <e> <s> a mini-bus permit can be for an -seater <e> <s> i am glad that he is showing surprise because that is something which should be eliminated from the bill quickly <e>", "<cs> i am certainly very grateful to the noble lord lord carmichael and the noble lord lord tordoff for their support <e> <s> i am sure that my noble friend will not mind and if he does he will have to put up with it if i say that i am not pleased with him <e> <s> he has been frightfully dismissive <e> <s> admittedly i did not expect him to reply for minutes to my speech of minutes but to speak for only four minutes is to be utterly dismissive of these amendments which basically deal with safety <e>", "<cs> that is one of the nicest things the noble lord has said to me this afternoon <e> <s> i should also mention that during the whole of my minutes i was severely barracked and it was very difficult to keep a straight face <e> <s> seriously however these are serious amendments <e> <s> i am not at all happy about it but i do not see any point in pressing these amendments today <e> <s> i urge my noble friend to do as the noble lord lord carmichael has said and between now and report stage go into the question a little more thoroughly <e> <s> for that reason i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i had intended to follow my noble friend the minister but perhaps he would like me to speak now <e> <s> i fully support my noble friend lord de la warr and i am very surprised at some of the irresponsible chats that we have had this afternoon <e> <s> this amendment contains perfectly reasonable requirements for any new operator and they are not restrictive <e> <s> i do not subscribe to the view that all is bad at the moment <e> <s> everything can always be improved <e> <s> contrary to the governments arguments there have been some successful new operators who have appeared over the last few years <e> <s> they have not been beaten to death by the bully-boys <e> <s> but i am not going to be led down that road because i shall go rather wide of the amendment <e>", "<cs> i apologise again to your lordships <e> <s> i have found the piece of paper <e> <s> i can tell your lordships that this is a perfectly straightforward technical amendment <e> <s> my noble friend has already accepted my point <e> <s> in that case i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble lord lord shepherd for echoing my sentiments and also to my noble friend for looking at this point <e> <s> i hope that he will find room to put in some form of amendment if not this one <e> <s> on that assurance i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the whole committee will be very gratified if my noble friend will do that <e> <s> it is a great step forward that the government have agreed in that way to the advisory body <e> <s> i rise to mention only one group of disabled people which was not mentioned last week and which has not been mentioned today <e> <s> i refer to those who are particularly affected by bus travel the arthritic <e> <s> they really suffer the tortures of the damned when they get on a bus and sit down <e> <s> they have the most miserable time <e> <s> i hope that the advisory body will look into their needs as well as the needs of everybody else and will put them high on the list of priorities <e>", "<cs> my noble friend sounds very reassuring <e> <s> i shall read exactly what he says and be advised accordingly <e> <s> i thank him very much indeed and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to follow the very interesting few words of the noble lord lord mcintosh but i think i had better pick up on the words of my noble friend lord mottistone when he said that one should consult the non-users rather than the users <e> <s> the users are in the competitive marketplace and they like to get a whole lot of other people interested <e>

<s> the users publicise their views on local radio in the free press and everywhere else <e> <s> they are surely the people in the know <e> <s> the nonusers are simply uninterested <e>", "<cs> i am delighted to withdraw this amendment <e> <s> in doing so i should like to say that if i had had that answer before i would have taken this amendment off the marshalled list <e> <s> however i am grateful to my noble friend for what he has said <e> <s> i repeat to be absolutely clear on this that any services which now exist which are outside the area will continue to be allowed to do so <e> <s> that has been agreed to and in those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> this was a quiet amendment <e> <s> my noble friend has posed all sorts of arguments which almost make me want to start a long discussion going on for about minutes <e> <s> my noble friend lord de la warr seems to want to ask me a question and he is perfectly able to do so before i sit down or if he thinks that my arguments are inadequate he can come in <e> <s> if my noble friends amendment on clause introduced a trial period for one year or even extended it to two or three years i should say that there was quite a lot to say for that <e> <s> but this bill is largely untried <e>", "<cs> splendid <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will give way the bill says that county councils will only be concerned with the subsidised services not even with commercial services <e>", "<cs> obviously there is a fundamental difference here which perhaps we shall never get over <e> <s> it is not the same sort of answer as my noble friend lord trefgarnes own amendment and my noble friends answer to this amendment does not incite me to reply in quite the same terms <e> <s> i shall withdraw the amendment shortly but i am not happy about this <e>", "<cs> i had absolutely no intention of intervening at this time of night but i must say that we are now back on to the old philosophical tack that with the lid off the pot this bill will be the most roaring success <e> <s> however when it comes to pensions we are discussing important areas of peoples lives <e> <s> i shall not say very much at all and i shall leave your lordships <e>", "<cs> there is one point that i should like to raise in support of this amendment <e> <s> my noble friend mentioned the fact that the peak services may provide spare capacity for maintenance <e> <s> i should like to mention to him that on occasions especially in the resorts on the coast and other places accommodation can very usefully be acquired by private coach excursions coming in thus keeping the vehicles away from the major car parks <e> <s> those depots could perhaps be used for garaging the coaches before they return home in the evening <e> <s> i should like to ask my noble friend whether this amendment could accommodate that <e> <s> if so it would give it very much more thrust <e>", "<cs> this is one of the most interesting parts of the afternoon <e> <s> we are coming back to what one might call an argument <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord tordoff but i must turn to my noble friend lady carnegy <e> <s> she will interrupt me if i am wrong but i think she is saying that if we accept this amendment it will stop the new people coming in <e> <s> she thinks that the new operator will not be able to look at a map or think up a new service and provide for a market which he thinks is there <e> <s> on the other hand she says that if we accept this amendment the members of a local authority will think of their constituents <e> <s> she says that the new commercial man will think of what the public wants but then the local authority will look at what <e>", "<cs> my noble friend will not be surprised if i do not let him get away entirely with his very impressive soliloquy in condemning this amendment <e> <s> i want to say one or two quite minor things <e> <s> my noble friend refers to the operator <e> <s> i talked only this morning with the bus and coach council which serves a large majority of operators <e> <s> one of its largest groups happens to be the independent operators <e> <s> like my noble friend lord de la wan they were a little happy about subsection but only about that <e>", "<cs> it might surprise the noble lord lord shepherd but i thought that on this occasion my noble friend made a clear and moderate speech <e> <s> one has not heard him as much on this bill as one should have liked <e> <s> my noble friend gave the governments view <e> <s> he did not fall into the trap of going back to the old arguments <e> <s> he did mention bureaucracy and paper <e> <s> although i have my name down to this amendment i think that we have to look back to clause <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord lord mcintosh has looked at it and has an excellent argument to throw back at my noble friend <e> <s> in that case one can come in again <e> <s> i thought that my noble friend presented his argument moderately and very well <e>", "<cs> my lords i should not normally have come in now having listened to the noble lord lord carmichael introduce this amendment so effectively and to my noble friend <e> <s> however i do so only to support this amendment <e> <s> i think my noble friend must think quite seriously of the restrictions of the timetable <e> <s> there are only two points that i should like to make to pre-empt his remarks <e>", "<cs> first may i say that i welcome talking to an amendment of the noble baroness lady stedman <e> <s> the last time one spoke to her on transport one was sitting three benches behind her and she was sitting on the front bench <e> <s> that was a few years ago now <e> <s> however although i do not want to introduce a dissenting note on this amendment i feel that at this time of night we are apt to become the faintest bit too cosy <e> <s> one must remember that here we are really talking about disabled people travelling on buses <e> <s> i am sure that my noble friend lady carnegy will not mind if i slightly chide her because she has been telling us that it is hard enough to get buses in the country now and she has been telling us before on all sorts of other amendments that with deregulation and the lid off the pot people will find competition of all kinds coming along <e>", "<cs> i have only a very small point to make about my noble friends amendment no <e> <s> h but i support all his other amendments which have to do with the clause <e> <s> in this bill we are dealing with local bus services <e> <s> we are also dealing with the allocation of extremely limited amounts of money <e> <s> therefore i must ask my noble friend whether in subsection the reference to public passenger transport service should read public passenger transport service by road <e> <s> i hope my noble friend will find favour with this interjection and will regard it as both sensible and helpful to the bill <e> <s> if so i hope he will arrange for the necessary amendment to be made <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for giving me certain assurances but i am not very happy <e>", "<cs> i feel much happier with what my noble friend has said apart from this last statement <e> <s> my noble friend refers to this odd works service which might go out early in the morning and keeps seats for odd members of the public and therefore claims fuel duty rebate <e> <s> that is something he has to look at and to look at the whole wider issue <e>", "<cs> unless any of your lordships object to this amendment being withdrawn i shall withdraw it but if any noble lords objects i shall not shun away from it i shall go ahead with it <e> <s> assurances have been given <e> <s> when one talks about million i agree that there might be some abuse but it is million over the whole and if there is any abuse of it i would say it is very small <e> <s> this is an area at which we have to look <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend and i hope the committee will forgive me if i make a very short re-run of what my noble friend has said in slow motion to make sure that i have understood absolutely clearly what has been said <e> <s> the noble lord lord shepherd quoted a case in which sometimes unfortunate things may happen with regard to spare parts and all kinds of unforeseen mishaps <e> <s> that one might accept <e> <s> also a fine of such high proportions could have an effect on the operators cash-flow and he may not be able to continue to operate <e> <s> that is not really a very likely thing to happen but it could happen and it is something that has to be thought of <e>", "<cs> i am terribly sorry but i have been advised by people who feel strongly about it to move <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to disregard travelling arrangements between sandbach and crewe but i should like to say a few words as an individual and not as someone representing a particular organisation i should like to speak as another noble lord talking about transport <e> <s> transport is essential to the disabled <e> <s> it gets them out of the house and therefore they should be well looked after <e> <s> we are not in dispute about that <e> <s> the government and the opposition agree on that absolutely <e>", "<cs> that sounds very indigestible but that is what my right honourable friend has said <e> <s> the transport bill enacts this provision which is fundamental to the fairness of competition <e>", "<cs> i thank all noble lords who have spoken <e> <s> when we come to schedule i might come in on one or two points but it will not be with conviction <e>", "<cs> my noble friend said after i had got up to interrupt him that he is not going to recommit these clauses <e> <s> every good reason has been put forward before and other amendments have not been moved <e> <s> finally we have reached this point <e> <s> we have got to discuss this very thing and quite frankly all the arguments have been given <e> <s> i do feel that these amendments to schedule should be recommitted in october <e> <s> my noble friend mentioned that these amendments had been before us since th july but it is rather different because one puts down amendments for the government and one expects the government to respond within hours <e> <s> they have civil servants whereas all other organisations have to go back out into the shires and so on <e> <s> in we shall be celebrating the years of domesday the first survey of this country and a most important document not only for this country but for the whole world <e> <s> that may not be quite so important as doing this but the amendments were brought forward on the th july and now we are at the th <e> <s> i think that my noble friend is asking really rather a lot and i believe that in this atmosphere we should ask for a slightly longer time to consider them <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that i cannot let my noble friend get off the hook <e> <s> i agree absolutely with what my noble friend lord sandford said and will say not very much more <e> <s> between now and report stage i hope that my noble friend on the front bench will get around to thinking very much harder about this bill which seems very unsatisfactory at this moment and all quarters of the public are deeply concerned about it <e> <s> the government say that this will be the best thing with competition and all sorts of other things <e> <s> this is the last comment in this committee and between now and october we have a realistic time for people to think again very hard indeed even about the amendments to this schedule <e>", "<cs> if my noble friend is absolutely right i shall buy him a very large drink <e> <s> at this stage i can usefully make no further comment <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise at this opportune time and begin by answering the point of the noble lord lord somers <e> <s> i think that he is referring to a few dates in the amendment but the date of april relates to only certain stages and certain cases mentioned in schedule <e> <s> i would advise the noble lord and other noble lords who wish to take up this point to spend like some of us about half an hour or an hour reading through the implications of this matter <e> <s> i hope that he will reach the same conclusion as i have that simply plucking out the odd date is not what it is all about <e>", "<cs> my lords we are on report but with the leave of the house may i say that either on second reading or at committee my noble friend said that i had said that the public was of paramount importance <e> <s> he attributed that remark to me and we had it in common <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend refers to the words stage carriage as archaic may i ask what they will be replaced by <e> <s> we have always known the words stage carriage as excellent words <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that my noble friend is going to be slightly disappointed as i am not going to withdraw these amendments <e> <s> i must deal with this point by point <e> <s> i am grateful that we have not had a purely political answer from the front bench talking about the main thrust of this bill <e> <s> at least the front bench has produced arguments to this amendment although i do not agree with them <e> <s> i hope for the rest of the bill they will keep on those lines <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall tell my noble friend why <e> <s> after all we might come into a very different state from the one we are living in <e> <s> an individual buying for himself and his immediate family is rather different from someone carrying others <e> <s> i could go on with this for a long time and indeed i shall <e> <s> if my noble friend wishes to intervene and says that i am talking absolute nonsense fair enough <e> <s> i made a note about buses and minibuses but i think i have dealt with that <e>", "<cs> my lords i utterly support the noble lord lord mcintosh who has made a most interesting and witty speech <e> <s> i could rise to say just that and then sit down but i shall go through one or two nuts and bolts <e> <s> as the noble lord rightly said these amendments were introduced originally by my noble friend lord de la warr whose idea they were <e> <s> one misses very much his presence today <e> <s> by no means do i consider myself a replacement for him <e> <s> the idea fell as flat as a pancake at the committee stage <e> <s> i hope that it is not just one of those things that one tosses over on shrove tuesday but one of those pancakes that will rise today <e> <s> however from my noble friends reply the government are unaware of the risk of transferring ownership of passenger transport executive buses to passenger transport authorities <e> <s> at the present time the ptes have three main functions first bus operations secondly securing the provision of other bus and train services and thirdly planning the integrated transport system <e> <s> the most important of these and the one involving the greatest resources both financial and manpower is bus operations <e> <s> the other two functions are complementary to bus operations <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord belstead for giving way and for all he said in comment on my remarks <e> <s> but we have recently had a rather unfortunate experience with london transport <e> <s> one must come right out in to the open <e> <s> surely we do not want any such situation there was a body there dominated by political control <e> <s> the question i would like to ask him is this are the government absolutely certain that that is not going to happen <e> <s> are they certain it is not going to be very damaging because curiously enough this whole group of amendments which one is delighted the opposition took on board does show that from all sides we are trying to make this bill work <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend did give way <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much agree with what the noble lord lord tordoff has said <e> <s> the alliance party regard the consumer body as being very important <e> <s> in this area i think it is important because as the noble lord points out sometimes local authority representatives do not cover every single point that people want <e> <s> nor should they necessarily <e> <s> if there is an area that has been rather neglected in your lordships house it might be that particular area <e> <s> these are very dedicated people at the grass roots <e> <s> they are worried about this bill <e> <s> they are worried not so much about this bill as about everything to do with transport <e> <s> these modest amendments should be carefully considered <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful and in the circumstances i can do no other than beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords at the committee stage i moved a similar amendment when i had a most surprising response from the government <e> <s> i felt that this amendment was of sufficient importance for me to recommend to the noble lord lord carmichael that he should take it on as the official leader of the opposition on this bill rather than leave it to an old funny sitting on the government back-benches and on a government bill <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment has taken off on a very different tack than i ever thought possible <e> <s> i should like to ask my noble friend about the ptc he is talking about <e> <s> this is a new dimension <e> <s> he has spoken about ptas but what is a ptc <e> <s> i imagine my noble friend means passenger transport authorities <e> <s> what are ptcs please <e>", "<cs> my lords i do like these things spelt out <e> <s> i loathe initials <e> <s> i am a little more stupid about this because some initials can mean umpteen things <e> <s> however i do not want to be pedantic about this <e> <s> but on the question of whether or not this amendment is important it is a simple amendment rather stuck in the back of the bill and i was rather concerned about the fact that there will be lots of vehicles which will not be needed because the ptes or the ptcs now we know what they are can be competitive and so on <e> <s> i agree that competition is absolutely lovely but i said earlier on a previous amendment that i had visited various ptes and i saw that there are times when you just cannot put another bus on the road <e> <s> i do not think you can query their operation or their operational achievement <e> <s> no form of competition could really better their service <e> <s> what can be achieved perhaps is not to give them the amount of subsidy and here i am getting into quite a grey area but i will go on not only revenue support grant from rates but revenue support grant from the taxpayer <e> <s> but on the very point my noble friend was bringing out about this competition and the governments approach i do not believe it will have a significant effect on the pte areas where services are excellent and it would be found very difficult to improve them <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say that i am very grateful to my noble friend for producing this amendment <e> <s> it was something which in committee rolled off the tip of my tongue and i was very surprised that it was accepted with the alacrity that it received <e> <s> but i am delighted to see the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may proffer one short word <e> <s> when any competition comes in one is very pleased if there is an operator who has been an employee provided he has an operators licence and everyone is satisfied that he can make a success of the whole thing <e> <s> i do not think it is quite the point made by the noble lord lord grimond but it has to do with employees as shareholders <e> <s> they seem satisfactory people who in certain situations can come in because they have experience of industry and that would be a new area which one has not seen in the trial areas <e> <s> i do not think that in this matter there is very <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend and i am very glad that he will look into this matter <e> <s> i think that in view of what my noble friend lady carnegy has said i should like rather to repeat what i said when i moved this amendment that this is very much a case of due to unforeseen circumstances <e> <s> i am most grateful to the noble lord lord tordoff for his pointing out the facts about the schoolchildren <e> <s> we may call them schoolchildren but they are not necessarily what one thinks of as nice little things going around in long socks and berets <e> <s> they are probably great hulking brutes of between and or something of that sort and they do need a service <e> <s> i think we must think in terms of such pupils to get this absolutely right <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall read carefully what my noble friend has said <e> <s> i do not think i can do much more than withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> i am not paying the slightest attention my lords <e> <s> is this amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend seems to be entirely fair <e> <s> i do not think i need bother to read what he said <e> <s> it seems absolutely clear as mustard <e>", "<cs> no my lords as clear as whatever <e> <s> i think it is fine <e> <s> however if having read it i find there is anything i wish to raise i shall refer back to it <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i would echo the feelings expressed by the noble lord lord henderson as regards the statistics <e> <s> it is almost too good to be true <e> <s> i am very grateful to the government for having allowed us to reach this very satisfactory conclusion <e>", "<cs> my lords i should just like to make a comment or two to support the amendment of the noble viscount and the noble earl <e> <s> one hesitates to enter into the disabled lobby which has made such valuable comments and such a good contribution to this bill but i should like to mention that i also paid a visit to south yorkshire and doncaster and i should like to add to various points that have been made <e> <s> what impressed me about the service there was that there was a perfectly ordinary bus in normal livery with an ordinary number and although the people who rode in it were in wheelchairs there was no patronage and no condescension <e> <s> either they were with their helpers or they found their own way <e> <s> the two-man crew were extremely efficient <e> <s> the passengers just arrived and went up in a very robust lift that would have taken a motorised wheelchair straight into the bus <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has given a very full explanation <e> <s> i share with my right honourable friend the hope that clause will never be used and that is a wish we have very much in common <e>", "<cs> my lords i followed with some diffidence my distinguished noble friend on the privy council bench <e> <s> there will be enormous pressure on the secretary of state to put back the date yet again <e> <s> however if we have a robust secretary of state he can jolly well say no <e> <s> i am quite sure that the prime minister would appoint a secretary of state who could say no <e> <s> this amendment is important because if matters do not go right here is the available power <e>", "<cs> my lords i could make a long speech over this but i shall not do so <e> <s> i am most grateful it was totally unexpected to my noble and learned friend lord renton <e>", "<cs> however my lords my noble friend lord renton made an extremely valid point my noble friend lord belstead then came in and covered one or two extra points which helped me but which he did not mention on report not that he was asked to do so <e> <s> so while not being very happy with the situation i feel that his words will be very useful and will be studied and if necessary they may have to be dealt with in future legislation which is an open-ended commitment <e> <s> my noble friend lord de la wan-disagreed with this amendment which was totally unexpected <e> <s> it rather goes to show that throughout this bill he and i have not been absolutely tweedledum and tweedledee <e> <s> however i feel that it was a valid point to make <e> <s> i am grateful to your lordships for having listened to the discussion on this amendment and for the two contributions <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the government for putting forward that very suitable amendment <e> <s> glossop was the place i mentioned but i believe there are one or two other places in the area which also come into this <e> <s> i am most grateful to the government for having put forward this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord tordoff has talked about not wanting to confuse the government or making this a confusing amendment <e> <s> that is right <e> <s> however this is an amendment that i introduced at report stage and one that i hinted at in committee <e> <s> my noble friend lord caithness got probably the worst of reactions and i was not as articulate as i might have been <e> <s> the figures were disputed <e> <s> the noble lord lord carmichael has mentioned the use of these vehicles <e> <s> it was estimated that they could number between and <e> <s> i must return to the point because it is one that was mentioned by my noble friend lord caithness <e> <s> there could indeed be this large number of vehicles involving a great deal of public money <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to enter into a discussion with such distinguished noble lords <e> <s> who know much more than i about this subject <e> <s> we have left it to those noble lords who have financial interests to deal with the matter of pensions but at this late stage i feel that i must comment <e> <s> the noble lord lord tordoff presented the argument fairly and fully as did the noble lord lord underhill <e> <s> i thought that it would be better to hear the remarks of the noble lord lord murray of epping forest before speaking <e>", "<cs> my lords at this late stage i am very grateful to my noble friend for the way he has answered this amendment <e> <s> i shall consider carefully every word he has said <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> i wish i had some more succinct statement to come back with but i think he has answered very fairly <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is possibly now my turn and i agree with absolutely every comment that has been made <e> <s> everyone has made remarks complimentary to everyone else <e> <s> as the noble lord lord underhill so rightly said we are very pleased with the cross-party spirit that has prevailed <e> <s> i am very pleased on this occasion that that co-operation has gone so wide and i think it has added to the spirit of <e>", "<cs> my lords i think on this occasion the noble earl has his heavy boots on rather too firmly <e> <s> perhaps the asking of an oral question is not the best way to deal with this matter <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord underhill that however the system might have been london transport garages have a one-man operation <e> <s> perhaps we should not deal with it by means of an oral question <e> <s> may i suggest that the noble lord lord underhill or another noble lord asks an unstarred question on this subject fairly soon so that we can discuss it rationally and quietly <e>", "<cs> my lords i was aware of the fact that in his question the noble lord lord underhill was saying that where the pay cuts might have to take place or are proposed to take place is in the outer areas where there is basically one-man operation and where there are services out to tender <e> <s> i give london regional transport my wholehearted blessing <e> <s> i think they are doing an absolutely excellent job <e> <s> but this is a very sensitive area <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that i think he was being slightly heavy-handed over this <e> <s> i say that to him with the greatest respect <e> <s> does he not agree that we should debate this matter further at a suitable time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> i hesitate to intervene but the noble lord mentioned that he has sympathy with abta in this area because it thinks it has to carry the can <e> <s> i do not know whether the noble lord used those words but i believe that that was his meaning <e> <s> i would enirely agree with what the noble lord says but it should be pointed out that one would have sympathy for abta especially if there had been cases <e> <s> however as the bcc and the psa have had clean bills of health for years i can see no reason and i would ask the noble lord to take that point into account <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a pleasure and a privilege to follow the noble lord lord scanlon <e> <s> i should have liked to hear his views on the truck acts <e> <s> i shall probably have to listen to him on another occasion outside the chamber <e> <s> i am sure that i shall benefit from his experience <e>", "<cs> no thank you my lords <e> <s> in their efforts to improve efficiency bus operators will be making people redundant <e> <s> in the old metropolitan areas at a minimum about to jobs will go <e> <s> because existing services have to run until deregulation these redundancies cannot occur until th october <e> <s> when the bill was first introduced the rebate was to be abolished after st october so the bus industry would have received its rebate <e> <s> plans and estimates were made on this basis and in the metropolitan counties the secretary of state for transport even determined the statutory limit on total expenditure of the passenger transport authorities on the buses that redundancy rebate would be available <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend says that people can go to a local post office to get their information <e> <s> is the information in the post office of a local nature or do all post offices have post codes for the whole country <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has not answered my question <e> <s> are the post codes in the crown offices for the local area or are they for everywhere in the british isles <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a pleasure to follow the noble and learned lord lord denning <e> <s> i am quite sure that he will return to many points on the committee stage <e> <s> my own contribution has to do entirely with part <e> <s> i intended to confine my comments entirely to that subject but i might veer off slightly later <e> <s> however i shall start by so doing <e> <s> in this bill among other things we consider the democratic rights of people in this country to proclaim their views on many subjects by way of processions and demonstrations <e> <s> we are jealous of the rights of the individual although we are not unmindful that liberties granted to one person may place constraints on many others <e> <s> this is recognised in the bill so far as aggressive behaviour is concerned <e> <s> however with the massive growth of public demonstrations dealt with in part ii it is necessary to see that everything possible is done to minimise inconvenience caused to the public in general <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord wedderburn is quite right and my noble friend is quite right but i am afraid the argument has been terribly narrow <e> <s> i have sat here listening to every word <e> <s> please may i ask a question <e> <s> the worker has had deductions from his wages for several weeks and i should like my noble friend to elaborate on this <e> <s> could it be as much as that <e> <s> while he waits for his tribunal presumably he will be paid his wages <e> <s> i know that there will be hideous inconvenience but we have had no examples of this <e> <s> when we read <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for saying all that <e> <s> i have done a bit of listening but there have been gaps and i shall do quite a lot of reading <e> <s> there is one question that i should like to ask my noble friend <e> <s> will the worker he or she while waiting between then and the tribunal be gainfully employed by his or her employer <e> <s> there will not be dismissal or suspension without pay <e>", "<cs> my lords i also have a lot of sympathy with this amendment <e> <s> the noble lord lord dean has naturally concentrated on the clothing manufacturing wages council which covers nearly workers <e> <s> the other three wages councils which are included in the clothing industry each cover only a few thousand workers <e> <s> i intend to concentrate on perhaps the largest of these the retail bespoke tailoring wages council as i have received represent-ations from both the federation of merchant tailors and the national union of tailors and garment workers <e> <s> i may say that both their briefs have been most caring sincere and moderate <e> <s> retail bespoke tailoring is a craft industry where the tailor makes the garment individually to fit each customer <e> <s> the garment is generally sewn by hand rather than by machine <e> <s> those of your lordships who may be fortunate enough to be wearing suits bought in savile row or similar streets will almost certainly have been customers of members of the federation of merchant tailors and will be enjoying the benefits of the craftsmanship of members of the national union of tailors and garment workers <e>", "<cs> i shall be very brief and i shall certainly withdraw my amendment <e> <s> my noble friend says that if the police had warning of demonstrations they would pass it on to others <e> <s> if there were any infringement of that i should certainly table another amendment <e> <s> that was my noble friends second point to which i shall return <e> <s> i thank him very much for explaining it <e> <s> but underlying this point which i think is going on to my next amendment i may say that of course it is all right to demonstrate and i am sure that many of those who demonstrate have a great point to make <e> <s> but i believe that they should be aware that others may be inconvenienced <e> <s> for example in travelling by public transport when one has allowed oneself say an hour to get from one place to another or perhaps even half an hour one can find that totally without warning the journey time stretches to perhaps two hours because one has to take a most circuitous route because of a demonstration <e> <s> but i shall not delay the committee any longer and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the first question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> does he agree that it is disappointing that <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> london regional transport is a happier story than that of the national bus company <e> <s> i should be grateful if my noble friend will tell me what technological advances have been made by london regional transport recently and of any innovative bus services that it intends to put on the market <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the question of the noble lord lord mellish about lousy services a view with which i disagree is my noble friend aware that london transport in trying to improve services cannot do it all on its own because of traffic congestion <e> <s> is my noble friend satisfied that all is being done to try to enforce existing traffic regulations and has he any plans for additional measures <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble lord for interrupting but i think i can tell the noble lord about the accident to which he has referred <e> <s> accidents have always to be looked into and i only refer to it because the noble lord has done so <e> <s> i gather that the driver concerned had been in his place only for about minutes when the accident occurred <e>", "<cs> my lords by and large i welcome these regulations although i shall be making one or two points or even criticisms on behalf of passengers <e> <s> i should like to say before i am a minute older how much the bus and coach council the freight transport association and the road haulage association appreciate the way the officials in the department of transport have helped <e> <s> i gather that much hard work has gone into making these orders more flexible <e> <s> they are complicated the subject is complex some might even refer to it as being dull but all these orders affect an awful lot of peoples lives <e> <s> i am sure people are very grateful for what the department has done <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord but i thought that it was quite all right to quote chapter and verse <e> <s> however be that as it may <e> <s> i must apologise but i can continue on my own on this subject <e>", "<cs> that saves me the time of arguing the arguments between the noble lord lord mishcon and the noble and learned lord lord denning <e> <s> however i come back to the first point made by the noble lord lord mishcon and also touched on by my noble friend about these great state occasions and whether they should or should not be paid for <e> <s> we are living in a world where things have to be paid for and accounted for <e> <s> whatever occasions they may be and however prestigious there should not be a nod and wink and a feeling that they are cosy <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that i am delighted he is answering this question <e> <s> i cannot speak for county councils but for passenger transport executives and while i did not agree per cent <e> <s> with the act i am absolutely satisfied that they have spent a great deal of time and money in going from house to house delivering timetables through the doors <e> <s> credit should be given to them for that <e>", "<cs> my lords may i send my noble friend a rather nasty lob <e> <s> can he equate in the spirit of this bill that there are two organisations the strathclyde bus company which is owned locally and the scottish bus group which has not been privatised both intent on war and possibly keen therefore to keep out private enterprise <e> <s> does my noble friend think that ultimately this war will bring a better bus service to the citizens of glasgow and to the employees of the bus companies <e> <s> will he say who is going to be the winner after all in this very unsatisfactory and unsavoury situation <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend please answer my question on leyland bus which has not so far been answered <e> <s> will he tell us what he thinks the future of this company will be despite the current traumatic changes in the home market <e> <s> i shall be pleased to hear all news that he can give us <e>", "<cs> my lords following other noble lords who have spoken at great length i feel that on this occasion i can be appallingly brief <e> <s> i rightly remind your lordships that we are discussing the london docklands railway city extension bill <e> <s> your lordships have already agreed to the london docklands railway bill <e> <s> we are now discussing the extension from the minories to the bank station <e> <s> i shall devote my remarks entirely to that aim <e>", "<cs> my lords this is the right time to correct that and not in the flow of the speech of the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble and learned friend will be aware that i was on his advisory council for nine years and that even before he makes a decision he is advised by many erudite people much more erudite than myself <e> <s> there are three main criteria <e> <s> only very selective documents are considered for further closure <e> <s> will my noble and learned friend agree that the present system which has been working for a very long time is extremely satisfactory <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to talk about east sussex and then i will go back to some other points <e> <s> i do not think your lordships have addressed the subject of east sussex <e> <s> there is a county west of kent called sussex now east sussex and it will be affected in one way or another <e> <s> mr mitchells committee has looked very seriously into thanet <e> <s> one does not want to be utterly parochial but one has had very properly parochial subjects dealt with <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend please appreciate the valuable job done by immigration officers in very difficult circumstances <e> <s> they are crown servants and have to operate the laws under the act <e> <s> the situation as he said has not just gone on in the last six months but for many years <e>

point with which i have great concern <e> <s> by and large i am now more in favour of the bill at this stage of the second reading than i was at the beginning <e> <s> to develop my theme i shall fall

had a crack at the subject i should like to raise one point <e> <s> the noble lord lord mountevans mentioned that i said that regional airports would relieve the south-east <e> <s> i agree with most of what he said in his speech but i should like to say that it was not a question of relieving the south-east i drew attention to the fact that per cent <e> <s> of the population of the united kingdom as a whole came from the north-west <e> <s> therefore it was not a question of alleviating the problem in the south-east <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to interrupt my noble friend but he just mentioned services to manchester from all those places <e> <s> how many direct services are there to manchester for those foreign airports or are they via london <e>", "<cs> my lords it is very difficult to follow my noble friend especially after his last remark <e> <s> however like other noble lords i commend the excellent report which addresses all major issues in a <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a certain challenge in following the noble baroness lady gardner of parkes <e> <s> she was very amusing i am not going to be in the least bit funny <e> <s> the whips have rightly chosen <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all most grateful to the noble lord lord mountevans for introducing this most interesting subject <e> <s> although the government might have mentioned it i think that he has rather caught everyones attention by actually speaking on the matter in a public forum <e> <s> moreover i must say that he has done so extremely well <e> <s> however his speech came to such an abrupt end i thought he was going to continue for another minutes that there was a slight pause before i rose to my feet <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that my noble friend only thinks i will withdraw the amendment

situation to occur <e> <s> if my noble friend can assure me on that point i shall be happy to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> as my noble friend has said that i can do nothing but agree <e> <s> however it will be between now and the next stage of the bills proceedings and i shall go no further while the bill is in this place <e> <s> i am most grateful to my noble friend for what he said <e> <s> i have at least achieved that <e> <s> in that case i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend for that answer and to the noble lord lord underhill and my noble friend lord shrewsbury for their comments <e> <s> the comment made by the noble lord lord underhill about people staying around depots was answered by my noble friend <e> <s> i

legislation <e> <s> my noble friend lord shrewsbury wishes to say a few words <e> <s> i do not wish to stand in his way so i shall give way now <e>", "<cs> my lords i concur with every word that the noble lord lord underhill has said about my noble friend <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend for accepting my group of amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords in broad measure i support what the government are doing in this bill <e> <s> i believe that returning the companies to the private sector where they were born and grew up is a logical step given that deregulation has already taken place in scotland <e> <s> there is little case for bus operations in scotland remaining nationalised industries <e> <s> however as with all legislation we have a duty to ensure that the bill contains all that is necessary to ensure that it meets its objectives <e> <s> in that respect i have some concerns <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble lord lord mountevans i believe that the bill should be given a second reading and a third reading in time <e> <s> i support it for the following reasons <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord ezra that transport needs new ideas <e> <s> this is not the first light rapid transit railway to which parliament has been asked to give approval <e> <s> parliament has given approval to schemes in greater manchester and in the west midlands <e> <s> i am aware that those schemes are rather different because they amalgamated existing and redundant railway lines and rundown streets and busy streets and their shopping centres <e> <s> this is different <e> <s> it may not be a monorail but it is a light rapid transit scheme <e> <s> i wish it were a monorail for which reason i shall explain later <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> thirty-three years ago <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to noble lords who have stayed and taken part in the debate and for the kind remarks that have been made <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i have very little to say on this amendment <e> <s> my noble friend lord lucas and the noble lord lord carmichael have introduced a most interesting discussion <e> <s> i am a public transport buff but i believe that this bill is absolutely splendid in providing for off-street car parking and payment by credit cards <e> <s> however i am concerned by my friends remarks about the number of parking spaces they could grow like topsy <e> <s> that remark may incite my noble friend to spend the next minutes saying that that it not so and the committee has already had to wait a long time for this bill to appear this evening <e> <s> therefore i shall wait for my noble friend to give us the benefit of his wisdom <e>", "<cs> it only remains for me to say that my noble friends amendment is an excellent and well drafted amendment <e> <s> the short debate on the subject has been most interesting <e> <s> in essence the measure satisfies the consumer and helps local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i should also like to thank the noble lord lord underhill for securing yet another debate on transport at a time when the nation is probably more concerned about the subject than ever before <e> <s> while the noble lords motion gives us great scope for a wide-ranging debate i wish to confine my remarks to policies affecting bus operators in particular <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that answer but he will not be surprised that i am not very pleased with it because it does not precisely relate to the question <e> <s> will my noble friend please agree that i do not ask for minicab drivers to be registered as are taxi drivers but that the minicab proprietors should be registered so that they can find drivers of suitable character in order that the public can be properly protected <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not deliberately seeking to get the last word but does my noble friend agree that the question on the order paper does not in any way denigrate the london black taxis <e> <s> i agree with all that has been said for them <e> <s> however will my noble friend please think again and ask his honourable friends in another place to look into possible legislation to ensure that those who drive minicabs are suitable people for looking after the public <e>", "<cs> my lords my only qualification for speaking in this debate is that i have had the privilege of serving for many years on the joint parliamentary ecclesiastical committee <e> <s> my only regret is that i did not speak then as strongly for this measure as i shall do now <e> <s> the reason why i did not speak strongly then was that i did not wish to prolong the agony <e> <s> after listening to so many speakers i always hoped that the proceedings would soon finish <e> <s> that may be regarded by your lordships justifiably perhaps as a feeble excuse <e>", "<cs> my lords with all due respect to my noble friend i am rather more than disappointed with his response <e> <s> should i put down a further amendment with the leave of the house would there be any chance of any measure coming forward from the government to deal with this situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall read very carefully what my noble friend has said and consider how to deal with the matter <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be brief <e> <s> i shall deal with a different aspect of the bill from that addressed by most noble lords <e> <s> i welcome what was said by the noble lord the chief rabbi when he spoke of the spiritual element <e> <s> i shall address a practical element <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lady speaks with certainty <e> <s> i do not have the bill in my hand to look it up <e> <s> however i am assured that the noble lady is absolutely correct it is clause <e> <s> i am very grateful to her for having pointed that out <e> <s> i should have spotted my mistake before <e> <s> one aspect of this house is that the people are terribly kind and point out these very trite but very important points <e> <s> i am very grateful <e> <s> it is clause which says that the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i hate to interrupt my noble friend but is not what is on the birth certificate extremely important <e> <s> it is important to have correct records <e> <s> what she has said sounds like myth <e> <s> perhaps she could repeat what she said about the wrong information on the birth certificate <e>", "<cs> it is my great pleasure and privilege to follow the noble lady lady saltoun whose amendments are mostly in our joint names and to congratulate her on a most excellent succinct and lucid speech in which she set out so eloquently our purpose in seeking to amend clause together with our enforcing ancillary amendments <e> <s> in order to eliminate any confusion we have purposely split <e>", "<cs> therefore it seems only fair that at some point in time the organisations acquiring the licences should be relieved of their duty of looking after the records and that the state should take up the duty in the interests of the community at large but that that time should be postponed until all children born will have died <e> <s> the effect of the transfer would enable the records to be open to inspection under the public records act <e> <s> remote generations and descendants and interested historians would then have access to any of the information which has been recorded <e>", "<cs> i am sorry about that <e> <s> the situation reminds me of a similar one when lord elwyn-jones said almost the same as has the noble lord lord ennals <e> <s> he said that i was inaudible <e> <s> at that time i was obliged to move my seat <e> <s> however i should like to speak to amendment no <e> <s> if i can find my information <e> <s> the order of my paperwork was changed because of the regrouping of the amendments <e> <s> however as i do not seem to have the relevant paperwork with me perhaps i may use the information in connection with the next group of amendments <e> <s> i think it is still apt in that respect <e> <s> i see that my noble friend lord eden of winton has <e>", "<cs> it might be a good idea to try to bring back some order and sense of purpose as regards the amendments and explain their original intention <e> <s> i am most grateful to the committee but we have gone rather far and wide <e>", "<cs> in all fairness humble as i am i should like to bring back order into the proceedings <e>", "<cs> the noble lord talks about illegitimate <e> <s> the word is not used but in the long birth certificate at the moment if the child is illegitimate a line is drawn straight across the space in column five referring to father <e>", "<cs> this debate has been long and wide-ranging but perhaps i may pick up one or two points <e> <s> coming back to my noble friend lord lauderdale integrity of records and accuracy are paramount <e> <s> also i am glad my noble friend lord renton preferred my amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> my lords i support this bill to a certain extent but to license minicab drivers <e>", "<cs> i shall certainly not press the amendment but it was not in the group it was a totally separate matter <e> <s> i checked the grouping list <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the excellent comments of the noble baroness lady darcy de knayth on the important subject of the orange badge have set the pace for us all to follow <e> <s> however i should like to mention three areas of concern raised by the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale <e> <s> i am delighted that he has finally obtained this debate on an unstarred question although it clearly should have been a two-and-a-half hour debate <e> <s> i should like to have presented my comments in a happier frame of mind <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will not think it a criticism if i say that i found him rather gloomy with regard to a situation which is not all that gloomy <e>", "<cs> my lords i really must intervene here for just a moment <e> <s> british rail takes a tremendous amount of trouble to provide the facility of announcements on trains <e> <s> the voices of actors are used for the purpose but of course this is not done with regional accents <e> <s> british rail has tried very hard in this respect <e> <s> nevertheless i agree with the noble lord lord carter <e> <s> i think that one would prefer to hear regional accents because they are easier to understand and we must encourage british rail to get this right <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be helpful to your lordships if i intervene before my noble and learned friend replies <e> <s> during the whole of the evenings proceedings i have felt that silence was golden and i have stuck to my seat reluctantly <e> <s> i feel it is now necessary to intervene <e> <s> i am most grateful to my noble and learned friend for tabling the amendment relating to scotland which is fulsome and concise <e> <s> as he did not think fit to include coats of arms in clause i was hoping for a full explanation <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to say that obviously i shall not press the amendment but i hope your lordships will bear with me if i briefly explain why i do not intend to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously i am slightly disappointed but i understand <e> <s> i hope that people who are around in years time will read this debate realise that we are not stiff and starchy and that we have dealt with this matter cheerfully and with humour and that we have thought of them <e> <s> in that light i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords my name is also down to the amendment moved by my noble friend the earl marshal <e> <s> i shall give a textbook answer and i hope that your lordships will bear with me <e> <s> coats of arms fall within the jurisdiction of the high court of chivalry <e> <s> since the court has always been held before
