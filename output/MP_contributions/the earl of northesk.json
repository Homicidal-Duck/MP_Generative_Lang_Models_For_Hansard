["<cs> my lords i should like to ask my noble friend a brief question <e> <s> one recognises the need for freeports in such places as liverpool and belfast which are areas of high unemployment but have the government taken into consideration the fact that permission has been granted and therefore a decision has been taken to provide a freeport in the isle of man <e> <s> because of the close proximity of these three places will there not be perhaps undue competition <e>", "<cs> my lords i find it a little difficult to follow the noble viscount lord st davids because i cannot agree with a great deal of what he has said <e> <s> i believe that the bill is basically unnecessary because by and large it will not achieve what it has set out to achieve <e> <s> nevertheless it may well be the better of two evils <e> <s> if it is possible to obtain some such reasonable and acceptable legislation it should prevent possibly more prohibitive and draconian measures from being imposed upon the legitimate and law-abiding gun user by the extremists who wish to ban the use of guns altogether <e>", "<cs> my lords i find it difficult to answer the noble lord <e> <s> with respect i believe that the police pressure is in many cases misplaced and misunderstood <e> <s> it has been suggested by other speakers today that the police do not have within their ranks people who sufficiently understand firearms <e> <s> if there were members of the police force who understood more about that then i should go along with what the noble lord has said <e>", "<cs> i think these groupings are a little unfortunate because although all these amendments attempt to achieve more or less the same thing amendments nos <e> <s> and attempt to achieve it in a slightly different way <e> <s> i think these are the most sensible of all the amendments <e> <s> most of this clause attempts to legislate against guns <e> <s> as we all know it is not guns that kill people it is people that kill people <e> <s> these are two amendments which attempt to legislate against people which seems to me to be the most sensible way of going about it <e>", "<cs> i refer specifically to amendments nos <e> <s> and because they are the ones which ask for some kind of test <e> <s> during the course of the noble earls explanation he said that these guns are not safe in the hands of anyone <e> <s> that is exactly the point <e> <s> these amendments ask that people should take some kind of test and once they have they are no longer just anybody they are people who are qualified as i understand it and capable of holding and using for want of a better expression a big bore self-loading rifle <e>", "<cs> my name is also attached to this amendment <e> <s> i have already spoken to it having been a little perturbed about the grouping of amendments nos <e> <s> and to which my noble friend lord wynford whether rightly or wrongly i am not altogether sure has attached amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i repeat what i said when i spoke earlier <e> <s> this is an attempt to legislate against people rather than against guns which surely must be the right approach in understanding how firearms should be used <e>", "<cs> in view of the suggestion that some issuing authorities are already imposing a limit would it be of some help if we were assured that this idea of no limit was written into the code of guidance <e> <s> if that were done and the code of guidance were published i believe we should be that much more satisfied <e>", "<cs> is it not likely that the visitor who is going to purchase a firearm will want to try it out somewhere <e> <s> surely no sensible person would buy any kind of gun without first attempting to see whether he can shoot the thing <e> <s> it seems a little hard if he has to buy the gun and take it home without ever having tried it <e> <s> surely he must have some sort of permission to use the firearm under certain circumstances <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment to which my name should also be attached <e> <s> my noble friend has spoken as a provider of sporting shooting i speak as one to whom such shooting is provided <e> <s> with apologies to the noble lord lord harris i am a visitor <e> <s> i do not have a criminal record <e> <s> i even have a clean driving licence <e>", "<cs> i would have to apply for a permit because i am a visitor <e> <s> i am very muddled <e> <s> perhaps i may ask a practical question the reply to which may help my noble friend lord peel <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to my noble friend on the front bench <e> <s> his friends in the isle of man and the channel islands will be absolutely delighted <e> <s> as i said at second reading when my noble friend has time to come to the isle of man he will be made that much more welcome <e>", "<cs> i ask only that the cost should be considered <e> <s> the amendment actually deals with the number twenty which seems arbitrary <e> <s> it bears no relation to what happens today <e> <s> i am told that the largest team attending bisley is from canada it has members <e> <s> the largest team for clay pigeon shooting at the commonwealth games or at the grand prix if it was ever held in this country would consist of a maximum of people <e> <s> therefore it is the number twenty that we are trying to amend <e>", "<cs> i repeat that the amendment has nothing to do with the fee <e> <s> i only asked that the fee might be considered <e> <s> as i understand it the amendment asks to leave out not more than twenty <e> <s> i ask that a group permit may be for any number required <e> <s> i am obviously not going to press the amendment <e> <s> it is not a matter of life and death <e> <s> as i have tried to explain the maximum number of any group is never likely to be more than <e> <s> will my noble friend consider altering to if a figure is required <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i also speak from personal experience because from time to time as a visitor i act as an unpaid agent or organiser i arrange shooting for small groups of visitors coming to this country <e> <s> such is the nature of game shooting as i am sure the committee knows that it is usually necessary to arrange the shooting many months before it takes place <e> <s> the same could also be said for competition shooting in as much as it may be necessary to complete and send in an entry form some time before the day of the competition <e>", "<cs> my lords there appears to be a conviction among the general public the home office and some members of your lordships house that a self-loading rifle is the most dangerous weapon that exists <e> <s> that is patently not true <e> <s> it is no more or less dangerous than any other gun it is the person behind the gun that matters and not the gun itself <e> <s> that is the essence and reason behind the amendment the object being that no one should shoot a self-loading rifle until such time as he has proved himself to be reasonably competent to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact that i spoke to amendment no <e> <s> in the first place has at least aired the views that everyone has wanted to put forward on this particular problem <e> <s> i say thank you to my noble friend on the front bench for his very concise and excellent explanation <e> <s> i do not believe there is any need to say anything further and i therefore beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>"]
