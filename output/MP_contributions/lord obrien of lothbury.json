["<cs> my lords i am not sure whether what i want to say should be preceded by the words is the minister aware but whether or not that is so i would like to say that many years ago it fell to my lot to have close relations with almost all the major oil companies in the world <e> <s> this was because of my responsibilities as an official of the exchange control at the bank of england to seek to control their operations in so far as they impinged on our exchange control <e> <s> in the course of that work which lasted for several years i came to have very great admiration for the calibre of the people who run these oil companies be they british american or other nationalities <e> <s> i also came to the conclusion that it was extremely difficult to know what these oil companies were doing and even more difficult to control what they were doing <e> <s> at a time when the british are at last on the threshold of having enough of their own oil to satisfy all their needs i hope that the desire of the international oil companies to service their international markets as they wish will not prejudice the right of the british to enjoy their own oil <e>", "<cs> my lords for many years from when we raised bank rate tentatively from to per cent <e> <s> i have been concerned with the conduct of monetary policy and later with its formulation <e> <s> is the minister aware that the governments present policy in the monetary field has my very strong support <e> <s> the more so because for the first time for many years it is being fully supported by fiscal policy as indeed it should be because monetary policy alone cannot do the job but the two together resolutely conducted as the present government are conducting them and i hope will continue to conduct them will in the end i believe do the job <e> <s> i give them my full support <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may add a gloss to the point made by the noble baroness lady seear on this question of codes of practice <e> <s> she will be well aware that in the city we have long had a code of practice on take-over bids <e> <s> it existed <e>", "<cs> my lords noble lords on the opposition benches and their colleagues in the other place talk often of the virtues of complete equality in our society <e> <s> i wonder what they are going to do about the fact that the noble lord lord rhodes has a stentorian bellow which commands attention whereas i have only a fluting tenor if that is not too flattering a description which pleads for it and pleads for it at the end of a very long day <e> <s> i regret that due to a previous engagement which i could not get out of i came here in the late afternoon <e> <s> the loss was entirely mine <e> <s> i missed the opening and early speeches and i missed the maiden speeches of the right reverend prelate the bishop of lincoln and the noble lord lord weinstock both of which i am sure were distinguished <e> <s> i congratulate them on having broken their duck and i am sure both of them will make distinguished contributions to our deliberations in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to follow the noble earl lord selkirk in thanking the noble and learned lord the minister for the changes which he has proposed in place of the nefarious section of the act which has long been a thorn in the flesh of bank lenders to no good purpose as i see it <e> <s> however i also agree with the noble earl lord selkirk in what he said about the new proposals which i observe followed consultation with many parties including the committee of london clearing bankers although the noble and learned lord the minister did not say whether they give satisfaction to the clearing bankers <e> <s> i should doubt whether they do <e> <s> i think it is important that the bankers should receive satisfaction on this point and i believe they would do so if the amendment to the amendment proposed by lord selkirk were accepted <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble and learned lord why if the statutory declaration gives complete protection to the lender he feels that the protection afforded by the amendment put forward by the noble earl lord selkirk is excessive <e>", "<cs> my lords i gave my strong support to an earlier amendment tabled by the noble and learned earl lord selkirk an amendment which was not satisfactory to the government <e> <s> i was extremely pleased that that did not mean that the subject was then put to bed with what i would take to be the wrong answer and that further consultations and thoughts have been given to this very important subject resulting in the amendment which is now before your lordships <e> <s> it seems to me to be no inconsiderable achievement to have an amendment put forward by the noble and learned earl lord selkirk joined by the noble lord lord seebohm and the noble lord lord wedderburn of charlton and i should have been very happy for my name to have been added to those <e> <s> when we have the noble lord lord mais also adding his voice in favour of this amendment i hope the government will take it very seriously <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that in and the years following prices were falling although unemployment was high <e> <s> the situation nowadays is entirely different although we have high unemployment prices are still rising <e> <s> that is the problem with which we are trying to cope <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree that the phenomenon referred to by the noble lord lord beswick of inflation produced by too much money chasing too few goods is one form of inflation but it is not the form of inflation from which we are now suffering <e>", "<cs> amidst a galaxy of noble and learned lords i was privileged to raise my small voice in support of the bill which subsequently became the state immunity act <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord mishcon that that act has been a very important up-dating of british law to bring it to accord with the facts of life insofar as the immunity of sovereign states is concerned to the great benefit of all in the city <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord lord mishcon would be the first to accept that important though it has been in preserving the business and the fees of solicitors in the city it has been even more important in ensuring that the business itself remains in the city because when important commercial and financial contracts are concluded the law by which they are governed tends to determine the place where the business is done <e> <s> it has certainly been very important indeed to the city that the state immunity act should have been passed <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the minister aware that i have had considerable experience over many years in fixing prices for issues on the stock market of various kinds and that it is notoriously extremely difficult to fix a price which is absolutely right on the day <e> <s> it is just as likely that on the day the price will be wildly wrong one way as the other and of course one gets criticised whichever way it is <e> <s> i am quite sure in this particular instance that those concerned acted in good faith and did their best <e>", "<cs> my lords first may i apologise to the noble lord lord saint oswald and to the house for attempting to precede him by rising in my place <e> <s> i was quite out of order <e> <s> i did so i think because of my enthusiastic desire to congratulate the noble lord lord strathalmond on his notable maiden speech <e> <s> his father was a friend and colleague of mine for some years and i am delighted that his son has acquitted himself so well in your lordships house <e> <s> now that he has broken the family duck i hope he will come to the wicket many times in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords although my name does not appear on the list of speakers i should like to be allowed to add a word of support to this bill <e> <s> i am not in any way authorised to speak on behalf of the bank of england where i spent so much of my life in the early part of which i was engaged at the very lowest possible level in dealing with transfers in the gilt-edged market which in those days were relatively few in number and were dealt with by clerks who had only just abandoned their quill pen <e> <s> much has happened since then <e> <s> the gilt-edged market is now of enormous volume technology has advanced with increasing speed and it is only right that that technology should be applied to these processes which at one time were so extremely laborious <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord the minister agree that it is not quite true to say that it is impossible to make a correct decision in instances of this kind <e> <s> it is merely very difficult <e> <s> the difficulty arises from the fact that in arrangements of this sort which take a good deal of time to conclude there must of necessity be quite a long interval between the time when they are announced and the time when they are completed <e> <s> it may be a week it may be more <e> <s> during that interval all sorts of extraneous events can occur which invalidate the judgment which has been <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord benson has said that this is a dull and technical subject as indeed is the case <e> <s> nevertheless company accounts and group accounts enshrine some of the great dramas of human existence the success or failure of commercial and industrial enterprise <e> <s> they are therefore exceedingly important <e> <s> in my lifetime i have come across companies large and small many of which have produced admirable products but because the financial side did not add up they have run into trouble <e> <s> therefore company accounts and what they reveal are important not only to those who prepare them but to their shareholders and indeed to the rest of us <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like as other noble lords have done to express my appreciation to the noble lord lord lever of manchester for giving us the opportunity to discuss this vitally important topic this evening <e> <s> the noble lord has never been in awe of professional opinion or of the conventional wisdom of professional opinion i expect he would call it in the financial field and he has always been a most thoughtful and provocative speaker on such topics <e> <s> in fact keeping up with his nimble mind was one of the more exhilarating occupations i had while i was at the bank of england <e> <s> that is already a long time ago but my noble friend lord cobbold was at the bank long before even then more than years ago <e> <s> i am sure he will recall that in the last five years of his governorship he saw across the atlantic a united states growing at a reasonable rate for a developed economy having a reasonably low level of unemployment and having stable prices and with that economy providing a background to a world which was becoming increasingly prosperous and having in most countries a reasonably low level of unemployment <e>", "<cs> i think that in the banking world we shall gradually turn this corner <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has said what i certainly would have said <e> <s> that is the first thing <e> <s> the international monetary fund is there and it has exercised a very beneficial influence on very many countries including our own <e> <s> with greater resources its power would be all that much greater <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord not agree that whatever international monetary system may eventually replace the present rgime of floating rates it must be based on the universally accepted and highly liquid store of value <e> <s> furthermore would he agree that no national currency is likely to fulfil that role satisfactorily <e> <s> would he further agree that at the moment there is no sign that the special drawing right is filling itself out to fulfil that role <e>", "<cs> my lords i have learned one lesson during an instructive evening <e> <s> that is if you want to make a speech do not get yourself stuck behind a closed shop <e> <s> i beg to move that this house takes note of the st report of the european communities committee session <e> <s> on the borrowing and lending activities of the european communities <e> <s> in moving this motion i must explain that the report was produced by sub-committee a of the european communities committee under the distinguished chairmanship of the noble lord lord plowden <e> <s> at the beginning of the present session i succeeded the noble lord as chairman of that subcommittee and he in turn is now chairman of sub-committee d on agriculture <e> <s> he does not feel that it <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to conclude by thanking all noble lords who have taken part in this debate <e> <s> first i should like to thank those fellow members of the committee who have joined with me in explaining the report to other members of your lordships house <e> <s> it is an agreed report and therefore of course we tended to agree but i think it is fair to say that each member of the committee illuminated some aspect of the report which others had failed to do <e>", "<cs> my lords my first very pleasant duty is to thank all those noble lords who have taken part in this debate which i think it will be agreed has been an interesting one <e> <s> i am particularly grateful to the noble lord lord barnett for having done so <e> <s> he made what one would expect him to make a most thoughtful and helpful contribution <e> <s> until we came to the end of this debate we had almost reached unanimity <e> <s> it became almost dull but one or two rescued us from that unhappy fate <e> <s> the noble lord lord vaizey i was sad to hear did not think it

had intended to say that the one good thing to come out of the restrictive practices court reference was the amount of information obtained <e> <s> if that hastens reform so much the better <e> <s> i would not want anyone to think that i am against reform as such but it has to be sensible reform in the proper quarter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am unable to take up that particular point of the noble lord <e> <s> an unacceptable situation is an unacceptable situation which i guess is what her majestys government think the present one is <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to intervene but i think that the committee in making this point did not mean that the two should sit side by side at an international conference on the subject but that the finance minister should be associated all the way through the prior discussions so that his views would be fully taken into account when the agriculture ministers for example were to meet around the table <e>", "<cs> my lords at the conclusion of this debate may i on behalf of the committee thank all those noble lords who took part in it <e> <s> all made impressive contributions to what i think will be agreed was a high level of debate in which political tub-thumping played little or no part <e> <s> on behalf of the committee i should like to thank all noble lords for the generous tributes paid to our report <e> <s> perhaps especially i should thank the noble lord <e> <s> lord molloy whose munificence alone will send the committee away with a song in their hearts <e> <s> i also thank the noble lord lord brimelow who lucidly

contributions of the noble lord lord barnett and the noble lord <e> <s> lord cockfield <e> <s> i am glad also to find that despite varying views as one would expect on the value of the european community virtually all noble lords support the views expressed by the committee which the government also share <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount the minister aware that some of your

in the end she will be successful <e> <s> but would the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords my first pleasant duty is to thank her majestys government for enabling this debate to take place this afternoon and if i may say so at such a civilised hour <e> <s> i should also like to thank all noble lords who were good enough to take part in the debate both for their contributions and for the tributes that they have been good enough to pay to the committee and indeed to me <e> <s> little though that was deserved <e> <s> the noble lord lord bruce said in the course of his remarks that he had agreed with all the speakers up to that point and i began to wonder where we had gone wrong <e> <s> but i came to the conclusion that there was one exception <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of your select committee on the european communities which as your lordships will be aware recently reported on these matters which the council of ministers have now been considering may i ask the <e>", "<cs> my lords on the assumption that her majestys government see the advantages of exchange rate stability and that they say they will join the exchange rate mechanism of the european community when the time is ripe and having heard the minister talk about the difference between sterling and the european currencies because sterling is a petro-currency may i ask whether there is any early prospect of the governments joining the exchange rate mechanism <e> <s> i should have thought that that was a more or less permanent situation <e>", "<cs> my lords since as i understand it the german government wish any decision on enlargement to be linked to the decision to raise the vat ceiling on the communitys own resources and since that latter decision will incorporate the fontainebleau arrangement for the abatement of this countrys contribution to the community budget may i ask the noble viscount the leader of the house when he expects the decision to raise the vat ceiling to be adopted by the council of ministers <e>", "<cs> my lords it was not my intention originally to come to the house today but in view of my past close connection with the subject of this debate i felt i ought not to miss the opportuity to take part in it <e>", "<cs> my lords may i clear the noble earls mind on that subject <e> <s> i really believe that this has to be done and that the coin must replace the note <e> <s> it is sad but i think that that is so <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the minister aware that the issue of banknotes is a highly profitable activity and that in so far as the bank of england derives profits from its issue of notes they accrue to the exchequer <e> <s> is he also aware that the issues of banknotes by the scottish and northern ireland banks are very small controlled by law and a survival of many private issues of banknotes in earlier days <e> <s> does he not agree that it would be entirely inappropriate to enlarge the powers of those private banks to issue banknotes in order to supplement the circulation in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i be permitted to ask him a question <e> <s> in view of what he said about the fact that the medical profession has no monopoly in its particular field under the law is it regarded as a privileged therapeutic assault if someone who is not a qualified graduate from say the royal college of surgeons inserts a knife into a consenting patient presuming to give him an operation which will cure his malady <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe sits down did i hear him correctly <e> <s> i thought he said that the bank of scotland was formed before the bank of england <e> <s> in fact it was formed a year after <e> <s> while mr paterson a scotsman played a large part in the formation of the bank of england he certainly did not found it unaided <e> <s> i may remark that an englishman <e> <s> i think called mr holland played a similar role in the

reference framework refers to the total expenditure of the budget and not merely to the agricultural expenditure <e>", "<cs> my lords although my name does not appear on the list of speakers in this debate i hope i may have your usual indulgence for the few remarks that i would like to make <e> <s> i did not expect to be able to be here today which was why i did not put my name down and it is possible that i may have to leave before the debate ends <e> <s> i hope your lordships will excuse me for that too <e>", "<cs> i am not suggesting that dear lord beswick but it has certainly been used in this house and elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i should make it clear <e> <s> i suppose the correct definition of monetarism is a belief that the monetary weapon can do the whole job <e> <s> people such as myself who have spent our lives in this field do not believe that <e> <s> it makes a contribution but it does not do the whole job <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord would give way would he accept that nobody who has spoken today has gone beyond suggesting a multi-judge court or the possibility of the accused electing or opting for jury trial in another jurisdiction <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness the minister aware that my old friends in her majestys treasury so passionately dislike the raising of funds by government for special purposes that they can be relied upon to crush the admirable suggestion made by the noble baroness lady lane-fox <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord the minister recall that in a debate in your lordships house in on the impending demise of the bank of england note i urged the government to rationalise the job lot of coins that we have as our coinage and i invited them to take as their model the admirable swiss coinage for doing this <e> <s> if a study is taking place at nottingham university will the minister be pleased to draw the attention of that university to the swiss coinage which has a lot to commend it <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not serve to quieten this interminable debate on the merits or otherwise of joining the exchange rate mechanism and the european monetary system if the government were

mechanism <e> <s> impressive contributions by other noble lords since not happily all in the same vein have left little for me to add <e> <s> but perhaps i may be allowed to cross a few ts and dot a few is <e>", "<cs> my lords i can see nothing against a subsequent realignment <e> <s> it seems to <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the minister will doubtless recall that i had the privilege to present to your lordships house not much more than a year ago your lordships select committee report on fontainebleau and after in that report we made it plain that we felt that the government had about only a year before problems would arise again <e> <s> from the statement which has been made today it is quite clear that that judgment was correct <e>", "<cs> my lords although sorely tempted i do not propose to begin by doing battle with the noble lord lord bruce of donington about whether it is unworthy if not improper to make money out of the handling of money <e> <s> i know that that is a view that is widely held on his side of the house <e> <s> it is not a view which i share <e> <s> i believe that it is an essential part of the sophisticated financial and capital market and it helps it to serve both the country in which it exists and the world at large <e> <s> if i may be forgiven i shall start by exercising the rare pleasure of taking the rise out of the noble lord lord bruce of donington by saying that in some years as against a new boy of years of gainful employment in the city of london i have seen many changes in our financial institutions but none to compare with the revolution among them which has taken place in the past year or so and is still taking place in preparation for the so-called big bang at the end of october next <e>", "<cs> i hope that it is not out of order for me to intervene on what the noble lord lord graham has said <e> <s> from my long experience in the city i have come to the conclusion that industrial relations in that part of our economy

representation on a body that is designed for a specific purpose <e> <s> it should fulfil that purpose and to do so it does not need representatives it needs effective executives <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that i returned to the committee after a brief absence and in the middle of this debate and so i cannot claim to know all that has been said <e> <s> however the bank of england and the takeover panel has been mentioned and the noble lord lord boardman <e> <s> has put the question in context <e> <s> it must be remembered that in the takeover panel was an effective instrument in a fairly narrow field and it still is today <e> <s> we are here talking about a sib operating over the whole field of securities business <e>", "<cs> before i address the committee on the amendment perhaps i should declare an interest in that i am a member of the international advisory council of morgan grenfell <e> <s> nevertheless i have nothing whatever to do with activities in the takeover field of that distinguished merchant bank <e>", "<cs> my lords if it is not out of order perhaps i may add to what the noble lord lord williams said about the securitisation of debt in the banking system <e>

nearly half a century of service in the bank of england nobody would expect me to take a totally unbiased view on this question <e> <s> nevertheless i strongly resist the amendment which the noble lord lord bruce of donington has put forward <e> <s> the bank of england has been in existence now for nearly years and for most of that time years it was in private hands <e> <s> at no time in its

admiration for our civil service and none greater than for those civil servants at the head of the treasury with whom i have worked for many years <e> <s> they are most admirable people in all

comment on that amendment <e> <s> the noble lord spoke of the need for the independent members of the board being able to bite <e> <s> it seems to me that if they have access to the chancellor of the exchequer they are able to bite <e> <s> naturally one accepts that the occasions on which they wish to bite will be rare but the fact that they are able to bite will make it doubly necessary for the

doing its job in the best manner possible and it takes whatever criticism comes <e> <s> so do not let us worry too much about the sensitivities of the bank of england <e>", "<cs> once again i find myself in opposition to the noble lord lord bruce of donington <e> <s> it seems to me as we are now agreed that independent members of the panel should be appointed jointly by the governor and the chancellor that the matter of their going should not be unduly advertised <e> <s> the noble lord lord bruce talks about a report to parliament being terse and to the point <e> <s> can you imagine a terse report saying mr so-and-so has been removed from the council because he has lost his marbles <e> <s> that is indeed terse and to the point <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord divides the committee

chancellor of the exchequer so-and-so ceased to be a member of the board from such-and-such a date and someone else was appointed in his place or alternatively with the agreement of the chancellor of

with this amendment perhaps i may speak briefly on it <e> <s> first i should remind the committee as i did a week ago that i am still associated with one of our principal merchant banks <e> <s> however as i also then said any views which i express to your lordships are entirely my own <e>", "<cs> this amendment is by far the longest on the marshalled list <e> <s> in my opinion <e>", "<cs> before the right reverend prelate sits down i shall just say one word about compassion and bankers <e> <s> he must not think that bankers have any less compassion than the members of his cloth <e> <s> they have every bit as much compassion but compassion in the banking field is bounded by the realities of life as they face a banker <e> <s> it is no good a banker being so compassionate that he goes bankrupt and all his depositors lose their money <e> <s> in the end the financial figures are something from which he cannot get away <e> <s> the loans were taken by all these countries <e> <s> they borrowed the money presumably to improve the wherewithal of their citizens <e> <s> what have they done with the money <e> <s> it is all too easy to take an ethical moral line and leave it at that <e> <s> there is much more to it than that <e>", "<cs> in general i support the amendment that has been put forward by the noble lord lord elton and i hope that the government will find it acceptable <e> <s> i think it is extremely important that the bank of england with the responsibilities that it will have under this bill when it becomes an act should not find those responsibilities in any way vitiated let alone undermined by the views of other regulators <e> <s> in matters where they overlap i think that there should be no doubt at all that the bank of england is the prime regulator <e>", "<cs> my lords it is too early for me to say that i support the amendment that has <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the amendment put forward by the noble lord lord elton at committee stage and i accept and endorse the thought behind the amendment now <e> <s> it seems to me still that if an unsuitable shareholder has been identified at per cent <e> <s> to have no powers to deter him until he gets to a controlling position at per cent is a loophole which ought to be closed <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand the point put forward by the noble lord lord williams of elvel he is looking at the situation where the board independent and ex-officio members alike have reached a conclusion but despite having reached such a conclusion there is a danger that the treasury will overrule <e> <s> he therefore wishes to avoid such a circumstance arising leaving the bank having the full support of the board to carry forward its responsibilities <e> <s> however where the independent members disagree with the official members they have the right to report their disagreement to the chancellor <e> <s> it is a situation which has to be resolved presumably with the help of the chancellor backed by the treasury <e> <s> the point made by the noble lord lord williams seems entirely valid <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that at least one member of your lordships house not on the conservative benches strongly supports the attitude of hmg in relation to the publication of details of the exchange equalisation account and hopes that they will maintain that stance despite the opinions expressed by former ministers in the treasury <e>", "<cs> my lords as a wimbledon common ratepayer for nearly years and one who has used the common at various stages of life for nearly years i should like very strongly to support what the noble lord lord renton has said and indeed the noble lord lord jenkins of putney except that i would not at any time have wished the glc to run wimbledon common <e> <s> i entirely agree with the noble lord lord renton that the manner in which it has been run by the conservators has had admirable results for the many people who use it <e> <s> it has always astonished me that no one thought of a similar idea for hampstead heath <e> <s> it seemed to me an obviously admirable arrangement as has been proved by the performance of the conservators in their duties over a very long period <e> <s> i hope that nothing in this bill will harm the present arrangements which have been so good for those of us who have used that common for so many years <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask the noble lord whether he is old enough to <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that more than years ago i had some lowly responsibility in relation to part of our coinage namely that part which was made of gold <e> <s> that was a worthy symbol of a great nation <e> <s> is he aware also that i share the widespread opinion that the present motley collection of coins is a disgrace to a civilised nation <e> <s> furthermore may i repeat a request which i made in this house some years ago that the government should look at the swiss coinage which is a model of what a coinage should be and that they should imitate it if at all possible <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that next month the lord mayor of london will be holding his traditional inaugural banquet in the guildhall to which many senior ministers of the crown and other dignitaries are invited and that traditionally at that banquet turtle soup is served <e> <s> are those people in great danger <e>"]
