am grateful to my noble friend lord caithness for spelling out as did my right honourable friend mr nicholas ridley in another place the position of the government in regard to the establishment of this fixed link <e> <s> i agreed very much with all that my noble friend lord soames said in his most persuasive speech on the principle and the need for the link <e> <s> i also agreed very much with my noble friend lord boardman on the main issue <e>", "<cs> my lords i warmly welcome the fact that a decision has been taken in this matter but i should like to ask one question <e> <s> as i say while i am glad that a decision has been taken and although i might myself perhaps favour a bridge as well as the high-speed rail tunnel i should like to ask my noble friend whether both governments have taken fully into account the experience of the japanese in building their seikan tunnel between the two islands and the very considerable problems associated with it extending over some years

evidence in close print in the second <e> <s> it is certainly an impressive and stimulating study for as we all know local government touches directly the <e>", "<cs> my lords as i see it it is fairly precise <e> <s> if one looks at particular passages ie <e> <s> paragraphs to there is certainly there a reference to the alleged fall of direct concern by central government <e> <s> at any rate as regards those danger signals which were referred to by the noble baronesses lady lockwood and lady stedman and indeed to a certain extent by the noble earl lord halsbury that is to say matters concerning financial constraints the abolition of the glc and the metropolitan counties and the alleged fall of direct concern by central government i think i should recall that of course the governments abolition policy was well known before the select committee settled on this question <e> <s> the government emphasised throughout the abolition debates that their objective was that decisions should devolve to successors and they set up a framework for them to do this either individually or collectively wherever necessary through co-ordinating committees in london and in each of the metropolitan counties <e> <s> indeed it was in your lordships house that an amendment was agreed to strengthen the role of the residuary bodies <e>", "<cs> my lords we should be grateful to the

interest in this matter and also my noble friend for giving us some crumbs of comfort <e> <s> i am always thankful for small mercies <e> <s> however i should like to ask my noble friend whether he would remind his right honourable friends the secretary of state for education and science and the minister for the arts of the importance of this matter and to ask that they will watch the situation

rhodes who as we have heard has led so many missions to that country and is so much beloved by our chinese friends some of whom i see in the gallery <e> <s> as a knight of the garter he must be very happy to know that her majesty the queen will be visiting the peoples republic in october <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords throughout this crisis i have not been able to stop my mind

education and science <e>", "<cs> i should very much like to support my noble friend lord monk bretton especially on his point about the consultative committees <e> <s> as i understand it consultative committees for the major international airports of heathrow and gatwick have effectively contributed to air policy issues in a way that is way beyond the limitations of the management or administration of their respective airports <e> <s> for example as has already been mentioned they were consulted by the civil aviation authority on air traffic distribution in the london area and are currently considering the consultation document on noise disturbance at night near both airports <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very glad that my noble friend lord soames has raised this question again <e>

fund <e> <s> as your lordships know i have been advocating britains full membership of the ems for a long time <e> <s> indeed in june almost exactly eight years ago i went further supporting mr roy jenkins then president of the european commission in relaunching plans for economic and monetary union which had already been announced at the hague summit in and which were subsequently supported by president giscard destaing and chancellor helmut schmidt <e> <s> in i regretted that the emu target date of for european monetary union agreed at the summit had been abandoned <e>", "<cs> like the noble baroness lady white i had not intended to take part in the debate <e> <s> however i was most interested to hear the arguments on both sides on this particular matter of increasing the number of

so on this bill so well introduced by my noble friend lady young and on the valuable report of the noble baroness lady llewelyn-davies <e> <s> despite the conclusions of that report which the noble baroness summarised very effectively i hope that the bill will have a smooth passage through your lordships house <e>", "<cs> i do not want to repeat what i said on second reading when there were

concerned being also a member of the research and technological development committee with the matters covered in article of the single european act <e> <s> i stress the point that the community is already involved in research and development but in my view and certainly in the view of the governments the absence of a specific treaty base for this work meant that the criteria for the communitys action in research and development were not clearly laid down and that such r d which is vital to the communitys ability to compete with the united states and japan was something of a poor relation in comparison with the policies already covered by the treaty of rome <e> <s> as i emphasised during the second reading debate the new treaty articles stress that community r d must meet the needs of european industry by improving its technological base and its international competitiveness <e> <s> this is in line with united kingdom policy <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope your lordships allow me to intervene briefly in this debate to speak especially about france and the french who as the report says have the most extensive nuclear programme in europe and with whom we now have an operational megawatt cross-channel electricity link from which i gather and i hope my noble friend lord davidson may be able to confirm this we can receive nuclear generated electricity up to per cent <e> <s> cheaper than we can provide it for ourselves <e> <s> i think your lordships would like to congratulate all the engineers who have made this link possible under very difficult conditions <e> <s> i

promotion as minister of state foreign and commonwealth office and my noble friends lady young and lord strathclyde on their witty speeches on thursday <e>", "<cs> my lords i rather expected that

sensible solution <e>", "<cs> my lords i found it difficult to make up my mind when to speak in this four day debate because nearly every aspect of government can be included in foreign affairs or

to reply to the noble lord lord shackleton perhaps i may say that i shall not detain your lordships very long <e> <s> however i felt for two reasons that i should say a word in the debate <e> <s> the first is that when i was parliamentary secretary to my noble and learned friend lord hailsham some years ago i got to know a number of medical research council units quite well <e> <s> i listened to my noble and learned friend lord hailsham with very great interest i have always thought his writings on science and religion and science and politics remarkably profound <e>", "<cs> my lords like my noble friends lady young lady cox lord blake and lord haig i support this bill and the principle of making cheap loans available to students <e> <s> i have done so for very many years especially when they are in addition to a maintenance grant and in no way mean that a student will be liable for his tuition costs <e> <s> i agree wholeheartedly with my noble friend lord caithness that additional sources of funding are needed <e> <s> in view of the fact that higher education more directly benefits the individual concerned than the general public perhaps it is right that students should be required to pay a very modest proportion of the costs incurred once their income has risen to a certain level <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to be the first to congratulate my old friend the noble
