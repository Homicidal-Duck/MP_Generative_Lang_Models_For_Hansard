["<cs> my lords to begin with i should like to add my congratulations to the noble lord lord miles on his maiden speech which i heard was a charming one but which unfortunately i missed <e>", "<cs> my lords this report is primarily an attempt at a description of the current stage of development of the eec budget because the truth is that as regards the budget the eec is learning as it goes along <e> <s> perhaps the first thing to be noted is that the budget expenditure is still fairly modest per cent <e> <s> of the total national budgets of the member-states and per cent <e> <s> of their combined gross national products <e> <s> i think there is no doubt that there still are serious defects of procedure and also in the results <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that the most recent meeting of the ministers of agriculture gives very small comfort to hopes that this will be an easy problem to deal with <e> <s> that meeting seems to me to be the most disappointing performance <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is very good <e> <s> just now he gave us what seemed to me a most interesting and astonishing figure for the increase in demand for electricity <e> <s> i wonder if he would be kind enough to repeat the figure because i was not sure that i heard it correctly <e> <s> it did seem to be an astonishing figure <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for intervening <e> <s> i have no knowledge <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like with enthusiasm to support the congratulations which the noble lord lord murray offered my noble friend lord fairfax of cameron on his excellent maiden speech <e> <s> i do so with added enthusiasm because years ago either the noble lords grandfather or his great-grandfather took me out shooting <e> <s> that was years ago when i was years old <e> <s> i do not want my noble friend lord fairfax to interrupt me at this point for he will probably say no it was my great-great-grandfather who took you out shooting <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the point made by my noble friend is very well worth making and i hope he will pursue it further <e> <s> what he told me about the ease with which you can get these visitors passports really horrified me <e>", "<cs> my lords at the risk of repeating what my noble friend lord boothby has said because i could not be quite sure that i heard him may i ask my noble friend whether he will accept that i believe the whole house would like to pay tribute to the patience toleration and admirable persistence that he has shown during the time that he has presided over this most important conference <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so the noble lord lord stewart of fulham has put down a very timely question <e> <s> i have no grounds to speak with one hundredth part of the authority of the noble lord lord annan on the subject i was most interested in what he said <e> <s> one remark he made almost caused me not to speak at all <e> <s> that was when he referred to polo-playing playboys <e> <s> i instantly recalled that in the days of my youth playboy or not and looking around the only member of your lordships house whom i can see who knew me in those days is the noble lord lord gladwyn i did once participate in a game of polo <e> <s> if that puts me outside the parameters of qualifications to speak in this debate my lords i must at once resume my place <e>", "<cs> my lords may i inform my noble friend that there are other good reasons for wishing to live to be which with luck i shall do if i can hold on for another five days <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add a word to what my noble friend lord brookeborough has said <e> <s> as a devonian i strongly applaud any sensible measures to look after the dartmoor national park an amenity which is enjoyed by thousands of people far beyond the bounds of my own county <e> <s> last night my noble friend lord brooke-borough told us that county fermanagh was the finest and most beautiful county in the british isles <e> <s> if i accept that <e> <s> may i then say that without any doubt whatever devon is the second finest and most beautiful county in the british isles <e>", "<cs> my lords i just want to say that a good many years ago now i used to be a director of a steel company and at that time workers were extremely proud of being steel workers and we were extremely proud of our workers <e> <s> therefore the present situation really makes my heart bleed <e> <s> i have to face the fact that if there was evidence that in spite of the money which has been pumped in by the taxpayers the factories concerned were still ill-equipped then i would consider there was a case for still more taxpayers money to be pumped in even though it had not been used fully effectively to date <e> <s> but i understand that that is not the case and that the industry is pretty well equipped today up to the level of our competitors <e> <s> that being so until something can be linked with the assurance of increased productivity then with the deepest regret i feel that any further money pumped in by the taxpayer would not be effective in bringing about the improvement that we all long to see in the years ahead <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether he will appreciate what a joy the senior citizens rail card is to me but that when i present it i find it a little embarrassing occasionally to be given a childs ticket <e> <s> it is an unnecessary reminder of the period of my life on which i have entered <e> <s> i think my noble friend may well tell me that it is outside his immediate responsibility <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a great pleasure to find myself following my old friend and that great greater mancunian the noble lord lord rhodes <e> <s> we each sit on opposite sides of the house and it seems about as far from one another as it is possible to get <e> <s> i imagine that that is because of the obvious danger of allowing two such powerful forces to operate in close proximity <e> <s> we simply cannot imagine my old friend ever being taken over by a silicon chip as he envisaged just now <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i know exactly what the noble lord means and it is a tragedy that several highly automated plants which were installed in this country some years ago are most unfortunately now running into sad trouble <e> <s> that is one of the dangers i think the sad developments of today <e> <s> referring to our traditional habits and attitudes which i mentioned it is i think a little like the practice of bleeding which for centuries the medical profession relied on with a blind faith in its efficacy <e> <s> as regards the law there can be no doubt in the mind of any fair-minded observer i think that the immunities properly given to trade unions by law years ago or much longer in some cases are wholly out of date today <e> <s> the trade unions unquestionably need reforms if they are to maintain the respect and support of the public <e> <s> unfortunately over recent decades they have refused or been unable to reform themselves so the law must step in and relate their immunities to justice to the community today <e> <s> the form of legislation will require the most careful consideration <e> <s> i wholly support the views of the present secretary of state for employment on that matter <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord kennet has this evening introduced a subject of wide scope and great importance <e> <s> when i saw the name of the noble lord lord caradon on the list of speakers i wondered whether he was going to talk to us about the danger to the beaches of cornwall through pollution <e> <s> they have fine beaches in cornwall and that is a very generous and broad-minded statement for me a devonian to make <e>", "<cs> my lords they are second in beauty only to the beaches of devon <e> <s> let me give another example of my broad-mindedness and generosity this evening by saying that i have not the smallest objection to the minister who is going to comment on this debate from the front bench being a distingushed legal luminary from scotland <e> <s> i wish to offer only a few observations on one aspect of this problem and that concerns the responsibility for dealing with pollution from the sea which falls on coastal county councils and district councils <e> <s> the noble baroness lady birk has already referred to this and the noble lord lord ritchie-calder has too and that means that i can be even more brief than i had intended <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very glad of the opportunity to follow the noble baroness lady stedman <e> <s> she has an excellent knowledge of these difficult problems from the angle of local government <e> <s> if she will one day do me the honour of coming across to the garden of eden in devon and she can leave all her warm clothes behind her i hope she will bring with her a few thousand tons of that marvellous black soil from the fenlandsprovided that it does not blow away as we have quite a wind <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like a little warning of numbers <e> <s> if necessary i will hire a coach i should be perfectly prepared to do that at the right moment <e> <s> as for the vane inn i am a little confusedi have an idea that if i ask for that i shall ask in vain <e>", "<cs> my lords i wanted to ask my noble friend before he reaches the end of an extremely interesting speech whether he would agree that when we have said everything about all these measures of diversification if the day should ever come when efficient agricultural production in this country was no <e>", "<cs> i intend to compete with the noble lord lord redcliffe-maud in making a short speech in the debate this afternoon and i think i can sum up my attitude to this difficult problem in half a dozen sentences <e> <s> it is not a decision i have found easy to reach <e> <s> i am in favour of giving local authorities this discretion because i believe that if local government is really to be local government the democratically elected members should have this kind of responsibility <e> <s> if there is a criticism that it will lead to lack of uniformity i agree that is likely but that is a price i am personally well prepared to have to pay <e> <s> having said that i think that to make a charge is a major change of policy not i believe a breach of faith because very few acts of parliament can remain unamended in changing circumstances for ever <e> <s> but it is a change of policy that i do not find i am keen on <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought the noble baroness lady birk raised a good point when she referred to the omission from the proposed census of certain information about the availability of private cars in particular local areas <e> <s> i know that the association of county councils i have heard from them feel very unhappy about this omission from the proposed census <e> <s> they found the information under this heading in the previous censuses very valuable indeed over such things as the need for public rural transport and new roads and parking places and social facilities <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether my noble friend could add to that reply just some little assurance that even at this late stage as it has not yet gone to the other place he would get in touch with the local authorities concerned and explain to them the reasons for this submission and let them explain to him the consequences of it <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble and learned lord had gone on a little longer i am sure he would have persuaded us that cox was a welshman <e> <s> i quite agree with him that welsh or not the coxs pippin is a delightful apple <e> <s> the noble lord lord peart in a gesture in my direction at one moment said that i would quite agree with what he said <e> <s> i do remember more than a quarter of a century ago when i was at the ministry of agriculture fisheries and food we were at that time somewhat concerned at the not too good presentation for sale of so many of our apples and pears <e> <s> i should only like to put on the record my personal opinion that a good deal of progress has been made since then in this matter my visits to greengrocers and so on lead me to believe that on the whole our apples and pears are much better presented than they were years ago <e> <s> that is very important when it comes to competition <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all grateful to the noble lord lord avebury for describing his bill to us with his usual clarity <e> <s> unlike the noble lord lord pitt of hampstead i found the remarks of my noble friend lady macleod of borve speaking from her wide experience and with her usual sympathy and compassion most persuasive <e> <s> the noble lord lord pitt <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend said mr amery <e> <s> will he make it clear that it was not me but a much more distinguished gentleman mr l s amery <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the importance of examples as regards these matters i should like to ask my noble friend whether it is true as reported in <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend accept that i am a little perplexed at the answer he gave in view of the importance which the present government rightly attach to incentive for effort and initiative <e> <s> but i was slightly comforted by the last part of his first answer <e> <s> will my noble friend also accept that this confirms my own prescience when i was temporarily in the army during the war in not having made a greater effort to become a field marshal <e> <s> that is the reason because of the application of what my noble friend called the overtaking phenomenon <e>", "<cs> my lords i always enjoy the opportunity of listening to the noble lord lord bowden <e> <s> i remember very well when he wrung our withers with the sad story of the sewer in manchester <e> <s> when i realised that i was to follow him on the list of speakers this afternoon i rushed to the library to read up about sewers but of course the noble lord lord bowden has talked about something else <e> <s> however he told us a great many things that it is right we should <e>", "<cs> my lords the arguments adduced by my noble friend lord morris and other noble lords who have spoken on this amendment seem to me to carry a good deal of weight both in the interests of the pensioners and in the interests of public funds <e> <s> if open-endedness is the difficulty my noble friend senses then i think the suggestion made by the noble lord lord mishcon might be worth looking at there with the limitation of the reviews that he mentioned <e>", "<cs> my lords i was rather impressed with the arguments <e>", "<cs> i think the explanations my noble friend lord ferrers gave were wholly satisfactory to my noble friend lord ridley <e> <s> if he had been present he would have been glad to say so <e>", "<cs> in reply to the noble baroness i cannot answer her question exactly <e> <s> i myself have been in touch with county councils and one district council in the matter <e> <s> i had a most amiable conversation <e>", "<cs> i quote understand what my noble and learned friend says that he wishes to have more time to consider it <e> <s> i am very grateful to the committee for considering a manuscript amendment in this way <e> <s> i am sure that in the circumstances my noble friend would wish to withdraw his amendment in view of what my noble and learned friend has just said <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to support the amendment which my noble friend lord inglewood has proposed <e> <s> it seems a sensible step to take and it is directly in line with the governments wishes to reduce unnecessary control <e> <s> i thought that my noble friend lord digby put his finger on the thing when he said that the government wish to reduce the detailed controls but of course must maintain control in the aggregate <e> <s> i agree that that should be the policy it must be the right strategic policy <e> <s> finally i should like to support what the noble baroness lady stedman said that the home office has a reputation for being extremely deliberative <e> <s> it must be infuriating for keen members of police authorities when they have to wait for detailed control of just the kind that the government have set their heart on reducing <e> <s> it seems to me that the proposal of my noble friend lord inglewood is a very sensible one indeed and i look forward to hearing what my noble friend on the front bench has to say about its practicability <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether my noble friend will take comfort from the fact that the working party has not met since last christmas is one more proof that they also serve who only stand and wait
