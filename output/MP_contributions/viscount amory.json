["<cs> my lords i am very glad of the opportunity to follow the noble baroness lady stedman <e> <s> she has an excellent knowledge of these difficult problems from the angle of local government <e> <s> if she will one day do me the honour of coming across to the garden of eden in devon and she can leave all her warm clothes behind her i hope she will bring with her a few thousand tons of that marvellous black soil from the fenlandsprovided that it does not blow away as we have quite a wind <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like a little warning of numbers <e> <s> if necessary i will hire a coach i should be perfectly prepared to do that at the right moment <e> <s> as for the vane inn i am a little confusedi have an idea that if i ask for that i shall ask in vain <e>", "<cs> my lords i wanted to ask my noble friend before he reaches the end of an extremely interesting speech whether he would agree that when we have said everything about all these measures of diversification if the day should ever come when efficient agricultural production in this country was no <e>", "<cs> i intend to compete with the noble lord lord redcliffe-maud in making a short speech in the debate this afternoon and i think i can sum up my attitude to this difficult problem in half a dozen sentences <e> <s> it is not a decision i have found easy to reach <e> <s> i am in favour of giving local authorities this discretion because i believe that if local government is really to be local government the democratically elected members should have this kind of responsibility <e> <s> if there is a criticism that it will lead to lack of uniformity i agree that is likely but that is a price i am personally well prepared to have to pay <e> <s> having said that i think that to make a charge is a major change of policy not i believe a breach of faith because very few acts of parliament can remain unamended in changing circumstances for ever <e> <s> but it is a change of policy that i do not find i am keen on <e>"]
