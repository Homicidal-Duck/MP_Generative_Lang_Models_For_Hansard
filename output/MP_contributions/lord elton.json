materially add to the information already available on which the government have based their declared intention <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for voicing those opinions <e> <s> i am aware of the high regard in which the staff of the sports council has been held and the good relations which it has established with the sporting community and the governing bodies of sport but i do not intend or expect that the output of the sports council will be so very considerably changed as a result of the change of the means by which it is serviced <e> <s> the proposed arrangements will eliminate much of the present duplicated effort and overlapping functions to which i have referred and will save administrative and staffing costs of the order of <e> <s> the intention is that a greater proportion of available resources should thus be received by sporting bodies for whom they were voted <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like one or two points to be made clear <e>", "<cs> my lords

that it has come to my notice that suggestions have been made outside this house i think this is the appropriate time to mention it that the civil servants in my department are biased in this matter and that i have been given partial advice <e> <s> i should like to put on record my confidence that the staff of my department have not given me and never will give me improper advice to suit their own personal interests <e> <s> the allegation in any case rests upon a misconception of the policy proposed <e> <s> it will not result in either the creation or the protection of a single job in my department <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to give that undertaking <e> <s> perhaps some of your lordships are under the misimpression that the intention is to abolish the sports council <e> <s> it is not <e> <s> the intention is to see that the sports council is now serviced at infinitely less cost by members of the department of education in northern ireland <e> <s> those members will be individually known to the sports council they will not be faceless men <e> <s> i intend that the budget for the department shall have within it a specific budget for the purposes of the sports council and the sports council will have direct access to the minister in advising him on how the budget should be spent <e>", "<cs> my lords first i cannot commit myself to what the total of next years budget for sport will be but after this reform it will be more than it otherwise would have been <e> <s> that is the purpose of the exercise <e> <s> we have been talking about consultation <e> <s> i

the new body <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the levels <e> <s> the expertise will be preserved on the sports council itself <e> <s> the service will be provided by my staff <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not suggest that the noble lord was being rude but i could wish that he was specific <e> <s> it is a matter that ministers constantly have under review whether their responses to communications are received in time to be of use because there is not much point in writing a letter after the subject has ceased to be of interest is there <e> <s> therefore if the noble lord will be kind enough after this debate has concluded to draw my attention to particular cases i will pursue them <e> <s> i was not aware that this was a matter of general complaint certainly in my department and my honourable and right honourable friends will be interested to know where the complaint should lie so that it may be put right <e>", "<cs> my lords at this stage of a lengthy debate the front bench spokesman is always faced by a dilemma <e> <s> i think on reflection that your lordships would not wish me to pick up every single point made in admirably brief but none the less extensive speeches <e> <s> so i should like to start by assuring your lordships that what your lordships have said and what can be read in <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope i shall not be thought discourteous if i do not give way again because i wish to be brief <e> <s> the point indeed is taken and i was about to say in response to another noble lords inquiry that of course the funding of the different regions of the united kingdom and the resources which are attributed to them are given in response to need and the needs differ from region to region <e> <s> if the noble earl will in fact refer again as i am sure he has already to paragraph of the document he will see the extent and the very considerable extent to which the particular position <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble duke will forgive me for a jibe which i found too tempting to pass by <e> <s> of course history is full of examples and if ever i quote one we have the noble lord lord blake to put me right by balancing it with another <e>", "<cs> my lords i referred to this order at the beginning of the debate and i have explained already its import <e> <s> i beg to move therefore that the second motion standing in my name on the order paper be agreed to <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret that i cannot retain all the questions which the noble lord lord blease asked me <e>", "<cs> my lords i think there were seven questions <e> <s> the principal one with which the noble lord concluded was on the question of the simplification of forms which is something with which i sympathise <e> <s> simplification and integration of benefits is a worthy goal but as the supplementary benefits review and various studies on housing benefits have indicated cost is likely to be a determining factor <e> <s> nevertheless the government will keep this aspect under review <e>", "<cs> my lords yes there is a difference in the aggregate between the province and great britain <e> <s> this is also reflected by the higher volume of payments of assistance in family income supplement and supplementary benefits <e> <s> therefore the government are aware of this and the machinery takes account of it <e> <s> as regards school meals and school uniforms i would ask the noble lord to bear in mind that the free school meals and the uniform allowance will continue to be available to all those families in receipt of supplementary benefit and family income supplement <e> <s> therefore account is taken of the poorest sector of the community <e> <s> will the noble lord further remember that there will be an increase in the family income supplement scales in november <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry but i did not catch what it was about the education and library boards that the noble lord wished to raise <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will forgive me i believe that he is speaking to the next order which is the extension order <e> <s> we are still i regret to tell the noble lord dealing with the first order on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will forgive me again if he feels so inclined there will be an opportunity for him to say it again in the proper debate which is the next order on the order paper <e> <s> otherwise i think that it will extend the debate and take our minds off financial matters when what i believe he wishes to talk about is security matters which come next <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to appear before your lordships as a censor i shall of course he most interested in what the noble lord lord plant has to say indeed i had in any case intended to refer to him during the coming debate even had he not intervened <e>", "<cs> my lords it is perhaps agreeable to be shot with a honey-covered bullet but i had not reached the point on the road at which the noble viscount was aiming

appear to have been made earlier against the civil service <e> <s> i think on their behalf i should acknowledge that the things that have been said are generous though they are not unmerited <e> <s> but what i must say and was in the process of saying was that the order will not be published this year <e> <s> if it is this year it will not be until december but i would not expect it until january <e> <s> i have not yet received the considered opinions of two of the most important bodies concerned <e> <s> i have reviewed the way in which the decision was reached in regard to the advice i have received and i am satisfied that it was properly given <e> <s> due weight will be given to everything which is said when the document is published <e> <s> i do not think that any government could go further than what i have now said <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to all noble lords who have taken part in this debate <e> <s> i welcome the general acceptance and indeed the general welcome which has greeted the lapsing of the section power <e> <s> i think the noble lord lord blease referred to sections and it is actually section to which i refer <e> <s> there are reservations held and the noble viscount lord brookeborough has alluded to them <e> <s> i do not think it is necessary for me to go further than mention the very cogent speech made by my noble and learned friend lord rawlinson to show that there are overbearing reasons why it is a good thing that this power should be treated as it has <e> <s> to those who are in doubt i can say that there is absolutely no slackening of the will to win and i think that i have already given evidence of the fruits of that will when i introduced this debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful <e> <s> it is not necessary for me to say more than that <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble lord speaks with such conviction he carries great weight <e> <s> however a great deal of what he said relates to the philosophy upon which the order rests which is the same as the philosophy upon which the bill which he discussed earlier rests <e> <s> as he rightly said he adduced his arguments in that debate and in so far as they were embodied in an amendment which the house rejected the house would not wish me to take up again the cudgels which he has so recently laid down <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has the advantage of me on this matter but i hope that i shall be able to reply to that point when i have finished answering the point to which i was addressing myself when he asked me to give way <e> <s> in the debate in committee in the other place my honourable friend the parliamentary under-secretary of state made it clear that the new committee will have considerable flexibility in the way it operates <e> <s> it will be up to the chairman and members when they are appointed to decide what special arrangements if any are necessary to ensure that the special circumstances of northern ireland receive full recognition <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the noble lords concern <e> <s> he will appreciate the constraints which operate upon me but in fact the government have been a little more forthcoming than he suggests <e>

government are aware that either the constitutional position may change which would be a dramatic change in the context of the ground which we have already covered this afternoon or if experience of the new arrangements suggests the need for a separate body we will re-examine it <e> <s> we shall try it <e> <s> if it does not come up to expectations then we shall look at it again <e> <s> and the noble lord is invited to give his views then <e>", "<cs> my lords an order-in-council was brought into operation last night in response to this developing situation it was not because of it <e> <s> it provides that remand hearings may be undertaken in the prisoners absence <e> <s> however a court may at any time direct that a prisoner should be brought before it <e> <s> that was in response to the situation it did not give rise to it <e> <s> the action in northern ireland is taken in sympathy with conditions in england and wales conditions which are not the same as those in northern ireland <e>

housing executive and the voluntary housing movement <e>", "<cs> my lords may i deal with lord hampton first on this occasion who though we regret not seeing the noble lord lord beaumont we are very

noble lord should make it clear which is the cause to which he gives his support <e>", "<cs> my lords may i reply briefly to this interesting debate <e> <s> i should like to thank the noble lord for his welcome for what i have asked the house to do and for his confirmation that the party opposite intends to pursue a bipartisan policy in this direction <e> <s> the noble lord among his remarks wondered whether the time for a judicial review of the powers was not approaching <e> <s> my principal concern as i have made clear already is that the resolve of the government in this situation

parcel a week and to have lost remission fully restored <e> <s> the house may not be aware of the extent to which these conditions are already available to the prisoners <e> <s> prison rules require

noble lord lord blease focused upon in the speech of the noble and learned lord lord gardiner and echoed by the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs and the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls <e> <s> it is the question of an independent judicial review <e> <s> i can assure the noble and learned lord and all those concerned that the government take very seriously the suggestion that there might be an independent judicial review <e>", "<cs> rose to move that the draft order laid before the house on th june be approved <e> <s> the noble lord said my lords i beg to move that the draft appropriation no <e> <s> northern ireland order which was laid before this house on th june be approved <e> <s> the order is being made under paragraph of schedule to the northern ireland act <e> <s> the purpose of the draft order is to authorise the issue of nearly million out of the northern ireland consolidated fund and to appropriate this sum for the purposes indicated in the schedule <e> <s> the sum mentioned represents the balance of the main estimates for northern ireland departments for and three excess votes incurred in the financial year <e> <s> the committee of public accounts in another place has examined these excess votes and has raised no objection to their being voted <e> <s> noble lords should be aware that a sum on account amounting to million has already been appropriated for

during the speech of the noble lord lord blease made it clear that it is not the intention of the government to gag the northern ireland voice in this house <e> <s> i would point out that quite recently we had a lengthy debate on northern ireland some of which touched on the areas we are now considering <e> <s> i would also point out that whereas the house of commons who dealt with this at great length has the power to control the purse this house does not <e> <s> this is an occasion for comment rather than legislation <e> <s> as there is no list of speakers it is not possible for me to comment on the number of people who might have spoken had the timing been otherwise <e> <s> however i take the point that was made by the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge a point made <e>", "<cs> my lords improvements are done by people and people cost money <e> <s> i shall look at what the noble lord has said in the light of what he has just added and perhaps write to him <e> <s> a number of noble lords including the noble lord lord hampton are interested in the level of subvention to northern ireland from great britain resources that is to say money which is generated on this

that represents about per cent <e> <s> of the total of public expenditure in northern ireland during that year and it is a figure to remember <e> <s> noble lords will i hope acknowledge that that level of subvention is evidence of successive united kingdom governments commitments to deal with northern ireland problems <e> <s> other relatively depressed regions in the united kingdom also of course benefit from revenue generated in the more prosperous areas <e> <s> it is the existence of separate northern ireland funds which makes it possible to measure the transfers but in this case i cannot make the comparison because situations differ <e>", "<cs> my lords the case in question does not refer to importation but to sale <e> <s> i cannot of course say what any court would judge in a particular case in the future only that the law is as expressed in the section of the act to which the noble lord has referred <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know as to the individual cases i think that the bulk of the complaints came from the trade <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend knows the ban on the display of prices in opticians windows was lifted by the general optical council on st may this year <e> <s> the office of fair trading has now sent out a questionnaire asking opticians whether and in what form they are displaying prices <e> <s> we shall know more about the results of this change when we have the answers to the questionnaires <e>", "<cs> my lords i remember with delight as a small boy the fascination which that very counter at woolworths to which the noble lord referred afforded me until i was upbraided for playing with it <e> <s> as to present practice the noble lord is probably aware because it has been said in this house before that qualified examination of the eyes of somebody looking for spectacles can reveal not only diseases of the eye but diseases of the rest of the body <e> <s> this is an occasion that should not be missed in the view of this government <e> <s> as to the question of the urgent requirement for glasses which the noble lord anticipates i hope it will not arise but i shall certainly inquire as to the delays he referred to <e> <s> in the meantime i suggest that he carries a spare pair <e>", "<cs> my lords i really should not like to verify that analogy <e>", "<cs> my lords in effect prescription and supply do not necessarily rest in the same hands at present <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged for the noble lords support <e> <s> none the less this is a position which i should wish to look at <e>", "<cs> my lords i take note of what the noble lord says <e> <s> the cost of national health spectacles for the first pair is very little and amounts to only for the cheapest and even that price can be waived where there are special needs <e>", "<cs> my lords the prudent purchaser will doubtless bear the noble baronesss advice in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his supplementary question <e> <s> it is indeed the governments policy to introduce as high a level of care in the community as is possible <e> <s> my noble friend will know that the departments social work service already performs an extremely useful watchdog function and is independent of local authorities and that the principal powers of entry examination and inspection available to it are set out in annex to circular dsws a copy of which is in your lordships library <e> <s> i will happily send a duplicate to my noble friend <e> <s> when he has studied it i hope he will agree that the provision already made is sufficient for the system which we have at present <e>", "<cs> my lords the government recognise the desirability of enabling parents to be represented in care proceedings and intend to implement section of the children act in full as soon as sufficient resources become available <e> <s> section is already in force but its effect is limited until section is fully implemented <e>", "<cs> no my lords i am not aware of that hypothetical situation <e> <s> i do not think that we should be justified in authorising certain expenditure by the legal aid fund on the basis of a saving which it has not yet been found possible to quantify with any certainty at all and which would in any case accrue only gradually over a number of years <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> no my lords i would not give that figure with confidence <e> <s> however i should like to say to the noble lord whose concern i largely share that where solicitors are aware of a conflict of interest between parents and child they are advised not to take instructions from the parents <e> <s> parents can get virtually every assistance short of representation in court from their own solicitor under the legal aid and advice scheme and some of them may also have recourse to law centres <e> <s> for the child the solicitor is advised to obtain an independent assessment <e> <s> increasingly in practice this is made by an independent social worker and is used by the solicitor who will make the childs case in court to determine what will be in the childs best interest <e>", "<cs> my lords the case to which i have been referring is one where there is a discrepancy between the interests of the parents and the interests of the child <e> <s> the provision i have described is relative to that case <e> <s> i do not think that the noble lord has made a case beyond that <e>", "<cs> my lords what happens is that if there is an apparent conflict of interest between parent and child it is clearly not right that the solicitor should take instructions from the parent on behalf of the child <e> <s> the child is not capable of giving instructions <e> <s> the solicitor therefore has to have an independent assessment of the case not very often from the local authority social workers because they are <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not a hearsay procedure <e> <s> the child does have the benefit of representation by the solicitor who makes his case in the courts but i share as do we all the noble and learned lords anxiety that we should proceed to full implementation <e> <s> but i cannot give a date for that while the resources are not available <e>", "<cs> my lords i can certainly reassure my noble friend whose work for the iydp in scotland is widely regarded that there is no question of abolishing the quota scheme without looking at it in the light of what is thrown up by discussion of this paper <e> <s> i also take on board what he says about the effectiveness of the quota scheme <e> <s> as in fact only per cent <e> <s> of the workforce is at present registered as disabled it is physically and mathematically impossible for all employers to honour the per cent <e> <s> undertaking <e>", "<cs> my lords the government issued a press statement on rd july to draw the general publics attention to this review and i trust that interested parties will indeed look closely at how the quota scheme is working <e>", "<cs> my lords that is perhaps less easy to achieve than the noble lord thinks <e> <s> we have looked at the scheme used in for instance germany where a levy is imposed on firms which do not honour their obligations <e> <s> the danger is that some firms regard the levy as being an acceptable imposition in order not to honour the obligation on the other hand firms which cannot afford to pay the levy find themselves disadvantaged <e>", "<cs> my lords both organisations and individuals have until the end of this year to make known their views <e> <s> it is not surprising therefore that so far we have received only about three dozen submissions from organisations and individuals <e> <s> i trust that the attention which the noble lord has drawn to this issue by asking this question will help to get others to interest themselves in this important matter <e>", "<cs> my lords nothing unusual or untoward has happened and it would not be possible to have a public inquiry into every piece of correspondence that issues from my department <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments intention is to make the greatest range and excellence of service that is possible available to the public through the national health service <e> <s> at present about beds in private hospitals and nursing homes are used by the nhs on a contractual basis <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think the noble lord wishes to imply that my honourable and right honourable friends were doing anything of the sort <e> <s> what my honourable and right honourable friends were doing was providing the means whereby area health authorities could avail themselves of resources available to them in the private sector <e> <s> there is nothing unusual in that and nothing improper <e>", "<cs> my lords the supplementary benefit <e>", "<cs> the difference my lords is that there are more people who qualify now than there were formerly <e>", "<cs> my lords when the government have the report they will consider particular issues such as that brought by the noble lord to the governments attention <e>", "<cs> my lords it is implementation which i think is what the right reverend prelate meant by getting through by september royal assent in consolidation shortly afterwards <e> <s> that gets us in a position for implementation with a consolidated act which is something you can hold in your hand read through and work upon instead of the jigsaw that we are producing at the moment <e> <s> i did not want that to go unmentioned in case i had earlier misled the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i only wanted to say to the noble lord that while i accept his description of myself as the lowest form of ministerial life i would not accept it for him particularly in view of what he has just said <e> <s> i endorse that my mind will be open <e> <s> perhaps i might take this opportunity to say that the earlier amendments come to us the easier it is to discover ways to accommodate rather than reject them <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord would be kind enough to allow me i do not want to anticipate the committee debate but equally there is a point which seems to be eluding us or eluding me every time this matter is raised <e> <s> a second opinion to be multi-disciplinary presumably must embrace more than one person and i envisage that the occasions when a second opinion is needed will very frequently be occasions of considerable emergency <e> <s> i hope therefore that when the noble lord comes to the committee with an amendment where we can thrash this matter out he will consider the difficulty if there is one of getting together a multi-disciplinary second opinion and how multi it will be remains to be seen in the sort of circumstances where it will be urgently needed <e> <s> that is the only point i wanted to intervene on <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord wishes to challenge the figures which i assure him are correct i will give way <e> <s> if he wishes to divert the debate i will not <e>", "<cs> well my lords in that case we have taken a steep road not from a valley but from a plateau <e> <s> it is in fact an increase of more than per cent <e> <s> since lord robbinss day <e> <s> it is over per cent <e> <s> since mine how long into the past that extended the noble lord lord davies of leek would know better than i the prospect now when we are exerting every possible measure to economise is the reduction in home students over four years from to to about that is in fact a decrease of about per cent <e> <s> will the party opposite kindly note that it will leave us with at least as many students as we had in when they were in power and quite possibly just a few more <e> <s> let us therefore indeed pay attention to the effects of government policy on education <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord would give way i would say that the house should know that when grant is calculated ileas unit costs in schools for an average standard of service are assumed to be per cent <e> <s> higher than those of some shire counties <e> <s> next year the allowance will go up to almost per cent <e> <s> but ilea will still be spending far in excess even at that level <e> <s> the point that the noble lord is making is discounted and ilea is still overspending <e> <s> therefore there ought to be ample scope for savings for doing the things that he and i both want to see done <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for intervening twice but i think that that is a most uncharitable and snide attack on what has been done <e> <s> the function of a direct grant grammar school was in fact to enable children with ability to go to a school of excellence when otherwise they could not afford to do so and that is what the assisted places scheme is for <e> <s> as a result of the scheme a third of the children pay nothing <e>", "<cs> my lords the council is a chartered body and the disposition of the councils funds as between its various activities is a matter for the council itself acting within the terms of its royal charter <e> <s> i cannot answer for it <e>", "<cs> my lords i find that question difficult to answer because as i say the disposition of the resources of the council are for the council itself <e> <s> i can say that the councils research grant scheme which is open to grant applications in the fields of both fundamental and applied research remains an important part of the councils method of supporting research and that the grant applications are judged for the purposes of decision about funding by academic referees <e> <s> i think the term is peer review system of judgment <e> <s> i think it is in the hands of those people that this surveillance that the noble lord is asking about will rest <e>", "<cs> my lords we seem this afternoon to be in the habit of getting rather away from the original question asked <e> <s> i take note of what the noble lord says about the comparative esteem in which different bodies are held and i shall draw it to the attention of my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords on the first part the government always welcome an institution examining its functions and reorganising them to meet current pressures <e> <s> as to the second i have already said that the disposal of funds is a matter for the council and not for the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite certain of the tenor of the noble earls question but i would never belittle the value of academic research into practical affairs <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is probably aware that the secretary of state is considering advice which he has received from the advisory board for research councils on the distribution of the science budget in and i am certain he will do so in the light of what the noble lord has said <e>", "<cs> my lords the council is actively engaged in supporting research in many policy-relevant fields of study <e> <s> two of the most topical and important are unemployment and law and order in the inner cities <e> <s> it is open to departments to seek to commission research directed towards their policy concern with the council <e>", "<cs> my lords the allowance was increased by nearly per cent <e> <s> last month from to a week <e> <s> that is well above the percentage increase expected in the retail price index in the year up to november

allowance was introduced in with an age limit for new applicants of <e> <s> once in the scheme a beneficiary remains entitled for a further years to age <e> <s> it took four years to establish the scheme to include all existing age groups of beneficiaries and it will therefore be another seven or eight years before any of them reach the upper age limit <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord will he kind enough to raise the matter again nearer the date <e>", "<cs> my lords the transport and vehicle group component of the retail price index has risen by per cent <e> <s> since april <e> <s> noble lords will readily see that the mobility allowance has increased substantially more than that and people with mobility allowance do not of course have to pay vehicle excise duty <e>", "<cs> my lords

application before they reached and now wish to do so <e> <s> i shall write to the noble lord on this <e>", "<cs> my lords it is part of government policy <e> <s> i regret i cannot quantify it but i shall write to the noble lord as to the future plans <e>", "<cs> my lords as i had actually sat down i shall merely say that all i said we had to wait for was the consultative process <e>", "<cs> my lords i was about to say that i was grateful the usual form of words to the noble baroness for her reception of these regulations but i am not altogether sure that i am <e> <s> i should remind the noble baroness that the scheme is rendered necessary only by her party having destroyed the direct grant system and blown up the bridge between the private and the public education systems <e>", "<cs> my lords we do not want to open up a massive debate <e> <s> i cannot agree with the noble baroness <e> <s> we must have a bipartite system <e> <s> if she were to no i will not follow her down that road because it is late in the afternoon <e> <s> neverthleless i am very tempted <e> <s> i must meet her again on the road we are following regarding the cost of the scheme <e> <s> she is under a misapprehension <e> <s> the scheme is not cash limited <e> <s> the original estimate of the cost of the scheme was million <e> <s> that was in prices <e> <s> the estimate for this year which was approved by parliament was million at current prices <e> <s> the now expected cost is million <e> <s> that is what she is looking at in current prices <e> <s> this represents a saving for exactly the reason she expected the shortfall in the take-up of assisted places <e> <s> it is a question of comparing the value of money which changes from year to year not its arithmetical equivalent <e>", "<cs> my lords i am advised that indeed it should and i misread the script <e> <s> i am most obliged to the noble lord for the close attention which he pays as well as for his very helpful intervention <e> <s> to save me making a formal apology later i should like to apologise to the house now <e>", "<cs> my lords i will leave that to the judgment of your lordships when you have heard the end of my tale <e> <s> i believe indeed that the purposes for which the fund is used and the means by which it is funded are fairly generally understood by those people who pay close attention to these matters at least in general principle and that it is proper to retain the name by which it has always been known <e>", "<cs> my lords i was about to tell your lordships that we have in fact increased expenditure in real terms by per cent <e> <s> since <e> <s> i am talking about real terms one would not perhaps gather so by reading some of the media or listening to some of the speeches in this house <e>",

have the right to pay the lower rate from per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> in doing this we are recognising that opted-out women should not be protected from the increase in the national health service allocation which they already pay in full this is because they benefit from the health service and it is fair that they should pay the new employment protection allocation as they can qualify for both redundancy and maternity payments <e> <s> nor do i think it unreasonable to expect them to contribute to the general costs of the national insurance scheme though of course it is necessary to preserve a proper differential between their contribution and that of others who are eligible for the range of benefits that opted-out women have chosen to renounce <e> <s> the difference between the reduced and full rate contributions will be per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords i am anxious not to be drawn into a protracted argument about semantics at this stage <e> <s> i shall merely say that this is the term that was coined to describe the pay-as-you-go scheme <e> <s> it has always been based on that principle <e> <s> i think that it is the right term <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords on the noble lords first point up to the time of this case police involvement was always considered when an initial case conference was called but it was not always thought necessary <e> <s> following this case the police are invariably informed of every initial case conference with the local authority we are considering <e> <s> on the second matter the proper response depends on what emerges from the inquiry which i have at present had made as to whether it is appropriate to place it in the house of lords library <e> <s> if it appears that a narrower

circular <e>", "<cs> my lords i was aware of the consultation that took place before the issue of the circular <e> <s> indeed it was the subject of a discussion in this house in which i took part <e>

most unfortunate people do not have to go to prison and to do that by a means which also secures that the other people to whom the noble baroness refers as mentally handicapped are not willy-nilly exposed to being detained in hospital for treatment when in fact their condition does not warrant such treatment <e> <s> i shall not go into an elaboration of the definition i merely commend to the noble baroness the publication that i mentioned which extends for pages <e>", "<cs> i should like to add that i am very grateful for the noble lords support <e> <s> the short definition relating to the general term impairment to which i have referred is in the context of health experience and impairment is <e>", "<cs> may i ask whether the noble lord is intending to discuss amendment no <e> <s> with amendment no <e> <s> in view of the similarity of the issue <e> <s> if so it would be as well to know at the outset <e>", "<cs> i think this has been a valuable debate <e> <s> i do not want to say i told you so but it was quite useful that we should have dealt with both amendments together in the end <e> <s> i should like to say that i too favour the principles embodied in both amendments <e>", "<cs> exactly <e> <s> the noble baroness and i and my noble friend are all addressing ourselves to the same <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> i do not respond to remarks from noble lords who have not risen to their feet <e> <s> we are in favour of doing what your lordships want which is to place a recognition in the bill of the duty to enlighten patients as far as may be and as speedily as may be of their rights under the bill <e> <s> i hope that noble lords moving both amendments will bear with me when i ask them not to press their amendments today if i undertake to introduce at report stage an amendment which meets the wishes of the committee on this point so far as i can manage to do so <e>", "<cs> i am sorry <e> <s> i misread the noble baroness on that point <e> <s> but it does not affect my determination to do what all your lordships seem to want me to do in so far as it proves possible and practical <e>", "<cs> of course i will do my best to meet the wishes of as many noble lords as possible <e> <s> whether what the noble lord lord kilmarnock proposes will prove to be practicable i could not at first blush say but i will certainly look at it <e>", "<cs> i think the noble lord wishes me to repeat what i have already said that if he withdraws his amendment it is my intention to come to the house at report with an amendment which will accomplish as much as it is possible and practical for us to accomplish of what he wants <e> <s> i cannot be more precise than that <e> <s> now we have to sit down and start drafting as the noble lord sat down and started drafting <e> <s> we have to iron out the difficulties and consult those people who will have to operate it <e> <s> therefore i do not undertake and the noble lord will not undertake either that i shall satisfy him until he has seen what i propose <e> <s> i have undertaken to do my best <e> <s> if he does not like it he can persuade your lordships to throw it out <e>", "<cs> i must protect myself from any misunderstanding <e> <s> i cannot guarantee nor can anybody else that any person will be made to understand anything <e> <s> i can only guarantee that best efforts shall be made at the best time to achieve this <e>", "<cs> it appears to me that we are not going to get this absolutely right before report <e> <s> perhaps we ought to debate the principles now involved and consider at the end of our discussion whether we can devise a form of words which will meet what we want to do <e>", "<cs> your lordships will no doubt know that clauses and give the new mental health act commission the duty of keeping under review the exercise of the powers of detention under the act and the bill <e> <s> the amendment for which this is a paving amendment would require responsible medical officers to report to the commission just one particular possible occurrence the admission for assessment of a patient who has been detained in the previous six months <e> <s> this may be something the commission will wish to review in order to investigate the problems which the noble lord has just eloquently described <e> <s> i do not agree though that the responsible medical officer should have the onus of reporting such cases <e> <s> the commission might wish to ask doctors to co-operate in reporting arrangements as in this amendment but they might wish them to co-operate in some other manner <e> <s> they might find ways if linking their inquiries to patients records <e> <s> it is really a matter for which we are creating a specialist body <e> <s> it is rather like teaching ones grandson to suck eggs when he is going to be a director of the egg sucking factory <e> <s> i believe we should leave it to the commission to decide how to go about their function of reviewing the use of powers of detention <e>", "<cs> i always strive to satisfy the noble lord ever since we sat on opposite sides of the house the other way around <e> <s> maybe i succeeded better then than i do now <e> <s> this was not a brush-off <e> <s> this was not a frivolous reply <e> <s> it seems to me that the mental health act commission is a statutory body which specialises in the welfare and handling of the patients whom we are now discussing under the legislation we are now discussing <e> <s> it is for that body to evolve an expertise in doing this <e> <s> for us to identify one possible sort of miscarriage of justice and to place it in statute and to leave the commission with the business of making all the arrangements for other abuses which may become clear later seems to me to be an oddly piecemeal way of going about the job <e> <s> to prefer this particular form of unfairness and to promote it as being so important that it has to be in the act whereas the practice and the experience of the body may well discover that it rarely of ever happens and that there are other things which we have never guessed at which are far more important is not the way to treat this matter <e> <s> it is not for legislation to deal with a particular foreseen probability or possibility and at the same time leave the whole of the rest of the waters uncharted <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may reply to the narrow point which the noble baroness has raised <e> <s> quite apart from the difficulty of getting hold of somebody who may be a long way off i would draw the attention of the noble baroness to the provisions of clause which seek to do exactly what she is seeking to do which is to substitute for the closest relative the person who has acted as if they were the closest relative in the table of what i call kindred and affinity which appears in the principal act <e>", "<cs> i was most interested to hear what the noble lord said about the scottish legislation <e> <s> there are a number of differences between our act and the mental health scotland act <e> <s> in this case there is an important similarity <e> <s> if a patient is admitted for treatment under section of the scottish act under criteria which are broadly the same as those in our own section he may be detained for up to one year <e> <s> but the scottish act provides that the responsible medical officer must examine the patient before the end of days detention and must inform the mental welfare commission if he does not discharge the patient <e> <s> therefore the principle of a review after days is common to both acts <e>", "<cs> i hardly think that your lordships will want to use this occasion for a debate on government policy on <e>", "<cs> this is one of those amendments about which i must give very careful thought to what is intended and what is achieved so i hope your lordships will bear with me <e> <s> the amendment strikes at clause of the bill and that clause relates to section of the act <e> <s> section deals with admissions for treatment and in subsection it sets criteria for admissions for treatment <e> <s> subsection of the clause which the noble lord now seeks to amend sets out new criteria the second of which is the treatability criterion <e> <s> the noble lord by inserting the words at the end of line <e>", "<cs> the noble lord speaks as if he were making a christmas pudding <e> <s> whatever charms there are about the amendment i could not agree with the noble baroness lady masham about the beginning of it being the most attractive part because if the committee looks at the way in which it matches in the bill would then read that it is that he should which is perhaps a rather biblical approach but of course i do not wish to delay the committee on that sort of point <e>", "<cs> i must apologise for having been out of the chamber briefly <e> <s> i can only say to noble lords who are medically qualified that it is not only mental disorder which we sometimes have to cope with and i had to leave the chamber <e> <s> i am confident i know the line which my noble friend took and we are looking at questions of degree <e> <s> the noble lord lord winstanley is talking about serious harm <e> <s> it seems to me that there are many things from which i entirely agree the public cannot be protected <e> <s> the public cannot be protected from the society of anybody simply because it does not like the society of anybody <e> <s> the public has to put up with the company of your lordships and myself without any such protection and many of us are eccentric <e> <s> but there are degrees of behaviour which fall short of inflicting <e>", "<cs> of course the courts have a power to order the detention of a patient in a hospital <e> <s> what the noble lord appears to be seeking to do is to limit that power to cases where serious harm results not where serious harm may perhaps be expected but where it is necessary to protect the public from serious harm which as i read this amendment is imminent and predictable <e> <s> i take a more cautious view than he does <e> <s> i think i am more protective of the public good <e> <s> i do not think this militates against the interests of the patient because it is in the interests of the patient to be detained and treated before that catastrophic event <e> <s> because in his life it will be catastrophic and it may be that it will be catastrophic in the life of some young adolescent who finds himself addressed in a manner which cannot be said to produce serious harm but is very disturbing and leaves a mark for many years <e>", "<cs> prescriptions often run for more than hours <e> <s> if a new prescription is needed at the end of hours i do not doubt that the proper doctor is there to do it but very often it happens that a persons course of drugs can last for some weeks <e>", "<cs> i think neither the noble baroness nor anybody else in this committee would expect to be seen by a doctor every day they take drugs that have been prescribed <e> <s> the noble baroness looks dissatisfied but i assure her that i take drugs under medical supervision on occasion for instance when i have flu and so on <e> <s> i expect to see a doctor only once and he expects to see me barely then <e>", "<cs> this is becoming a very informal exchange and also a very personal one <e> <s> no i have not for the purposes of this debate <e> <s> however even when i have been in hospital i have not seen a doctor every day <e>", "<cs> this has been a fascinating and illuminating exchange but not altogether relevant <e> <s> what we are discussing is whether somebody else who it has been decided by the responsible medical officer is appropriate to exercise this power if an emergency takes place shall then exercise that power <e> <s> i am confident that the responsible medical officer will be competent to decide who can and who cannot exercise this power and i hope that your lordships will decide accordingly <e>", "<cs> i believe that my noble friend does not intend to press this amendment and merely seeks information <e> <s> we have introduced the powers given in the subsections with a very definite end in view <e> <s> the legal position of nurses who wish to prevent a mentally disordered informal patient from leaving the hospital in which he was receiving treatment has in fact up to now been uncertain <e> <s> my noble friend referred with confidence to the common law but i think that that confidence is not shared by those people whose only protection it was <e> <s> this made it difficult for a nurse who felt the need to prevent such a patient from leaving the hospital but was not sure whether he or she had the protection of the law in so doing <e> <s> the holding power will make the position clear for everybody <e> <s> it will provide protection and will make sure that no nurses hesitate to prevent a patient from leaving because of fear of the consequences for themselves <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to my noble friend for recognising that i cannot answer him at once <e> <s> of course i will look at it and will speak to him in the interim between now and report <e> <s> he will then do as he thinks fit <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness has touched on ground in which i have a close interest <e> <s> i have great sympathy with her views <e> <s> i was interested that she prefaced her remarks with a reference to the excellent booklet which shows ways of getting children out of institutions and into the community <e> <s> it was commissioned by the department from ann shearer <e> <s> i applaud also the admirable work being done by dr barnardos and i congratulate the noble baroness on the part she plays in it <e> <s> i would be the last person to deny the importance of the matter which my noble friend has raised but the amendment has nothing whatever to do with clause which relates to the duration of authority for detention and guardianship <e> <s> as very few mentally handicapped children are detained in hospital under the mental health act my noble friend i presume intends the amendment to apply also to mentally handicapped children who are informal patients <e> <s> the amendment refers to cases of extreme mental handicap <e> <s> but under the operation of the bill this will not be an acceptable way of defining this condition apart from the definition of severe mental impairment <e>", "<cs> we are all agreed that we want wherever possible mentally handicapped children to be taken out of large institutions out of all institutions if possible but out of large institutions in particular <e> <s> i believe the scale of the problem is about children <e> <s> it sounds therefore as if the noble baroness has personally seen a great proportion of the problem <e> <s> i welcome her support in this and perhaps we can pursue it further outside your lordships house <e>", "<cs> may i crave the leave of the house because i did say that amendment no <e> <s> was consequential <e> <s> it is in fact technical <e> <s> if noble lords wish me to return to this point at report then of course i will but i trust that your lordships will bear with me <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure what is a veteran and what is a vintage citizen in terms of the question <e> <s> of course it is open to people to work beyond the age of retirement <e> <s> retirement from full-time work is however one of the conditions for receipt of retirement pension <e> <s> the national insurance act included provision that a person should automatically be regarded as retired five years after the minimum pension age <e> <s> this was introduced because some people for example farmers and some shop keepers or indeed anyone who was able to preferred to work as long as they could as the noble lord would like to happen <e> <s> in that case they would never receive the pension to which they had contributed if it became payable only when they stopped work <e> <s> the government therefore consider that this deeming of retirement at the age of is fair and reasonable and have no proposal to change it <e>", "<cs> my lords i hear what the noble lord says with great interest the more so as i approach the time myself <e> <s> as regards the possibility of phasing out ones employment this is very much a matter for individual employers and employees <e> <s> the present scheme does allow flexibility in the ages of retirement for individuals and they can choose that time for themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a limit to what one can do with existing resources <e> <s> to tempt people to retire by an overall increase in retirement pension would be about the most expensive solution to our problems we could find and if that were to be done it would not be a solution at all <e>", "<cs> my lords i was trying to distinguish between the tones of the laughter in front and behind <e> <s> i will not enter into a geriatric contribution <e> <s> i will only say that the noble lords point is well taken <e>", "<cs> my lords because neither the retirement conditions nor the earnings rule apply to pensioners who are working more than five years after minimum retirement age information on this is not collected <e> <s> it is estimated however that there are about people who are currently deferring retirement and are earning entitlement to increments to their pension for their eventual retirement <e> <s> most of them are within a year or two of minimum pension age <e> <s> what they will do when they reach either minimum pension age or a point five years beyond it it is not possible to predict <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are never satisfied with anything less than perfection <e> <s> i would not wish to enter a judgment on what the noble lord has asked me <e> <s> i will write to him <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments position on the earnings rule has not changed <e> <s> it is a desirable thing to do <e> <s> it cannot be done until the resources are available <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not certain what the noble baronesss question is but if she is asking about awareness of the literature the department is constantly looking at information from all over the world not only germany <e>", "<cs> my lords far from having increased the figure for england and wales has fallen from on st march to on st march <e> <s> that is a reduction of over <e>", "<cs> my lords the fall since when figures were affected by industrial unrest reflects <e>", "<cs> my lords the possible questions are so numerous that i have not the precise answer at my hand <e> <s> however i can tell the noble lord the principle in outline which is that this government regard the private sector as assisting the public sector and do not see it as interfering in any way with the rights of citizens under the national health service for which it provides important ancillary work <e>", "<cs> my lords on the question of waiting list cases the latest figures are for and they show based on a per cent <e> <s> sample that per cent <e> <s> of male admissions were waiting list cases <e> <s> the bulk of the others were emergency admissions <e> <s> i am afraid that this is not a direct answer to the noble lords question and partly reflects the burden placed on the national health service by accidents on the roads at work and in the home <e> <s> a very high proportion of those come in as emergencies nowadays <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret that my figures are not broken down in that way <e> <s> i shall write to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot of course anticipate any exchanges which may take place in negotiations of this nature <e> <s> the noble lord may be interested to know that the total of all nursing and midwifery staff in england including unqualified staff and agency nurses increased from in whole-time equivalents in september to in september an increase over the year of about <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are well aware of the very valuable work done by the nurses and the way in which they do it but i am not prepared to anticipate any future negotiations <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to explain the background to that question <e> <s> roughly half the site is vested freehold in the secretary of state the other half of which a proportion is occupied by the medical school is also held freehold but the freehold is subject to special provisions in the conveyance and those provisions restrict the site to use as a hospital and a medical school <e> <s> if that use ceases an offer back a preemption right must first be made to the grosvenor estates from whom the site was originally acquired in before it can otherwise be disposed of <e> <s> as my right honourable friend is satisfied that there is no further health service requirement for the site he has concluded that the best course of action is to dispose of it for the best commercial price which can be obtained within the restrictions imposed by the covenant <e> <s> our part of the site is a key to the whole development <e> <s> we expect to realise several million pounds from it and the transaction to be very lucrative for the national health service <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i can embark upon a <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said my right honourable friend is convinced that there is no further national health service requirement for the site <e> <s> no other national health service function in london is suitable for relocation here which could only be done in any case at heavy capital cost <e> <s> therefore we intend to dispose of it for the best commercial price we can obtain <e> <s> it is of course subject to planning conditions and that will be the forum in which to discuss this focal point in london <e>", "<cs> my lords no the noble baroness may not ask me that <e>", "<cs> my lords the staff side of the nurses and midwives whitley council has not yet submitted a pay claim to take effect from st april next although it is imminent <e> <s> it will then be for the two sides of the whitley council to negotiate on this <e> <s> as regards the <e>", "<cs> my lords in answering the noble lords marginally narrower question i can say that the government have already reconsidered their expenditure plans for the next financial year and have done so very recently <e> <s> on st december my right honourable friend the secretary of state for education and science announced in another place that planned total expenditure on education for is billion an increase in cash terms of per cent <e> <s> on the estimated outturn this year <e>", "<cs> my lords in settling the plans for the government have taken into account the extent some per cent <e> <s> to which spending by local authorities on education in the current year is expected to exceed the plans the additional resources some million for england announced by the prime minister last july to enable more young people to stay on in full-time education in school or college and for additional costs in higher education <e> <s> the new plans provide for an increase of per cent <e> <s> in the cash available for education compared with the previous plans <e> <s> the new target is realistic but it still requires constraint <e>", "<cs> my lords nevertheless we have to economise and we intend to do so in a pragmatic way related to the output of the institutions concerned <e> <s> the distribution of the quantum of advanced further education expenditure within the predetermined pool determined by the secretary of state for education and science following consultations with the local authority associations at million assumes that the major part of securing the necessary economies should fall on those polytechnics and other institutions with the higher unit costs <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the point made by the noble baroness but if she will study <e>", "<cs> my lords the remarks of the noble baroness about my right honourable friends daily programme are a travesty of the truth <e> <s> he is a most energetic minister and he is very cognisant of the problems to which the noble baroness has alluded <e> <s> i would add that over and above the universities recurrent grant for the next academic year of million the government are allocating million in the financial year to be used by the university grants committee specifically for restructuring including the cost of redundancies <e> <s> my right honourable friend is announcing today that subject to two modifications guidelines formulated by the committee of vice-chancellors and principals for the compensation of university academic staff who are made redundant are acceptable <e> <s> the modifications concern staff over for whom the existing premature retirement arrangements will apply <e> <s> details of the scheme have been placed in your lordships library <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend is a more pragmatic man than he has been given credit for in earlier questions and i will certainly bring that to his attention <e>", "<cs> my lords i will certainly direct my attention to the circular <e> <s> as to disowning i shall leave the difference of opinion where it lies <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly did not intend to mislead the house nor i think did i do so <e> <s> what i attempted to say was that the necessary reduction in funds would he done in such a way as to temper the wind if i may so put it to the shorn lamb <e> <s> that is perhaps not the best analogy but to put the money where it is most needed and take it from where it is least needed <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord does that if all that the noble lord wants and i hope his noble friend will know whether or not this is all he wants is an assurance that the government do not intend that there should be such a transfer of ownership i am quite prepared to give that assurance now so as to save time at a later stage <e>", "<cs> it is not my duty to do the horse trading between the various benches on the other side of the committee <e> <s> i am in the position of somebody who has been sitting on the side of a hill down which a snowball has been rolling and i just wondered if i sat there long enough whether the whole of the rest of the bill could be rolled up into one debate <e> <s> however there are strong connecting themes in the three amendments to which i now propose to speak <e> <s> my noble friend lady faithfull as it is a snowball it is proper is it not to approach first the outside which was rolled on last <e> <s> said that it was not her purpose to give the social services authority an advisory function except in the way in which a patient might get legal advice <e>", "<cs> and aid <e> <s> i must say that that was not immediately apparent from her amendment and i take note of that <e> <s> i think i should also speak to the amendment as it appeared to me and i think to other noble lords <e> <s> what worries me is that this would give a difficult conflict of interest to the social services <e> <s> if they were involved in the legal as opposed to the aid advice they would be involved by mental welfare officers who undertake duties under the act in making the application for the patient to be detained in the first place and might also be involved after the patient had been discharged in providing accommodation and other kinds of help for the patient <e> <s> therefore i think they are not the proper people to advise at this stage <e> <s> i sense that noble lords tend to agree with me <e>", "<cs> noble lords have spoken with obvious feeling much of which i share and with a great deal of knowledge beyond what i have on a very important issue <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones in two successive breaths advised me to go slower and to go further <e> <s> i shall try to go slower <e> <s> i am not in a position to go much further <e> <s> perhaps i ought to underline how far i have gone since no one seems to have noticed <e>", "<cs> it is charming to hear the noble lord lord winstanley woo my noble friend lady faithfull towards what i would term an indiscretion <e> <s> but i think i can persuade her that it is not necessary for her to err in this fashion <e> <s> as i said before the amendment she has tabled does not appear to me or to my advisers to achieve what it is she says it sets out to achieve <e> <s> it says in the new clause that <e>", "<cs> this has been very instructive for me <e> <s> i take note of what my noble friend says that there is difficulty in obtaining advice <e> <s> on the face of it it seems to me that a request for this information to a social worker or anybody attached to a hospital in which one of these patients might be would already be acceded to <e> <s> i hear what my noble friend says that this does not always happen <e> <s> she has said that this is a probing amendment <e> <s> if i can find out more <e>", "<cs> plainly we cannot again go over the debate that we have just concluded <e> <s> i will make great efforts to reduce the speed of my delivery <e> <s> if members of the committee find that i forget this undertaking they are very free to remind me of it <e> <s> in the meantime i think that if the noble baroness looks at <e>", "<cs> i have not actually been asked that in terms of an amendment and i wonder whether in fact the noble lord lord hooson is going to speak to his amendment at this stage in which case it would be convenient for me perhaps to hear what he has to say <e>", "<cs> i can only speak to the amendment we are discussing <e> <s> the intention of section is to protect staff who were going carefully and conscientiously about their duties under the act often in very difficult circumstances from the continual threat of litigation <e> <s> we have to realise that for staff caring for the mentally disordered this threat can be a very real one <e> <s> patients may suffer from severe and persistent delusions which make them quite unreasonably antagonistic towards a member of the hospital staff <e> <s> the problem is particularly severe in the case of detained patients <e> <s> these patients arc in hospital against their will and it is likely that they will harbour resentment towards the staff whose duty it is to prevent their leaving hospital particularly until they have had the opportunity to understand what their presence in the hospital is all about <e>", "<cs> if i may take the first leg of the noble lords argument at the start that there are so very few cases brought to the high court for permission to proceed i took it that his contention was that the hurdle was too high the sieve was too small or the intimidation was too great that he wanted something easier and i imagined that a larger number of cases would ensue <e> <s> however be that as it may i have said that we are prepared to look at whether this is the appropriate sieve hurdle or disincentive but that in all honesty while there is a case before the commission we do not think that it is sensible to commit ourselves in legislation when it will be perfectly feasible to get a legislative vehicle for this amendment if it proves to be advisable when we know what the finding of the commission and possibly subsequently of the court will be and those decisions are notoriously difficult to predict <e>", "<cs> i am surrounded by sirens <e> <s> i would certainly not accept that we should repeal section and put nothing in its place <e> <s> that would be unwise from two points of view that which i have adduced and that which my noble friend lord mottistone has adduced <e> <s> i have met many of the people who do this work since i took on my present responsibilities and i have a totally unbounded admiration for the dedication of people who in exhausting circumstances day after day week after week year after year give of themselves to the disordered and sometimes pathetic and sometimes aggressive people whom they serve and whom willy-nilly sometimes they must detain <e> <s> i believe that they deserve and must have protection from the sort of litigation which can endlessly get them into court and against which they can protect themselves only by being always accompanied like st paul by a great cloud of witnesses <e> <s> i stand absolutely firm on that <e>", "<cs> the matter is that the noble lord is asking me through the printed paper office <e>", "<cs> if i may dispose of one point of substance but detail first may i tell the noble baroness lady masham of ilton that i am not aware of any operations as such by which i take it that the noble baroness means psycho-surgery

kind enough to give way <e> <s> perhaps i should have saved my fire but the mental health act commisison is a multidisciplinary panel <e> <s> that is exactly where we are taking the opinion from <e>", "<cs> i pause to see whether my noble friend lady faithfull wishes to speak in view of the fact that if this amendment succeeds hers falls <e> <s> it would seem normal practice therefore to discuss them together <e>", "<cs> i do not think my noble friend will have that pleasure but that remains to be seen <e> <s> i hope to be a little more friendly than that dour first reply may have given the committee reason to think <e>", "<cs> with pleasure <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down may i just refer him for his future consideration to section which is the interpretation section of the act so that we are clear what we mean when we talk about medical treatment <e>", "<cs> certainly not before we finish dealing with the bill <e> <s> as to the exact date i would have to take advice <e>

record <e> <s> in fact i acknowledged in my original answer that the number of beneficiaries has gone up and that the increase in benefit is not <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not easy to tell how many

employees share of class i contributions and of this as i said on second reading is intended for the fund <e> <s> this applies to the generality of employed people <e> <s> opted-out married women and widows are separately dealt with by regulation and the noble lords second amendment to which he spoke but which he did not i think elucidate is intended to apply a similar reduction to their contribution and in effect it does apply because the noble lord has corrected the figure in the marshalled list <e>", "<cs> it is always a pleasure to give way to the noble lord because it throws a new perspective if i may so put it on an argument <e> <s> i was not aware that most of the catastrophes against which i personally insure myself were ones to which i had contributed <e>", "<cs> the noble lord and i are arguing on opposite sides of the same coin <e> <s> it is not necessary that a benefit should be contributory <e> <s> there are many that are not <e> <s> equally it is not necessary that an insurance policy should attract no payments of premium from those who benefit from it <e> <s> there is no new philosophy involved <e> <s> at the outset when the redundancy payments act was brought into force it was expected to be self-financing from contributions <e> <s> the noble lord lord bruce of donington was saying that it would be largely supported by the state <e> <s> we are not changing anything dramatically <e> <s> i accept that noble lords feel that these are very hard times and that they have to speak out but we are not <e>", "<cs> i ought to remind noble lords that the calculations which we have been discussing are made on the basis of a percentage of income <e>", "<cs> i should like to put one other answer to the noble lord lord bruce of donington because it would not be right to let the matter go by default <e> <s> he referred to rebates which puzzled me somewhat <e> <s> however i deduce that he is referring to what an employer gets back after he has made a redundancy payment to a redundant employee <e> <s> that money comes from the redundancy fund which at present is subscribed per cent <e> <s> by employers <e> <s> it does not come <e>", "<cs> if i may start with the jumping-off ground of the address of the noble baroness lady jeger the point was made that the treasury needs more money because of unemployment <e> <s> to put this debate into its proper perspective i should remind the committee that in the year it is expected that only million extra is going on unemployment and nearly million more will be spent on retirement pensions <e> <s> i think that statement puts this issue in the right context <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness with her customary charm has disarmed the criticisms of draft <e>", "<cs> i can only reiterate the remarks which i have already made <e> <s> the principle which the noble lord presses is not congruent with the legislation that we have before us <e> <s> the schedule gives power to make redundancy payments to certain categories of people who are excluded from payments such as mariners <e> <s> it would not allow payments to people disqualified because of length of service <e> <s> it would not have been possible to have adduced that without looking at the principal legislation <e> <s> i am sorry that i hesitated at the beginning <e> <s> we sometimes depend upon the carrier pigeons and it was rather a swift flight on this occasion i think <e> <s> i counsel the committee for all the reasons i have given to reject this amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i should say that the government hold the self-employed in very high esteem <e> <s> they regard them as an innovative and important element in the british economy <e> <s> they recognise that they are not all very wealthy men <e> <s> some of them are like little acorns which grow into great economic oak trees while others remain small men throughout their lives <e> <s> and they are the salt of the earth and of the economy <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble baroness does not apply the same principles to her modes of transport as she does to legislation <e> <s> the effect of the amendment is to impose a duty on the secretary of state to carry out a review under section of the social security act of the general level of earnings and if necessary to produce an order to alter the rates of class and class contributions the figure of earnings below which the small earnings exception may be granted and the profit levels between which class contributions are calculated <e> <s> the bill which the noble baroness seeks to amend or rather does not seek to amend provides for the suspension of this duty this year because the bill itself includes the increases which can be made under that order as well as the increase of per cent <e> <s> in the class contribution rate and the increase of per cent <e> <s> in the class rate <e>", "<cs> in rising to reply to this short debate i should like to extend my sympathy to the noble lord lord hooson whose indisposition i was sorry to hear of <e> <s> i hope he will he with us again soon <e> <s> if i can recapitulate i do not wish to go over stale ground either the original amendment on this subject was no <e> <s> <e> <s> that removed the protection against vexatious litigation provided by section entirely and substituted nothing else <e> <s> this amendment also removes the protection provided by section and substitutes something else so far as criminal though not civil proceedings are concerned <e>", "<cs> this amendment would mean that members of the mental health act commission would be authorised to discharge patients who were unlawfully detained <e> <s> i do not think that that is something which is consonant with what we are trying to do in this bill <e> <s> the mental health act commission is about the welfare of patients while they are detained <e> <s> it is the mental health review tribunal which is about discharging patients <e> <s> therefore this amendment seems to me to confuse two issues because we are talking about two different types of case <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble lord opposite is suggesting that the three amendments should be considered together and giving a warning to my noble friend that he does not agree with her amendment in one respect <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord again but he cannot move his amendment now <e> <s> he can speak to it but amendments have to be moved one after the other <e> <s> however the noble lord can speak to amendments in a jumbled-up group <e>", "<cs> not if the noble lord does not move it <e>", "<cs> if the noble baroness would forgive me this bill is about detained patients <e> <s> the noble baronesss description of what happened to her sadly late friend does not sound to me as if it concerned a detained patient <e> <s> it sounds to me as if he was a voluntary patient <e> <s> i may be wrong but i am anxious that we should not extend the area of discussion and draw into this debate considerations which are not germane to it <e>", "<cs> the bill proposes that the mental health act commission shall be concerned only with detained patients <e> <s> i am well aware of the phenomenon to which the noble lord lord winstanley referred whereby people in mental hospitals are not very clear about their legal status <e> <s> our concern in this bill relates to the mental health act and that is why the commission is called the mental health act commission and we propose specific functions for it <e> <s> its main functions will be to deal first with consent to treatment which is a matter which has exercised your lordships greatly <e> <s> i think the debate suggested that there should be a watchdog and that is the function of the commission <e> <s> then there is the preparation of a code of practice covering treatment for detained patients and again the same applies your lordships wanted it closely considered and were concerned to introduce a multidisciplinary element into the second opinion <e> <s> that is a function which is allocated to this body because it is a multidisciplinary panel <e> <s> there is also the monitoring of the use of powers of detention and generally acting as a watchdog for detained patients <e> <s> detained patients need this extra safeguard because they are in a special position they are not free to leave the hospital when they wish as other patients are <e> <s> it is that special factor deprivation of liberty which justifies establishing a new body which will have particular experience and expertise in the problems which arise from detention <e>", "<cs> i do not think i can answer that question off-the-cuff <e> <s> my instinctive response is that if they saw malpractices they would not remain quiet about them <e> <s> but usually in legislation there are other considerations which are not immediately apparent <e> <s> i would not want to commit the government to a line but i shall try to write to the noble lord before the next stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble lord is perhaps not quite getting the message that i am trying to give him <e> <s> plainly it will not be the purpose of the commission to ignore the interests of anybody but their responsibility is going to be to detained patients <e> <s> that responsibility has to be closely delineated otherwise they will either become swamped with work or so numerous as to be almost uncountable <e> <s> neither of those alternatives is acceptable <e> <s> if the noble lord is merely saying that he would like to table an amendment which says that the commission should not disregard the interests of informal patients i should have thought that that was almost superfluous because i would not think that anyone would expect them to do so <e> <s> if the noble lord wishes me to assure him in that respect i would be happy to do so <e>", "<cs> i may be able to make even that superfluous because i have taken advice more quickly than i thought it was possible to do <e> <s> it would be entirely proper and expected that the commission would bring cases of improper practice affecting informal patients to <e>", "<cs> there is a limit to the amount of detail that you can go to <e> <s> we could legislate that they should all be well-disposed to the mentally ill generally <e> <s> i think that there is not a difficulty here <e> <s> if i find between now and report stage that there is a difficulty i shall both get in touch with the noble lord and suggest what we should do about it <e> <s> but i think we can assume that where the processes allow it and where the instituting authority who are the government expect it the members of this commission will do it <e>", "<cs> perhaps i can clear one difficulty out of the way at the start <e> <s> my noble friend lady faith-full said that we had been arguing backwards and forwards as to whether there should be a report every two three or five years or whether there should be a report at all <e> <s> i can assure her that we are taking away a clear indication that the committee wants there to be a report <e> <s> we are discussing how that report should be presented to whom and how often and that is something which i think we shall review more effectively in the light of what my noble friend lord renton will say if i anticipate him correctly on clause stand part <e>", "<cs> to ensure that i answer the point my noble friend is making may i ask him to repeat that part of the subsection to which he is referring <e>", "<cs> i was taking another point on board as my noble friend began his last remarks and i am asking for the reference to the point he is now making <e>", "<cs> we are debating the clause stand part and it might be more convenient to the committee to discuss at the same time amendments that strike later in the bill <e> <s> i am quite prepared to be persuaded of that if the noble lord thinks there is advantage in so doing <e>", "<cs> well this has been and i hope will continue to be a very interesting debate <e> <s> perhaps i should start by saying that we see the commission as being a very important part of the bill <e> <s> as many of your lordships have said we in this chamber debate major changes in the law about compulsory detention of mentally disordered people only every years or so <e> <s> so we are very much aware that when the opportunity arises difficult issues are involved and i am grateful for the sustained and concerned interest that your lordships have shown in the bill <e> <s> i hope that i shall be able to reassure various noble lords around the chamber about what actually is within the bill and what its results will be <e>", "<cs> i have said what i believe the position to be and the position i believe to be is the position i wish to be in <e> <s> if the noble lord has discovered a defect which means that in fact we are in a different position i will certainly look at it to see whether his fears are well grounded and if they are well grounded then of course i will have to consider the matter again <e> <s> but i hope i have given to the committee the necessary assurance as to what is the intention of the legislation <e>", "<cs> i can give only tenuous guidance <e> <s> it seems to me the issue is a different one but of course it is possible to bring any issue into any speech in this chamber and the issues are contiguous <e> <s> i do not know what the noble lord has in plan but probably it would be more helpful if he could take his amendment separately and if he feels it has not gone in the way he expected when i have replied perhaps he would then leap to his feet because there is nothing in our standing orders which prevents him from doing that <e>", "<cs> i will do my best to bring the disparate parts of this very interesting discussion to some sort of conclusion <e> <s> there is actually a greater degree of common ground between us than perhaps some noble lords may realise <e> <s> we are all agreed that the functions of the social workers to whom we refer are of very great importance to the community and especially to those people who may be detained as a result of their work <e> <s> i think we are also at one in wishing social workers to be held in the highest esteem and to be enabled to earn the highest esteem that is possible <e> <s> so let us first try to do a little definition <e> <s> i apologise if i do not take these points in the order in which they arose <e> <s> i am taking them either in the order which logic seems to determine or as chance has ordered my papers <e> <s> i attempt to follow the former criterion but i feel it is often the latter which supervenes <e>", "<cs> i can make absolutely clear our intention <e> <s> if the noble lord is questioning the effect either of the guidelines or of the bill that is another matter <e> <s> our intention is not to draw into this very important field unqualified teenagers <e> <s> it is to draw into this field qualified people with experience and unqualified people with great experience <e> <s> this is not a loophole as i tried to say before to dilute the service <e> <s> it is not the water from the bottom of the bottle that we are after <e> <s> it is the cream at the top that we are after <e>", "<cs> i feel it is hardly necessary for me to speak after that splendidly apposite and well-informed intervention by my noble friend <e> <s> of course we do recognise that there is great concern that the mental welfare officer should exercise his judgment independently in making applications for admission under the act and what is more should be seen to do so <e> <s> there may be cases where social workers based in a hospital and undertaking mental welfare officer duties find it difficult to act independently in making application to that hospital and that may well arise most often where the doctor with whom the social worker is working has made one of the medical recommendations <e> <s> but it is our view that this sort of case should be a matter for good practice rather than legislation largely for the reasons which my noble friend has just given <e> <s> i should like to add another dimension which is that some social workers indeed i think an increasing number now do divide their work between area teams and the hospital and they may well be for that reason more familiar with the case than they otherwise would be and more familiar than anybody else is <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord withdraws the amendment i think i should say what a magnificent example that was that my noble friend gave and it does show that social workers are thoroughly human thoroughly wise thoroughly sensible and also prepared to take on a great deal more than statute or guidelines or anything else demands <e> <s> who would take on buster as a result of a statute <e> <s> i congratulate my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my guidance to the noble lord was that any remarks he had about this amendment would be appropriate to the debate about this amendment <e> <s> this amendment is not about the composition of the mental health act commission and i thought that he was going to talk about that when we were discussing it <e> <s> he is talking about two alternative parliamentary procedures for overseeing subordinate legislation which brings those provisions into effect <e> <s> had i <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may reply to that rather briefly because i have already delineated the grounds of my reply <e> <s> i should like to say first that the reason the clause which the noble lord wants to bring into the embrace of this procedure is omitted while clause is included is that under clause the secretary of state has the power to take a right away from a patient or to reduce it whereas under clause the intention is that he shall take steps to defend the rights of a patient or increase them <e>", "<cs> what i say in reply to this question will be tinged with speculation because it is a highly technical question <e> <s> as i read clause it says <e>", "<cs> the answer is no <e> <s> it is two years from the date when the bill is passed <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble friend for that kind and complimentary remark <e> <s> in return may i assure him that the secretary of state can refer a case to a tribunal at any time the provision for that is in paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords throughout the passage of this bill through the house certainly in the earlier stages the noble baroness lady jeger has returned to the theme this afternoon noble lords and noble baronesses on the other side have sought to treat it as if it made a significant departure from the accepted philosophy on which our system of social security rests <e> <s> i hope i have by now convinced your lordships that it does not <e> <s> in every respect but two the bill treats with matters sufficiently minor to be disposed of by subordinate legislation <e> <s> these matters were only brought into the bill as a matter of convenience so that the whole of the governments proposals for this annual adjustment could be dealt with together <e> <s> it avoided the necessity of dealing with separate parts of the same complex whole upon two separate occasions <e> <s> that simplified the business of your lordships house but it did not add an iota of importance to the matters themselves <e> <s> nor i might add does the bill set out to regulate the level at which benefits are set though some noble lords would have us treat it as though it did <e> <s> nor does it interfere as has several times been suggested with the character of national insurance in such a way as to make it anything other than it now is a national insurance scheme in the original sense of that phrase <e> <s> indeed some of the suggestions we have heard from across the chamber would have altered it a good deal more than we ourselves are proposing to do <e>", "<cs> my lords the national union of students draws its income from the affiliation fees paid to it by student unions in individual institutions and universities <e> <s> the question of whether they affiliate or not is for them to decide <e> <s> the sum of money which the noble lord asked about is not a matter of return to the government but press reports lead us to believe that it is about million <e>", "<cs> my lords if that was not another question i would say that there is always a response <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not wish to dismiss that flippantly <e> <s> the form i think varies from generation to generation of students and so does the pretext which at the moment is basically economic <e>", "<cs> my lords i see nothing illogical in defending the functions of institutions of learning from those who seek to disrupt them and to prevent them from doing what they set out to do <e> <s> that is the only aspect of the demonstration which i have said is a matter of concern <e> <s> the noble lord may have as happy memories of other forms of student indiscipline as i have and i felicitate him upon them <e>", "<cs> my lords orderly constructive demonstration was not the subject of the question <e> <s> the question referred to disruption and that is what i answered <e> <s> the more orderly and constructive the way in which a body can make its opinion felt the more effective in the end it will be upon those to <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords series of questions opens a whole line of responses <e> <s> my response in that circumstance is merely to say that the governments economic restraints cannot be applied less stringently to those who are not in work but are learning at public expense than it is to those who are in work <e>", "<cs> my lords i am greatly obliged to the noble lord for doing something to put the character of our national student body into a proper perspective <e> <s> it is those who seek to deny freedom of speech for instance to visitors who bring it into disrepute <e> <s> if i may add to that i think those students merely demonstrate in a small shrill way an affinity in one respect with adolf hitler and joseph stalin that is an instinctive fear of the truth <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord addresses himself to a slightly wider question than that on the order paper <e> <s> but i would say that in the short time that we have had the report before us we have seen that of the nine countries with which it deals only one has a lower proportion of householders in poverty than we do <e>", "<cs> my lords the report concerns itself with nine countries only the community excluding greece <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not entirely accept that definition <e> <s> of course we do not take comfort from other peoples discomfort <e> <s> i have sufficiently often from this dispatch box spoken of the importance which this government give to getting the economy right to lift all of us out of poverty so i will not weary the house by repeating that argument <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i would be rash before we have studied the report to say what we shall do with it <e>", "<cs> my lords if the rules of order permitted it i should like to ask the noble lord whether he thought that poland was a good example of the cause he advances <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to my noble friend for underlining that aspect of things <e> <s> but we are in danger of straying beyond the terms of the question <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord has asked me to go farther than i wish to go until i am more familiar with the report <e> <s> it has suggested a second european programme on poverty similar to the one which we engaged in ourselves which i think finished last year <e>", "<cs> my lords as to the first part of the noble lords question i am not aware that an increase in represents a decline in recruitment <e> <s> as to the second part of his question i shall refuse as i refused last week to follow him into a debate on nurses pay which it would not be proper to pursue either in terms of this question or in terms of the negotiations now going on <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i could not catch what it was that the nurses have had to withdraw because of <e>", "<cs> my lords no i am not aware of the answer and i shall have to write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords there are inequalities over the country both between areas and between specialisms <e>", "<cs> my lords as i say things differ from one area to another but the current increase in the number of nurses working seems to me to be good news not bad <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i really do think that is another question and not a subject we should pursue now <e>", "<cs> my lords the profession is a large one and the figure is not relatively large when you consider that not every nurse is going to live next to every vacancy <e> <s> there really is a question of adjustment and people sometimes do not want to work where the work is <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for my noble friends comments <e> <s> our awareness of the distinction between mental handicap and mental illness has been made manifestly clear in the amendments which we have put into the mental health amendment bill at present before your lordships house <e> <s> on the question of getting mentally handicapped children into the community i would take the opportunity to commend to your lordships a small blue book which was commissioned from ann shearer to show the various ways by which this can be done <e> <s> i have a few spare copies if noble lords are interested <e>", "<cs> my lords the question addressed itself to children and the figures i gave related to children <e> <s> however there has been a steady move into the community of all age groups <e> <s> they go to local authority provision to voluntary provision to private provision and in some cases into individual homes <e> <s> the supervision of all but the latter is normally the responsibility of the local authority concerned <e> <s> i am not aware of any defects in that provision <e> <s> if the noble lord has reservations should be very glad to hear of them <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree entirely that some children sadly will have to stay for a long time in institutions <e> <s> i agree also that those institutions are usually better when they are small than when they are big <e> <s> that is part of the governments point of view <e> <s> i can endorse what the noble lord says in that respect <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a growth in fostering schemes for handicapped children <e> <s> at present it is on a fairly small scale <e> <s> i think that the experience of those authorities which at present are running schemes will be of great benefit to other authorities who i hope will follow their example <e>", "<cs> my lords i am even more aware than i was before of the value of this work <e> <s> the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords in reply to the noble lords question i ought perhaps to say although the noble lord is well aware of it that the bill relates only to detained patients who do not impinge very significantly upon what we are looking at this afternoon <e> <s> however i will bear carefully in mind the rest of what the noble lord has said <e>", "<cs> my lords while i cannot give the position on an individual scheme i can say that in general principle the pound-for-pound scheme is basically a one-off payment for capital expenditure for the conversion of buildings and such like <e> <s> but there are occasions when we are prepared to look at schemes where there is an initial revenue expenditure which is heavy and which a voluntary organisation might not undertake in view of the risks entailed but we think the risk is worth taking to see whether the scheme works <e> <s> it is for capital schemes basically <e>", "<cs> yes my lords we are well aware of the advantages of small units <e> <s> they have to be considered in conjunction with any medical requirements that the children may have and the possibility of providing them in small separate units <e> <s> i am very well aware of the advantages of having these places near the childrens homes <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble baroness is referring to the shortfall described in the book <e>", "<cs> well my lords this is presumably not the sole resources of the family even if it is depending upon supplementary benefit <e>", "<cs> my lords the requirements of every group under supplementary benefit are looked at with great care every year <e> <s> the uprating time is november the review is at the time of the budget <e> <s> i really would not want to anticipate anything at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not certain i caught the drift of the noble lords question <e> <s> if he is talking about one-parent families we have already taken note of that problem <e> <s> the parents benefit from a special tapered earnings disregard so that of any earnings between and a week only half is offset against their entitlement to benefit which does remove a great deal of the disincentive for working <e>", "<cs> not at first blush my lords no <e>", "<cs> my lords in general local authorities do share our perception of the importance of the contribution of voluntary agencies <e> <s> i would direct the attention of my noble friend to the report of the association of directors of social services published last october <e> <s> also in grants by local authorities to voluntary organisations were million as against l million the year before <e> <s> it does not sound entirely like cuts to me <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to that question if it were full would be extremely long and complex <e> <s> but i did try to hint to your lordships in my principal answer that sometimes voluntary organisations are <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware of the issue to which the noble lady refers <e> <s> it is an issue of course for treasury ministers but it is also much too close to the budget for me to give any reply which would colour her expectations <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged to the noble lord for his interest <e> <s> it is intended to bring all agencies concerned with this problem both voluntary and local authority together with the help of the department so that we can assist them to adapt their provision to the changing needs of local authorities <e> <s> it will take place early in the summer <e> <s> i can be more precise to the noble lord in a week or two when i shall write to him <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord always introduces a predictable perspective into the problem he sees <e> <s> i did say in my second answer that the local authorities themselves had provided million more last year than the year before <e> <s> that may have been more or less difficult for other reasons but it still represents an increase <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already declined to follow that fascinating avenue so close to the budget <e> <s> however i would correct my noble friend <e> <s> i think that the grant to the nspcc was <e> <s> perhaps my noble friend will recall also the grant to mencap of to mind of to the spastics of and to the national schizophrenia fellowship of <e> <s> your lordships sometimes tend to concentrate only on the shortcomings of the government i think that in

more than <e> <s> the national union of seamen were taken into consultation <e> <s> as for the question of flags of convenience i shall have to write to the noble baroness as indeed i shall have to write to the noble lord lord kilmarnock on his point <e> <s> i hope the house will be satisfied with those explanations and approve the order <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will be so kind and if the house would permit there is not a moment after the noble lord has said i beg to move when i can say before the noble lord sits down <e> <s> i want to put one thing right <e> <s> there was <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i should start by saying that the government very much share the concern of the noble lord lord wells-pestell <e> <s> my colleagues and i fully accept that the hours of work of some junior hospital staff are excessive <e> <s> indeed the average junior doctor is contracted for nearly hours a week <e> <s> although as has been made very clear this evening contracted hours include both time spent on-call and hours actually worked we consider that this figure is too high <e> <s> we are anxious that it should be reduced and have started to consider steps to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords with some temerity i would say that i have experience of predicting the length of time things take in government and have been wrong <e> <s> i would not like to come to the house and say that this problem will be solved in a particular span of time <e> <s> i have said that we recognise the problem we want to solve it and we intend to play our proper role in it <e> <s> i have tried to make it clear that it is not entirely the governments role to solve it because standards of training and so on are matters for other bodies than government and the government should not issue edicts to them <e> <s> but we shall certainly be at the centre of the operation and with lord wells-pestells riding whip to it we shall not be able to spend a long time about it <e>", "<cs> my lords i can hardly think of a more difficult introduction to the reply to a debate than the magnificent recollections of the noble lord lord davies of leek <e> <s> i am sure that all your lordships will agree that the noble lord lord beaumont of whitley has done a service to the house in introducing this subject and calling forth such an impressive array of speakers <e>", "<cs> my lords on the question of the numbers of prisoners in the category to which my noble friend refers at th september last there were convicted inmates considered to be suffering from a mental disorder who could be detained under the act <e> <s> mentally disordered offenders are just like other people with mental disorders some of them need to go to hospital for treatment and others do not <e> <s> the act distinguishes between the two categories <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the noble lords point absolutely <e> <s> i have tried to show that the number of people we can address ourselves to in this context is only because unless people qualify under the act it is not in the power of either the department of health and social security or the national health service to detain them anywhere <e> <s> as regards the empty accommodation of course we always do consider very carefully what should he done with it <e> <s> it is the product of a policy which is generally welcomed of establishing smaller units in place of larger ones <e>", "<cs> my lords the prison service has health provision within it <e> <s> i cannot answer as to specific and individual institutions but i am not aware that patients are denied treatment when they need it simply because they arc in prison <e> <s> indeed i have tried to point out that just like people outside prison if they do not need to go to a hospital they receive treatment in the normal way <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to pick up a particular case but the generality of the noble lords references are to occasions when there is a difference of professional medical opinion between people in two different establishments <e> <s> when that happens it is necessary to consider carefully the individual case under consideration <e> <s> i do not think i can go further than to say that these cases always are difficult and that i do myself pay close attention to them when they are brought to my notice but one can never ensure that medical opinions will coincide <e> <s> it is not the case as might be inferred from the noble lords question that the difference of opinion always lies between medical practitioners who operate in different institutions <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it the noble baroness wishes us to be certain that the extent of accommodation is at least equal to the extent of need <e> <s> that is a principal object of the departments policy throughout and does not call for a specific survey <e>", "<cs> my lords while i am not absolutely clear on what the noble lord is aiming at he will be aware that the legal status of staff in mental institutions is one of the matters to which we have directed the effects of the mental health amendment bill at present before your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords that is very often the case <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure how grateful protocol requires me to be for the way in which noble lords opposite have received this statement but i certainly take note of what they say <e> <s> in reply to the noble lord lord wallace of coslany i would say that the national health service was not funded to provide free medical treatment for the entire population of the world <e> <s> the noble lord took the image of the good samaritan but may i point out to him that the good samaritan was travelling along a road where he met the victim the victim did not deposit himself on the front doorstep in order to have his accident <e> <s> the noble lord asked what evidence we have of abuse <e> <s> it is not easy to quantify evidence of abuse but it is very clear if subjective from the mailbags of members in another place and indeed in letters that i myself see that abuse does take place <e> <s> indeed it takes place to the extent of a cost of million net and that is the gain which we expect to make in the national health service <e>", "<cs> my lords in response to my noble friend on the question of the level of charges they will be set at the same level as those for private treatment under the national health service when separate arrangements with the consultant have not been made <e> <s> on the question of infectious diseases the proposal is that all communicable diseases shall be exempt from charge <e> <s> i believe that that answers the question <e> <s> it might be worth adding that treatment in hospitals before formal admission that is treatment in accident and emergency departments will also be free of charge <e>", "<cs> my lords on the first point i think that it might reassure your lordships if i explained a little more what the process will be <e> <s> on formal admission to the hospital a patient will first be asked have you or your husband or wife lived in this country for the last months <e> <s> if the answer to that is yes then that is the end of the matter <e> <s> the second question will be are you or your wife living permanently or indefinitely in this country <e> <s> if the answer to that question is yes then that is the end of the matter <e> <s> the third question will be are you or your husband or wife in this country for the purpose of work <e> <s> if the answer to that question is yes then that is the end of the matter <e> <s> that requires no enormous edifice of bureaucracy it requires one intelligent and sympathetic person and am quite convinced that the national health service is able to produce him <e>", "<cs> my lords on the first point i think that i should say that no government in this country have ever treated students as a special category under the national health service <e> <s> moreover it is sometimes difficult to distinguish the <e>", "<cs> my lords i much regret that i shall have to ask the noble baroness to be patient with me <e> <s> i shall write to her because i do not have the detailed costing <e> <s> i shall hope to see that my letter reaches her quicker than my last letter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that i did not answer that question earlier <e> <s> i should have done so <e> <s> the answer is yes <e> <s> it is a negative procedure but it is open to members of either house to pray against them <e> <s> i would expect them before the summer recess <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord has expressed more sentiment than question <e> <s> i find it difficult to say anything except that i have not met shylock in the pages of the new testament and cannot follow the analogy that he seeks to make <e> <s> on the question of reciprocity i have already said once and implied once that we are in favour of it where we can achieve it <e> <s> naturally there are countries which do not have a national health service equal to ours <e> <s> indeed what the noble lord has said makes it clear that no country has a national health service equal to ours and therefore full reciprocity around the world cannot be achieved <e> <s> and where it cannot be achieved where people are not covered by reciprocity they need to be covered as i do not doubt the noble lord himself is when he travels with an insurance policy against unfortunate eventualities <e> <s> i do not think that i <e>", "<cs> my lords on the first point it was not my intention to say that a costing did not exist <e> <s> it was my intention to say that i regretted that i did not have it at my finger tips <e> <s> i shall certainly give the noble lord a copy of the letter which i send to the noble baroness <e> <s> the noble lord is not alone in valuing overseas students at out universities <e> <s> but the figures which he next asked me to reveal to him and their effects were those for the changes in charges for tuition of overseas students and that is the subject of a different question <e>", "<cs> my lords if the clock is right we have spent minutes on this <e> <s> perhaps i may just reply to that point <e> <s> if in fact it proves that there has been no abuse of course there will be no gains <e> <s> if there is a gain of million then there has been an abuse <e> <s> we believe that there has been million-worth net of abuse and that it is worth recovering <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord winstanley has said i did make very encouraging noises in committee because the government are in favour of the general intention of this amendment <e> <s> indeed if the noble lord lord winstanley looks further ahead on the marshalled list he will find at amendment no <e> <s> an amendment which i hope not only embraces almost every point that he has made in his own amendment but which also goes a good deal further <e>", "<cs> my lords to wind up this very short debate i should like to say that the definition of the term assessment is not changed by the amendment <e> <s> therefore it follows that anything it was proper to do in the process of assessment before it will be proper to do in the process of assessment after this comes into law <e> <s> however there was doubt about the extent to which it was proper to treat once assessment had been completed in other words once one knew what was wrong with a patient one might consider oneself to be inhibited from doing anything about it <e> <s> in that case the assessment is equivalent to diagnosis and it is proper that diagnosis should precede treatment <e> <s> so i do not think that there is a difficulty here and i hope that your lordships will accept this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords we are not at committee stage and i am merely relieving my noble friend of asking the leave of the house yet again to address the house <e> <s> this is what we are saying <e> <s> what the noble lord lord donaldson has said is that any decent doctor examines a patient before he places him in detention or prescribes for him <e> <s> one would no more wish to say that he has got to have seen him within the last hours than one would wish to say that he should ask him to say ninety-nine or take his pulse <e> <s> there are certain things which are rudimentary about good medical practice i should have thought <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the noble lords intentions <e> <s> however i cannot agree that his proposal to reduce the length of the holding power is entirely practical <e> <s> the aim of the holding power is to allow a reasonable time for the nurse to obtain medical support <e> <s> we have had to decide what that reasonable period should be i believe we have got it right and the noble lord thinks we have got it wrong <e> <s> perhaps he should recall that a period of hours was originally suggested during consultation on the introduction of the power <e> <s> we decided that was too long <e> <s> however i fear that three hours would probably be too short to prevent cases arising where a patient desperately needed for his own health or safety to be restrained from leaving hospital and where the nurse was powerless to do so <e> <s> although three hours may sometimes suffice for a medical practitioner to reach the patient there may be other cases in particular at evenings or weekends when three hours is not enough <e> <s> we are talking about <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord hooson has advanced with great eloquence his own amendment he has been backed up loyally by the noble lord lord wallace advancing his own amendment and the government have been asked in a sense to choose between them <e> <s> i recognise the strength of feeling that there is in this house <e> <s> indeed i hope i made it clear at commtitee stage that i recognised this and i know not whether or not my words then were those which lord hoosons correspondent took as a near promise of action a nice turn of phrase thought if a some what pejorative one <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord winstanley rises with his pin to skewer me like a butterfly to the board <e> <s> i have said that the matter is under urgent consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords i find myself in a slight difficulty because i have not had a great deal of time to consider this amendment <e> <s> although the noble lord has gone some way towards explaining its purpose he does not actually elucidate its effect as i read it on the marshalled list <e> <s> the power for a tribunal to direct delayed discharge has been welcomed by your lordships and i am sure it is helpful to extend the range of options open to the tribunal when they consider a case <e> <s> as i explained to your lordships in committee we intend to widen the options still further by means of the rules made by my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor so as to permit tribunals to recommend transfer to another hospital or to guardianship or trial leave of absence subject to conditions under section of the principal act <e> <s> this meets what i think to be the intention underlying the noble lords amendment and if that is the case i hope that he will not press it any further at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords it was not as late as some <e> <s> special hospitals are provided under section of the national health service act which imposes on the secretary of state as part of his general duty to provide health services a specific duty to provide special hospitals for persons subject to detention under the mental health act who <e>", "<cs> my lords i trust that the effects of taking a holiday in the united kingdom will not always be as disastrous on those who do so as the noble baroness seems to expect <e> <s> if the patient were detained and the patient cannot go to a special hospital unless detained that would not apply <e> <s> therefore the noble baroness may remain assured on that point <e> <s> i should have asked for your lordships permission to speak a second time on this matter <e> <s> i see from the noble baronesss expression that she may require me to speak <e>", "<cs> my lords i will try to allay the suspicions of the noble lord lord winstanley by referring him to the image of a ratchet <e> <s> the noble lord makes the charitable assumption and rightly that the secretary of state would not be expected to increase the period initially but only to reduce it <e> <s> but the secretary of state would wish to be able to reduce the period and then if he got it wrong to feel that he could revert either to the original length of time or to some shorter period of time <e> <s> it is because we do not want my right honourable friend and his successors to be deterred from experimentally reducing the period that we would prefer to keep the wording in the bill as it is <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot detect from the house whether it is giving me leave to speak or not <e> <s> in order not to trespass on your lordships territory i can only say that i cannot really add to the not very veiled things i said at an earlier stage <e> <s> i have nothing jingling in my pocket after dinner any more than i had <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that both noble baronesses have done a service to the house in bringing forward this matter for discussion and calling forth this very useful debate <e> <s> i hate to disappoint the noble lord lord winstanley but i shall not take the ground that he told your lordships i would in this position i shall not take ground which shall altogether please him at least it should if he bears with me to the end of what i have to say <e>", "<cs> with the leave of the house my lords i shall again do something improper and speak a second time though i should not be doing so <e> <s> the noble lord referred to the introduction of the power to give a delayed discharge as though that was in order to allow the local authority to build a new hostel or produce some new institution to receive the patient <e> <s> that is not the intention <e> <s> the intention as i tried to make clear but i think the noble lord was directing his attention elsewhere at that moment is that where a <e>", "<cs> i am already answering as it were an interruption my lords and we must not degenerate into a committee stage <e> <s> i have given the full list of figures which will appear in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i had been going to suggest that it would be convenient to discuss this amendment with amendment no <e> <s> but looking at the liberal front bench it would appear not to be <e> <s> as i explained when we discussed this matter in committee the intention of section is to protect staff who are going about their duties under the act often in difficult circumstances from the threat of malicious litigation <e> <s> we must recognise that for staff caring for the mentally disordered this threat can be a particularly real one <e> <s> patients may suffer from severe and persistent delusions which may make them quite unreasonably antagonistic towards a member of the hospital staff <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> the noble lord lord winstanley has not heard the argument and i should be deprived of the chance of speaking to the amendment <e>", "<cs> not i my lord <e> <s> but the commission stands perhaps as a deputy headmaster outside the court who sits inside the headmasters study <e> <s> i think i used too many analogies <e>", "<cs> my lords as to the second part of the noble lords supplementary question per cent <e> <s> of the estimated charge represents staff salaries and wages <e> <s> a high staffing ratio is necessary in order to care for difficult and disturbed adolescents per cent <e> <s> represents running costs per cent <e> <s> represents administrative charges a further per cent <e> <s> represents loan charges <e> <s> these are particular to a newly-built home <e> <s> discounting these charges the running costs for spurstowe terrace are very much in line with similar establishments in london <e>", "<cs> my lords i was there yesterday morning but i regret that the number escapes me <e> <s> it is around the norm it is not exceptionally high <e> <s> it may be as well to remind the house that this home is not simply for delinquent young people but also for young people in the care of the local authority who are in a very disturbed state who are in danger of exploitation or incest who have been abandoned by their families who are disturbed and disruptive although not delinquent and whose disturbance may manifest itself in suicidal tendencies <e> <s> as to how much it is proper to spend on such cases that is for consideration <e> <s> in my view it is not unreasonable to spend at least a little more on those who have reached such extremities of misfortune than on the generality of young people who are better placed in life <e> <s> if we save their lives or keep them out of prison or borstal the money is well spent <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i would leave the governors and principal of cheltenham ladies college to answer that supplementary question <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a place for fostering and for intermediate treatment for family therapy and for other types of provision for disturbed or delinquent children <e> <s> these facilities are directed towards children who cannot be catered for within that system <e> <s> i should like to take the opportunity of saying that the borough takes advantage of a good relationship with voluntary agencies who also provide a range of facilities but there are some people in a desperate plight who must be put into accommodation <e> <s> the more recent accommodation carries a heavy debt charge and that is why the london childrens regional planning committee operates a pooling system whereby the charge to authorities placing a child there will be only a week because it is averaged out over the whole range of provisions <e>", "<cs> my lords while i take the drift of the noble lords question i think it is perhaps misdirected <e> <s> the question is directed at an establishment of which the whole of the cost originally was subject to loan sanction from central government and on which a proportion is subject to per cent <e> <s> grant <e> <s> i am referring to the secure accommodation within it <e> <s> i have taken the opportunity and i hope your lordships will forgive me for so doing of trying to throw a little light on the general problem faced by all authorities over which this government presides and to show that what is being done is not quite so scatter cashas people would sometimes think it was <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his intervention <e> <s> at the same time i should say that my noble friend is quite right to see that the money is properly spent and it is a proper question to ask <e>", "<cs> my lords i am now placed in the difficulty that the noble lord lord avebury pointed out <e> <s> my impression from a visit from reading the papers connected with the case seeing some of the children in the classroom there and talking to the staff is that the work is invaluable <e> <s> it is not merely assessment but also treatment <e> <s> it will benefit society <e> <s> also my impression is that the local authority is very well aware of the shortage of resources and of the need to administer its functions as efficiently and cheaply as possible <e>", "<cs> indeed my lords and we are so doing <e>", "<cs> my lords the overall provision is notwithstanding what the noble lord has said below what is regarded as the level of need <e> <s> individual institutions may fall out-of-date and need replacement <e> <s> if all of them were to operate at per cent <e> <s> occupancy there would be no accommodation at all for the emergency cases which so frequently characterise the work being done by the people in the institutions <e>", "<cs> my lords i need do little more than welcome the response that noble lords have given to this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords there are a number of reasons why we are not happy with this amendment and i think that by way of introduction i ought to explain what they are <e> <s> we addressed ourselves earlier to the question of consultation by committee and the noble lord lord winstanley in a very eloquent and obviously moving <e>", "<cs> my lords i was under the impression that this amendment stood with amendment no <e> <s> and that the noble lord would not be moving it <e> <s> i think that your lordships might be a little confused if we proceeded on another basis <e> <s> if i am wrong the noble lord will correct me <e>", "<cs> my lords as i see it the principal defect in this amendment can perhaps be expressed more briefly than if i read out the whole of my brief <e> <s> it is simply that it deletes not only irreversible and unfortunate results but also irreversible and beneficial results <e> <s> it would mean that no irreversible treatments the treatments whose results were irreversible could be embarked upon even if they were entirely beneficial <e> <s> i do not think that that is what the noble lord lord kilmarnock intended <e> <s> i sympathise with his desire to remove areas of doubt resulting from subjectivity but i think that this is a necessary area of subjectivity <e>", "<cs> my lords i think possibly damocles could suggest the sort of illustration that the noble lord was looking for <e> <s> i entirely agree with the noble lord <e> <s> i am happy to accept this <e>", "<cs> my lords everybody else has justified their contribution to the debate by preceding it by saying that they spoke to the matter in committee <e> <s> i shall not advance that justification <e> <s> the reason why i intend to look at this question fairly closely though <e>", "<cs> my lords if your lordships will forgive me because this is report stage and i ought not to reply to questions i think i should say to the noble viscount who i think has not attended all our discussions on this matter that it would cause harm both to the system and to individual patients and also to the people looking after them and that we have been into great detail about which are the treatments which ought to be accepted without the consent of the patient and which are not <e> <s> yes my lords i think it would do harm <e> <s> that is the answer to the noble viscounts question <e>", "<cs> my lords we did indeed discuss this matter very generally at committee stage and also with some thoroughness as lately as last tuesday as the noble lord lord wallace has said at which juncture i said that i had sought advice and that i was not moved from my original position that now was not the time to make any change that might be revealed as necessary by decisions in europe <e> <s> one cannot but admire the persistence of the noble lord lord hooson or the courage and honesty of my noble friend lord renton who is the self-revealed architect of all that he deplores <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with part of the amendment that the independent doctors should report back to the mental health act commission about the second opinions that they give <e> <s> that is what we intend but i do not think there is any need to say so in <e>", "<cs> my lords we have have we not <e> <s> already discussed what the commission is to publish <e> <s> we have have we not <e> <s> laid down with the consent of your lordships that the commission shall publish regular reports and that it shall also give guidance on good practice in the admission and medical treatment of detained patients <e> <s> it is likely therefore is it not <e> <s> that the commission will want and indeed will need to look at the kind of matters which are raised in this amendment <e> <s> it will no doubt wish for example to check current practice to make sure that its guidance is being followed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for the notice albeit short which he gave me of this intention of his and for drawing my attention to the difficulties foreseen by the nsf with which i entirely sympathise <e> <s> however i am afraid that the problem is not soluble by the means which the noble lord proposes <e> <s> what we have here is in some sense a small bill of rights for detained patients rather an important one <e> <s> noble lords on all sides of the house will agree that a right which is concealed from its rightful recipient ceases to be of any value <e> <s> what the noble lords verbal amendment proposes what he foreshadows in his speech is that the consultants in charge of the case should decide whether or not the patient should have his rights drawn to his attention as soon as may be after his introduction to the institution in which he is to be detained <e>", "<cs> my lords i aim to reassure your lordships that the government are at one with the movers about the principle behind this amendment <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful as your lordships will be to my noble friend for giving her informed comments on a subject with which she is most familiar even if she always does it from a position which gives me a terrible crick in the neck <e> <s> my noble friend did i think raise three points <e> <s> the first was that those who were trained under the new system should have close experience of a mental hospital or institution <e> <s> i am sure she looked at the guidelines <e> <s> she may not recall that in phase a the very first thing <e>", "<cs> i am so sorry my lords <e> <s> we have this geographical difficulty <e> <s> my noble friend can hear but those sitting opposite cannot <e> <s> to recapitulate very briefly the guidelines contain provisions very similar to what my noble friend wants in respect of becoming familiar with a mental residential or day-care setting <e> <s> in any case i look forward to hearing her comments on the subject at greater length on paper <e> <s> it is always dangerous to encourage the noble baroness to write to one at length because she is apt to do it without encouragement and what i shall get as a result of this i do not know <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is perfectly free to proceed <e> <s> we will perhaps discuss later the late putting down of the amendment <e> <s> it does not appear on the marshalled list i was looking at <e>", "<cs> my lords by way of preface i should like to say that i regret inspiring my noble friend lord sandys to intervene on the question of the marshalled list <e> <s> i was working from my own originally amended marshalled list <e> <s> i think that my misunderstanding will be understood if i say that i was not aware of the amendment until very late today and that a great deal of my time thereafter has been spent in manufacturing the sort of detailed answer that i gather the noble lord does not now expect of me to the detriment i may say of perhaps my ability to speak on other amendments <e> <s> as this is the second and not the first day of the report stage and as this amendment refers to part viii of the act which is a self-contained part dealing with the court of protection and it was expressly not covered by the review of the mental health act i think that we are on very delicate ground and have arrived on it rather late <e> <s> section of the mental health act in effect empowers the court of protection to intervene in the administration of a persons affairs where the judge or one of the courts judicial officers is satisfied that that person is incapable of managing and administering his property and affairs <e> <s> by the following sections of the act the court is given a whole range of specific powers to take decisions on the patients behalf of which the most fundamental is the general one of appointing a receiver to manage the patients affairs <e> <s> none of this would be affected by the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not certain i can answer all those supplementaries at once <e> <s> i should first point out that in fact the whole of medical research started with private finance and there is nothing dis-honourable in private finance assisting a continuing part of it <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not unusual for a programme of research to run over a limited time <e> <s> the medical research council acknowledges this by making many of its grants for a limited five-year duration <e> <s> as to the months funding at present in view this will no doubt be used by the institution in question to see whether the programme is worth extending further and if it is how much it should be extended further <e>", "<cs> my lords there are three other centres which can provide excellent cover for any detailed work required in this field <e> <s> i am given to understand that st bartholomews the royal free and northwick park hospitals may be cited in this connection <e>", "<cs> yes my lords the spanish authorities have increased payments due from british social security pensioners resident in the territory of spain including the canary islands who have chosen to join the spanish health service scheme <e> <s> the increase was from pesetas per month in to pesetas in and pesetas in <e> <s> the ability of british pensioners to participate in the scheme derives from a protocol to the convention on social security between the united kingdom and spain signed in <e> <s> the terms of the protocol which is on health care are not reciprocal but they do provide for british pensioners to pay at a rate fixed by the spanish government which has discretion in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord asked whether i was aware and i said i was and he asked about the document under which this was done and i replied <e> <s> the matter has indeed been taken up with the spanish authorities <e> <s> they tell us that the increases are needed to meet rising costs and to bring the contributions nearer to those paid by those spanish pensioners who have not made sufficient payments to their health scheme to qualify for free medical benefits <e> <s> in fact those spanish pensioners at present pay pesetas a month more than do ours <e> <s> as to spanish nationals resident in the united kingdom they are of course beneficiaries under our health scheme without charge <e>", "<cs> my lords as to bargaining power we have in fact achieved some progress <e> <s> we have reached agreement with the spanish authorities that separate contributions will not be required unless both husband and wife are entitled to separate social security pensions <e> <s> this concession will cover not merely a wife without any pension entitlement in her own right but also one with a pension which is less than her husbands <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe so <e> <s> in what form i could not say <e> <s> but i do not think that we are content with things as they are <e>", "<cs> my lords the chief supplementary benefits officer is i understand about to publish guidance on the interpretation of the regulation <e> <s> this will advise that the hours should be interpreted as including all the time spent on the course that is time spent on project work on private study and on lunch breaks as well as actual teaching time <e> <s> i should explain that his earlier advice that only actual teaching time should count towards the hours would have had the effect of bringing within the scope of the concession for example sixth formers taking a full set of a-levels <e> <s> having taken further legal advice he took the view that this was inconsistent with the original spirit of the concession as i am sure your lordships will agree <e> <s> i should perhaps add that the chief supplementary benefits officer is independent from ministers and is not required to consult with other departments <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i will take note of what the noble lord has said <e> <s> if the noble lord will cast his mind back to the day when he was a student he will recall that hours of study is quite a long time <e>", "<cs> my lords this government are well aware of the difficulties of refugees and we conduct ourselves towards them in a very humane manner <e> <s> i will certainly take on board what the noble lord has said and will take it back to the department with me <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot say that i entirely agree with what the noble lord has said although deeply respect his experience in the field of education <e> <s> the length of a lunch hour is something i should not be prepared to prescribe nor the scattering throughout the timeable of an institution of private study <e> <s> as i understand it when a person is required to be at an institution in order to pursue a course like this all the time he is there counts towards the course and his qualification to supplementary benefit <e> <s> if the person conducts private study at home or elsewhere as i understand the regulations that is nothing to do with it <e> <s> it is not therefore a question of one hour of study a day but a question of enough study to do a part-time course as opposed to a whole-time course because if it were a full-time course the student would not benefit <e>", "<cs> my lords no assessment can be made at this stage of the number of cases <e> <s> we are considering ways of monitoring <e> <s> on the other question i cannot accept that excluding all sixth form students from the area covered by supplementary benefit is in any way harrying part-time students who want to pursue a part-time career <e>", "<cs> my lords

appeals which are not made <e> <s> i would assume that those who appealed were those who thought themselves must likely to succeed on appeal <e> <s> i can confirm that the percentage i gave in each instance was a percentage of the total number of applications at the start <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the best answer to that is to say that i take note of my noble friends concern <e>", "<cs> my lords the particular point that i acknowledge from my noble friends question is that it originates from a male member of this house <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord kilmarnock did indeed move a very similar amendment in committee and i gave him a full reply then to the point he was making <e> <s> he returned to the issue in a slightly different guise at report stage and i gave him a reply then <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness has certainly done one signal service to this house and to the community and that is to bring to prominent public notice the uniformity of opinion which i share that the after-care of patients and particularly mental patients is a matter of very great importance for reasons of compassion as well as reasons of common sense <e> <s> the compassionate reasons are that when a patient comes out of security into insecurity and out of certainty into uncertainty he needs somewhere to turn <e> <s> if he has nowhere to turn he is likely to relapse <e> <s> if he suffers a relapse then we come to the common sense argument that he is again going to be a charge upon the community <e> <s> there is no difference of opinion about that <e>", "<cs> my lords i would rather not turn this into a committee stage debate <e> <s> the noble earl and many other noble lords or if i am not mistaken have put their points of view <e> <s> i am endeavouring to answer them all keeping as closely to my brief as i can consistent with not repeating myself by saying things <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> we have been on this point for a very long time <e> <s> if i can anticipate what the noble lord would wish to say i am explaining to your lordships that there is a statutory duty exactly analogous to and a great deal more precisely and effectively drawn than that which the noble baroness lady masham wants to put on the statute book <e> <s> i am saying to your lordships that this is a house of revision that it should not issue bad law to another place and that we ought not to do this <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has breached the standing orders of the conduct of debates and i hope your lordships will allow me to reply in kind because this really ought not to happen <e> <s> i have said that guidance will be issued that is to say a document will go out embodying the points about which the noble lord is anxious and a great many other points as well they will all be in one place <e> <s> i do not think that there is a single arm of local or national government that is not subject to more than one statute at one time <e>", "<cs> my lords we are indeed on familiar ground on this and the next amendment no <e> <s> and almost all of what i have to say about this amendment relates to the next one also so i hope the noble lord lord kilmarnock if he intends to move no <e> <s> will give me a sympathetic hearing <e> <s> on report my noble friend referred to the second time of asking this is presumably the third and i must say i am beginning to see the noble lord lord wallace rather like a very nice vicar <e> <s> noble lords will recall that on the last occasion he preached the sermon from the wrong text although with a remarkably successful result more so perhaps than had he preached it from the right one and now he appears to be calling the banns <e> <s> in effect he is saying if anyone knows any just cause or impediment why this amendment should not be joined to the bill ye are to declare it <e> <s> i do declare it and what is more i declare it from the front pew <e> <s> in fact it is not quite such a sensational declaration as it might be in a church because i seem to have made it at every service i have attended with the noble lord since the bill was christened <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think the opportunity exists for a reply to that question to come from the right quarter because we are at the third reading stage <e> <s> the noble lord lord winstanley almost overreached the house by saying at the beginning of his remarks it was the guardian of the conscience of the country but i think not quite <e> <s> i have already said virtually all there is to say about this in connection with the previous amendment and i do not intend to do more now than say that it is not right to carry this amendment at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e> <s> i think it might be as well if i were to reserve the generality of my remarks on this bill until i have had the benefit of hearing what other noble lords wish to say <e> <s> but there is one doubt that i think i ought to resolve before we go further <e>", "<cs> my lords since i moved that this bill be read a second time your lordships have spent very nearly hours debating its provisions and even that figure was typed some hours ago <e> <s> between us we have filled columns in the <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are already spending about million in order to ensure that there is a micro-computer in every one of our secondary schools by the end of this year <e> <s> we also spent million in and will be spending million a year from to on ensuring adequate teacher training and curriculum development in information technology <e> <s> we are also now considering how to extend the micros in schools programme to the primary sector and we hope to make an announcement on that soon <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i am not familiar with the scheme to which the noble lord refers <e> <s> obviously we are interested in every development of this subject <e> <s> it is the intention of the government that through the action of secondary further and higher education systems skills with micro-computers shall become commonplace in the whole population <e>", "<cs> my lords i have addressed myself to that question in one form or another on a number of occasions <e> <s> i must remind the noble lord that in announcing the recurrent grant to individual universities last july the university grants committee made known its national student number targets by broad subject area for and against the background of an overall decrease small increases were assumed between and in engineering and technology including electronic engineering and in mathematics including in this context computer science <e> <s> it is understood that the increase in numbers in mathematics is attributable mainly to the committees wish to increase provision in computer science both in honours degrees and in in-service teaching for other departments <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baronesss vision is matched only by her humility but i think there is a great deal of wisdom in what she says <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot adopt personal responsibility for this but i intended to indicate in my response that i thought the idea was worth looking at and that i will pass it on to my colleagues who are better fitted than i to take it a stage further <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think the curriculum in this case is subject to central control but i will write to the noble lord when i find out the detail of the answer to what he asks <e>", "<cs> my lords the government published a document of guidance called <e>", "<cs> my lords in our publications in our support for relevant curriculum research and development in our sponsorship of and participation in conferences even in the speeches of my honourable and right honourable friends and in the activities of her majestys inspectors an almost constant theme has been that of encouragement to our schools to ensure that their work is effective and relevant to the subsequent careers of their pupils <e> <s> that of course relates not only to careers for those going straight out into the world of work but also to those exploiting the further opportunities left to them by the further education system <e>", "<cs> my lords the report was only published on th february <e> <s> the government will reply as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i must assure the noble baroness that the government will respond to the report as soon as possible but i cannot comment on individual comments ahead of the general response <e>", "<cs> my lords a good deal of attention is already given in some schools to these fields <e> <s> i shall draw the emphasis which the noble baroness would like to place on these subjects to the attention of my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords in congratulating the noble lord on his syntactical skill in phrasing that as a question i should like to say that her majestys government have always been aware of the political dangers of central control of the curriculum but that historically there has been a variation in the degree of central interest in the general questions of the curriculum <e> <s> i think that that is quite right and that a touch to the rudder is needed every now and again when what is taught in schools gets out of tune with what is required of the pupils when they leave <e>", "<cs> my lords it is scarcely for me to answer for the government of france <e>", "<cs> my lords the responsibility for ensuring that religious education is provided in accordance with the terms of the law rests with the local education authorities and with the schools themselves <e> <s> we in this government have made clear the significance which we attach to religious education <e> <s> my right honourable friends the secretaries of state for education and science and for wales have called on local education authorities to keep their provision for religious education under review bearing in mind the requirements of the education act <e>", "<cs> my lords how freely and how widely must be a matter for debate <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord should realise that in a different context his own beliefs might be so described by those to whom he now refers <e>", "<cs> my lords i took it to <e> <s> we come to the per cent <e> <s> in which we have not yet reached <e>", "<cs> my lords perish the thought that i should reply in great detail at an hour which your <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know what his chosen vehicle would be except that it would not be a rolls-royce <e> <s> i can think of many other analogies but he has succeeded in throwing me out of my stride he cannot want any more and so i shall proceed <e> <s> nonetheless we believe that there needs to be a greater involvement of the private sector especially in training and the government have been discussing with the private sector a range of options for increasing its contribution to staff training <e> <s> we have not ruled out the possibility mentioned by noble lords of a voluntary levy but we feel that the best way to proceed is by working with the private sector through its representatives to see how its training potential can be expanded <e> <s> apart from an extension of its own arrangements for basic nurse training if that proves feasible other possibilities are joint arrangements with the national health service post-basic courses and sponsorship of lectures <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought i had reached an elegant conclusion in minutes <e> <s> i am now going to stumble into an untidy finish after <e> <s> if i take the noble lords question aright the gift of ministerial posts if it is in the hands of anybody is not in the hands of under-secretaries of state <e> <s> from the expression on the noble lords face i have obvioulsy misunderstood his question <e> <s> the best thing i can do is to talk to him immediately after this debate and sort it out with him then <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are indeed aware of the importance of technological development and technological education <e> <s> indeed the plans of the university grants committee for student target numbers envisage a positive move in favour of subjects related to technology and science <e>", "<cs> my lords i am tempted to say yes i will bear everything in mind that the noble lord has said in so far as i can recall it <e> <s> i think the salient points to which i should wish to reply in that contribution would be that the government are in fact treating both sectors with a close degree of equality <e> <s> the government are aware of the necessity to preserve excellence in both <e> <s> we already have the ugc for the university sector and we now have the national advisory body for the advanced further education sector <e> <s> we are also aware of the importance of the advancement of knowledge in this country and in-deed in the capacity to turn that knowledge into industrial progress as well as academic progress <e> <s> upon that necessity hinges the vital need to reduce unnecessary expenditure in this country on un-productive things and to get the best possible result for our money in the academic world so that we can develop the industrial base which pays for everything including academic progress <e>", "<cs> my lords first i remind the noble lord that almost every university has some aspect of <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have a precise breakdown beyond the figures given in the white paper <e> <s> if it is available to me i shall write to the noble baroness about that as indeed i will about her projection which i think is a little on the pessimistic side <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> we are committed to doing all we can to reduce the amount of cigarette smoking and hence the death and disease associated with it <e> <s> but there is no clear evidence that a ban on cigarette advertising would lead to such a decline <e> <s> as for discouraging smoking i would remind noble lords that the government are making available over million in the forthcoming financial year for the health education council to spend on anti-smoking measures mainly directed at young people <e>", "<cs> my lords on the specific area of sport sponsorship which is an important area of promotion the main advance is that all media advertising for <e>", "<cs> my lords nonetheless the government must take a position on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord will have observed we are seeking to proceed by agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords as i was at pains to explain a moment ago the backdrop in future will carry in almost every case the governments warning at the expense of the advertiser <e>", "<cs> my lords things are not so simple as the noble baroness supposes <e> <s> if i may use figures to demonstrate in in this country per cent <e> <s> of men smoked cigarettes <e> <s> by that figure was per cent <e> <s> it is very difficult to make comparisons internationally but in norway where advertising was banned in which is what the noble baroness would have us do the percentage of men smoking dropped from per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> over the same period <e> <s> that is the same period almost exactly the same decline a total ban on advertising in one <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not seek to advise anybody how to run their own show <e> <s> i would say however that advertising companies are very anxious to persuade consumers of another brand to transfer to their own <e> <s> that is what a lot of this is about <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are of course in favour of greater employment opportunities throughout the country and welcome any efforts which companies can make to diversify into fields in which they are able to excel <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i am not saying that advertising has no effect <e> <s> what i am saying is that it is doubtful how great is the effect of advertising on consumption as a whole <e> <s> if you look at foreign examples it does not appear to be great <e> <s> it has a considerable effect i am given to understand on which brand people smoke <e> <s> if we can use the battle between the companies as to who shall smoke more of their brand as an opportunity for advertising the fact that people ought to give up smoking as i did when i reached a day i think that that is not inconsistent <e>", "<cs> my lords i will certainly take that to my honourable friend with that responsibility as a practical and sensible suggestion <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has expressed much more elegantly than i could or indeed have one of the elementary factors in this situation <e>", "<cs> my lords if we can reinforce that will-power i think it will be a good thing <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the noble lords first point consideration of the long-term solution of the management problems of local authority higher education is continuing <e> <s> however given the urgent need for a co-ordinated response by the sector to resource constraints and an -year-old population that is due to decline my right honourable friend decided to establish interim machinery to provide the academic advice needed for effective rationalisation in the short term <e> <s> how short that term will be i cannot precisely say <e>", "<cs> my lords the body will not give instructions to anybody it will advise the government and my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords on the first point the university grants committee distributes the resources the government give <e>", "<cs> my lords nurses are free to seek employment wherever they choose <e> <s> being the major employer of nursing staff the national health service is bound to lose some qualified staff to posts abroad <e> <s> the department does not collect information on the number of nurses who leave the national health service to seek employment abroad <e> <s> however the general nursing council for england and wales provide details of the number of nurses who apply for verification of their qualifications to be sent to a registered authority in another country <e> <s> there were of these in the year to march <e> <s> they do not of course include nurses taking up employment in a country which does not require verification of qualifications <e>", "<cs> my lords whether the term is culinary or sporting the government remain of the opinion that the standards are indeed high and welcome the fact that the private sector is beginning to contribute to this <e>", "<cs> indeed my lords the government think that still more can be done in the way of involving the private sector in the training of nurses though in fact a good deal is being done <e> <s> it is not our impression that the standards of remuneration and conditions of service are so very much better in the generality in the private sector than they are in the national health service <e>", "<cs> my lords the private sector is a very small part of the health services <e> <s> the level of trained nursing unemployment is below per cent <e> <s> of the whole <e>", "<cs> my lords the study of the parties opposite is a matter of continuing fascination to me but i would not seek to explain it to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i said that such a scheme had not passed beyond the possibility of being considered <e> <s> the noble lord will be aware that for instance at the royal masonic hospital there is the training of both state registered and state enrolled nurses and at st andrews psychiatric hospital there is training of registered mental nurses so the private sector is not doing nothing <e> <s> i hope as does the noble lord that it will do more <e>", "<cs> my lords the question of pensions in the private sector varies from institution to institution <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said earlier the question of the conditions of service and remuneration of nurses in the private sector is very much a matter for them but i understand that many independent sector establishments and organisations base their pay scales on whitley rates and that in a large number of cases no additional financial payments are made <e> <s> indeed the annual salary received by a qualified nurse in the independent sector can be less than she would receive in the national health service <e> <s> comparisons such as this are difficult to make because of the other terms and conditions of service which might be involved <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that by any stretch of the imagination that is another question <e>", "<cs> my lords we return to the point at which we started that the nurses have freedom to work where they wish to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords if i can give a brief reply to that rather long question the government always have the interests of nurses very close to them and wish to be well informed as to what those interests are <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very much aware of the important role played by married women both at work and in the home <e> <s> currently there are some men single women and about women who are widowed divorced or separated receiving this benefit but to extend it further would cost anything up to million <e>", "<cs> my lords there is some illogicality in what the noble baroness says <e> <s> the people to whom she referred are being exploited by the government only if they are caring for people without being paid <e> <s> this makes it difficult to do the arithmetic that the noble baroness asks me to do <e> <s> i can only reply that it would cost us anything up to million and that is what we appear to be saving <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think anyone supposes that they would all be put into institutions this is the point i am trying to make <e>", "<cs> no my lords i cannot give a precise figure <e> <s> i said that it would be up to million <e> <s> these calculations are always notional to some extent <e> <s> if the noble lord lord avebury wants to know the impact on an individual family he should recall that it is not payable in addition for instance to the supplementary benefit <e> <s> so if a husband was in receipt of an invalidity pension which included the dependency addition for his wife of the familys income would be increased by only pence <e> <s> if the husband received retirement pension which included the dependency addition of the income would be unchanged <e> <s> if the husband was in receipt of supplementary benefit the income would be unchanged if the amount of the supplementary benefit payable before the award of ica was or more <e> <s> in other words the impact on the individual family is often a good deal less than noble lords might at first suspect <e>", "<cs> no my lords the figures are not at variance <e> <s> i can confirm the dependency additions to which the noble baroness has referred <e> <s> i stated the condition of the family in the examples i gave <e> <s> it remains the case that the government would prefer to be able to extend this allowance but that preference must be put in competition with other considerations when resources become available to us to consider those priorities <e> <s> in the meantime benefits for the long-term sick and disabled in the financial year amounted to million which is per cent <e> <s> more in real terms than in <e> <s> i do not think this is a hard-faced government we are simply trying to do the best we can in the order in which resources come to hand <e>", "<cs> my lords i scarcely know how to answer that question <e> <s> we are in a time of changing standards and we are looking at the question in the light of those changing standards <e> <s> if i were to say that it was odd i would appear to be old-fashioned <e> <s> if i were to say that it was entirely normal i would perhaps betray some of my own preconceptions <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the very valuable work which is done by the cystic fibrosis research trust and indeed of the way in which it has attracted non-public funds for that work which is extremely welcome <e> <s> as to the work to which the noble lord has referred i point out that the isolation of the gene is a very difficult matter which has not yet been achieved <e> <s> i would say that the medical research council is aware of the importance of this disease and that the division of inherited metabolic diseases at the clinical research centre of the mrc includes in its forward programme research into biochemical derangement in cystic fibrosis and also the detection of carriers of this disease <e> <s> perhaps i may detain the house a moment longer <e> <s> it is in fact the result of the coincidence of a recessive gene in each parent of a union and when those recessive genes coincide there is a one in four chance that the child resulting will be suffering from cystic fibrosis <e> <s> it is of course a matter for the parents to decide whether they take that chance or not <e>", "<cs> my lords of course genetic counselling admirable as it may be is a different question and i cannot respond to the noble lords probings on that front without notice <e> <s> as to the other question which the noble lord asked i should say that the government do through their departments of health give guidance to the medical research council as to the need for research and that the need for research into genetically determined illness is in fact one of the matters to which they have directed their attention and to which they are responding as i have just said by their work at the centre <e>", "<cs> my lords the voluntary spirit is one of the hallmarks of this nation of which we are all proud and from which we all benefit <e> <s> i should like to endorse what the noble lord has said and what the noble lord lord molloy has implied in this matter that the voluntary agencies do great work in the medical field as well as in other fields <e>", "<cs> my lords prevention whether in medicine or in war is always better than cure <e> <s> it is my belief that this governments policies are far more likely to prevent the disease of war in the world than the policies advocated by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords the incidence of the disease is about one in children <e> <s> an increasing proportion of those children now survive to adult life <e> <s> i cannot tell the noble lord how long into adult life they typically survive <e> <s> as to the degree of success being achieved i think that there are a number of areas which are encouraging <e> <s> i believe that there is an ability to diagnose the disease early in the life of a child <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for showing that we share the same interest in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the first part of the noble earls question is none at least for the present <e> <s> an alternative source of finance has been secured until the end of the next financial year <e> <s> in answer to the second part i can say that i understand that the department is the only centre in the world at present able to separate and estimate the concentration of four forms of vitamin b <e>", "<cs> my lords i can answer for the government but not for the department at the university <e> <s> i cannot answer for the westminster hospital medical school i can only observe that they have given a higher priority to many other functions <e> <s> i understand that this was a considered decision and that it saved them about a year <e> <s> it is not the only place where the work can be done <e> <s> the money does not come directly from government it comes from the university grants committee which sends it to the universities which decide how to distribute it among their schools and then the departments <e>", "<cs> my lords the money which the government propose to spend on the medical research council next year is million which is an increase over the present year <e> <s> the money is not diminishing <e>", "<cs> my lords i will endeavour to bring that into my closing remarks <e> <s> i began that passage with a reference to the performing arts and that reminds me of the other point put by the noble lord lord beaumont of which he gave some advanced warning <e> <s> i think i can reassure him on this by saying that some institutions offer drama as an option within initial teacher training <e> <s> provisional estimates for the admissions suggest that about students entered either postgraduate or undergraduate initial teacher <e>", "<cs> my lords by way of preface to my reply i ought to explain that the provision in the scheme was intended by parliament to apply to those people whose chosen career was either interrupted or deferred involuntarily by service in the armed forces of the crown during the second world war <e> <s> a chosen career can be identified only when a person becomes committed to it and the first hard evidence of such commitment is normally the first job in it <e> <s> however there are occasions when the preparation for a career can be directed only to that career and commitment to a career starts with a preparation for it <e> <s> but you cannot say that of a university teaching career because there is no training which is specific to the career of being a teacher in a university and which cannot be otherwise employed <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in my original answer the scheme is intended to be on all fours with schemes for other people serving in the public service <e> <s> that condition applies to them and was extended to the university teachers last year <e>", "<cs> my lords the distinction between the training of a teacher who takes a certificate of education as it was or a diploma of education and a teacher in a university is that the certificate or diploma is of use to him only in teaching and he has therefore been committed to a career in teaching from the beginning of his training <e> <s> a university teacher with a university degree can apply it in a whole spectrum of other employments <e> <s> that is why there is that distinction <e> <s> as to the question of moving the date by hours that is an interesting proposition which i shall look at <e>", "<cs> indeed my lords but a certificate or diploma of the ability to teach is not as widely useful <e>", "<cs> my lords the same applies to them as applies to teachers <e> <s> in local government it is a qualification for this exemption for public health inspectors to have taken training for the royal sanitary institute diploma <e> <s> it is to those i presume that the noble baroness refers <e> <s> similarly in the national health service specialist training courses for qualification in medicine and dentistry including courses for professions supplementary to medicine clearly qualify people to pursue only those professions <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not answerable for what happens abroad but i am interested in what the noble baroness says <e>", "<cs> my lords i much regret that i could not get the drift of the question that the noble lord was asking me <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> the bill which i bring before your lordships today is rather more than the routine document which social security measures are apt to be <e> <s> it contains two important and beneficial social reforms <e> <s> the first affects payments to people who fall sick and whose sickness prevents them from working <e> <s> the second affects the way in which we give help to those people who need it in order to meet the cost of their housing <e>", "<cs> my lords i was about to touch on that <e> <s> there will be an increase in the workload for local authority staff but not by any means commensurate with the loss of workload by the department <e> <s> at present the department of health and social security can give cash to claimants for them to pay rent and rates to the local authority officials the noble baroness asked about and they have to deal with that <e> <s> there is also a large exercise each year to revise individual rent and rates to help to take account of increases <e> <s> under housing benefit all that goes <e> <s> for the large majority of supplementary benefit claimants authorities will not have to collect rent or rates <e> <s> they will simply rebate them although cash payments will continue to be made to private tenants <e> <s> we recognise that local authorities will need some extra staff to cope with the extra volume of work and the government have promised that these extra administrative costs this is what the noble baroness has been waiting for will be met in full <e> <s> there will nonetheless be overall administrative savings of up to million and as i have said this will be transferred to benefit expenditure <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness is apparently not fully metricated p is in fact s <e>", "<cs> my lords either i have misunderstood the noble baroness lady jeger or she has misunderstood the bill <e> <s> she mentioned the rate at which statutory sick pay was to be calculated <e> <s> has the noble baroness perhaps overlooked clause where the actual figures which are different from those she has just given are set out <e> <s> if that is the case and the noble baroness has not noticed those figures then there is the answer <e> <s> if she has noticed those figures then will she rephrase her question so that my noble friend can answer it properly <e>", "<cs> my lords in the absence of my noble friend lord gowrie i beg to move that the house do approve the draft industrial relations northern ireland order which has been laid before the house under the northern ireland act <e> <s> many in this house will recognise the subject matter of the order which largely enacts the provisions of the employment act in northern ireland <e> <s> it is now a year and a half since we debated the employment bill in this house and noble lords will no doubt be relieved to hear that i intend to be considerably more selective in my comments tonight than it was possible for my noble friend to be on the earlier occasions <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly take note of what my noble friend says and i thank him very kindly for his courteous words of introduction to these responsibilities <e> <s> my honourable friend with particular responsibility for civil defence is already keeping a close eye on things and your lordships may know that the leaflet <e>", "<cs> my lords i would have one reservation in agreeing with my noble friend and that is of course that where the existing civil arrangements differ it is necessary to make the emergency arrangements differ in order to fit that difference <e>", "<cs> my lords i will certainly see that by means other than <e>", "<cs> my lords subject to correction it would be the local authority <e> <s> if i need to elaborate on that my noble friend will i hope allow me to write to her <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that indeed many noble lords will read that valuable report <e>", "<cs> my lords local authorities are required to assist in the planning of provision and can be requested then to assist in the provision itself <e>", "<cs> my lords as the report has been out barely three weeks the noble lord will not expect me to deal in detail with the recommendations within the report <e> <s> however i think it is right to say that the government have on many occasions acknowledged publicly that the prison population is well in excess of available accommodation and we are continuing to encourage the courts to make the fullest possible use of the range of non-custodial alternatives to imprisonment <e> <s> we are also extending the range of options open to the courts both by our proposals in the criminal justice bill and by the introduction of the partial suspension of sentences <e>", "<cs> my lords nevertheless another of the governments acts has been to take steps to reduce the length of sentences <e>", "<cs> my lords it is somewhat early to give a specific reply to the noble and learned lord <e> <s> there is some evidence that courts are following the lead given by the lord chief justice towards shorter sentences and we shall continue to encourage that trend <e>", "<cs> my lords as to the first part of the noble lords question i am obliged to him and indeed my right honourable friend in the foreword to which i have referred has pointed out that the major problems to which her majestys chief inspector refers have been decades in the making and cannot of course be solved overnight <e> <s> the noble lord asked about interim measures <e> <s> i should point out to your <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are of course aware of the difference in policies and have taken what they believe to be the right course <e> <s> they do not believe they should dictate matters of this kind to the courts when the courts are in a better position to make judgments in individual cases <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said earlier i do not think that i ought to reply to specific recommendations made in a report which was published only i think days ago <e> <s> i think my right honourable friend should be given credit and perhaps your lordships would agree not only for having set up this inspectorate but also for ensuring that its reports are published since he was thereby as it were cutting a rod for his own back and had some idea as to who would be using it to beat him <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise the importance of my noble friends question and i shall give her the answer in writing <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are well aware of the importance of the social aspects of offending and i can assure him that these are taken on board <e> <s> i do not want to pursue that further it is a little wide of the question <e> <s> but since we are dealing with the number of people in prisons i would think it right to remind your lordships that the government are also anxious that police forces should be kept up to the highest strength and that the rate of detection should be as high as possible <e> <s> your lordships will also realise that resources used in this direction call for a greater need for resources in the direction in which the noble lord lord brockway wants them to be spent <e>", "<cs> my lords as to which prisoners should not be in prison that is a matter which would have to be investigated case by case <e> <s> as to the specific figure put in the report i must again say that i do not wish to anticipate anything my right honourable friend may say when he has had proper time which he has not yet had to consider the contents of the report <e>", "<cs> my lords the appropriate period of delay is that necessary to digest information and to apply it correctly <e> <s> i was asked in the question on the order paper about a report which was published days ago <e> <s> i was not asked about the previous report <e> <s> if the noble baroness wishes to put down a question i shall be happy to answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that that is a different question <e>", "<cs> my lords i of course have the greatest respect for the views of the noble lord lord robertson on this subject and i understand fully the purpose of his amendment but for a number of reasons i would advise your lordships to consider its implications very carefully indeed before agreeing to accept it <e> <s> apart from a reservation about a reference to the pharmacy and poisons act which has in fact been repealed the government have two main reservations about the desirability of including this amendment in my noble friends bill <e>", "<cs> my lords this house takes a very considerable interest in questions of broadcasting policy and i am very much aware of the enormous concentration of experience and authority represented on the short list of speakers for this afternoon <e> <s> for the <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has amply demonstrated not only the acuteness of his hearing but also the fact that there are some games that one can play without any playing fields at all <e> <s> i think i should point out to the noble lord that it does not always follow that an abandoned school has its playing field in the area where playing space is most needed and the best thing may be to sell that and buy another one in a better place <e> <s> the only people who can decide that are the local authority not central government <e> <s> as to the need for an actual reduction in the number of schools i think i should remind the noble lord that in his own part of the country and indeed all over the country it is considerable <e> <s> the department carried out a study of school buildings which was published in <e> <s> that resulted in an estimate that by there would be over million primary and secondary school places surplus to requirement <e> <s> we do not of course intend to close all of them but the target is million <e>", "<cs> my lords maybe the noble lords hearing is not as good as i thought it was <e> <s> i said primary and secondary schools <e>", "<cs> my lords i have great sympathy with the emotional appeal of what my noble friend has said but the fact remains that there are some open spaces that are not much use <e> <s> one of the virtues of the new regulations which the department has brought out is that the only area which will count towards a minimum play area for a school is one which can be used for team games and which can be expected to be usable for seven hours a week <e> <s> that does not mean that there will not be flower beds coppices and so on but it does mean that all the play space that is available is usable <e> <s> when that sort of space becomes available no doubt there will be a very strong case for its retention for public use <e> <s> but the people who can determine whether it is the best place for public use are not central government nor the department of education but the local authority <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the noble lords difficulty <e> <s> i can tell him that there is statutory provision for local authorities to give discretionary rate relief in respect of charitable bodies <e> <s> if the noble lord will bear with me i shall try to give him more particular information in writing <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not remind the noble baroness of the celebrated london case which took place under the jurisdiction of the previous administration <e> <s> i will merely say that where there is a shortfall in the requirement of the ratio of space to people the local authority is under an obligation to meet that requirement <e> <s> and if it has surplus school playing fields available to it that is a means by which it can do it <e> <s> it should not be done by central government <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to repeat a statement being made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for education and science about the future of the schools council for curriculum and examinations <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness and to the noble lord for their reception of this statement more so perhaps to the noble lord than to the noble baroness <e> <s> i note that they both approached it with a certain reservation which is understandable because it is a new document <e> <s> i can confirm to the noble baroness that this is in fact an occasion on which parliament is the first to know the intention of the government and the discussion will take place in the light of the statement which has been made this afternoon in both houses <e> <s> she asked about the composition of the examination council <e> <s> this body it is envisaged would be formed of about to people drawn from both within and outside education appointed in a personal capacity and not paid of good standing in their fields and reflecting a broad spectrum of knowledge and experience <e>", "<cs> my lords i am also grateful to the noble lord for his reception of this statement <e> <s> he asks whether it was necessary to carry out such a drastic simplification so soon <e> <s> i think it might be worth saying that one of the anomalies of the schools council is that it was not actually a council at all <e> <s> it was made up of a finance and priorities committee with members a professional committee with members and a convocation with members <e> <s> that brings it to <e>

education liaison group and a world of work liaison group bringing the total number of committee posts up to <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness knows as well as i do from the note that the people will be appointed after discussion and at this stage therefore <e>", "<cs> my lords this is something which is under consideration <e> <s> i could not now tell the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords the proposals that the government have where they are fairly clear in our minds are proposals for discussions with local authorities and other interested bodies <e> <s> i would expect the relationship to develop in the light of those discussions <e> <s> they do relate to each other but i would remind your lordships that we are talking about curriculum development and not curriculum policy <e> <s> that may seem a subtle distinction but it alters somewhat the importance of the curricular aspect of the examination function <e> <s> both bodies will work to my right honourable friend <e> <s> my right honourable friend is very well seized of the interrelationship between these two aspects of the work of the current council <e> <s> it is one of the criticisms that one hears of the existing schools council that this relationship is not sufficiently closely reflected in its current workings <e> <s> i think the noble lord may be assured that this important aspect will not be lost sight of <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be happy to take to both my right honourable friends the secretary of state for education and science and the secretary of state for wales the concern which the noble lord has put before the house <e> <s> the secretary of state for wales was a party to all these arrangements and the document carries his approval as it does that of my right honourable friend <e> <s> i would say that this house and the government are aware of the distinctness of welsh culture and the tenacity with which certain members of this house feel it necessary to defend it <e> <s> at the same time we are seized of the strength which can derive from single institutions covering both the kingdom and the principality if the welsh ingredient is preserved therein <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> the scottish system appears to bring benefit to the scots i believe sufficient for it not to be added to by their being brought into the english system <e> <s> i should not like this to be thought of as an english system because it is also a system which embraces the people of wales is it not <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so the noble lord behind me has laid a curates egg <e> <s> i agree with him that a new beginning is a welcome occasion <e> <s> i must say that i do not share his anxieties about the -plus which we debated with such closeness even under the last government <e> <s> i think it is very agreeable that having got out of the morass then proposed we have arrived at something for which there can be general support <e> <s> the other factor which the noble lord will find strengthens his argument is that when it was proposed within the committee on education science and the arts in the other place that the schools council should be abolished that proposal was rejected by one vote only <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a possibility embraced within general policy <e> <s> i cannot permit the noble lord to pin me down more closely <e> <s> it is one of the things that will be discussed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged for that thought <e> <s> it has been on our minds to see and it is difficult to say this without appearing to diminish the stature of education that the product is something which suits the consumer <e> <s> otherwise children of talent will find that because their talents have not been developed in the right direction they cannot be employed as they should <e> <s> i shall put that before my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with very great interest and very great profit to this debate <e> <s> i am as are the rest of your lordships most grateful to the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale for giving the house an opportunity to discuss a subject which is not often aired in such a considered and rational a manner <e>

make as i grow closer to his roots <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged to the noble lord <e> <s> what i shall be doing very shortly is reading the record of this debate and when i do so i shall take that point very much on board <e>", "<cs> my lords circumstances change through history and governments have to be free to change the response according to the changes in the circumstances <e> <s> this sort of provision is kept continually under review and i therefore cannot answer the noble lords question more precisely than i have done <e>", "<cs> my lords the question was first what the sentencing powers would be and secondly who would have to discharge the judicial function under circumstances in which normal arrangements could perhaps not continue <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to a hypothetical question is itself always hypothetical <e> <s> whether it is also otiose i cannot say <e>", "<cs> my lords as i think i made clear the government necessarily have draft contingency plans to meet circumstances as they arise <e> <s> but the circumstances are very varied and so therefore are the plans <e>", "<cs> my lords as i sought to make clear the contingencies are so varied that i cannot specify what they may contain in every case <e>", "<cs> my lords as i recall the letter it referred to the circular es which was drafted and circulated by the previous administration and which this government decided should be made public <e> <s> it was to that the noble lord referred <e> <s> those provisions are kept under review <e>", "<cs> my lords i too wish to congratulate my noble friend for the very determined way in which she has piloted her bill through its stages in your lordships house <e> <s> although i was not present for the earlier stages the reports of those debates are of great interest and her reference to the tranquil waters of this house left me surprised by the notable ripples which we have encountered since she sat down <e> <s> the discussions we have had on this complex and emotive subject have been well-informed and useful <e>", "<cs> my lords the borehole had no connection with any radioactive waste disposal programme or mineral resources programme <e> <s> it was undertaken entirely for scientific purposes in the geological field <e> <s> i understand that the only thing that has been tipped down it so far is concrete in order to seal it and it will not be used for anything else in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding is that at the last such election the republic of ireland did not have the system to which the noble baroness refers and that denmark and belgium did so only for those out of the country temporarily <e> <s> and in the first direct elections in greece in only those resident in greece were entitled to vote <e> <s> so we are not entirely alone in this <e>", "<cs> my lords her majestys government are aware of this concern and indeed of the fact that there may be about united kingdom citizens living in other member states <e> <s> this matter is under review <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact of their having lived so long abroad is one of the difficulties in devising a system to allow them to vote in a particular constituency in the country of their nationality <e> <s> the french as i think my noble friend has inferred do have a system for this but i understand that their nationals can elect for which constituency they will vote and this lends itself to fraud and a good deal of dubiousness about the votes cast <e>", "<cs> my lords i take note of what my noble friend says <e> <s> my experience of problems is that on the whole they do not go away <e>", "<cs> my lords the matter as i say is under review <e> <s> what my noble friend says will be taken careful note of and indeed anything else she likes to say to me will he taken on board <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that my noble friend would like those who have run away from the difficulties in this country to be pursued by them

registration will involve an inspection by her majestys inspectorate of schools covering both the premises used and the education provided <e>", "<cs> my lords i can confirm that the premises are not an embassy <e> <s> as to the inspection by her majestys inspectorate which is necessary for the registration of the school that will be of the premises of the school and will be to establish whether

itself such a collective self-denying ordinance to reach this point so far ahead of the predetermined length of a short debate <e> <s> i must congratulate your lordships and consider whether i shall do more to inspire jealousy by exploiting the extra time by going to a greater length myself or risk hostility by not replying to every point made in the debate <e> <s> in fact it will not be possible for me to reply to every point raised in the debate for a number of reasons <e> <s> one is that i cannot consider all the <e>", "<cs> my lords when a matter is put forward for discussion there is little point in doing that unless attention is paid to the criticisms or endorsements of the policy which arise as a result of the discussion <e> <s> what i have said is that the government have considered the response and in the light of the response have changed their mind and that is what a prudent person should do in my view <e> <s> it is by increasing the flexibility of the courts in the application of the sentencing principles outlined by the lord chief justice that the government believe they can most effectively support the movement towards shorter sentences in appropriate cases <e> <s> that is why they have implemented section of the criminal law act which provides for the partial suspension of prison sentences <e> <s> the great advantage which we see in this provision is that it allows the courts greater flexibility to fix at their own discretion the period of custody within the overall sentence length <e> <s> it is my belief that this provision will prove effective in bringing about a reduction in the prison population <e> <s> the criminal justice bill will shortly come before your lordships house <e> <s> the noble earl lord longford asked for legislation he will then have an opportunity to <e>", "<cs> my lords as to northern ireland it is generally agreed that the half remission scheme combined with conditional release which operates in northern ireland has been a success <e> <s> but that scheme is a substitute for parole which does not operate in northern ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords i dare say the noble lord knows it but that would not be the impression gathered by those reading this debate if we do not state it <e> <s> i doubt if we could rely on the same public acceptance of the scheme at least as an alternative to the consideration given to cases prior to release and the subsequent supervision arrangements under the parole scheme in the wider context of our criminal justice system <e> <s> moreover the liability to recall under the scheme lasts for longer than does parole <e> <s> consequently the longer-term reduction in the prison population would be very much smaller than a straightforward increase in remission and might be less than and even such an estimate is subject to the same degree of uncertainty as those for increased remission because of doubts about the likely reaction of the courts to any scheme which made a mandatory cut in effective sentence lengths <e>", "<cs> my lords i tried to make it clear that the courts appeared to me to he at one with the government in seeking not to send people to prison if it is possible not to do so <e> <s> one way of keeping people out of prison is to make use of the probation service <e>", "<cs> my lords of course the government deplore any attempt to confuse the electorate at an election and agree that candidatures whose purpose is simply to do so and to distract attention from <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed this might be a way of discouraging frivolous candidates and my right honourable friend the home secretary is reviewing that possibility together with that of increasing the level of the deposit which has remained at since it was introduced in <e> <s> i am informed that that is equivalent to at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords our experience in recent years is that this rarely if ever happens <e> <s> i would remind the noble baroness that the weapon we are discussing is not really suitable to the sort of purposes for which the normal criminal wants to use such a weapon <e> <s> i accept that one might expect them to be a source of illicit weapons but on the other hand they are the livelihood of their owners and their owners therefore keep considerable care of them <e>", "<cs> my lords the exemption extends only to weapons of what we would call calibre that is below <e> <s> the home office recommendation is that only short ammunition should be used which has approximately half the carrying range of the long which i do not doubt my noble friend uses from time to time at home <e> <s> as to the sale the purchaser has to prove his eligibility for the exemption usually by showing that he is a member of the showmens guild <e> <s> nobody else is likely therefore to profit from that exemption <e>", "<cs> my lords as to the registration of numbers i regret i shall have to write to my noble friend <e> <s> as to restraints on the weapons typically yes they are restrained <e> <s> their use is also regulated by local authority legislation and is subject to home office guidance published in <e> <s> the effect of this is that in almost every case there is protection for the public at every point in front of the firing position and it is impossible to swing the weapon behind it <e>", "<cs> my lords the exemption extends as i have said only to <e>", "<cs> my lords the maximum of should be seen in the context of the fact that is generally speaking the maximum fine that magistrates can exact for any offence and therefore the maximum must be seen in relation to that and not destroy the deterrent effect of other penalties <e> <s> as to a greater deterrent i know that the national farmers union has considered a three-year ban on straw burning rather in the manner of the loss of a licence <e> <s> that would be given further consideration not least by my noble friend lord ferrers if circumstances showed that that was necessary but that is by no means certain <e>", "<cs> my lords if they are also disposed of as quickly we shall be doing very well indeed <e> <s> on the question of the requirements for people to clear up afterwards i think the answer must be that if the litter constitutes a hazard to health then of course it would be a condition because it would be a breach endangering the health of the public <e> <s> if on the other hand it is an offence to aesthetic sensibilities i am afraid i shall have to disappoint the noble baroness <e> <s> i think your lordships have welcomed this work which had been done before i became responsible for the bill and i shall pass on that welcome <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the intention of the amendment is clear <e> <s> your lordships have been fulsome in your thanks but i am afraid not quite fulsome enough for me to get the detailed answers <e>", "<cs> my lords we do indeed still think that it would be helpful if the home office were to supply local authorities as part of the guidance which will be issued on the coming into force of the bill with a draft notice which they could use or adopt as they think fit <e> <s> the noble lord has been kind enough to say that this suggestion satisfies him and i therefore hope that he will not feel it necessary to press his amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i only wanted to say that i did not take part in an earlier stage <e> <s> i think that the noble earl is referring to my noble friend lord belstead <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendments to which in the absence of my noble friend lord nugent the noble earl lord halsbury has spoken are i believe among the most important which we shall have to consider today <e> <s> they propose a substantial extension of the scope of schedule and one which i believe the house would be wise to consider very carefully <e>", "<cs> my lords i suppose that considerations of irregularities in flight could scarcely come from a less or should i say more <e> <s> appropriate source than my noble friend lord hawke who i am afraid is ahead of us in his imagination of what these people might get up to <e> <s> indeed i suppose hovercraft might ply their trade illicitly too once these people read my noble friends remarks in <e>", "<cs> my noble friend is right my lords and as i was rather long-windedly saying we are obliged to him for the point he has made which i shall consider carefully between now and third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords i suppose that the phrase might have something of the colloquial about it no doubt a sex establishment is a considerable carry on in some terms <e> <s> however i take the noble baronesss point <e> <s> she will accept that i cannot give her anything at this stage but i shall look at the point before third reading <e> <s> i hope that her approval of the amendment does not depend on any immediate response from me <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl lord halsbury has used the word bogus he has used the word humbug he has used the word nonsense and he has used the term roundabout and he has referred them all to her majestys government and myself <e> <s> i take what he says in good part but i must tell him that when he refers to instinct and reason i think that perhaps he has the measure of the government wrong <e> <s> i think that by instinct one always prefers the simple and the obvious and what he proposes is indeed simple and obvious but reason i am afraid upon analysis dictates that this is wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords i note with a wry smile that my brief begins i am grateful to my noble friend lord nugent for explaining so clearly the purpose of the interesting amendment which he has tabled <e> <s> i should like to congratulate his noble friend on the sterling work that he has done in introducing this interesting amendment and perhaps i might be forgiven for being a little brief because he did not mention a number of matters that my noble friend lord nugent might have brought forward <e> <s> i trust that that will not be exploited to my disadvantage after i have sat down <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may exercise on lord robertsons behalf the right of reply i am glad that this amendment has been welcomed by the house <e> <s> secondly to the noble lord lord harris if he looks down the marshalled list he will find that the fine is the same as that for a breach of conditions of licence which will become under a later amendment <e> <s> it may be that at that point he would like to comment on the relative magnitude of penalties in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords in my brief time with this bill i have concentrated on the bill and i do not have a table of comparisons in my mind i regret to say <e> <s> i shall have to write to the noble lord <e> <s> if i find discrepancies perhaps we can discuss them at a later stage <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether the house will bear with me for yet a third time <e> <s> i shall write to the noble baroness at the same time as i write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords an amendment in identical terms was tabled by my noble friend lord nugent at committee stage <e> <s> my noble friend lord belstead explained then that the government considered that the proposed amendment was unnecessary <e> <s> he advised the committee that it was open to local authorities to make whatever arrangements they chose for regulating the conduct of hearings and for publicising the arrangements and that there was no need of a formal rule-making power <e> <s> we have discussed this matter subsequently <e> <s> i do not think in truth that we have been able to carry it very much farther forward although it was said that the government would be willing to draw to the attention of local authorities their implicit powers in this matter and to do so in a circular <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend lord nugent has reminded your lordships the question of what provision should be made in schedule for the charging of fees was discussed in committee <e> <s> paragraph of the schedule enables a local authority to charge such reasonable fee as it may determine in <e>", "<cs> my lords i am anxious not to turn this into a committee stage <e> <s> i have spoken my piece already <e> <s> i have advanced the cogent reason that the provisions in the bill already allow this money to be charged <e> <s> but in view of my noble friends anxiety i look forward to a further agreeable conversation with him between now and the next stage <e> <s> i would not <e>", "<cs> my lords first on the amendment itself may i say that despite the very high level of fines already set in the bill there has been understandable concern both in your lordships house and another place that the proposed maximum penalty might still not prove a sufficient deterrent bearing in mind the vast sums of money that are to be made from the commercial exploitation of pornography <e> <s> there was some support in another place for the view which i believe is shared by westminster city council and the london boroughs association that the penalty should be increased to <e> <s> my noble friend echoed this at the committee stage as did the noble baroness lady birk <e> <s> the government accordingly undertook to consider the matter again <e> <s> clearly when we are venturing on to new ground without any real precedents to guide us the question of an appropriate penalty for these offences is very much a matter of judgment <e> <s> on the one hand it must be sufficiently large to deter and punish <e> <s> on the other it must bear some reasonable and defensible relationship to the general level of penalties particularly bearing in mind the mode of trial for these offences <e>", "<cs> my lords this is one of those rare and agreeable occasions when i am able to be persuaded by my noble friend <e> <s> indeed it is one of those even rarer and equally agreeable occasions when i am persuaded by the noble baroness lady birk <e> <s> i

schedule and in fact elsewhere as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for her reception of this <e> <s> i take note of what the noble lord lord leatherland says <e> <s> unfortunately he and i find ourselves in a diminishing minority of ordinary people or otherwise who subsist only on feet and inches <e> <s> this statute will be on the books for many years <e> <s> i take note of what he has said but i do not think this is the occasion to debate metrication <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend finds me in something of a difficult position <e> <s> i am very ready indeed to join with my noble friend lord belstead in the sympathy which he expressed with the intention behind this clause when it was moved by my noble friend during the committee stage <e> <s> however i am bound to say that the government are not yet convinced any more than they were in march that the amendment is necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords i am in the difficulty that i have fired the one shot that i am allowed at report stage <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble baroness will permit me i am reminded that with the leave of the house the minister may speak more than once <e> <s> if the noble baroness wishes to bring forward her amendment now i shall try to put forward my side to her argument at the same stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the noble baroness can move it just yet because we have not reached that part of the bill though it is agreeable to see her enthusiasm in this cause with which i have some sympathy <e> <s> but i am not really certain that there is an exceptional general need to establish a criminal offence of trespass on educational premises in particular in addition to the general civil remedy of trespass which already exists <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> if it appears in discussion with the people principally concerned and if the government are convinced as they are not now that the use of a criminal procedure would bring about the results which my noble friend wants and if they can be satisfied that this can be done with adequate protection of the rights and interests of the governors of voluntary schools then of course we should be very happy to do so <e> <s> it depends on the government being convinced on those two matters of which the latter may take a little longer than the former which is why i do not want to give an undertaking at this stage to do anything at a later stage of this bill though of course if that proved possible i should be happy to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to commit myself to doing something half-baked on third reading <e> <s> legislation is always a technical matter and very finicky to work out <e> <s> it must be worked out in consultation with the people whom it affects and that includes my noble friends friends as well as the friends of the noble baroness lady david <e> <s> we have the best intentions if we are persuaded as a result of these conversations that something should be done to do it as soon as we can but i cannot undertake with the present pressures on parliamentary time that the time between now and third reading will suffice to do this <e> <s>

accommodating <e> <s> my noble friend lord belstead explained the governments objections to extending the exemptions from clause when a similar amendment was considered at the committee stage moved by the noble earl lord halsbury and supported by the noble lord lord airedale <e> <s> the present amendment is narrower in scope in that it would exempt only physiotherapists who are members of the chartered society of physiotherapy and does not refer to members of the other professions supplementary to medicine <e>", "<cs> i am always sympathetic to the noble baroness my lords but of course that never influences my judgment <e> <s> on the previous amendment we were discussing a process involving the puncturing of the skin where hygienic standards were of critical importance because of the danger of introducing infection subcutaneously <e> <s> the hazards in sun-tanning are quite different and in many ways less dramatic although i know stories of people who have suffered from the improper use of sun lamps perhaps falling asleep underneath them for an excessive length of time <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i would say that i do not think it is more simple or more direct because all one is doing is deferring the solution of the problem from one central organisation which i have described to all authorities which would be entitled to make by-laws <e> <s> they would have to create their own guidelines or criteria in order to implement their by-laws or licensing system <e> <s> it might be that uniformity is not necessary in this matter but it is at least desirable and to do what the amendment proposes would simply be to multiply the work <e>", "<cs> my lords i have intervened twice in this debate which is testing the patience of your lordships and since the idea of registration is not mine but that of the noble baroness i think that it would be for her to reply to the question <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i can give a satisfactory air of conviction to any reply that i give to the noble lord and the noble baroness <e> <s> i hope your lordships will be content with the amendment <e> <s> i will write to the noble lord and to the noble baroness to elucidate the points they have raised and of course they will be able to come back at me if they are not content <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i should repeat that the only purpose of this amendment is to exempt as had always been the intention the dairyman who sells on his round other foods as well as milk and cream <e> <s> he will not have to be registered under clause <e> <s> what exactly the noble baroness meant by protection i am not certain but the intention is not to interfere with that and i think that that is what the noble baroness would wish to be told <e>", "<cs>

lady ewart-biggs the succinctness of the noble lord lord davies of leek and the lucidity of the noble baroness the government are still not persuaded that what they are seeking to do can be achieved by what they propose <e>", "<cs> my lords in looking at this amendment the first reservation which one is bound to have is that of enforceability <e> <s> i take the point that the noble baroness made in her closing paragraph that there is an analogy with the public house <e> <s> i do not suppose that she is a regular frequenter of either sort of establishment but the public house has a lockable and narrow door and the amusement arcade is wide open at one end and usually at the other <e> <s> even if there were a barrier it would need to be constantly staffed both to ensure that unaccompanied under s did not get past it and to establish that adults accompanying under s were parents or <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is right in attributing to chief officers of police the duty of recruitment and the government encourage them vigorously to do so <e> <s> i should put this in context by saying that the decline in number in the last few years which i illustrated has been going on for no less than years <e> <s> last years drop of was the lowest in the whole of that period <e> <s> in part it was caused deliberately by chief constables who are successfully creating a younger and more effective reserve police force <e> <s> by per cent <e> <s> of all specials were regularly on duty <e> <s> that compares with per cent <e> <s> in <e> <s> i am also happy to add that in some hard-pressed metropolitan counties the total number of special constables is actually increasing <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot answer for earlier years but the efforts of the present government are turning the tide with the result that in the most hard-pressed areas the numbers are going up the average age of the force is coming down and more special constables are more effectively on the beat <e> <s> things are better now than they were some years ago <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend lord renton who asked the question says in his publication <e>", "<cs> my lords a police advisory board working party report on the special constabulary which was circulated to forces last summer reminded chief constables of their discretion to retain special constables for up to five years beyond the normal retirement age of which i hope my other noble friend will regard as years of sufficient maturity to bring experience to the force <e> <s> the report suggested that chief constables might wish to exercise this discretion to retain fit and able special constables <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> the criteria are stringent though slightly less stringent than those for admission to the regular constabulary <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that that is a matter for universal regret in this particular case but in many others it would be a matter for jubilation <e>", "<cs> yes my lords we are taking steps in this direction <e> <s> a home office study group is at present looking at ways of encouraging more involvement of ethnic minority communities in police-related activities such as that of the special constabulary <e> <s> i do not think it should be restricted to that area alone <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i would particularly remembering that they are fully operative members of the civilian community and do not in fact get paid <e> <s> although they are reimbursed for expenses they do not get paid for their work <e> <s> they therefore combine the best british traditions of

undertake to take the noble lords representations to my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i have indeed received a letter from my noble friend in the same terms some of which the noble baroness has read out with i presume his knowledge <e> <s> i have to say that there were exchanges between the association of county councils my department and the department of education and science after the committee stage but the tally of correspondence that i have been given does not entirely accord with that which my noble friend describes <e> <s> i feel it really would be tedious if i were to give the tally i think i ought to write to my noble friend as they seem to diverge at the point when they become telephonic <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to congratulate my noble friend

to his substantive supplementary question i am aware of the provisions of the act and indeed the civil defence general regulations under which the requirement to which he referred exists <e> <s> i can tell him that all local authorities are presently complying with their obligation under the civil defence act <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not accept that the noble lords apocalyptic vision is the only interpretation of a possible international confrontation <e> <s> furthermore the civil defence services are required to act in conventional emergencies as well as in nuclear emergencies my noble friends question was addressed to both <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not certain of exactly what the noble lord was asking me <e> <s> if he was asking me whether i view the escalation of the present conflict to a nuclear level as likely i would say god willing i do not <e> <s> if he was asking whether i rested that expectation upon the scientific press the answer is that i do not do that either

that can be envisaged will wipe everybody out at a blow <e> <s> no scenario that i know of suggests that there will be no <e>", "<cs> my lords no possibility should be entirely ignored <e> <s> i think that the best thing that i can say to reassure my noble friend is that it is intended to increase national civil defence expenditure by about per cent <e> <s> to million annually by and local authority expenditure is we hope to be doubled <e>", "<cs> my lords even if my term of office were to last as long as the noble lords life and i hope for his sake that it does not i could not give such a guarantee <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble friend lord morris for that late and lucid support <e> <s> if i can briefly try and allay your lordships fears i would first thank my noble friend lord nugent of guildford for his hesitant gratitude <e> <s> i would then reply taking your lordships out of order to the noble baroness lady birk with regard to the danger which she foresees <e> <s> the purpose in amending both schedules is simply that the wording shall be the same so that an interpretation of the wording in one shall not automatically cast a question on the same interpretation being applied to the other <e> <s> that is why i am saying that the one schedule follows the other and it is the principal amendment that i address myself to which deals with the sex shops and the licensing thereof <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may start at the end of the oration of the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby by saying that i shall certainly recall that he has voluntarily restricted himself to seconds on third reading on this subject <e> <s> as to the rest of what he says i do not want to embark on a philosophical <e>", "<cs> my lords i quite sympathise with my noble friends desire to see that the local authorities have every recourse in any legal contest that is open to those with whom they are contending and i am happy to reassure him that there is not the slightest doubt that the present wording provides for appeals to the crown court by both applicants and local authorities <e> <s> it carries no implication whatsoever in contrast to provisions which are sometimes found in other legislation that the right of appeal is restricted to one party in our view it simply provides a right of appeal to the party which has lost <e>", "<cs> my lords i

offences described in section and possibly also section of the highways act <e> <s> the structure would be liable to removal under sections and of that act <e> <s> this person would simply be trading

acknowledge the considerable efforts that members of all sides of the house have put into perfecting a piece of legislation of some importance and of some variety <e> <s> of course one must

piece of legislation is regarded by parliamentarians as a <e>", "<cs> my lords the government do not think that matters of constitutional importance ought to be decided in response to short-term political developments <e> <s> as to a review i have to remind my noble friend of the very crowded parliamentary timetable before your lordships and i cannot encourage him to expect any early review

vote at dail elections and we have no reason to believe that this has changed <e> <s> under those circumstances i feel that my noble friends question is answered <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords question is so hypothetical that i cannot answer that either <e> <s> i regret that questions about the return to their native country of citizens of other countries do not bear on the privileges if

of the irish republic and not to anything else <e>", "<cs> my lords that is always a good objective <e>", "<cs> my lords assistance is already available from government funds to those immigrants who have failed to settle here and genuinely wish to return permanently overseas but lack the means <e> <s> the assistance is limited to the payment of fares and incidental expenses <e> <s> resettlement

friend has described <e> <s> but i think my noble friend should recall that about half the ethnic minority population of this country have this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure my noble friend asked his question from the best of motives <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> i bring this important measure before your lordships house for the first time in the wake as it were of two highly relevant debates <e> <s> the first was introduced by my noble friend lord renton and dealt with law and order <e> <s> the second was introduced by the noble earl lord longford and dealt with the prison system <e> <s> each issue is a matter of very real concern <e> <s> on the one hand there is the concern that private citizens shall be able to live at peace protected from criminality by the police and the law <e> <s> on the other there is the concern no less real that the criminals who are apprehended for the protection of those citizens shall serve out their time in conditions that are acceptable by humane modern standards <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble earl will bear with me i believe that he is speaking later and i am moving into my peroration i shall answer him when i reply to the debate <e> <s> this is an important and a substantial bill <e> <s> it reflects the contemporary view of sentencing policy that has been evolved by the judiciary and endorsed by her majestys government <e> <s> it will provide the means by which the courts will be able to award a much wider range of sentences to have more frequent and more precise recourse to non-custodial disposals and hence to place perhaps somewhat reduced demands upon the resources of the prison service <e> <s> it is a fitting answer to some of the points raised in our two earlier debates and for this reason as well as for the merits of its other lesser but still important provisions i commend it to your lordships <e> <s> my lords i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords after the practised performances of the noble lords who preceded me we come to the inevitable patchwork with which one must reply to the unforeseen questions which the debate has provided <e> <s> your lordships have asked many questions and i shall endeavour to reply to as many as i can <e> <s> as this is the beginning of the passage of a bill through the house and not just an unstarred question i feel that perhaps i may be constrained to speak rather longer than i should wish because of the number of questions asked but inevitably some will not be replied to and i shall have to write to your lordships on those <e>", "<cs> my lords that is the shortest notice i have had of any of the noble baronesss questions this evening <e> <s> i shall have to consider that <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord should feel flattered that i take so much care to persuade him that our view is right <e> <s> the new powers which the bill will give to the courts will not i think the noble and learned lord said reverse the trend towards greater use of custody for young offenders <e> <s> in particular he voiced the fears which have been expressed about the three-week detention centre minimum <e> <s> it is important to distinguish the absolute increase in the number of custodial sentences imposed on young offenders from an increase in the proportionate use of custodial sentences <e> <s> the increase in the number of young offenders dealt with by the courts has led to an increase in the number of young offenders given custodial sentences but for to -year-olds that is for young adults the courts have not increased the proportionate use of custody to any significant extent <e> <s> in other words the courts have not shown signs of wanting to increase custody <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to encapsulate this into a miniature debate especially with one of my noble friends behind me <e> <s> i would say that where it is a parent the fine bites on the person responsible and where it is the local authority the fine does not bite on the person responsible <e> <s> i will look carefully at what my noble friend has said but it appears that the impact would not be what she would hope <e> <s> i was worried to hear of an incidence of bare discipline in an attendance centre to which he referred <e> <s> strict discipline is something at which the police are generally pretty good <e> <s> it is usually the police who run the attendance centres <e> <s> there is no reason why the need to provide a constructive regime at an attendance centre should involve any slackening of discipline <e> <s> it sounds as though the incident cited by my noble friend is an exceptional slip <e> <s> i will follow it up if my noble friend will let me have the details later <e> <s> on the question of compensation for wrongful imprisonment i have to tell the noble and learned lord lord gardiner that the justice report is still at the printers and it is not for me to comment on it until it has been received and published <e> <s> the government are aware of article of the united nations covenant on civil and political rights which this country ratified in <e> <s> although the united kingdom does not have a statutory right to compensation i feel that we are not in breach of that provision because as the noble and learned lord reminded the house as arrangements to make some such compensation do exist <e> <s> my right honourable friend the home secretary may make an <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware of that <e> <s> we are looking into this closely and there is at present no ready answer to the problem <e> <s> where you have people intent on setting fire to materials and themselves it is rash to have something which burns so readily as does straw when you often have to break down doors to get in and the doors are strong <e> <s> we have taken steps to see that the prison staff have smoke protection hoods so that it is easier for them to get out and get prisoners out before the damage is fatal <e> <s> it would be difficult otherwise <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend from immediately behind me has not merely plied me with hostile criticism during her speech so i

friends will not forgive me <e> <s> finally to add insult to injury she has stolen the quotation with which i was going to conclude my speech <e> <s> it is indeed by their fruits that they shall be known <e>", "<cs> my lords the footsteps of the seven out of nine do lead in slightly divergent directions and will have to be brought back to the same path when the council of ministers agrees <e> <s> when the council of ministers agrees it will have been a waste of parliamentary time if we spend time now legislating upon something which immediately we have to undo and replace with something else <e>", "<cs> my lords as to the process by which we reach agreement within this country i should not like to commit the government <e> <s> however the noble lord will have noticed the strength of feeling among my noble friends <e> <s> i agree that it is important that we should get it right and that it would be a mistake to legislate twice upon it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am tempted to follow my <e>", "<cs> my lords with the greatest respect to the noble lord i am not confident that there is quite such a discrepancy between what binds our own citizens and that which relates to the citizens of other countries <e> <s> our own citizens can vote when abroad in exactly the same way in a european election as they can in a general parliamentary election <e> <s> i see that the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his patient exposition of his very impatient feelings <e> <s> as to the ability of residents in other countries who are citizens of this country to affect the tide of opinion in this country about affairs which relate as to nine parts to ten to other countries i would not wish to take issue with him <e> <s> however the government are aware that there is a desire for a movement in this direction <e> <s> i undertake to bring the strong feelings of my noble friends to the attention of my right honourable friend but i cannot be more encouraging than that <e>", "<cs> my lords without pursuing my noble friend into too much detail this is an area upon which from the outset it was agreed that there should be uniformity <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand from the commissioner of police of the metropolis that the police acted under difficult circumtances and in accordance with their duty to prevent a breach of the peace <e>", "<cs> my lords the union jack was neither burned nor trampled upon on this occasion <e> <s> the police were acting under difficult circumstances and had to act to prevent what appeared to be an imminent and considerable breach of the peace <e> <s> we should recall that the actions of the police were based solely on the need to keep the peace <e> <s> it is not their business to weigh the merits of one cause against another <e> <s> neither did they do so <e> <s> noble lords will recognise that this degree of impartiality requires considerable self-discipline and they will realise from the events to which the noble lord has referred that the police are fully able to command it <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may summarise for the benefit of the noble and learned lord at the point we are considering the head of the procession had passed <e>", "<cs> my lords i had assumed a greater degree of knowledge among my noble friends and others than there appears to be <e> <s> there was a procession and a rally organised by something calling itself the ad hoc committee for peace in the falkland islands numbering about people <e> <s> it assembled in one place and marched to another and the latter place was trafalgar square <e> <s> as the marchers approached trafalgar square the head of the procession passed i believe no <e> <s> whitehall although i am not sure of the number <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i should complete the account for which many noble lords have asked me even if it makes a longer answer <e> <s> as the procession passed this point things were thrown on the people in the street below <e> <s> as this section of the procession arrived outside that building windows were thrown open banners with proclamations upon them were hung out of the windows as was the union jack and music was played <e> <s> the procession began to slow down <e> <s> at that point about eight people appeared on the roof and started shouting at the people below <e> <s> they were joined by the crowd surrounding the procession <e> <s> the procession began to halt and events became extremely tricky <e> <s> the police decided rightly in my view that the only catalytic factor they could remove was the people on the roof <e> <s> they did so and they also removed their belongings which were t he banners and also the flag to which the noble lord has referred and that is normal practice <e> <s> as the police left they also turned off the electric switches as they should have done and that silenced the music <e>", "<cs> absolutely not my lords <e> <s> i should add that people whose views were exactly contrary to those of the people to whom we have just referred were arrested on the same day <e>", "<cs> my lords i have given the house copious information <e> <s> i will add to it by saying that the band was recorded and i do not know what was on the label of the disc <e> <s> now i have clean forgot what the second question was <e>", "<cs> it was in whitehall and my recollection is that it passes under the address of nos <e> <s> to <e>", "<cs> well my lords at least people not very friendly to the ad hoc committee for peace in the falkland islands <e>", "<cs> my lords may i add to my previous reply that the building was nos <e> <s> to whitehall <e> <s> although the arresting officers did not have occasion to make inquiries at the time of the people they arrested in that connection i believe it is associated with something called the coalition for peace through security <e> <s> as to the noble lords separate question i find myself in a difficult position because i think it a very glorious thing that in a democracy under stress it is still possible to allow those who criticise the defence of democracy to have their voice <e> <s> if one resorts to absolutely silencing critical views one is beginning to do what it is that one is trying to defeat <e> <s> on the other hand as i hope a not unpatriotic member of your lordships house i find some of the sentiments thus expressed extremely offensive to me personally <e> <s> that is why i have such unbounded admiration for the police who always determine these issues with strict impartiality not on what the demonstration is about but on whether or not the queens peace is in danger <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that is an admirable sentiment with which to conclude what has become rather a lengthy debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that the medium we are looking at now is different in kind and intensity of effect from the traditional sort of pornographic material which was available in the noble lords youth and my own <e> <s> it poses particular difficulties <e> <s> the noble lord will be aware of the lack of agreement that there is in general on the control of this difficult area and may take courage from the voluntary approach now being looked at by a working party which has been set up by the british board of film censors and the british videogram association with the intention of setting up some kind of certification scheme similar to that used in the film industry <e>", "<cs> my lords as to the first part of the noble lords question the system of classification if it involves a voluntary sense is a very good answer in part to the problem <e> <s> under the provisions of the local government miscellaneous provisions bill as it left your lordships house it will be open to licensing authorities to require shops to indicate the classification given by such a body to the material which they sell <e> <s> as to the noble lords second question i regret that <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps it escaped me because it is a little far from what we are discussing at the moment <e> <s> what we are now looking at is the nature of the stuff on the tapes or discs as they may later be when they are sold <e> <s> questions of copyright and so on are outside the brief for which i have prepared myself on this occasion because they do not relate to the original question <e>", "<cs> my lords although that is a related question i regret that i shall have to write to the noble lord lord kennet and give my answer <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lords innocence is so maidenly at his stage in life i am afraid that my explanation might shock him <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i have gone as far as i can in saying that i believe we should proceed at present along the voluntary path and see how it works <e> <s> we shall look at this very closely in the context of two pieces of legislation which are currently going through this parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords at this stage your lordships may wish me to give an indication of the governments attitude towards my noble friends bill and i should like to congratulate him on the eloquent way in which he has introduced it to the house <e> <s> the purpose of the bill has already been explained by my noble friend and we do indeed recognise the debt of gratitude that we owe not only to my noble friend but also to his and my honourable friend mr eldon griffiths the promoter of the bill in another place for their efforts in steering through parliament this modest but important contribution to firearms legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords what i intended to express was ignorance of the original source of the figures not the words that the noble and learned lord quoted <e> <s> i would equally say that we have no evidence that such weapons are available at the kind of knock-down prices to which the noble and learned lord referred <e> <s> i hope that i can reassure anybody who is worried about that <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has produced a formidable list and i could do better by reading out the list of candidates for the warrington by-election where the citizens band candidate scored votes and the prosperous britain candidate perhaps surprisingly scored only votes <e> <s> as for a means of reducing the number of candidatures this is a difficult issue <e> <s> as i said in reply to a question earlier this session the real value now of the deposit is somewhere around to <e> <s> there are seats for which major parties can put up candidates <e> <s> if they contest a reasonable proportion <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that gloating comes better from the liberal party than from the government front bench <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not go so far as the noble lord lord underhill has suggested that i should <e> <s> i have already said that the government are keeping this issue under review <e> <s> the noble lord is quite right when he says that this is a serious matter <e> <s> my interest was first misleadingly brought to the subject in with the candidature of someone calling himself screaming lord sutch for stratford upon avon and it is difficult not to deal with such matters in a spirit of levity <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say again that the government arc considering it but they do not regard this as a matter for immediate action <e> <s> as to increasing the number of subscribers to a candidature i do not believe there is any difficulty in getting quite a large number of subscriptions to almost any candidature <e> <s> i know that one person who has attended a great many by-elections merely goes to the top of the tallest tower of flats and works his way down as far as it is necessary to get the eight signatures <e> <s> presumably one would just go on to the next tower block if one needed more <e>", "<cs> my lords my recollection is that i had to turn up with the money held in my hand <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a useful thought which i will bring to the attention of my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already taken on board the possibility of increasing the number of subscriptions by which i mean signatures <e> <s> the noble lord lord mackie of benshie raised that point and i will certainly draw it to the attention of my right honourable friend <e> <s> i think we should beware of shutting the door in the face of all new growth in the democratic process <e> <s> some of the new plants may be frivolous but not all <e> <s> we must have a reasonable threshold to allow small groups of people who have a genuine new philosophy with which to tackle our problems to prosper in

was raised earlier and i do take it on board <e> <s> your lordships will no doubt be familiar with the candidature of a mr tarquin biscuit-barrel at crosby in a recent by-election <e> <s> in fact his full name was registered as tarquin fintimlinbinwhinbimlim bus stop-ftangftang-ole-biscuit-barrel <e> <s> i do not think that was a serious candidature <e>", "<cs> my lords i think this is becoming something of a constitutional debate and i would not wish to follow my noble friend into that point <e>", "<cs> my lords in this at least i am sure that the white monarchist candidate would support me in saying that there is no intention of our turning to a presidential system of government <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to prolong this either by a list of my recollections of licensed premises in which

reported unfavourably on the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i can say at the outset that i have the greatest sympathy with the amendment proposed by the noble baroness and with the proposition on which it rests that young people remanded for trial and young people committed pending sentence should be kept apart from the general run of the prison population and held in young offender establishments rather than in prisons which as all your lordships are aware are overcrowded <e>", "<cs> the total of unsentenced persons under is <e>", "<cs> i should like first to say that i am very much obliged to my noble friend lady macleod of borve for explaining more fully than i had both the pressures on this part of the system and the reasons for wishing to continue with a custodial remand <e> <s> as to what primarily concerns your lordships it is clear that there is an agreed inordinate pressure of bodies upon places throughout the prison system and we have debated this at length on a number of occasions <e> <s> what your lordships are saying is that not only should there be an application of our finite resources to reducing pressure by increasing the places and also i hope your lordships will agree by reducing the number of bodies or the duration of their imprisonment which is one of the principal objects of this bill but the young offender should go to the head of the queue for those resources in the prison system which extend to the need for more staff to oversee the activities of prisoners when they are out of their cells more accommodation for prisoners to engage in manufacturing and other activities out of their cells more resources for the education of prisoners in education centres more cells more washing facilities better reception facilities and better processing all the way to the courts <e>", "<cs> perhaps i shall not want to hear what the last seven words of the noble lords interjection were but i did not hear them <e> <s> was he telling me to tell it to the marines <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my two noble friends for bringing us back to a consideration of the amendment in the context of the bill <e> <s> as a finale to my response to what noble lords have said about this i would say that i have tried to make our concern clear <e> <s> it is not a question of a country house being done over with a few inexpensive additions <e> <s> the people who could live there could be sent home on bail <e> <s> we have to provide secure accommodation

accommodation which is not always the most welcome new neighbour in a community <e> <s> there are many planning difficulties <e> <s> however the state of the prison service as it now is the noble baroness has been generous enough to accept that this is not the fault only of this government the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge has attributed it to many governments and i would endorse both speakers means that to include the amendment in the bill at this stage would leave us with nowhere to send a large number of remand cases a considerable number of whom would subsequently be

given her of the fact that my perception of this very nearly coincides with hers <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness does that may i ask her whether she will consider the terms of the amendment very carefully because she is in fact throwing people out on the street <e> <s> i cannot imagine that many people would wish to vote for that <e>", "<cs> may i welcome the noble lord lord elystan-morgan on board this bill which i think is going to voyage for some considerable time and compliment him on the obvious conviction and considerable eloquence with which he argued his case <e> <s> may i start from the standpoint of the common man which is the one think i am best fitted to occupy <e> <s> it generally is the case in human experience that the first experience of any strict or unaccustomed rgime has the greatest impact <e> <s> i remember with pangs of unhappiness my first day at boarding school <e>", "<cs> i had no intention of using an excuse to conceal from the house knowledge which the department already had <e> <s> what i wished to explain was that the actual evaluation would not be sufficiently reliable as an exercise as a whole for us to put before your lordships until it had run for two years and it then needs to be processed <e> <s> as to the figures the only figures i can get now is the round figure of who have been through already <e> <s> i take the noble lords question and i see its relevance <e> <s> it appears not be possible to produce them at this stage <e> <s> i assure him that i shall get them as soon as may be possible and convey them to him and other of your lordships who may be interested by the most appropriate and expeditious means but i cannot put my finger on them at the moment <e>", "<cs> what i would imagine might happen would be that we should be able to raise the issue at a later stage so that all your lordships could partake of the knowledge <e> <s> i do not wish to hold cards close to my chest <e> <s> i cannot display them until i myself see what is on the face of them <e>", "<cs> perhaps i might elaborate a little <e> <s> i shall certainly be able to produce the reception figures to <e> <s> the reconviction figures are not so easy to come by because each individual case has to be tracked down <e> <s> i shall certainly see that every best effort is made <e> <s> i have no wish to conceal things from your lordships <e> <s> what i cannot produce is what we have not got but we shall do our very best to get everything that your lordships may wish and the proper time i accept to do that is at the next stage of the bill rather than by correspondence <e>", "<cs> i am very sorry but my attention was wandering to the previous point when my noble friend <e>", "<cs> indeed yes that is so and therefore as i think the noble lord lord wigoder would say there would be some limitation on the use of all of this <e> <s> what the noble lord wants is some indication of where we are going and i think that that is a perfectly acceptable desire <e>", "<cs> in fact at the moment the normal method is not to conduct research until two years after conviction <e> <s> that is why at this stage i am being so very hesitant in making an unwise commitment to more than i can deliver <e> <s> the normal screening is after two years to see how many reconvictions there have been <e> <s> therefore there is not a running programme out of which we can just pick the figures as the noble baroness suggested we should <e> <s> the latest figures given in prison statistics are for those released until i understand <e>", "<cs> as i say the experiment is designed on a statistical basis with a two-year base <e> <s> we have not reached the end of it <e> <s> as to an ill-considered phrase in a weekend speech that really is not the basis of policy <e> <s> it was rather a well-considered and apt phrase describing the policy <e> <s> i would point out that we are talking about only two places <e> <s> we are not talking about every detention centre being full of people who are there for only a week or a fortnight <e> <s> i really cannot tell the committee more than i have told it <e> <s> i am certain in my bones that in the difficult position in which we are this is the better way to proceed that we ought not to continue as we now are and that we should not leave the question mark hanging over the people at present working in the detention centres <e> <s> to the best of my ability i shall put before your lordships further information at the report stage <e>", "<cs> i suppose the disadvantages of mixing young offenders with adult offenders which would result from the larger sentence that the noble lord was after apply even more when one mixes male young offenders with female young offenders <e> <s> as to the question of nearness to home of course i accept that it is a good thing when a prisoner can be visited and is close to home <e> <s> as a matter of policy we always put young offenders as others as near to home as is possible <e> <s> however there are other considerations <e> <s> it is better to have him in provision that is suitable to him a little further away and we are dealing with short sentences when of course visiting is of rather less importance <e>", "<cs> if i may revert first to the question of girls i would remind your lordships that there was in fact and has only ever been just one detention centre for girls <e> <s> moor court in staffordshire was opened in <e> <s> it served only the northern part of the country and had an average daily population of about girls <e> <s> it was closed in on the recommendation of the advisory council on the penal system and a study of girls sent there and to borstal showed that apart from the number of previous convictions there was little difference between the sort of girl sentenced to the detention centre and the sort of girl sentenced to borstal training <e>", "<cs> it is difficult to be clearer in an undertaking than i hope i have already been <e> <s> what i will seek to do is to obtain the largest appropriate and feasible sample <e> <s> there are constraints upon recovering information about reconviction <e> <s> i am not personally familiar with how long it takes to trace the subsequent career of a released detainee but i will see the extent to which i can satisfy your lordships with information and i will make available the whole of the information which i feel the committee ought to have in this context <e>", "<cs> there is a remarkable unanimity about what we wish to achieve and i subscribe to it <e> <s> we want to stop people from going improperly to custodial treatment when they can be treated in the community <e> <s> we are alert to and share the anxiety about the rising figures for custodial treatment particularly of young people and i have a great deal of sympathy with what my noble friend lady faithfull i almost forget what she looks like because she will sit behind me wishes to achieve and with the way in which she has advanced her cause <e> <s> but it is not only the interests of the individual offender which demand that he should receive a custodial sentence only when no other method of dealing with him is appropriate <e> <s> the appalling pressure to which i have referred before throughout the prison system advocates that as well <e> <s> i say this to make absolutely clear both the governments acceptance of the principle embodied in these amendments and the spirit in which they have approached them <e> <s> there is already in clause an unequivocal provision that no court shall pass a custodial sentence on a young offender unless no other method of dealing with him is appropriate and the amendments themselves borrow words used in paragraph of this governments white paper <e>", "<cs> i am much obliged to the noble lord and i take his point exactly <e> <s> it is something which i shall take into consideration <e> <s> the noble lord need not think that i am trying to fob him off <e> <s> i want first to establish that in my view it is from the courts indeed from the court of appeal that this kind of guidance should come <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord lord hutchinson of lullington for his inter <e>", "<cs> i take it that that question is addressed to the mover of the amendment <e> <s> in any event i think that we are focusing our attention on the essentials of this issue and it is simply a question of what will be more efficacious in doing what we all want <e> <s> some noble lords say that it is best done in tablets of stone which can only be chiselled away by all the stages of another statute and that the corners and the commas should be rounded and inserted by the court of appeal <e> <s> i can only say that the guidance given by the court of appeal will be binding on the lower courts <e> <s> i do not doubt that it will be extensive and specific and not simply in the form of a check list which the lower courts can tick off as has been suggested <e> <s> the sentencing courts will have to take <e>", "<cs> i can well conceive a pattern of the guidance far wider than that which my noble friend proposes and some parts of which would not be in precise accord with what she says <e> <s> i do not see any point in having unnecessary overlapping grids of guidance when we have the expertise and experience of the appeal court of this land which can be adjusted to meet circumstances as they change rather than placing immutably on the statute book something smaller and bolder and therefore rougher and readier <e>", "<cs> i think that perhaps i was injudicious in my intervention at the beginning of my introductory speech because the noble lord has looked at what the noble lord chairman said <e> <s> it would seem that we are to remove a part of the bill which is to be amended by amendment no <e> <s> although it is a consequential amendment <e> <s> when i was doing my preparation i had not made the assumption that the last division would go against me and that is why i drew that conclusion <e> <s> it will be for my noble friend not to move amendment no <e> <s> but to do what is appropriate at the next stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords my work has almost been done for me <e> <s> my noble friend lord onslow is of course right that the question has arisen before <e> <s> he thinks that it was resolved at the moment when crime began that was when eve first picked the apple and i think that the result was almost instant eviction which is not an order appropriate to what we are now considering <e> <s> but the usual rule is as indeed the noble lord lord elystan-morgan has said that a court should sentence an offender according to his age at conviction and sentence <e> <s> there would be very absurd results if this were not so even if some of the results are not altogether agreeable as things are now <e> <s> indeed this is borne out in clause <e>", "<cs> i thought that i had made it clear that it is in the bill but in clauses and <e> <s> the noble lord lord elystan-morgan has pointed out that the usual practice is also based on statute so i think i can assure the noble lord that what he seeks to do is superfluous <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may reply to my noble friend afterwards because i have not actually grasped the point and we wish to get on with the committee stage <e>", "<cs> the only point of substance which my noble friend raised was to ask us to have a look at the technicality which my noble friend has placed upon the face of the bill and of course we shall do so <e>", "<cs> part of the answer which the noble lord lord donaldson seeks rests in other parts of the bill and i am sure my noble friend will accept that our principal intention in the bill is to reduce both the numbers in custody and the duration of custody to increase the confidence of the courts in non-custodial sentences and thereby to reverse a progress which we all deplore <e> <s> but do not think my noble friend believes any more than i do in what i would call aspirational legislation <e> <s> the fact is that even she in her lengthy and enlightened rgime at oxford was constrained to see six children consigned to penal institutions <e> <s> there will always be cases i regret when younger as well as older young offenders however few will be of a nature when they will have to be so contained <e> <s> that is the reality of the situation <e> <s> i wish it were otherwise but we have a duty to deal with things as they are and not things as we would like them to be <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to my noble friend for narrowing the area of his concern in this amendment to the question of medical and other treatment in detention centres <e> <s> the committee will know that the intention is that the sentences shall be short and i accept that it is possible that inmates might be partaking of courses of treatment of one kind or another which last longer than the sentences <e> <s> the question that my noble friend is asking is should we keep them inside the detention centres for longer than the sentences in order to see that the courses of treatment are completed <e>", "<cs> i must make it quite clear that the function of the prison service is not to cure the sick <e> <s> we had lengthy debates in this area when considering the mental health amendment bill and it was then made quite clear the types of illnesses under which people could be detained because they suffered from them <e> <s> frankly under those circumstances a person would not be in a detention centre anyway <e> <s> but if he were suffering from a lesser affliction whether it be a social disease or a mental disease we must remember that when the sentencing justice says to him you must take your medicine he uses the term entirely figuratively <e> <s> the young person is put inside for a purpose which relates to his misdemeanour not to his state of health <e>", "<cs> may i say first that all young offenders released otherwise than on parole will on release be subject to a period of supervision and that supervision is integral <e> <s> perhaps your lordships would bear with me for a moment <e> <s> they will have to observe certain conditions and the government intend that these will be relatively simple and will relate mainly to keeping in touch with the supervisor <e> <s> there must be sanctions if they are not observed <e> <s> clause deals with the offence of breach of supervision and sets out the penalties which are a fine of up to or a custodial sentence of up to days <e> <s> the offence of breach of supervision is directly connected with the original custodial sentence <e> <s> the courts should be able to remind the offender of the importance of supervision and of the need to comply with its conditions <e>", "<cs> if a young offender is not physically or mentally fit for the rgime at a detention centre then ideally he should not be sent there and we shall be debating this issue i think at greater length after dinner <e> <s> if on the other hand he arrives there and proves not to be fit to pursue the tougher rgime he can be moved to a less demanding one <e> <s> furthermore if he is seen by the court not to be fit either mentally or physically for a detention centre rgime then his sentence can be made one of youth custody and he will go to the establishment appropriate to that rgime <e> <s> i hope that answers my noble friends question <e>", "<cs> i can travel a good deal of the way down the same road as the noble lord lord elystan-morgan did in dealing with the amendment proposed by my noble friend <e> <s> i think i am right in saying that in her intervention just now my noble friend lady macleod had it in mind that had the magistrates been to detention centres in an inspectorial role rather than a custodial role they would certainly see that a medical report was furnished <e>", "<cs> i am so sorry to have brought the noble lord into a state of confusion immediately before dinner <e> <s> what i was saying was that under the normal cycle if somebody is remanded typically he is remanded for three weeks for a medical report and that comes from somewhere else <e> <s> but there is provision which is not at present properly used as i understand it for this report to be available more or less in the precincts of the court <e> <s> i was saying that i thought it would be wrong to introduce into the bill a procedure which would probably result in these remands but right if i could persuade by administrative means the courts to avail themselves of what is already available <e> <s> it will be possible to monitor this by the number of people who are subsequently transferred <e> <s> i think it will go down dramatically <e>", "<cs> no i would have thought that a thorough medical examination for this purpose would not take more than hours i do not think it would be measured in days <e> <s> i could not say how many minutes there would be <e>", "<cs> indeed it is <e> <s> i was about to phrase it in a different way <e> <s> i accept that <e>", "<cs> paragraph <e>", "<cs> what is proposed here is in effect a special limit on the powers of a magistrates court when it is dealing with juveniles <e> <s> magistrates courts have power to impose a custodial sentence of up to six months on offenders of any age <e> <s> that is the general limit of their sentencing power <e>", "<cs> perhaps i might intervene in this developing exchange to say that my noble friend lord mottistone is not entirely irrelevant in what he says because it is not only the dangerous and suicidal lunatic who is in danger of falling into the gutter if he is released into society without some other provision <e> <s> i do not doubt that if we were addressing ourselves to an amendment in the name of the noble lord lord donaldson i am not suggesting by that that we prolong the proceedings on report he would say no indeed that person should not be discharged into the gutter but some other provision some other supervision or care should be provided <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord can see if not from my face from the faces of others that i shall have to write to him on that point <e>", "<cs> with respect i think that when the noble lord reads <e>", "<cs> as to the numbers i shall do what i can to help your lordships committee <e> <s> whether or not the people who robbed the noble baronesss friend were mentally disturbed i cannot say that would he for the court to decide <e>", "<cs> i did not catch the allusion <e> <s> i think that we shall do better if only the person standing up takes part in the debate <e> <s> i shall be very happy to sit down for as long as noble lords wish <e> <s> but the thing is <e>", "<cs> in that case we shall never know whether or not they were mentally disturbed <e>", "<cs> indeed yes but i should point out that these are all unfit people and not just mentally unfit people <e> <s> the noble lord will agree i think that there is a difference between putting somebody who has a mental illness to cope with in a youth custody institution or indeed in an adult prison and somebody who has a hernia for instance <e> <s> they are really of rather a different order <e>", "<cs> i think i ought to intervene to shelter my noble friend and the advisers and possibly provide a magazine to slip down the trousers <e> <s> i apologise if the answer went astray but as the noble lord had linked it with no <e> <s> and my noble friend was about to take that i handed it to him and this is where the slip came between the cup and the lip <e>", "<cs> i shall try to be brief and to satisfy your lordships <e> <s> the first point from which we started was the standard minimum rules for the treatment of prisoners of which there are both united nations and council of europe versions <e> <s> these cover much of the ground in the amendments though without specifying quantities or dimensions <e> <s> the standard minimum rules have the status of recommendations to guide legislation and practice <e> <s> in administering the prison system the government endeavour to comply with the rules so far as is possible but they are not i can tell the noble lord lord avebury conventions subject to signature and ratification as capable of enforcement <e> <s> they are as it were international guidelines <e> <s> i recognise the attraction of what is proposed <e> <s> it puts noble lords who have tabled the amendments whoever moves them on the side of the angels <e> <s> they are very attractive in some respects <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has entirely misunderstood me <e> <s> what we are saying is that there should be guidelines that there should be something like the sm rs a target a standard which ought to be reached and adhered to <e> <s> that means quite a bulky document as the noble lord will realise if he has looked at the european and united nations equivalent <e> <s> to get that out may take about months <e> <s> then we have to bring the accommodation up to standard <e> <s> how long that will take i cannot say until we know what the standards are and how far we are below them <e> <s> however we intend to do what the noble lord wishes us to do not by statute though but by guidelines <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord was going to emulate his noble friend and answer the question for me i will be only too happy to give way <e> <s> the noble lord lord avebury has raised a point which i regret f am skirting because i have set the relevant piece of paper on one side <e> <s> the prison rule borstal rule and detention rule all say much the same <e> <s> neither the legislation nor a prison department guidance sets the precise standards to be applied and in practice accomodation is certified by governors and medical officers operating under regional oversight <e> <s> in setting certified normal accomodation levels they are enjoined to determine the uncrowded capacity of the establishment and in so doing to bear in mind such factors as the size shape and general condition of the accommodation the number and position of doors and windows ventilation and lighting heating and access to ablutions and lavatories <e>", "<cs> the level we are talking about is the certified normal accommodation <e> <s> if a prison medical officer thought that it was exceeded to a level which made things not only uncomfortable but dangerous to health then obviously he would have a duty to intercede <e> <s> the cna is what the prison is regarded as being designed for <e> <s> as i have with tireless regularity told your lordships it is something which we are forced to accede <e> <s> this bill is among the armoury of things which we are using to bring that excess down to a lower level <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> as i think i said this is done under regional supervision and the regions themselves are under the hand of central government so there are not wide discrepancies about the standards <e> <s> the question of the extent to which cna is exceeded depends on a great many different factors in different areas catchment area the types of offenders and the number of establishments available in a particular area <e> <s> therefore there is more overcrowding in some prisons than in others <e>", "<cs> the amendment addresses itself to standardising these criteria <e> <s> i have said that we endorse that proposal <e> <s> there will he variations do not doubt of circumstance from one region to another <e> <s> it is the function of the prison governors and the medical officers to see that minima are observed in setting what is certified normal accommodation <e> <s> almost every establishment is above certified normal establishment and of course that is what we are <e>", "<cs> if one prison was built in and another in the rooms are likely to be a different size and they are liable to be a different size which is not modular to adjust to prisoners you either have one and three quarter prisoners or one and a half or half of one prisoner <e> <s> i would have thought this was elementary and i think we were straining at a gnat <e> <s> the principle the amendment is after has been conceded and i do not see why we go on with the debate <e>", "<cs> i can quite understand the noble lords interest in this subject because i also find what i have discovered rather surprising <e> <s> the arrangment is in fact intended for the benefit of the individuals concerned <e> <s> it is the case that the present law does not distinguish between prisoners on the basis of their age and in the womens and girls system over s and under s subject to sentences of imprisonment which start at the age of have been held together for many years <e> <s> that has not been done casually or in response to the need to solve an <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord said this amendment is similar to one which was tabled and discussed though not formally moved in another place <e> <s> although it is well meant the government do not believe it is quite the right approach and indeed if brought into the bill it could produce some confusion <e> <s> the demand for places in the prison system is in effect determined by sentencing decisions taken by a judiciary operating within general but not specific limits imposed by parliament <e> <s> a statutory provision requiring individual courts to have detailed population returns at regular intervals could indeed exert an overt influence on individual sentencing decisions <e> <s> i do not say that those responsible for taking sentencing decisions should not have relevant information about custodial <e>", "<cs> i cannot forbear to thank the noble and learned lord for his calm and generous response <e> <s> nothing would mortify me more than through my own ineptitude denying myself the pleasure of being thanked by the noble and learned lord <e>", "<cs> i understand the concern which underlies the amendment <e> <s> it can sometimes be difficult for the probation service to deal with young offenders who resent being supervised and their task is not helped when the offender feels he is an adult and should not therefore be treated differently from people who are sentenced as adults and it may help if i explain why the government have included the provision in clause and why therefore we are not disposed to accept the amendment <e> <s> we take the view that all young offenders should on release be subject to a period of supervision <e> <s> an offender who has been in custody is likely to be in a vulnerable state and a supervising officer can provide him with both firm guidance and support of a practical kind <e> <s> the period of supervision is an integral part of the sentence <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the noble lord for exposing his interest in this matter so clearly <e> <s> under clause there is provision to continue the existing arrangement whereby certain juveniles released from detention centres and borstals are supervised by local authority social workers <e> <s> mainly these are youngsters who would have been under the care or supervision of the local authority when they were sentenced and whose continuing supervision by the same local authority social worker is considered to be essential <e>", "<cs> if i may elaborate on what i have said the social workers have perfectly ample authority to cope with the most difficult cases and they do so in my last job i saw them do it and was impressed <e> <s> as to training there is a common element in the cqsw course and therefore i feel that the social workers are as well equipped as the probation officers for this work <e>", "<cs> i will try to match the noble lords brevity <e> <s> i do not think i can quite do it but i think he would like me to make it clear that the provision in clause is not some form of recall or return to custody <e> <s> it creates a new and separate offence like any other offence and sets a maximum penalty for it <e> <s> that penalty is available whether the offender is under supervision after being in custody for three years or three weeks <e> <s> it does not provide an easy way for the court to pop someone back inside when they seem to be going astray <e> <s> the imposition of a custodial sentence under this provision will be subject to all the restrictions in the opening clauses of this bill including social inquiry reports legal representation and so on <e>", "<cs> this turns also to some extent on the concept of whether what happens is a new offence or as it were a distortion of the old conditions <e> <s> i see one attractive side to the noble lords argument which is that there is a danger of somebody being trapped into a constant recycle of offence breach offence supervision and so on <e> <s> but the period of supervision on release under clause is an integral part of the young offenders sentence <e> <s> during that time he must comply with the requirements in his notice of supervision <e> <s> these will be quite simple and mainly concerned with keeping in touch with the supervising officer <e> <s> if he fails to comply he will be guilty of an offence carrying up to days in custody <e> <s> plenty of other offences might result in a young offender being given up to days in custody <e> <s> the question is should this offender be treated differently from all other offenders <e>", "<cs> my lords i always proceed upon the thin ice of local government expenditure with great caution <e> <s> i should like if i may to be more specific by writing to my noble friend but it is a per cent <e> <s> grant on work undertaken <e> <s> i think that my noble friend believes it is subsumed in the rsg <e> <s> my understanding on the advice i have before me at the moment is that it is a grant against a specific expenditure <e> <s> if i am wrong i shall have to inform your lordships at a later stage <e> <s> but in any case i will write to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to give a technical reply to my noble friends technical question and i think that will just allow a little time for it to gestate if i may so phrase it <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> it might perhaps be helpful if i put my oar in at this stage and your lordships could perhaps occasionally pick up a few points that i propose to make and for which my noble friend trailed his coat earlier on <e>", "<cs> we were discussing clause and care orders i never so much as mentioned borstals <e>", "<cs> perhaps we could revert to that in a moment <e> <s> the noble baroness raised the question of intermediate treatment <e> <s> the term intermediate treatment is not a statutory term nor indeed is the term supervised activities <e> <s> i suppose that one could sound as if it takes place in the dentists chair and the other at school <e> <s> so to that extent both are misleading <e> <s> i think that intermediate treatment which is what it is generally speaking known as now shows very promising signs of being a useful alternative to custodial treatment and one which is relatively less expensive <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness lady masham asked about a point raised by my noble friend <e> <s> i can tell her that the disposal to which she refers is to a detention centre <e> <s> a number of your lordships have asked for notice of the curfew provision to be as long as possible <e> <s> of course we shall do our best <e> <s> your lordships will realise that this was being argued to and fro all the way through in another place and the amendment is now in drafting <e> <s> i shall do my best to table it at the earliest convenient moment hassled no doubt with the hounds of lord harris supporters snapping at my heels with his question <e> <s> i am obliged to him for providing me with this means of acceding to his request otherwise it would have been difficult <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> that was a formidable deployment was it not of combined opinions <e> <s> i wonder whether the phalanx of opposition to this measure which noble lords have quoted including i noticed the association of county councils which i think is a newish recruit and which i was not aware of does not repose to some extent upon a misconception <e> <s> i am advised that in fact the association of county councils at best regards it as a curates egg so i withdraw that point <e> <s> i was saying that i was withdrawing one of the facts i was deploying against the noble lord <e> <s> he need not trouble himself with which he can just be content that my case is fractionally weakened by what i have said <e>", "<cs> in order not to be stranded on either scylla or charybdis it is necessary to have a positive course to steer <e> <s> that is what clause provides <e> <s> if you drift you finish up on scylla or charybdis wrecked <e>", "<cs> i should merely like to say that the noble lord is quoting me a little out of context <e> <s> i was referring to residential care orders and i take it that the noble lord is not doing so in that reference <e>", "<cs> i think i can say that few powers to pass a particular type of sentence have attracted as much attention in all parts of the committee and inside and outside parliament as the power to order that a sentence of imprisonment may be partly served and partly suspended <e> <s> the odd thing and an aspect your lordships should note about the argument of those who oppose it is that they do not actually say that it is penologically wrong on the contrary they say the courts may abuse it <e> <s> on the penological merits of the sentence i refer your lordships to the report of the advisory council on the penal system entitled <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord hunt for the courteous manner in which without delaying the procedures of this chamber he has addressed himself to the basic and important principles of his amendment <e> <s> amendment was an attack on one means of reducing the pressure on our prisons by introducing a new kind of sentence the partially suspended sentence <e> <s> we are all agreed that the pressure on our prisons has to be relieved <e> <s> i can confirm to the noble lord lord avebury that the population of the prisons has hovered around since the end of february this year <e> <s> one cannot say that the majority of those serving short to medium-term sentences are non-violent offenders <e> <s> over it is true over per cent <e> <s> of sentenced prisoners are serving sentences for burglary a matter of great concern to the public and what is more the majority of those have three or more previous convictions <e> <s> over or over per cent <e> <s> are known to have more <e>", "<cs> i take the noble lords point <e> <s> in other words the prisoner is not referred direct to the home secretary he is returned to goal to await review <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> parole is supervised <e> <s> supervised release is supervised <e> <s> supervised release carries an unquantifiable burden the results of which are far from certain and not altogether welcome from the probation service <e> <s> i know that the probation service has been quoted or prayed in aid of what is being put forward but in its comments it had considerable reservations not least about the resources needed as well as the difficulty of mandatory supervision of offenders with mixtures of offences and mixtures of difficulties which might well prove to be counterproductive <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to detain the committee <e> <s> i wish to place on record that the government are fully aware of the pressure on the present system and what a difficult and dangerous task we have before us <e> <s> we believe we have modelled a tool with which to improve that position but whatever your lordships put into the bill at whatever stage of the proceedings here or in another place it will still be necessary to have a safety valve in case it does not work <e> <s> therefore there is nothing wrong in having an executive release for that degree of emergency <e> <s> if the noble lord likes to regard this as semantics i think he is wrong <e> <s> i think there is a greater degree of emergency in view than we now have and that he would not think there should be executive release at this stage to meet this degree of pressure <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord whether he is addressing himself to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> because the reasons for parole which is what he is discussing at the moment occur in a later amendment <e>", "<cs> there is one other thing that is successful in northern ireland and that is the very elegant tree which was planted by the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge in the gardens of hillsborough which caused me great jealousy because it grew unchecked and i was never invited to plant one <e> <s> i was about to launch into more serious matters but i believe that the noble lords lord melchett and lord harris of greenwich both want to say something which i should perhaps hear before i launch into my own remarks <e>", "<cs> although i would not share all their grounds i think that the noble lord lord harris and the noble lord lord elystan-morgan have done a good deal of my work for me in analysing this amendment <e> <s> however perhaps i may start in northern ireland <e> <s> i agree that one cannot accept arguments when they suit one and reject them when they do not <e> <s> but to the noble lord lord melchett would say that one cannot transfer arguments of systems from one theatre or environment and expect them to operate equally in others <e> <s> as he knows as well as i do the situation in northern ireland is entirely different from that in this country and in particular the selection of individual prisoners for parole and the subsequent supervision of them is a matter of very much greater difficulty in northern ireland or would be than it is here <e> <s> that is why there is a different system and the early release there is in fact a part of that system and would not sit well with the one that we have here <e>", "<cs> i cannot accept that <e> <s> the noble lord should look at dods <e>", "<cs> the proposal which the noble earl lord longford makes in this amendment is not a new one <e> <s> he has brought it to the house before as he said <e> <s> i give great weight to his transparent compassion and the forthrightness with which he addresses himself to this clause and to the support of the noble lord lord hunt who regrettably is not here to speak for himself <e> <s> i must also weigh very carefully the enormously authoritative opinion of the noble lord lord harris of greenwich who has said more ably than i could and with more direct experience than i have a great deal that i had intended to say <e> <s> may i take this opportunity of thanking him not for that contribution though i would do so also but for his service as chairman of the parole board for the past several years for which the government would like to give recognition <e> <s> i must say what he said makes me think that they made a very wise choice <e>", "<cs> the effect of this is cumulative is it not <e> <s> and it will go on increasing until the natural life span of those who are kept in prison for the term of their natural life expires <e> <s> ten per cent of lifers are not <e>", "<cs> i cannot give the noble lord an objective answer but the subjective answer i would have thought was sufficiently obvious to be convincing <e>", "<cs> the intervals and i regret if i appeared discourteous to the noble lord but it is very frustrating to be interrupted in a peroration but it is possible that my perorations cannot be detected as such until they finish between reviews are not set to a pattern <e> <s> they are set to the nature of the individual case and the noble lord was good enough to bring a particular case to my attention and i felt that the pattern was wrong <e> <s> if there is a change in the pattern overall it is coincidental it is made up of individual cases and not of policy <e>", "<cs> if i may start at the end of these exchanges i would say to the noble lord lord hutchinson of lullington that i have not found the cotton-wool of home office briefs at all stifling <e> <s> i find it translucent <e> <s> one can see through it and having done so and discovered what it is all about one finds that the briefs are extremely helpful and i do not believe that the noble lord lord harris is any less perceptive than i am <e> <s> i would not say that what he has said was absolute rubbish at all but then that is because i do not think that that is a phrase that one should address to ones noble friend in the same party in the course of debate but it is interesting to hear the different points of view of the noble lords party expressed in this way <e>", "<cs> t believe there would be comprehensive litigation because there would be more things to challenge in every report and they would be challenged <e> <s> i cannot conceive that any of your lordships who were in prison and had been for some time who went up for parole and got comprehensive reasons for not being <e>", "<cs> would the noble earl give way <e>", "<cs> the noble earl is more than courteous <e> <s> i rise simply to point out that the whole purpose of the bill is to have fewer people going into prison and wherever possible more coming out sooner <e> <s> but in order to do that we must preserve the confidence of the public and it would not be preserved if people were improperly let out <e> <s> on the other hand if the effect were as i have described it and as the noble lord lord harris also described it namely to fossilise the process so as to protect people from litigation that would mean fewer people coming out so in neither way would we win <e>", "<cs> that is a refreshing revelation but the views of the <e>", "<cs> i am very sorry <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord elystan-morgan and the noble and learned lord lord gardiner have between them demonstrated the very cogent reasons that there are behind the wish of everybody on all sides of your lordships committee to reduce the prison population <e> <s> your lordships will also be aware from the opening remarks of the noble lord lord harris that the clause which this amendment seeks to alter is itself an earnest of the governments intentions and was put down in response to similar pressure in another place in order to give the secretary of state the power to do what he is not yet able to do because the machinery does not exist <e> <s> i think that the assurance that your lordships wish to hear is that this is our intention and that we have set our hands to the plough in order to get it done <e>", "<cs> perhaps i fail to make myself clear on what i intend to do <e> <s> what we wish to discuss with the services who will have to administer what emerges from this will be some quantified estimate of what would be the result of the legislation he proposes or the implementation of the order now in the bill <e> <s> i have told your lordships that that investigation has already begun and on this day fortnight or whenever we discuss it again i shall be able to tell the noble lord that we have done another or days work on that <e> <s> as soon as that is available we shall be able to discuss the matter with those who will have to administer it and i think the noble lord will accept that you cannot launch the product of extra parole reviews onto the parole services of the country without discussing it with them and with the police <e> <s> i can say that we shall be finding out as soon as possible what are the implications and then we shall discuss this as swiftly as we can <e> <s> i do not want to give the noble lord an exaggerated expectation of what i shall be able to say next week or the next fortnight <e> <s> it may take the matter a little further but not necessarily much further <e>", "<cs> my noble friend the noble and learned lord and other noble lords are all seeking to persuade me of something of which i am already persuaded the desirability of doing this if it is possible <e> <s> i have also said that we are discovering this with the greatest expedition possible <e> <s> maybe the noble lord lord melchett can find more rhetorical ways of expressing that sense of urgency which would convince him more rapidly than i can that we are doing what we can as quickly as we can <e> <s> i am not going to come with a cut-and-dried solution dates and numbers at report stage or third reading <e> <s> it will not be possible <e> <s> if i can find anything else which convinces the committee of the real sense of urgency which we give to this matter i shall do so <e> <s> what i said to the noble lord lord harris stands <e> <s> i am grateful to him for giving me to third reading at least to be able to report that much more work <e>", "<cs> my lords that idea had been hovering at the back of my mind but i had not taken advice on it and as this issue is going to be raised again at a later stage perhaps we may address ourselves to it then <e>", "<cs> arising out of the last reply i must <e>", "<cs> i do not think i shall be able to satisfy the noble lord at this stage but i will consider carefully what he has put before me <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> he referred to the governor of brixton but i believe he meant the governor of wormwood scrubbs <e> <s> if he looks in the record he might like to put that right <e> <s> i feel that it is right to remind the noble lord that it was my right honourable friend who appointed the inspectorate of prisons as an independent sector of the home office with the chief inspector publishing all these things and the damaging criticisms which the noble lord is frequently quoting are actually generated and publicised as a result of this <e> <s> this is open government so are the reports by the inspectorate on individual prisons which again cause cries of alarm <e> <s> it is perfectly deliberate <e> <s> we wish society to realise the problem <e> <s> we wish to support society in spending more money but if one puts that into specific machinery as the noble lord says the experience is that every pressure group wants per cent increase in money but no group is actually in charge of the total budget <e> <s> that is not an easy way to finance government because one finishes up with a very large minus quantity at the end of every year <e> <s> perhaps i am assisting to broaden the debate on this amendment for which i apologise <e> <s> i merely wanted to put the record straight on these two facts <e>", "<cs> the effect of the first amendment is to increase the maximum fine that can be imposed for a breach of an undertaking that a house which is unfit for human habitation will not be used for specified purposes usually that it will not be lived in <e> <s> the effect of the second amendment is to increase the maximum fine for entering into occupation of an unfit house subject to a demolition order or permitting such occupation <e>", "<cs> that is another issue <e>", "<cs> i think i ought perhaps under these circumstances to try to explain the background to section of the housing act <e> <s> if the owner of a house which is unfit for human habitation and which the local authority are satisfied cannot be made <e>", "<cs> i think it will require my noble friend to look at it again as well and i do not encourage her too much to expect a meeting of minds but i shall <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may suggest to my noble friend that it would be better if she moved amendment no <e> <s> a and did not move no <e> <s> <e> <s> i think that was the plan <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the noble and learned lord for explaining the effects of the bill <e> <s> if i may i will explain to the noble baroness the effects of the difference between amendment no <e> <s> and amendment no <e> <s> a in joined-up writing because i cannot do it off the cuff <e> <s> but we are happy nonetheless to accept amendment no <e> <s> a with its capital letters <e>", "<cs> there is one reason why i find the universal support for this amendment a little puzzling <e> <s> that is that it purports to amend the criminal justice act <e> <s> as i understand it that act was repealed in so to that extent the amendment is seeking to alter something that does not exist <e>", "<cs> i have no intention of shrugging off the principle to which the noble lords amendment addresses itself but he must allow me to smack my lips a little when i detect my skilled adversaries in the position of having made an error i agree without malice and perhaps a little self-congratulation <e> <s> the amendment of my noble friend or in her absence of the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge should be addressed to the attachment of earnings order <e> <s> if one examines that one sees that the courts have powers which are very close to the power which this clause seeks to give to them <e> <s> where default has occurred in payment of a fine it is open to the person to whom the payment has to be made in this instance it would be the clerk to the justices to apply to the court for the making of an attachment of earnings order and in addition whether or not default has occurred the person ordered to make a payment by the court may at any time apply for an attachment of earnings order to be made in his case <e>", "<cs> i am sorry if i am slower than the noble lord would wish <e> <s> i am almost there in meeting this point <e> <s> there would appear to be no reason at all why a person who has been fined should not make such an application at the time of conviction if he wishes to do so <e> <s> the slight difference which the present new clause would introduce would be to give the court the power to make such an order without the application on the offenders behalf but only still with his consent <e>", "<cs> the court would not say we need your consent but would you please ask us to do it then we will do it <e> <s> there is a difference of semantics <e>", "<cs> does the noble baroness wish to intervene <e>", "<cs> i hope we shall not get embarrassed by semantics and of course i am always ready to be corrected by my noble and learned friend <e>", "<cs> who has demonstrated that this is not a procedure which is often either known about or practised <e>", "<cs> i am advised that the court can say we are going to make an order for you <e> <s> you will have to pay a fine <e> <s> it is probably beyond your means <e> <s> do you want or do you not want an attachment of earnings order <e> <s> what noble lords opposite would say is we are now in a position to offer you an attachment of earnings order <e> <s> will you take it <e> <s> i cannot actually see the difference but i absolutely accept that it is not satisfactory if it is not known <e> <s> i am therefore prepared to take advice about the best way of getting it made known whether by an amendment along these lines or by some other means and i hope the noble lord lord donaldson will be satisfied with that <e>", "<cs> he is not late <e>", "<cs> under those terms i advance upon the field with trepidation <e> <s> before i comment on the noble earls amendment i think i should outline what is the system we have at present and what the noble earl seeks to change <e> <s> since great britain has had a non-statutory scheme the criminal injuries compensation scheme which he referred to and suggested should be in statutory form which provides compensation by the state for those who suffer personal injury as a result of crimes of violence or in attempting to apprehend offenders <e> <s> where the victim dies the scheme provides for the compensation to go to the dependants <e> <s> the scheme applies to both england and wales and to scotland northern ireland has its own <e>", "<cs> i should like to add something at this stage rather than intervene in the noble earls reply because no doubt i should be in danger of trespassing upon his peroration <e> <s> the government do not consider that a criminal justice bill such as the one now before the committee should deal with the question of state compensation for criminal injuries <e> <s> the noble earls proposals are not directly concerned with the powers and procedures of the criminal courts nor with the treatment of offenders <e> <s> they are much more closely related to matters of civil law <e> <s> the state compensation arrangements are a substitute for civil court proceedings and they follow civil law practice <e> <s> i am afraid that i have to say that in the view of the government this block of amendments is out of place in the present bill and their tabling at this relatively late stage leaves in any case not a lot of time to give adequate parliamentary scrutiny to them <e>", "<cs> i could not accept the approach of the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones to this problem for a number of reasons but perhaps i should start with the safeguards to which the noble lord lord donaldson in particular directed his enquiries <e>", "<cs> as i attempted to explain in my principal response it will be for the court to satisfy itself and in the large number of cases where the prisoner is in receipt of legal aid the legal representative is under an <e>", "<cs> we shall need to make arrangements to ensure that matters such as this which are customarily dealt with at committal can be settled before the hearing <e> <s> i am referring in particular to such matters as which witnesses will be needed at the trial <e> <s> giving the defendant an alibi warning is another example <e> <s> ensuring that legal aid has been granted to the defendant and specifying the crown court centre to which the case will be committed are yet other examples <e> <s> these arrangements are i quite agree important but they can be made without legislative change <e>", "<cs> i must congratulate the noble baroness on the commendable brevity of her interventions throughout the debates on this stage of the bill <e> <s> if as the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge suggested the government are being given a test then i fear they have probably been set the wrong paper <e> <s> i do not rely on the difficulty of what is proposed in the amendment but upon the probable total lack of effect of the amendment as well as the other considerations <e>", "<cs> i regret that my archaeological research deflected me at the moment when i should have been responding to that <e> <s> as i read it this amendment would still permit extending the time limit in the same circumstances as is permitted in the rule which we are discussing <e> <s> the net effect would be to add <e>", "<cs> i understand that the day rule is not mandatory either so we are comparing like with <e>", "<cs> i must apologise for disrupting the noble lord but he has been disrupted in his flow and i would like to get something straight too <e> <s> as i understand it the term mandatory is not quite as simple as the noble lord has put to me because there are provisions for exception in the scottish rule <e> <s> if the delay is not due to the prosecutor then the case will continue as it would have done had that rule not existed <e> <s> i take it that that is what the noble lord is saying should happen here <e> <s> so the whole of the amendment is directed simply at delay by prosecutors but that is not going to address itself to the huge majority of cases where delay is due to pressure on the courts or to the desire of defence counsel to present a more complete case <e> <s> the noble lord is therefore suggesting that a great curative effect will be had when the prosecution is dilatory in presenting its case <e> <s> i suggest that that is caught by rule <e>", "<cs> may i put something straight for the record <e> <s> the noble lord referred to as being the average <e> <s> i presume that he is referring to the london average <e> <s> the national average waiting time is just under days which is rather different <e>", "<cs> if i may clear my mind of course i recognise the great desirability of what the noble lord proposes <e> <s> but at present an appeal against conviction on indictment is submitted in writing to the court of appeal and it would seem to follow from that that only a judge in the court of appeal criminal division would have before him the material upon which the decision as to bail would have to be based <e> <s> i want to consider what the noble lord has said but it could not be dealt with elsewhere if that is where the material was for example as the new clause proposes by a judge of the crown court <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i might at this point tell your lordships that we have it in mind to table a further amendment to the immigration act which the government will propose at report stage <e> <s> that amendment like the amendments that we have been debating today concerns the procedures relating to the prosecution of offences under the act <e> <s> section <e>", "<cs> i am not sure whether the noble lord wishes me to reply because he probably knows the facts which i should put before him in the reply as well as anybody in this committee <e> <s> he will know that some of the delays are inevitable <e> <s> one important factor is the period for lodging an appeal <e> <s> three weeks in the case of a magistrates court order and four weeks in another case has to elapse before the home secretary may sign a deportation order <e> <s> then the person has another fortnight in which to appeal against the destination specified in the removal direction <e> <s> so there is an irreducible period during which a person is liable to be detained and if he appeals the period is longer <e> <s> if the person concerned receives a noncustodial sentence he will be detained solely as a result of the recommendation for deportation <e>", "<cs> i think i had better look into that point and let the noble lord know <e>", "<cs> it might be for the committees convenience if i refer also to amendments nos <e> <s> a b and c which address themselves to the same problem <e> <s> i can indeed assure the committee that arrangements have been made with the four probation areas concerned for the centres in question to continue in use as an alternative to a custodial disposal by the courts <e> <s> repeal of section will enable the centres to be used more flexibly and intensively as day centres with their facilities available to courts from a wider area <e> <s> the complication has been that your lordships house recently dismissed an appeal to which the noble baroness referred in the case of <e>", "<cs> i am afraid i spread my net too wide in anticipating the noble baroness <e> <s> i do apologise <e> <s> i think nonetheless it may have been useful to speak of the whole <e>", "<cs> well the more amendments that are not moved the more quickly we shall be able to get <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness has asked for reassurance which i am fairly confident i can bring in fact i reassure her <e> <s> the intention of the amendment is indeed to foster the development of the day centres <e> <s> it is further explicitly drafted to include the standard probation requirements such as regular reporting <e> <s> as to the out-patients issue that i think will take me a little longer to answer <e>", "<cs> that is what it is all about <e> <s> i think the noble lord lord hunt can be quite reassured about that <e> <s> that is why we are where we are <e> <s> on the question of out-patients i am not absolutely certain i have got the noble baronesss question right <e> <s> we might discuss this matter between this stage and the next <e> <s> there is concern if it is out-patients for mental treatment whether they would be entirely suitable <e> <s> i am speaking without sufficient particular knowledge about this <e> <s> if it is an issue that she wishes debated she can bring it forward at report stage <e> <s> if i can satisfy her in correspondence or conversation before then perhaps she would allow me to do so <e>", "<cs> the obviously important phrase is where it is appropriate and what i will try to discover is where it would be and where not <e> <s> i would not wish to mislead the committee about the day training centres <e> <s> what we are bringing about is that the four centres in question will continue under the new day centre powers i have described <e> <s> that is to say that the statutory day training centres will cease to exist in that form but the four centres will continue under the new day centres

some drunkenness offences for which imprisonment is still available being drunk in charge of a child or being drunk in charge of a loaded firearm for example <e> <s> these are serious offences for which it is right that the court should have the option of imprisonment but in general drunkenness offences do not in themselves merit imprisonment and indeed imprisonment is not available as a penalty either for simple drunkenness or for being drunk and disorderly <e>", "<cs> at the report stage perhaps the noble lord will explain how one can have a system whereby one is told what you have done is bad but it is not bad enough to put you in prison so we will make you pay a fine and if you do not pay the fine we shall not do anything more <e> <s> i brought in the reference to other cases

health <e> <s> that aside if the clause was adopted magistrates would lose the power to impose suspended sentences community service orders or hospital orders under the mental health act <e> <s> that

the crown court by persons remanded in custody to appear before magistrates courts <e>", "<cs> may i also take the opportunity to thank all noble lords who have exercised restraint and less generously those who have not exercised restraint on the length of their speeches <e>", "<cs> my lords as to the first part of my noble friends question we are dealing here with the common travel area formed by great britain the channel islands the republic of ireland northern ireland and the isle of man in which no immigration regulations as apply to other destinations exist and in view of the threat posed

majestys calm in the face of this difficult and very worrying situation <e> <s> the earlier incident involved a man on th june <e> <s> the man is now in custody and that is the man we are speaking of <e> <s> i would rather not be drawn into details of this event for two reasons <e> <s> one is the aspects of security which detailed discussion can reveal to others who are not aware of the situation <e> <s> the other is that with prosecution under consideration the matter is i am advised <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it proper that i should respond to detailed matters at a later stage although the noble lord lord aylestone will be aware of the fact that for the first time in many years the metropolitan police are now approaching their establishment figure <e> <s> i am not aware that any of the people in question had knowledge from outside of the inside of the palace but i cannot make reference to the particular circumstances of this occasion for the reasons i have already given <e>", "<cs> my lords the man about whom allegations are now being made is the man who was charged for the original offence <e>", "<cs> i have to emphasise again that the urgency with which this will be pursued is something that depends on the absolute conviction of my right honourable friend that it is a matter of the first importance not only out of his loyalty to her majesty as a loyal subject but in knowledge of the deep love and regard in which she is held by every member of this house and by the nation <e> <s> it will be pursued with ineluctable determination <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a question of the timing of the charge which did not in fact allow the custody to take place in time to prevent the offence <e> <s> as to the second question i shall have to let my noble friend know in writing <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely understand the concern felt by the noble baroness which is shared by her majestys government but for reasons i have given of security it really is not proper to discuss what those arrangements are or how to great surprise they were defeated <e>", "<cs> my lords i can confirm that the security arrangements at the other royal residences are also being reviewed <e> <s> in the process the general security of the royal family will be considered <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely anxious not to commit myself to making a statement that can be used in court about the first occasion <e> <s> as i understand it the identity of the first intruder was not clear <e> <s> i have already misled your lordships the identity of the intruder was not clear until the second occasion <e> <s> but i do not want to go any further than that because i am trespassing on ground that might be covered by courts and it would be improper for me to say anything which could prejudice the outcome of a trial <e>", "<cs> as a result of the incident which took place on friday morning my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i will bring that idea to the notice of my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> i am already aware that the noble lords amendment touches upon a matter which is the subject of very widespread and real concern <e> <s> i am aware of that not only from the careful and persuasive speech with which the noble lord lord underhill introduced the matter and from those noble lords elsewhere in the house who spoke in support of his amendment but also from the very considerable post bag which i have received on the subject <e> <s> another indication of course was the extensive debate held on this subject in another place <e> <s> indeed i must ask those of your lordships and they may be many who have read that debate as i have to forgive me if a little of what i say seems to be somewhat familiar and repetitive for that very reason <e> <s> for the benefit of noble lords whether in the chamber or reading <e>", "<cs> i take the noble lords point absolutely <e> <s> it was in fact the sort of machine that was used in the <e>", "<cs> my noble friend always urges difficult courses as though they were easy and the noble lord lord mishcon always makes what may be a thorny <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the noble lord lord underhill for giving me an opportunity to reply to what he said in conclusion to the debate on this amendment and i would refer first to his reference to the words of the learned judge in <e>", "<cs> perhaps i could take the noble lords mind on one idea which would be some form of procedure <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl makes an unwarranted assumption when he says that i would not wish to defend the present arrangement because it works rather well <e> <s> therefore i do not think although of course i will bring the noble earls concern to the attention of my right honourable friend that i will be pursuing it with quite the vigour that he would wish <e>", "<cs> my lords it is generally assumed that life sentences are meant to be longer than sentences for a determinate period <e>", "<cs> my lords the arrangements within the home office do in fact involve a very high level of advice to the home secretary in each case and in the case of the life sentence prisoner the home secretary has to have the advice of the lord chief justice and of the trial judge if he is available as well as a recommendation from the parole board <e> <s> the parole board of course also deals with determinate cases <e> <s> the discrepancy to which the noble lord refers is not as great as he supposes i think and rests entirely upon the merits of each case <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for the considerable courtesy of the way he introduced his question <e> <s> of course my right honourable friend always pays close attention to what is said in this house and will consider what the noble lord said in the second part of his question <e> <s> i should not like to make a more elaborate commitment than that beyond reassuring your lordships that although on the face of it there may appear to be an illogicality in remitting the rgime for life sentence prisoners to one minister and their release to another when you see the importance of the question of release in the context of criminal justice policy and public concern i think it is right that there should be a fresh pair of eyes looking at that particular issue at ministerial level but i will draw to the attention of my right honourable friend what the noble lord has said <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to my noble friend and i quite agree with him <e>", "<cs> my lords the question that i was asked related to england and wales an area with which i am modestly familiar <e> <s> things may well be different in scotland and that would probably be because the population differs at least in respect of number if not of anything else and presumably the criminal population is equally reduced <e>", "<cs> my lords even if that were the case it would be a different question <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i hoped to have given the impression that the monitoring process would set off an alarm bell if anything was going severely wrong and that of course would be a very loud alarm bell <e>", "<cs> my lords what i am saying is that the retrieval of the figures in an annual event and the figures for the year are therefore only coming out of the system now <e> <s> they then have to be processed <e> <s> that is what i am saying <e> <s> let me remind your lordships that the amendment itself is not addressed to the pilot schemes or to the stricter rgime itself it is addressed to the whole concept of detention orders <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble baroness will forgive me and i am most reluctant to interrupt her i am not certain whether she made that point in respect of the special rgime or of the whole system but it is of material importance because the amendment relates to the whole system of detention centres and not just to the special rgime <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord was inviting me to think and i thought that i ought to reply <e> <s> if the house would allow me to do so i would <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i will now repeat a statement being made in another place by my right honourable friend the home secretary <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords the statement was made in order that your lordships and members of another place should have this information from my right honourable friend and myself and not from another source <e> <s> the full context of what has taken place will be made apparent i can confirm on wednesday <e> <s> the duties of the queens police officer are to be responsible for the personal protection of her majesty when she attends public functions at buckingham palace and at all times when she is outside the palace <e> <s> he also supervises the personal protection of all members of the royal family <e> <s> the third point which arises from the noble and learned lords question is that superintendent hagon has already been appointed the queens police officer on an acting basis <e> <s> i think that what i have said will indicate to the noble lord lord wigoder that the queens police officer is so closely concerned with her security that this must be a matter for security concern <e>", "<cs> my lords in committee the house decided that statutory guidelines incorporating the three criteria set out in the first of these amendments should be added to the restriction on the imposition of custodial sentences on young offenders <e>", "<cs> my lords with the greatest of pleasure <e> <s> i welcome what the noble lord has said <e> <s> he has recognised that this is an embarrassing difficulty <e> <s> this situation has only very recently come to light i was only aware of it today <e> <s> as soon as there is a substantive amendment available i shall see that he and the front benches of the other parties and the noble baroness who speaks for the cross-benches have copies of it and also an explanatory note insofar as i am able to devise one to explain its effect and purposes of reaching that effect <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble baroness will give me her valuable and edited address list i shall try to do that also <e>", "<cs> my lords it has been urged on the government both here and in another place that we should not let juveniles be held in prisons for a substantial part or the whole of their sentences <e> <s> while we are short of places we cannot make such a concession in respect of group after group of trainees but we do recognise the strong case that the youngest should be kept out of prisons when at all possible <e> <s> that is why we amended this bill on nd june to make the provisions now in clause <e> <s> the effect of what is now of clause is that where a juvenile is not already subject to the training guarantee set out in subsection he may be held in a youth custody centre or a remand centre but not in a prison except in very limited circumstances <e> <s> those circumstances are specified in the subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords i am in some difficulty as to the procedure of the house <e> <s> having been rebuked for replying at inordinate length before i can only give a cautious estimate at this stage of the figures for which the noble lord asked <e> <s> i should not probably give them but perhaps your lordships will give me leave <e> <s> if there are about in the system at any one time and if the length of stay in each case is somewhere between one and two weeks your lordships will have to do the arithmetic more quickly than i can in order to get the answer before i sit down which i must now do <e>", "<cs> my lords i will first look at what this amendment actually does <e> <s> it relates to a young offender who is ineligible for a detention centre by virtue of his mental condition and who is instead sentenced to a short term of youth custody <e> <s> if it were to be accepted such an offender could be accommodated in a youth custody centre or in a remand centre but not as clause at present also provides in a prison <e> <s> perhaps inadvertently the amendment would also have the effect of preventing a mentally unfit offender from being held in a prison even temporarily <e> <s> i assume that that effect would be inadvertent because the temporary purposes for which <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> it is therefore not strictly relevant but i am trying to give approximations because approximations are all that i can produce <e> <s> i hope the noble lord will bear with me before he gives vent to his spleen until i have completed what i wanted to say <e> <s> well i have just done it in response to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the way in which the noble lord describes my manner he has also got my intention right <e>", "<cs> my lords if it is the noble lords intention to divide the house and silence any criticism of the amendment at the same time forfeiting any defence of the amendment then i am not sure that that is within the power of the noble lord to achieve <e> <s> i must repeat to your lordships that there are cogent reasons why the first amendment was not agreed to with a majority of this house and that is the only way in which it can be agreed to <e> <s> the noble lord has now cut off the pair of legs at one end of the table and is expecting us to address ourselves favourably to the others <e> <s> i think that the table would stand flat if we cut the legs off at that end too <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord who is intending to be helpful places me in a very difficult position <e> <s> i shall read the debate with the greatest care and i shall also read the division list with the greatest care <e> <s> in the light of that i will consider what has gone before <e> <s> however the fact remains that we have discussed the merits on one occasion <e> <s> your lordships have shown that you very nearly agreed with the noble lord and that you very nearly agreed with me and that actually you were equally divided <e> <s> but if the noble lord lord mishcon is asking me to bring an amendment to the house at third reading then that is something which at this short notice and without debate of this amendment i could not undertake <e> <s> i can undertake to read what the noble lord lord hunt and others have said in moving exchanges to see whether there is anything i can do in order to go some way towards what he wants <e> <s> but on the basis of the division as it was it is not something as regards which i can undertake to come back with an amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords with your lordships leave because we were discussing whether the amendment should be put we have now decided that it should be put and the noble lord has said that there are arguments in favour of it i shall also be brief <e> <s> people are apt to dismiss as irrelevant or bureaucratic arguments of administrative convenience <e> <s> all i want to do is to put a gloss on what i said before that <e>", "<cs> my lords at the risk of annoying your lordships by asking your indulgence a second time for speaking more than once i do not wish to appear curmudgeonly about this <e> <s> i recognise the narrowness of the division and i have already said that i shall look at this very carefully <e> <s> i cannot anticipate the result of that look <e> <s> i cannot say to your lordships that as we are exactly evenly divided on this i shall come back with something which will satisfy one per cent <e> <s> rather than the other <e> <s> but if what the noble lord lord harris said accurately expressed what the noble lord lord hunt thinks about this i am perfectly willing to consider the whole of this debate and the division list and the debate that produced that division list with my right honourable friend before the third reading to see whether in the light of that there is a new positon that we could take <e> <s> if that is of assistance to the noble lord i am very happy to offer it to him <e>", "<cs> my lords in committee i set out quite fully the reasons why the government cannot accept this amendment <e> <s> they were i think fairly substantial <e> <s> the argument put forward in support of the amendment was simply that young offenders should be treated in the same way as adults <e> <s> my lords i certainly agree that young offenders should not generally be denied any advantages which adult prisoners enjoy <e> <s> that is why parole will be available for those serving youth custody <e> <s> but it is not always and invariably possible to achieve exact parity because young offenders do not serve the same sentences as adult prisoners <e> <s> the crucial difference is that when young offenders are released from custody they are all under supervision <e> <s> adult prisoners are not <e> <s> the arrangements we make for young offenders on parole must take account of what happens to young offenders who are not released on parole <e> <s> that is what the present parole provisions do and that is what we are doing in clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for the opportunity provided by her amendment to say a few words about the development of senior attendance centres <e> <s> as was indicated in the white paper on <e>", "<cs> my lords we had reached not the end but an interesting caesura in my speech i regret and i apologise to the noble baroness on the woolsack that perhaps because this is an important issue i had spoken at greater than usual length and in my sitting down she understandably hoped that i had finished but i fear i have not <e> <s> perhaps i may return to my muttons and deal with the noble lord a little later <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether when she put that question to him she said that it would be entirely up to him whether such an order was made <e> <s> because he would have to give his consent before it was <e> <s> if so what on earth was the point of the hammer and nails <e> <s> presumably he would not accept the order <e>", "<cs> my lords it is most kind of my noble friend to give way again <e> <s> either the mother or the father has to agree before the order can be made <e> <s> the noble baroness is suggesting that the parents would not agree <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships have asked me many questions <e> <s> i shall not always attribute the question to the asker <e> <s> certainly the noble lord lord harris of greenwich was among those who were keenest that i should come clean i do not know whether that is the right phrase and should say a little more about what support and what opposition we have had to this requirement in our consultations <e>", "<cs> my lords during the committee stage my noble friend embarked upon a successful course of adding guidelines to the powers of the courts in <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness may have more experience of this than i but as i look at the law as it is now written it seems to me that the magistrates are required to see that there is no alternative to custody before they resort to custody <e> <s> to my innocent eye therefore it seems that what this does is superfluous <e>", "<cs> my lords the obligation in fact arises from a decision of the council made in september and until a uniform system is agreed in the manner which i stated there is no obligation which we can fulfil <e>", "<cs> my lords i had attempted to give a <e>", "<cs> my lords the consideration of that proposal is with the council of ministers and in fact is with a body of experts who have so far met three times <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the habit of this government as i hope of other governments to honour their obligations under treaty but the obligation is to do something when it is agreed by all the nations and we are a very long way from that <e> <s> it is years since the obligation was constructed for the parliament to make a suggestion before it came to the council at all <e> <s> so we are not moving very fast <e> <s> it is not just the government <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i will now repeat a statement being made in another place by my right honourable friend the home secretary <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the two noble lords for their reception of this statement <e> <s> your lordships will understand that i have little further information that i can give at this stage though it would seem from common sense clear that some sort of remote control was necessary for the explosions to take place <e> <s> i would not wish to give away anything about defensive measures being taken but i heartily endorse the acute need for the public to be aware of the necessity to spot anything suspicious and not to be shy or think it is not a matter with which to trouble the police <e> <s> if they see anything which makes them doubt then they should report it <e>", "<cs> my lords i think civilised people of every religion and in every country in the world will see that these deeds are not merely criminal but wicked <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with the noble lord that we need a framework of law within which the police force can with the vigilant support of the public counteract this despicable conduct <e>", "<cs> if there are no further speakers my lords i will endeavour to reply to this impressive debate <e> <s> i should like to start by thanking the noble lord lord bruce of donington for the extremely considerate or at least extremely perceptive way in which he introduced this debate into my personal context like a cross-bar between the two down-strokes of an h <e> <s> a very compressed day it has proved to be with its own alarms and excursions <e> <s> i am grateful also to those of your lordships who put your names down to speak <e> <s> one way of estimating the importance of an event is to see the number and indeed the calibre of speakers whose names are on the list <e> <s> while i say nothing against the calibre of speakers whose names were on the paper when i saw it earlier today certainly their number was a good deal less than it has since become <e> <s> but all that is by the way <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will allow me to put a marker in my pile so that i do not get lost i will give way <e>", "<cs> my lords i will endeavour to satisfy the noble lords question a little later on <e> <s> i was saying that miss luczaks leave was extended for a further year and when a relationship such as hers has lasted for some time it was the practice eventually to grant settlement but there were always significant doubts about the stability of her relationship and those doubts proved justified only four months after her last grant of leave to remain <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that it is material to this case but i shall be quite happy to correct myself in retrospect if it proves to be wrong <e> <s> i was saying that in august as i understand it the relationship came to an end and she informed the <e>", "<cs> my lords again i will revert to this <e> <s> i think i am right in saying that it was to the original and not to the latter address <e> <s> however be that as it may i have said that i will revert to this later she left the united kingdom on th december <e> <s> my lords it is as i thought the letter was sent to the original that it so say the other address <e> <s> she returned on rd january this year having spent just one week with relatives in germany <e>", "<cs> my lords nobody is saying that the visit was not <e>", "<cs> my lords i begin by saying that i think i understand the noble lord lord hutchinson aright in that his intention is to give a judge who presides at a crown court trial the power to grant bail pending an appeal <e> <s> the new clause as drafted does not i think achieve that end <e> <s> as i read it it still gives the power to all crown court judges not just the one who presided at the trial <e> <s> the expression court of trial means the crown court which is one court although it sits in many divisions and in many places <e> <s> that is an important technicality which must be got right <e> <s> the new clause also seems to preclude the possibility of the court of appeals revoking bail if it thought that was appropriate <e> <s> as there might be changes in circumstances which rendered such a course appropriate i would have thought that would be a most understandable fetter on the court of appeal <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is most kind to give way <e> <s> with the leave of the house i would mention that i have a number of points but i feel that <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i will now repeat a statement which is being made in another place by my right honourable friend the home secretary <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords for the way they have taken this very important statement and which has emphasised the fact that it lies at the heart of the concern of this nation <e> <s> if i may reply to lord bostons first question i think the answer must be that we shall never be satisfied that everything possible is being done we shall always exert ourselves to find out new ways to make security more secure <e> <s> but at the moment and i think that the noble lord will see this borne out when he reads in <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the endorsement of the noble lord lord harris of greenwich of a number of the steps that my right honourable friend has taken and i welcome also his personal endorsement of the stature of my right honourable friend which i believe to be considerable <e> <s> i will of course bring to the attention of my right honourable and learned friend the concern expressed by the noble lord and by the noble lord lord wigoder regarding the matter of contempt of court <e>", "<cs> my lords if such an amendment could be drafted and tabled in the time although it would be unusual in the conventions of this house to achieve legislation in that way it might be a useful thing <e> <s> however my right honourable friend has been considering this matter and he feels it is not really the way to legislate on such a fundamental matter at such very short notice quite apart from the need for parliamentary consideration and that really the patient solution is likely to be the better one whatever our anxieties may be at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord will find from perusing <e>", "<cs> my lords i can undertake that it is a matter of great urgent concern <e> <s> i cannot undertake that the problem will be elucidated as quickly as the noble earl and indeed we ourselves would wish it to be <e> <s> however it is not at all a simple matter to construct an offence even if it is differently expressed from the aspirations expressed by the noble lord in his first question <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with the noble lord that crime must not pay and non-crime should not pay either <e> <s> i take to heart what the noble lord says and i will put it to my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is useful for your lordships to deplore the conduct of the press when it is not as it should be and of course the press council exists also for that purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we should not get too deeply into this matter but if the noble lord will recall two occasions were involved and for one of them there is a remand in custody <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord wigoder has raised a matter of considerable significance <e> <s> i am grateful to him for the opportunity he has provided by his amendment for the issue to be debated <e> <s> the act empowers a court which passes a sentence of imprisonment of not more than two years to order that the sentence shall not take effect unless during a period of not less than one year or more than two years the offender commits a further imprisonable offence <e>", "<cs> i shall try to do so my lords <e> <s> i take it that what the noble baroness is saying is that the second offence was so much less grave than the first offence <e> <s> if it was sufficiently less grave to be a non-imprisonable offence then the matter would not arise because it is imprisonable offences with which we are concerned <e> <s> i take it that whatever he did when he ran out of the pub was something for which he could be imprisoned <e>", "<cs> my lords it is very difficult to argue particular cases off the cuff when one has not actually seen them but i will certainly try to digest what the noble baroness has said <e> <s> perhaps i may return to what i was trying to say which was that in reverting to the original circumstances it seems that what the noble lord lord wigoder is doing is producing a proposal for an element of resentencing between courts of equal status <e> <s> that is a dubious principle <e> <s> doubts about the first sentence should be dealt with not at the same level but on appeal <e> <s> if on the other hand the doubts are only about the second instance then it is the circumstances of the second instance which ought to be taken into consideration <e> <s> i would like to know whether the noble lord really wants to press this rather doubtful principle of resentencing into the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord wigoder is the judge of the stage at which i might most profitably do so <e> <s> sometimes the pigeons do not fly quite fast enough <e> <s> what i wanted to say was simply this two practical considerations have been put to me with which i am not entirely familiar <e> <s> i have grave doubts about the general principle <e> <s> some of the things the noble lord has said have been extremely reasonable and anyone from the shires will know what i mean when i say that when one gets into the monday country one has to go very carefully <e> <s> that being so and without wishing to raise any hopes in the mind of the noble lord other than those which might already repose there it might be a good thing if i considered this a little further before third reading <e> <s> i am giving no undertakings other than that i will do that in the light of the material which has been brought forward <e> <s> this is a lengthy introduction and if the noble lord has anything else he wishes me to consider perhaps he could bring it into his peroration <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i could start by putting this in context <e> <s> what we are discussing is a schedule which describes those people who may not <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord will find that arson with intent to endanger life arson endangering life is already covered by the schedule <e> <s> however i will keep all this on board while i look at the noble lords amendment between this stage and the next one <e>", "<cs> my lords let us start by looking at what now happens and with two eminent ex-chairmen of the parole board and one probably silent chairman present i shall be corrected if i am wrong <e> <s> as i explained at an earlier stage when a life sentence prisoner has been detained for three to four years and in some cases it may be earlier the joint committee meets to consider the facts of the case and all the reports that have been made on the prisoner during his detention so far <e> <s> it then either recommends a date when the case should be referred to the local review committee or if it is clear that he could not be released for several years or not immediately clear how soon he might be released asks to see the case again after a specified interval <e>", "<cs> my lords i am trying to establish whether what the noble earl is denouncing is what i am describing and he has now confirmed that it is <e> <s> as was made clear more than once in the debate officials are in a minority on the joint committee <e> <s> senior members of the parole board including the boards chairman and vice-chairman form the majority and it is right that that should be so because the committee is in effect winnowing the cases to be presented to the local review committee and the full board so as to present to them only those cases with at least some prospect of success <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged for that comment because i am anxious to learn <e> <s> what the noble lord lord hunt is saying is wanted is an indication to the prisoner of the progress of what i might call his case and that did not seem to me to be the principal object of the amendment <e> <s> i am informed that the prisoner knows at every stage of the review and i see the noble lord lord harris a more recent occupant of the hot seat nodding his head <e> <s> that being so i think what lord hunt has advanced is somewhat weakened <e>", "<cs> my lords it is difficult to deal with such views put in one after the other <e> <s> noble lords are saying that there should be personal contact and the noble lord lord avebury is saying that where the person is a foreigner it is better that the translation should be done verbally than on paper so the point he makes is the same as the point other noble lords are making <e> <s> i have to be advised in these things and when i look at the annual report of the board for i see that personal hearings while they might work to the advantage of the sophisticated criminal could disadvantage the unsure and the inarticulate <e> <s> i am quoting the parole board in its report and i should have thought that the members of the board are the people with the most direct experience <e> <s> then <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down <e>", "<cs> my lords i am an optimist <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble earl will be kind enough to give some indication whether it is the frequency or the formality of the review with which he is principally concerned or is it the immediacy aspect <e> <s> that is the personal interview which the noble lord lord avebury has rather emphasised might be the main concern <e> <s> if the noble earl would give such an indication i would be clearer about the focus of his intentions <e>", "<cs> my lords as it happened i specifically exempted the chairman of the board <e> <s> it is a small point <e>", "<cs> my lords at the committee stage the noble lord brought to the house a proposal for a scheme for supervised release which my noble friend lord campbell of alloway showed to be mandatory and in which the element of discretion was entirely executive <e> <s> after much discussion he prudently took it away and he has now as he threatened brought it back <e> <s> it has undergone a certain amount of surgery in the interval with the result that the court now does have a discretion <e> <s> in what the noble lord sees as <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know that the analogy is false but i am merely using the arguments in exactly the same circumstances that the noble lord has used them himself against my discretionary scheme <e> <s> i was told that the scheme that we have in the bill is discretionary and will not therefore certainly reduce the prison population whereas the scheme produced in the amendment when it came to this house at committee was automatic and it would not reduce the prison population <e> <s> that was the principle reason that it was commended to your lordships <e> <s> now your lordships opposite have introduced the discretionary element and if you had done so in an unfettered way as it is in our arrangements then the noble lords amendment is open to exactly the same objections as what is in the bill <e> <s> if on the other hand he had not then it does not meet the objections of the judiciary which it claims to do <e>", "<cs> my lords i am

see why i should be denied that pleasure <e> <s> i was saying that it would be less welcome to the taxpayer because that same supervisory effort though of limited and doubtful benefit will give rise to certain and inescapable costs <e> <s> i think it will be less welcome to the prisoner who would stand to serve a slightly larger portion of his sentence <e> <s> those various counts all add up to a great many discontented customers <e> <s> i hope that your lordships too will feel discontented and will follow me to the left below the bar if the noble lord presses this to a division <e>", "<cs> exactly my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord was good enough to give way so that i might intervene <e> <s> i now have before me the submissions of the national association of probation officers the conference of chief probation officers and the central council of probation and aftercare committees all of whom express grave reservations <e> <s> i think it right to put that on the record <e> <s> the noble lord was then addressing himself to the overcrowding which we are all aware of but what your lordships have to accept is that we want a method that will produce certain results and this method is no more certain than what we propose and it has certain disadvantages <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord wigoder for returning to the charge and being able to move this amendment himself at the report stage on a principle which has already exercised us <e> <s> i think i have made it clear already that the governments view is that any proposal to increase remission equally for all prisoners or any class of prisoner from the present one-third of the sentence to one-half is open to fundamental objections which i have already outlined in previous debates in relation to supervised release <e> <s> i do not propose to preface my remarks by going over the ground of the comparison between the partly suspended sentence and the scheme of supervised

brief i will give way to him but after that i must stick to my irons <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble lord for that interruption and for his brevity <e> <s> i observe of course that on occasion judges recommend that life sentences should have a minimum period to run and i was under the impression that judges were concerned about the length of time a prisoner remains in prison <e> <s> but if the noble lord corrects me i stand corrected <e> <s> as i made clear at the committee stage we are certainly not opposed in principle to extending the benefits of parole to a wider range of prisoners provided that the principle of selectivity is not undermined <e>", "<cs> my lords it is and it does <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house if the noble lord would be kind enough to give way may i point out that this is the report stage and i do not think that the noble lord moved this amendment which does not give him a right of reply and he appears now to be making a second speech <e> <s> i am very ready to be corrected if i am wrong but i think that he is probably out of order <e> <s> is that not right <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not a question of my wishing to deal with it or not <e> <s> both the noble lord and i have now used up our ration of speech at the report stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i would never expect to leap at once on something which the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones did not find obvious <e> <s> incidentally i regret that he did not receive the document i hoped he might have had which explains some aspects of this matter but not the aspect to which he applies <e> <s> plainly the effects of this bill will be carried into the legislation with which the noble and learned lord is concerned and i imagine that the manuals will be updated <e> <s> this is an important matter and i will find out the machinery by which it is actually achieved and will write to the noble and learned lord at the first opportunity <e> <s> i can tell him that the provisions are now scattered throughout the armed forces acts and that they will probably be consolidated in <e> <s> the noble lord is anxious no doubt to know how justice will be conducted in the armed forces between now and and i shall try to enlighten him <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i can start by saying and this will illuminate the last two exchanges that in most instances an attachment of earnings order is very much a soft option for the offender <e> <s> when such an order is made all the duty for making regular payments to the court which settle the fine passes away from the offender on to the shoulders of the employer <e> <s> i imagine that if the employer is the crown the employer stands in rather a different relationship to the court than if he is a private person or a corporation <e> <s> the offender when the order is made is relieved of any need to discipline himself to make the payments although of course he loses the money <e> <s> therefore it has certain attractions from the offenders point of view <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure which of us is being silly <e> <s> it seems to me that the court is in a position to do exactly what the noble lord wants it is just a question of the mood of the verb in which it is expressed <e> <s> perhaps he can discuss it with me afterwards but the substance of what the noble baroness wants is there to be had <e>", "<cs> my lords the processes by which this sort of legislation is generated are complex and slow and it was not apparent until a latish stage that it would be possible to have it ready for your lordships in time for this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords the long title of the bill and i will not read it out in full because the noble lord has it before him at the end says <e>", "<cs> my lords the purpose of the bill is to try to reduce the population of the prison which is what everybody is urging us to do <e> <s> the noble lord lord donaldson has taken my right honourable friend to task for not having sufficiently acknowledged the crucial rle which the reports of her majestys chief inspector play in this purpose <e> <s> the appointment is central to what the bill sets out to do <e>", "<cs> my lords the long title and the bill itself are about the sentencing and treatment of offenders and the inspector of prisons inspects the treatment of offenders <e>", "<cs> my lords this can go on for ever <e> <s> it seems to me that where you have courts with a power to sentence to institutions inspected by an inspector there is a close connection between the court and the inspector and that is the person of the prisoner and the building of the prison <e>", "<cs> my lords i am always anxious to provide the noble lord lord melchett with an agreeable nightcap but perhaps his prospect of getting it would be better in the bar than in the chamber <e> <s> nonetheless i do not think that we are very far apart at least in what we wish to achieve <e> <s> the new clause would require that a caution be issued to a first-time offender who admits the offence save in the case of serious offences <e> <s> it would thus remove from the police and others who want to bring criminal proceedings against first-time offenders for non-serious offences the discretion to prosecute <e> <s> it has a number of clear technical deficiencies and would give rise to a number of perverse results <e> <s> i shall not go over these i will come straight to the issues of principle which the noble lord has raised <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the sympathetic approach of my noble friend that i have to wait upon before i can reply to the noble and learned lord <e> <s> the answer is that they are not published but they are not secret <e> <s> if the noble and learned lord thinks it would be helpful to have them available either to his noble friend or otherwise i will discuss that with him if that would be helpful <e>", "<cs> my lords these amendments came somewhat late before your lordships and changed their guise in one respect even later <e> <s> however their principal effect to which i shall address myself appears now to be to give to almost any person detained under the immigration act a presumptive right to bail <e> <s> at present the only detainees under the act who may apply for bail are those who either have an appeal pending or who after seven days are still held for questioning at a port and except in certain circumstances there is no presumption in favour of it <e> <s> this position will be a little altered by what was done in this bill in another place <e> <s> at the committee stage the government moved amendments to deal with a small and specific difficulty in relation to people recommended for deportation by the court <e> <s> under the present law such persons are detained unless the court directs their release and that release cannot be made subject to conditions <e> <s> we accepted that it was desirable for courts to have the power to impose conditions in these cases and we did so because that would enable more people to be released and this as the noble lord lord avebury rightly pointed out is what the government amendments are designed to achieve <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord refers to a point which i did not pick up from his earlier speech when he referred to the particular case of mr <e> <s> butt which is relevant to what he is saying <e> <s> he could of course always apply for <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept the apology of the noble lord for not giving me notice of this difficult question and of course his position was difficult because he had only whatever it is days notice that an amendment such as this was coming down and it was published i think only a few days ago <e> <s> however the government are particularly alert to questions of relevance in respect of this bill and have taken considerable care over such matters <e> <s> i am advised that this amendment is relevant to the bill because it deals with the problem of when proceedings can be brought against a person for the offence of overstaying under section <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords as your lordships will have learned from the as always lucid explanation of the noble lord lord mishcon the effect would be to delete the new section a of the powers of criminal courts act which is inserted by schedule with which the noble lord was wrestling at the committee stage <e> <s> this new section deals with the powers of courts to include requirements in probation orders <e> <s> it was among the provisions which i introduced as an amendment during the committee stage and these innovations were made in response to the judgment of this house in its judicial capacity in the case of <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to trespass on the patience of your lordships which has not been tested by the noble lord lord mishcon because he has every right to speak twice when he is moving his own amendment but i fear that i fell into the trap of forgetting that the noble lord was telescoping what he had to say to cover both amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged to my noble friend lord renton for his robust emphasis on a point which i would have put with much greater circumspection and much less effect <e> <s> certainly i would not have provoked two speeches from the noble lord the former lord chancellor at report stage i am sure by my tantalising remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord avebury raised this matter in committee when i said that we entirely shared his desire that prisoners should in general be able to serve their sentences in establishments <e>", "<cs> the point i am anxious to make my lords is that that would be based on nationality and <e>", "<cs> my lords i am tempted to ask the noble lord lord avebury to prompt me regarding this question but of course the convention is not yet set in concrete <e> <s> the convention would require not the application of the prisoner but his consent that he be returned <e> <s> that is quite a different matter <e> <s> one can imagine that there are certain countries to which nobody would wish to be returned and the convention would not require a prisoner to be returned to such a country against his will <e> <s> if the noble lord wishes us to say that there are certain scotsmen who would wish not to be returned to scotland i think it unlikely that we would do that except under circumstances of considerable constraint <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say that of course the position is the same if he comes from cornwall <e> <s> what i am trying to say is that the concept of nationality is different from the concept of where ones home is <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a slight <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe the most speedy thing for me to do is to say that if indeed there is a point of substance in what the noble lord has said i have his point on board and if it is necessary to do anything as a result it will be done <e> <s> i understand that it is not likely that anything should be done <e>", "<cs> my lords what i have to say is not lengthy and i will try to curtail it in the circumstances <e> <s> as i have said before we do not think it right to deprive the lower courts entirely of the option of the short custodial penalty which is what this amendment seeks to do <e> <s> there may be cases in which a short sentence of imprisonment would be appropriate for example when the offender has had previous convictions <e> <s> those who want to amend the penalties for possession of cannabis have pointed out and the noble lord lord avebury has referred to the number of persons sent to prison as a result of current legislation <e>", "<cs> the amendments actually deal with the treatment of the offender in the different jurisdiction <e> <s> it does not alter the provisions of section of the act which govern the circumstances in which a transfer can be made <e> <s> they only affect how the offender is to be treated in the receiving jurisdiction <e> <s> the intention is to see that there shall be neither benefit nor disbenefit as a result of the change of location in the application of the sentence <e> <s> i hope that that has reassured the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords it is very pleasant to sit as it were in the carriage receiving these bouquets <e> <s> i can only say that everything that noble lords who are my friends on all sides of the house have said is reciprocated from this side <e> <s> these have been very trying times and your lordships have been patient when on a number of occasions i got into certain difficulties with my brief or my memory <e> <s> your lordships have been most kind and i am most grateful for the help we have had <e>", "<cs> my lords the government fully recognise the importance of the -plus age group <e> <s> following consultations the secretary of state has <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the first question of the noble baroness is no i do not need reminding <e> <s> in answer to her further questions i may say that my right honourable friend the secretary of state for education and science announced days ago a programme of development projects in seven or eight local education authority areas in england volunteering if they will to begin in september <e> <s> it will take until then to get the local authorities to volunteer and the plans for the new schemes to be approved and agreed upon <e> <s> we hope that they will enable authorities to put into practice some of their own ideas for new approaches to the education of the lower-attaining pupils especially in the last two years of compulsory education <e> <s> of course it is important that the interests of these children be looked to at every stage of their education <e> <s> but the question relates to this particular phase and i am convinced that what is being proposed <e>", "<cs> my lords with the exception of a very few cases of talented people that is not a profitable form of instruction for later life <e>", "<cs> my lords the government and previous governments are deeply obliged to the contribution which the noble lord himself has made in arriving at that understanding <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that that is probably a separate issue but i will consider it further in the columns of <e>", "<cs> my lords i would doubt if it was but it is not the subject of the present question which concerns improving the position in schools for the less academic children <e> <s> my right honourable friend has announced a very impressive programme for that in an experimental way <e> <s> the number of areas which still have bipartite systems of education are extremely few and i should not wish to enter into debate now to cover ground which we covered with so much passion in this house many years ago <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has stated a self-evident point but it does not amount to a question <e>", "<cs> my lords with the particular example of the noble lord in mind i shall with very great enthusiasm bring his interest to my right honourable friends notice <e>", "<cs> my lords this provision permits local authorities which have adopted schedule to refuse an application for a sex establishment licence on the grounds that an applicant is unsuitable to hold a licence by reason of having been convicted of an offence or for any other reason <e> <s> the government will be drawing the provision to the attention of local authorities and the police by circular in the normal way <e> <s> it will be for local authorities to determine the information they may reasonably require of applicants and they will do so in the knowledge that the police must receive copies of all applications and may submit observations upon them <e>", "<cs> my lords applicants are bound to give notice of an application to the chief officer of police <e> <s> the chief officer may submit observations on or objections to the application <e> <s> he would no doubt draw attention to any matters which cast doubt on the accuracy of an application <e> <s> perhaps i should tell your lordships that the local authority has power in effect under paragraph of schedule to require applicants to state whether they have been previously convicted <e> <s> all applications must be copied to the police under paragraph and any applicant giving false information commits an offence and will be liable to prosecution and a fine of up to <e> <s> an applicant will therefore either disclose his previous record spontaneously or suffer the risk of its being discovered by the police and making himself liable to prosecution and clearly unsuitable to have a licence <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the grounds are any wider than when we so recently discussed this subject on committee and report stage of the bill <e> <s> the paragraph is paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords there is an obligation on the police to receive the copies of the application the local authority is plainly going to ask the police authority for their comments on the application itself and the police have access to the criminal record and beyond that it is really impossible to see how much further one can go <e>", "<cs> my lords i should be very surprised if the local authority decided otherwise <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i will consider carefully what the noble baroness has asked me <e> <s> i do not think there is such a substantial difficulty as she imagines because local authorities will themselves have strong views on who are suitable people to conduct these establishments <e> <s> if the applicants do not come up to those standards then they have every reason not to give them a licence <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i am trying to recall a similar question which the noble lord asked me some weeks ago and on which i found it necessary to shelter his ignorance in benefit of his character <e> <s> a sex establishment is a place such as is frequently found in places like soho purveying things about which the noble lord has already made it clear he does not know a great deal and more strength to his elbow <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is always libellous to make allegations of criminal activities which have not been proved <e> <s> there is nothing libellous about the naming to a particular individual of convictions which have not elapsed under the rehabilitation of offenders act <e>", "<cs> my lords the irish government are as conscious as we are of the need to stamp out ira terrorism <e> <s> monitoring the movements of criminals and exchanging information about them are matters for police forces rather than for governments <e> <s> there is close co-operation between police forces in the united kingdom and the police in the republic of ireland on a wide range of matters <e> <s> as your lordships will have noticed both police forces worked together to excellent effect in the arrest and assembling of evidence against gerard tuite who was sentenced to ten years imprisonment after conviction in dublin of an offence of the possession of explosives which had been committed in london <e> <s> for obvious reasons it would not be appropriate to enter into details about procedures for passing information <e>", "<cs> my lords any government who said they were satisfied with their methods of dealing with terrorism would be uttering a prelude to catastrophe <e> <s> we shall never be satisfied but very considerable resources and ingenuity are expended to this effect <e> <s> i am well aware of the hideous tally of crime to which my noble friend refers and to a number of those which remain unresolved <e> <s> i trust that those who perpetrated them will not for a moment mistakenly think that they are now ever free of the danger of conviction <e> <s> as to the prevention of terrorism act i believe it was in my noble friends mind to ask that it should be applied to people coining from places other than ireland and indeed it does apply to people coming to this country from the continent as well <e>", "<cs> my lords the report of the royal commission on criminal procedure was published in january of last year <e> <s> the question tabled by the noble lord lord wigoder provides a timely and welcome opportunity for her majestys government to respond to the recommendations made in the second part of that report and i am grateful to him too for giving occasion for the interesting contributions of the five other noble lords who have spoken in the debate <e>", "<cs> i think my lords that although the noble lord lord wigoder asked a question i can stretch the rules of order to the extent of giving a monosyllabic reply which is what i would have done the answer to his question is yes <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are aware of and share the distaste which my noble friend expresses for the practices she describes <e> <s> the inquiry of the press council was mounted following the public outcry last year at the time of the yorkshire ripper trial concerning the alleged activities of certain newspapers to secure information and stories from sutcliffes family <e> <s> it concerns all aspects of press coverage of the arrest and trial of peter sutcliffe in the light of the councils declared views on cheque book journalism and we hope that this will result in a proper regulation of the practice <e>", "<cs> my lords i am concerned to see that opinion influences the press council sufficiently to make them take effective steps <e>", "<cs> my lords where legal proceedings have been initiated any publication which creates a substantial risk of impeding or prejudicing the course of justice in those proceedings is likely to constitute a contempt of court under the act <e> <s> a defence however is that the risk is merely incidental to the discussion in good faith of matters of general public interest <e>", "<cs> my lords there are so many mistakes to which the liberal party must come round to a view of that i could not say if that is even a contender <e>", "<cs> my lords my figures are a little more recent <e> <s> i support my noble friends statement that the scottish experience is successful <e> <s> in the first months of operation of the new power just over one-third of the or so persons stopped and searched were found to have an offensive weapon on them <e>", "<cs> my lords i can confirm that we want to have a uniform procedure throughout the country and that at present there is a patchwork of local enactments which ought to be superseded <e> <s> as the noble lord asked and as the royal commission recommended it is also intended to rationalise existing powers of stop and search in relation to stolen goods by extending them throughout england and wales and to create a new power in relation to housebreaking implements <e>", "<cs> my lords since the noble lords question lacks any definition of the term peace studies i can only answer that the government regard it as essential that what is offered in any institution should always be education and never indoctrination <e>", "<cs> my lords i note the noble lords interest and i would point out that the parliamentary under-secretary of state in any department is never a member of the cabinet i say with regret <e> <s> as to trojan horses i have not read my honourable friends precise words but any subject can be a trojan horse and it must be the case that the quality and content <e>", "<cs> yes my lords and i would go on to say that the sort of balanced analysis of human behaviour which the noble lord lord hatch of lusby quite rightly thinks should be pursued in our schools has for many generations been pursued in the subjects of history geography and economics <e>", "<cs> my lords in response to that i should like to say that peace like salvation is very greatly to be desired and our concern is that in their consideration of how to achieve it our young people should be given guidance which is realistic and balanced <e> <s> prejudice in pursuit of either aim is a fatal handicap <e>", "<cs> my lords the first half of my noble friends supplementary question i note with great interest in the context of lord hatchs declaration of interest <e> <s> as to the second i am well aware that there is a wide unease about this subject but as i said in my opening reply it has not actually been defined and it does not in the terms of secondary education as i understand it yet lend itself to definition <e> <s> what matters is the quality of the teachers and the way they put across what they are teaching <e> <s> it is my experience that a good teacher will give good guidance irrespective of his own personal convictions or prejudices in either direction on matters in which children ought to be taught to make up their own minds and that is what we want to pursue <e>", "<cs> my lords i would entirely agree and i am tempted to follow that theme wider into the area of the question of the validity of deterrence as a means of keeping the peace but in order to keep the peace in your lordships house i thought i would not <e>", "<cs> my lords her majestys government do not exercise censorship over what goes into schools unless it is obscene <e> <s> the publications of her majestys government are available to all schools and so indeed are the publications of the government of the soviet union <e> <s> it is to make up their minds that our children must be taught <e>", "<cs> my lords i would never dissociate myself from the words of my honourable friend on such an invitation as i have now been offered <e> <s> but i would say as i said at the beginning that the term as used is not defined in our schools and i am not prepared to condemn out of hand something which the noble lord has not specifically described <e> <s> if the noble lords question is addressed to matters other than the schools i ought to apprise myself of that also <e> <s> but i do not think that will be helped if all my noble friends and i were to tramp through the classrooms in the first instance <e>", "<cs> my lords while i always have the highest regard for what my noble friend suggests i do not think that it is proper to use legislation as an instrument of propaganda warfare <e>", "<cs> my lords it will be for the house to decide on the speed of its passage <e> <s> i think that it is already placed on the timetable <e>", "<cs> my lords i can never regard my noble friend without joy whatever his opinions <e>", "<cs> my lords that is largely why about of the falkland islanders which is the vast majority of the population will automatically become british citizens at the beginning of next year <e> <s> we are talking of a balance of about who will have direct access to british soil should they wish to have it and who will be able to take up residence here <e> <s> my noble friend also referred to gibraltar <e> <s> the distinction between the two is of course that the gibraltarians will be within the bounds of the european economic community and as such are technically already with us in nationality <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the noble lords bill is down on the timetable for a second reading and your lordships will make up your minds about it when it reaches that stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged to my noble friend for enabling me to correct an impression that i wrongly gave <e> <s> i understood that he was asking whether it was not appropriate to bring in legislation in response to an advertisement taken by wealthy argentinians

be drawn on issues of responsibility <e> <s> i have already said that i do not think that this is a matter of propaganda warfare except in the terms to which my noble friend referred at the beginning of our exchanges <e> <s> i think that i have made the case that every citizen of the falkland islands will either become a british citizen automatically on st january next year or have the opportunity so to do if they wish <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be difficult to promote the people of the falkland islands higher in the esteem or the sympathy of either this house or the country <e>", "<cs> my

run from st january till st march <e> <s> we will not place obstacles in the way of young people wishing to remain in full-time or part-time education and the numbers doing so continue to rise to a

the academic to the totally non-academic <e> <s> the noble lord is referring to the latter and that is the area in which there is the greatest expansion <e> <s> however many who have undertaken university degree courses in their youth will recognise that there is room for general education as well as specialist education at about the age of <e>", "<cs> my lords we are using the existing plant <e> <s> a feature of what we are doing is to use it more productively and what we are doing i think is not doubtful but practical <e>", "<cs> my lords i can relieve my noble friends bewilderment

would have been given <e> <s> i can confirm that we included million in the rate support grant settlement for to allow authorities to restore their expenditure on school books and equipment to its level and there is some evidence to suggest that even prior to this there had been some increase in the level of purchases of school books <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is the experience that they usually are <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to a question at the end of last week i was at pains to show how this is happening and the very great importance which the government attach to the

of an enactment to which he contributed considerably and which will i hope shortly reach the statute book <e>", "<cs> my lords with great respect i believe that i should remind your lordships that this is a third reading debate <e> <s> i did wait to rise to my feet for the second time with your lordships permission until i saw i thought that nobody else wished to ask me any questions <e> <s> i will try to wait a little longer in future but after this amendment i do not think that i will seek to <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very glad it has been done in such a practical way <e> <s> as i was saying when i indicated our intention on report the need for this only came to light at a very late date <e> <s> i hope as many of your lordships as wanted it have received some explanation in writing from me <e> <s> the amendment deals with a complex and technical matter of sentence calculation <e> <s> it amends clause of the bill and that in turn amends section of the criminal justice act <e> <s> it sounds complicated but i think the principle can be expressed fairly simply <e> <s> clause gives effect to a widely welcomed change in the basis on which sentences imposed on young offenders are calculated <e> <s> section of the act allows time spent in custody on remand to count towards a sentence <e> <s> at present such remand time does not count towards detention centre or borstal sentences <e> <s> clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i refer to the last point first <e> <s> it is our intention to ask local authorities to provide this information and also for the courts to ask for it if necessary <e> <s> however we shall consider whether an amendment to the court rules will be necessary in the light of our experience <e> <s> that is a means of accomplishing our aim without legislation <e> <s> as to the other points your lordships have raised <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall return to that <e> <s> what i said was that if it proved necessary to achieve that aim which we are determined to achieve it would be possible to achieve it by means of the court rules if it was not sufficient merely to do it by what the noble lord would call exhortation <e>", "<cs> my lords i also shall be extremely brief but i think it right to say that the noble and learned lord referred earlier to sentences of six months <e> <s> i think that those must have been remands in secure custody because it would be very rare to have remands in care for six months <e> <s> i merely wanted to put the record straight i do not want to have another go at the noble and learned lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to confirm to the noble lord that the grapevine is in this case correct <e> <s> if it had not been it would have been embarrassing for both of us <e> <s> on report we had a valuable debate on amendments tabled by the noble lord lord hunt to restrict powers to hold in prisons juveniles that is people under the age of who receive sentences of less than days <e> <s> i undertook to consider all that was said in debate and to see whether there was scope for change <e> <s> the government share the view of this house that juveniles should be kept out of prisons if at all possible and noble lords will remember that with that in mind we had already amended clause at the committee stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i set out in committee and at the report stage the governments views on the amendment now forming the first part of this amendment <e> <s> if the noble lord had merely moved that amendment once more the government would have found it unacceptable <e> <s> the government attach considerable importance to the supervision arrangements for young offenders <e> <s> the period under supervision is an integral part of the sentence and as i said at the committee stage an offender who has been in custody is likely to be in a vulnerable state and a supervising officer could provide him with both firm guidance and support of a practical kind <e> <s> the government have been concerned that no change should be <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble baroness lady masham for that practical intervention because it underlines one of my own views on the amendment <e> <s> on report your lordships accepted after a substantial and serious debate the governments proposals for a night restriction requirement as part of the supervision order the detailed provisions are set out in clause <e> <s> opinions were divided but the house made its decision and therefore i do not think i should address myself too much to the question of the principle of whether or not night supervision orders are a good thing <e> <s> i have a copy of a letter to which the noble lord lord donaldson referred on the last occasion and to which the noble baroness lady david referred this time though i find in it support for what i propose <e> <s> she mentioned many others <e>", "<cs> my lords they are perfectly free to do so but a discretion remains with the supervisor as to what action he then takes <e> <s> no doubt he will consider his action in the light of the youngsters general conduct in respect of the supervision order <e> <s> but as i understand it <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall sit down if the noble lord will allow me to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords it is exactly as the noble lord has said and as i have said <e> <s> i am sorry if i said it unintelligibly <e> <s> the parents have consented to the order but they are under no obligation under it to split on the child <e> <s> that is what would think the noble lord would hope was the case <e> <s> it is certainly what i think <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to noble lords for their useful contributions to this debate <e> <s> we have heard two agnostics three infidels and one person of sound religion so far as i can work out the analogy which we appear to be using <e> <s> i am entirely orthodox in this matter <e> <s> i understand that there are really two legs on which the noble lords amendment stands <e> <s> one of them is what i call the resources leg and there is an analogy here is there not with community service orders <e> <s> that is that it might not for resource reasons be possible to implement the provision at the same time in different areas <e> <s> but the resource reasons are extremely limited <e> <s> it will of course depend from area to area upon the extent of enforcement and indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lady faithfull has obligingly made the speech which i should have made and which i could scarcely have made shorter <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall try to emulate the admirable pace at which the noble lord took this first fence on the circuit <e> <s> i would merely observe that the parent is not a party to the proceedings <e> <s> he is not charged with an offence and he is not on trial for his own shortcomings <e> <s> it is the child who is charged and convicted and against him that the penalty is awarded <e> <s> it is important therefore not to apportion criminal liability between the convicted offender and someone who is not himself on trial <e> <s> that is why clause like the existing law confines itself to a separate power to order the parent to pay the penalty which has been imposed on the child <e> <s> that does not blur the lines of criminal liability as the noble lord apparently wishes to do <e> <s> i think that those remarks were just about as brief and i hope they were as clear <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not clear whether your lordships think that we should all have two bites at this debate <e> <s> if your lordships will permit i doubt whether i have much more to add <e> <s> the question is the question of the status of the parent <e> <s> the purpose of requiring the parent to pay the fine is to bring home to the parent the responsibility it has for the behaviour of the child <e> <s> but the parent as i said before is not himself or herself legally tried or legally convicted of the offence <e> <s> if you start apportioning the fine you start apportioning what appears to be the legal blame and apart from being faced sometimes with judgments of solomon to decide on the apportionment you will also be encouraging the child to imagine a sort of tariff of responsibility between parent and child which i do not think courts could impose <e> <s> i regret that i cannot be more lucid than that and i shall not go on longer <e>", "<cs> my lords as he has said during our debates at the report stage of the bill the noble lord lord mishcon gave notice that he would once more raise the issue of the courts powers to order payment of the fine by the parent rather than by the child <e> <s> he has dealt separately with the question of apportionment and so i shall not again refer to that <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i could rehearse some of the complexities to which the noble lord has referred and possibly throw some additional light on them but i do not think that that is what the noble lord wants and i shall not therefore detain your lordships <e> <s> the amendment touches on matters of very great importance and some complexity or should i say of some importance and very great complexity <e> <s> at this stage of the bills progress i cannot do them justice <e> <s> indeed i do not think as i have said that the noble lord would wish me to do so <e> <s> i can assure the house and the noble lord that the government are seized of the issues involved <e> <s> we are giving them very careful consideration <e> <s> we have begun the examination of them with the chief metropolitan stipendiary magistrate <e> <s> we are also in touch with the magistrates association and the justices clerks society <e> <s> we shall continue this process of consultation and our aim will be to seek agreement on the interpretation of the existing provisions taking into account the decisions of the courts in the cases bearing on the issue <e> <s> in the light of this we shall consider what changes may be needed <e> <s> i think that is what the noble lord wishes me to say <e> <s> this may mean legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords i must advise the noble lord lord wigoder that it is dangerous to assume the reception that i will give to an amendment by whether it is taken immediately before or immediately after dinner <e> <s> having said that the noble lord has not in fact been misled <e>", "<cs> my lords i speak by leave of the house <e> <s> the noble lord asked one substantive question <e> <s> we are talking about controlled drugs <e> <s> as the noble baroness has just made quite clear the use of nicotine by many of us is not controlled <e>", "<cs> my lords in his introduction to the amendment the noble lord lord harris drew our attention to the number of prisoners at present in prison <e> <s> i can assure him that there is no complacency whatever in the government or administration about that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> he has spoken at some length on two occasions <e> <s> i propose with the leave of the house to be very brief <e> <s> i would ask the house whether what the noble lord is saying is being fair either to the government or to the administration <e> <s> what i have said is that when we last discussed this while the idea was attractive we had no idea whether it was feasible <e> <s> i have now said that we have investigated this in depth and we believe that it is feasible and we propose to go into the consultations to see how and if this can be done <e>", "<cs> my lords in half a minute i shall therefore apologise to your lordships if i have spoken for too long in this manner and merely remind the house that the population of the prisons this year is about not the figure of which has been imprinted on your lordships minds <e>", "<cs> my lords i dearly wish that i could tell the noble and learned lord lord gardiner that it was necessary to consult the prostitutes union <e> <s> if he would undertake to accept that answer there would be no comeback <e> <s> in fact the noble and learned lord is aware that the amendments we are discussing relate to the fines and not to the imprisonment <e> <s> the question which concerns him is the bringing into effect of the clause and assuming that we receive royal assent in due time we are aiming at st january <e>", "<cs> my lords i was trying to reserve to myself a place at the end of the queue <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i can give as much information as i have available to me which miraculously increases <e> <s> in the home office there is no intention of withholding implementation of clauses just because they have advised against them <e> <s> but perhaps i could elaborate more gracefully by saying that most of the provisions in the bill necessitate some sort of preparation for example with the courts <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble lord the deputy speaker for making what amounts to an oral amendment to the marshalled list <e> <s> during our earlier debate on an amendment on these lines i said that the increase proposed would result in a penalty significantly greater than for roughly comparable offences <e> <s> since then however my noble friend lady gardner has successfully persuaded the government to accept the amendment which she moved at report stage increasing the penalty for one of these comparable offences that under section of the housing act <e> <s> in those circumstances the governments previous objections clearly no longer have the same force and the government are therefore prepared to accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the friendly operation of the house denies me repeatedly the pleasure of holding the noble lord opposite in suspense <e> <s> i will speak but briefly longer than him <e> <s> the amendment seeks to spell out in some detail what should happen when a court consults a probation officer about including a requirement in a probation order which would entail the offender attending a specified place or participating or refraining from participation in specified activities <e> <s> as the bill stands at present the court must consult a probation officer before making such a requirement <e> <s> in addition the offender himself must consent to the requirement and the agreement of any third party concerned must also be obtained <e> <s> that is quite a formidable array of safeguards and might seem sufficient to prevent the making of unsuitable requirements <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment would require centres of facilities that are included in requirements in a probation order to be approved by the local probation committee before an offender attended them <e> <s> the provisions in the bill would already require the consent of the offender and the agreement of any third party involved as well as consultation with a probation officer <e> <s> what is being sought here is an additional safeguard about the values and standards of the centre or the activity concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment would provide that attendance at a facility or participation in activities specified under section a should not in practice introduce a custodial or other punitive element but should be designed to advise assist or befriend the offender <e> <s> i can well understand the motives behind this amendment <e> <s> none of us wishes to introduce anything which is not compatible with the nature of probation <e> <s> i am sure that we all wish to see the probation order used to the benefit of the offender and to keep him out of further trouble during the currency of the order <e>", "<cs> my lords the government do indeed recognise the importance of the judgment in the case of <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is normal for the minister bringing the bill to the house to speak first <e> <s> as i am now up perhaps your lordships will permit me to do that <e> <s> our labours have been long <e> <s> i think your lordships would prefer my concluding remarks to be brief <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had what has been for me a fascinating debate in two respects <e> <s> it has revealed to me a little more about the nature of the radar speed test and a great deal more about the nature of this house because your lordships have not been as reassured as i had hoped by what i have said nor have they recognised quite the extent in present circumstances of the success represented by a minister leaving this house with a request to spend more money and then actually coming back with modest but necessary resources in order to pursue a policy which he and the department had been persuaded by your lordships eloquence at an earlier stage to accept <e>", "<cs> my lords i can think of no more agreeable occupation than consoling the noble lord lord airedale <e> <s> resources may be involved <e> <s> will the noble lord forgive me if i answer him somewhat slowly in order that i can be absolutely confident that what i am about to say to him will be not only relevant but accurate and useful <e> <s> it may be that what eventually i have to say will take longer than i thought it was going to take <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have no plans to change the broad role and function of the university grants committee <e> <s> nor do ministers seek to influence academic decisions between courses and universities <e> <s> however we believe that it may well be appropriate for ministers to have to a modest extent a little more influence over broad shifts of emphasis upon which they could be questioned such as that at present taking place towards science and technology and away from arts and social sciences <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said at the opening of my answer to the previous supplementary question we have no plans to change the broad role and function of the university grants committee <e> <s> there are no detailed structural changes immediately in mind that i know of <e>", "<cs> we certainly recognise that the universities have been going through a very difficult period and we should recognise the very able and flexible way in which the universities have coped <e> <s> we are now approaching the floor as it were of the cutback and it is hoped that the level of funding will he maintained at the same level for the subsequent year <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will not expect me to give detailed forecasts <e>", "<cs> because one does not anticipate budgets over a period <e> <s> the question asked by the noble lord lord hunter was about a triennium <e> <s> the advantage of the present system is that one is given a firm figure for the immediately ensuing year and figures of increasing flexibility over subsequent years which enable one to plan ahead and also meet contingencies as they arise <e> <s> i am sure that is the right balance <e>", "<cs> my lords if it is of help to the noble lord and the noble baroness perhaps i can be slightly more precise <e> <s> we intend that should complete the planned period of contraction and we hope that the level of grant provision then reached can be maintained in <e> <s> however your lordships will know that one cannot tie oneself to precise volume figures at a time of uncertain inflation rates <e>", "<cs> my lords it would he very nice for all of us if we could always count on the money in our pockets buying what we want it to buy <e> <s> unfortunately in real life we can only count on the amount of money in our pockets <e> <s> the noble lord would like that to be more precisely defined <e> <s> he will see from the letter which my right honourable friend wrote to dr parkes on th july which was published that figures were given in approximate terms for the years and <e> <s> those are planning figures and my noble friend would be the last to complain if contingencies were such that they had to be varied downwards and not upwards <e> <s> flexibility must be available in both directions <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect the noble lord has not asked me a sentence which ends with an interrogation mark <e> <s> i do not know what the question is <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already stood here and done better <e> <s> i have said what we intend to do <e>", "<cs> my lords what the noble lord has described sounded admirable but obviously i cannot comment without notice on specific cases <e> <s> however <e> <s> i shall look at what the noble lord has said and if it is as admirable as he describes it i shall bring it to the attention of my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i repeat that we intend that should complete the planned period of contraction and hope that the level of grant provision then reached can be maintained in <e> <s> if the noble lord reads that tomorrow morning at his breakfast i think he will find that it comes to as clear an indication of our intentions and the direction of our expenditure plans as it is fair to give at that distance of time <e>", "<cs> my lords this question has gone on a long time <e> <s> the question is about universities and the noble lord asked me about polytechnics <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i should take advice on the answer to that question <e> <s> i shall write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to confirm that the noble lord is right in his analysis <e> <s> we wish the equipment although there is not too much of it in use at present on motorways to be embraced in the provisions of the act as it will be <e> <s> the noble lord was very observant and quite right to put the government right and i shall be happy to accept this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord underhill has led us with great elegance on to fairly well-trodden ground on which both his footprints and mine are already clearly marked <e> <s> i fear therefore that i may have to repeat a little of what i said before <e> <s> the amendment falls into two halves <e> <s> first there is the reference to a performance standard secondly there is the link with regulations <e> <s> as i understand it although performance standard is a term of the art understood by engineers it has no legal meaning as such <e> <s> it is presumably derived from the references to the british standards institution which were included in the noble lords previous amendment <e> <s> having persuaded him to drop that reference i fear that i may seem to he ungrateful if i point out that without the reference to a performance standard the amendment makes no sense <e> <s> it would mean that a standard would have to be defined and its items listed <e> <s> then if we were to follow the noble lords wishes we would have to turn this list into regulations and i have two fundamental doubts about this <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord is asking who would authorise i understand it would be the home secretary <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not usual for a minister to speak twice on third reading but i have had many challenges thrown down many questions asked and the opposition front bench have contrived to have two speeches already so your lordships may think it fair to allow me to speak again <e>", "<cs> my lords the individual pieces of equipment will be tested by the scientists and they will then have a certificate of conformity to the type which is regarded as satisfactory by the home secretary because that piece of equipment performs to a standard which your lordships would accept <e> <s> that standard is that it will tell with a degree of accuracy and with a lack of deviation which would be satisfactory for a court <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord places me in the procedural difficulty of matching three opposition front bench speeches <e> <s> i would merely say that everything your lordships have said on both sides of the house will be studied as always with the greatest of care in the department and by my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords if i repeat a small section of my earlier argument your lordships will forgive me if i do so briefly <e> <s> it is simply to draw your lordships attention to the fact that we again have the term operating standard standing free as it were of british standards which makes the amendment in that sense weaker than the noble lord would wish <e>", "<cs> my lords as to the delay as the noble baroness described it the latest comments on the report were not received until the end of last year and it is a very complex matter <e> <s> on the friendship of the government towards the world of further education i shall only say that the government have in this year alone given additional expenditure provision totalling about million to enable more young people to stay on in education <e> <s> most of those extra people are in fact staying on in further education colleges <e> <s> as to the anomalies i think i should leave that to our response to the report <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are well aware of the importance of the to year-old bracket <e> <s> what i have said refers to those staying on outside school <e> <s> we do not disaggregate payments for <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords first premise would be the subject of an interesting sociological debate <e> <s> i agree only that often social deprivation is accompanied by educational deprivation although not always <e> <s> his second question on the legality of further education is central to our response to the report when it comes <e> <s> if the noble lord will remind me of his third question i shall answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are well seized of the value of the workers educational association as indeed am i we seek in no way to limit the good work which it does <e>", "<cs> my lords much as some of your lordships may sympathise with the noble lords remarks i have to remind him that the question is whether or not there is a date on which we are to make a statement <e> <s> i have had to say that i cannot say precisely when that statement will be made <e> <s> when it is made it will be made in the knowledge of the noble lords views <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking noble lords for their reception of the order i can explain the difficulty which the noble lord lord ponsonby expressed by saying that this works not unlike income tax <e> <s> by increasing the exempt income of the companies we are not drawing more money from them and any company would have to increase its advertising revenue by a greater amount than the amount by which the free slice has been increased before it started to pay more and of course it would be paying it on a larger income <e> <s> i thank the noble lord lord winstanley for his kind remarks and i hope that his break fast <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have made it quite clear that they wish to see universities attract increasing income from outside sources and that income so raised will not lead to any consequential reduction in ugc grant <e> <s> we believe that it is right to encourage institutions to become progressively less dependent on the public purse but that does not mean of course that we propose to limit government funds according to their ability to obtain other support <e> <s> we do however want to see some greater diversity in the way in which institutions are financed <e>", "<cs> my lords the priority of allocation of money in university grants is of course determined by the university grants committee <e> <s> that said it is not the case that universities such as salford and some others are the only ones which have a special expertise in technology and nor is it the case that that is the only expertise that they have <e> <s> therefore it is necessary is it not <e> <s> for universities such as salford to improve or maintain their usefulness and merit by seeking the savings that are required to keep the whole system effective from those subjects where the savings can best be made <e>", "<cs> my lords cranfield certainly does attract a very large proportion of funding other than from government sources and that makes sir henry chilver a very appropriate person to have chaired the body which produced this excellent report <e>", "<cs> my lords i could well have coupled the university of aston with my remarks about the university of salford <e> <s> i am of course aware of the importance of its role and i am very glad that the noble baroness confirms that it is receiving increasing sums of private and industrial money which will offset the difficulty of the grants reduction to which she referred <e>", "<cs> my lords we do indeed recognise the need to ensure that the examination and the education systems are kept in touch with the real world of work for which they prepare people <e> <s> the government are taking initiatives to secure this <e> <s> in particular through the examination system we propose to introduce in a national prevocational qualification at -plus <e> <s> associated courses will give a vocational bias to a balanced programme of general education aimed at the better preparation of

exercise <e> <s> when we have the result of that a decision will be taken whether or not to replace the cse and gce -level examinations with a single system <e> <s> a statement of policy which will be of interest to the noble baroness will be published early next month <e> <s> i regret that i have not read the article to which she referred but i shall see that that error is made good <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a great sympathy with the general tendency of what the noble baroness said but i doubt whether reform of the university system would answer it largely because universities <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord alexander of potterhill has been bombarding me with powerful and unexpected questions since long before i came to sit on this side of the house <e> <s> i would never

that until the governments new clause on the use of secure accommodation was agreed in this house at third reading the clause in the bill dealing with the question of the use of secure accommodation was simply an enabling power which it was appropriate to bring into force at the time of royal assent <e>", "<cs> my lords i can certainly undertake that those parts of the media concerned with this

house doth agree with the commons in their amendments nos <e> <s> to <e>", "<cs> my lords may i acknowledge the kind remarks made by noble lords in welcoming me back to this well trodden ground <e>

putting into legislation a confirmation of the right of any patient in a hospital to be seen by another doctor <e> <s> however we are dealing here with accused persons most of whom will in any event be eligible for support via legal aid in the preparation of their cases <e> <s> i am assured that where the commission of an independent medical report forms a proper and necessary part of the accuseds case so far as the court proceedings are concerned legal aid may reasonably embrace the cost of the preparation of the report <e> <s> thus the effect of the words <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we have to occupy ourselves on the bill for the time being <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house doth agree with the commons in their amendments nos <e> <s> to <e> <s> it may be to

committing an accused person for trial on a charge of murder to impose as a condition of bail a requirement that he should co-operate in the preparation of reports on his mental condition <e> <s> these reports are always required in murder cases so that the possibility of diminished responsibility can be properly assessed <e> <s> the sort of co-operation which would be required of a person committed for trial but released on bail would for instance be that he should present himself to a particular doctor at a particular place for examination <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to get embroiled in a dispute but if we could dispose of this block of amendments quite brieflly we would then be in better order to take the statement <e> <s> they are not contentious or complicated <e> <s> but i am in the hands of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not a stupid question <e> <s> the amendment relates only to cases of murder <e> <s> it does not affect what happens in other cases <e>", "<cs> my lords i have every sympathy with the noble lord having been in just the same situation myself <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that we need once more to occupy ourselves with the bill <e> <s> as i recall we were discussing amendments nos <e> <s> to <e> <s> i was under the happy impression that i answered all the questions your lordships had asked but owing to the peculiarity of the circumstances in which we embarked upon the discussion it is possible that some noble lords still have something to say and therefore i am ready to reply to that if i can <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this house doth agree with the commons in their amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it may be for the convenience of your lordships if i speak also to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> these amendments give effect to the governments decision that voluntary patients should no longer be prevented from registering as electors solely because their only place of residence is a mental hospital <e> <s> the amendments do this by allowing voluntary patients to make a declaration which entitles them to be registered as electors for a home address or other address outside the hospital and to obtain an absent vote at the time of an election <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to your lordships for the varied reception that these amendments have received and for the general agreement that they are a move in the right direction <e> <s> it is a matter for regret that there has not been longer for discussion in the house although there were two debates on the matter <e> <s> although we felt that it would have been better to have placed this in another vehicle it was clear from what went on in another place and from a great deal of what went on in this house that <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is very trenchant on the matter but the fact remains that your lordships time and the time of another place is extremely valuable <e> <s> your lordships become increasingly aware of it

baroness said in my presence and of what my admirably diligent noble friend lord glenarthur wrote of what the noble baroness said in my absence <e> <s> i hope that she will be in no way slighted by the measure of attention i gave her although i was distracted a little by my urgent need to take on a little fuel before attempting this flight <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear that that also was a page that i turned over which i regret <e> <s> the position is that we have that under close review <e> <s> i am aware of the noble lords interest which now takes the form of a bill which he has tabled <e>

of my noble friends question in addition to the helmets there are pairs of fire-resistant overalls and shields <e> <s> i can assure my noble friend that our police forces are trained effectively in the use of all equipment issued to them <e>", "<cs> my lords yes it is our intention that they should always bear identification numbers <e> <s> i am aware of a recent occasion when a small number of officers were said not to be wearing identifying numbers on their flame resistant overalls <e> <s> that is a subject of investigation and i should not therefore like to go further <e>", "<cs> my lords i always look forward to a conversation with the right reverend prelate and would expect to profit from it whatever the subject <e> <s> however we are on common ground <e> <s> i entirely endorse his approach to this subject <e> <s> the commendation of the police implicit in his words could not come from a better source <e> <s> we in the home office are also extensively engaged in promoting means of consultation between communities and their local police forces because as i said on another occasion police forces do nor impose things upon the community nor are they themselves imposed upon them <e> <s> they are part of the community and act with the consent and support of the community <e> <s> that is the origin of good policing <e>", "<cs> my lords at the risk of departing even further from the question i will say that a good deal of this work is already going on and we sympathise with the noble lords position <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said earlier it is our intention that every police officer should be clearly identifiable <e> <s> as to the hypothesis on which the noble viscount rests his case the features of hitler mussolini and stalin were indelibly etched in every mind in this chamber <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the first part of the noble lords question is none <e> <s> as to the second provisions relating to the probation of academic staff are of course entirely the responsibility of the university concerned and the department would not be informed about such changes <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the noble lords acknowledgment of the generosity of the agreement reached yesterday and announced by my right honourable friend in another place <e> <s> as regards contracts new contracts can of course be worded to provide for dismissal for reasons of for instance redundancy <e> <s> existing contracts which do not allow for this can be expensive and that was reflected in yesterdays settlement <e> <s> in such cases a university is faced with negotiating amendments to the contracts or in suitable cases as is implied in the noble lords substantive question changing the provisions in their statute <e> <s> so far two universities have made tentative inquiries about such amendments to their statutes <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certain that my right honourable friend would engage in any discussions if he was approached on the subject <e> <s> i understand that he has been approached by two universities <e> <s> i am well aware of the ossification that threatens some university departments and the noble lord will know that we have an initiative to introduce new blood into universities <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble lord for drawing that fear to my attention and i will see that it is related to my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords these are matters for negotiation between the individual and the institution <e>", "<cs> my lords the package to which we have referred several times in these exchanges contained million to help with unforeseen and unavoidable increases in the cost of superannuation as well as rates and some other smaller items <e> <s> in fact i think that this will result in movement <e>", "<cs> my lords in / students in england and wales claimed a total of million in excess of the notional element in the main rate of individual grants but these claims were subject to a parental contribution <e> <s> i regret that no breakdown of these claims between term-end and daily travel can be made <e> <s> as to applying these funds for another purpose i would simply say to the noble lord that although it is desirable to have more students in our universities it is essential for those students already enrolled to be able to get to them in order to be taught <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has raised a number of points <e> <s> what stands out in my recollection of the noble lords suggestion is that students often hitch-hike which is perfectly true and other things being equal it is not a bad thing <e> <s> the noble lord mentioned that they ought to have other means of getting to their lodgings <e> <s> indeed he referred to my own university of oxford where such a situation is very common <e> <s> i think that it is even more common in another university <e> <s> however i recall as perhaps he will recall the gradient of headington hill and i think that there are certain students who could not be expected to bicycle to their lodgings even if they could be expected to bicycle from their lodgings <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that would be a work of supererogation <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords noted eloquence is never absolutely matched by his patience <e> <s> i hope he will be able to get the knowledge he wants from what i am about to say <e> <s> if the bill were to proceed to its further stages we should of course wish to propose amendments to it <e> <s> whether it should proceed to those later stages is a matter for later judgment as the noble lord has himself suggested <e> <s> there is i think general agreement that legislation broadly on these lines is needed <e> <s> there is also general agreement that its best chance of success is if it is launched in another place by a member successful in the ballot for private members bills <e> <s> so far although the ballot has taken place it is not yet apparent what <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble baroness could contain herself she will have an opportunity to speak or intervene and i shall reply to questions in the wind-up rather than in my introductory speech <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to all of your lordships whatever the colour or temperature or direction or pressure of your contributions to this debate <e> <s> perhaps i should make that clear at the outset in case some of my responses to individual interventions are less generous than that <e> <s> my lords this is a take note debate it is therefore if i may so put it a take away debate <e> <s> my principal function is to take <e>", "<cs> my lords on the first point which is narrower than i thought i will think about it and write to the noble baroness <e> <s> she has by putting this on the record performed the purpose that this debate is supposed to serve anyway <e> <s> as to the words shall and may many long and fascinating hours have been spent between these benches on the subject of which words should be used where <e> <s> where it is a discretionary power i should have thought that the word shall was a contradiction of the word discretion but i will also look at that <e> <s> the speech of the noble baroness was rendered charming i thought not only by her own personality but by the theme that it ought to be at least as easy for lovers to come here as it should be for businessmen which i think appeals to our hearts perhaps a little more than our heads <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is not incumbent on ministers at the home office to pronounce their personal views on the content or standards of work of individual people working within the bbc <e> <s> i would accept that the extract which my noble friend gave from clause of the licence is correct and i would add that that undertaking is currently fulfilled by the corporation by broadcasting the programme today in parliament each night at <e>", "<cs> as to the existing machinery my lords i understand that the sound broadcasting committee of your lordships house exists solely to consider questions arising out of the resolution of the house of <e>", "<cs> as i said earlier my lords this is a policy which the corporation is running experimentally for six months <e> <s> they will doubtless have regard both to the numbers of the audience and to the views of the audience when they come to review their policy and the trenchant things which my noble friends and others have said will doubtless form part of the material they consider <e>", "<cs> my lords it really is not for me to answer to the brief of the corporation but i should think that their assessment of whether or not the noble lords view was correct would in some measure be guided by the listening figures which result from the change in policy <e>", "<cs> my lords as to the point about the existing machinery the noble and learned lord has just been using it <e> <s> i do not not doubt that everything that he says will be listened to by the editor of the programme and drawn to the attention of the policy formulators in the corporation <e> <s> as to the question of a more elaborate form of consultation i should think that i ought to take notice of that and consider it further <e>", "<cs> my lords it is within my own experience of watching the process of ennoblement that it rarely makes people more biddable <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall take careful note of everything that is said in these exchanges and bring them to the notice of my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords as to what goes on in another place i cannot have a view on that <e> <s> as to what goes on in this place i say to my noble friend what i have said to others of your lordships that i shall take careful note of the views here expressed and if it appears appropriate i shall then write to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord is asking me whether we cannot impose editorial policy upon the bbc <e>", "<cs> if i am wrong i shall apologise-but the answer to what i understand to be the noble lords question would obviously be no <e> <s> if the noble lord is anxious that his remarks should be taken elsewhere in another sense i can only say that not only shall i bring the content of these exchanges to the notice of my right honourable friend but i shall see that they are asterisked as it were in the programme of consultation involving the corporation <e>", "<cs> my lords the government give great emphasis to health and safety matters of all kinds in penal establishments <e> <s> we have issued smoke protection hoods to all closed cellular establishments for use by prison officers in rescuing prisoners and others from smoke-filled cells <e> <s> we are continuing our search for a more fire retardant prison mattress and recent research leads us to be hopeful of success <e>", "<cs> my lords the mask is the draeger parat produced by draeger safety limited <e> <s> there are fire drills in all prison establishments <e> <s> i could not tell the noble baroness with what frequency they are put into action because it will vary from case to case <e> <s> but this is an aspect of the inspections carried out by her majestys inspectorate the reports of which are published <e> <s> the noble baroness may have noticed that occasionally this is the subject of comment by the inspectorate so she may be confident that these matters are taken care of <e>", "<cs> my lords there are at present on the market no mattresses suitable for use in prisons by reason of their non-combustibility <e> <s> there are a lot of safer mattresses if the people who use them are merely going to drop a lighted cigarette or match on the cover but prisoners who wish to set fire to their mattresses can tear them apart and it is the content which also has to be treated <e> <s> as to the research i am confident within reasonable limits that tenders will be invited next month for a new specification now in preparation <e>", "<cs> my lords we have a staff of six safety officers at the national headquarters and a safety committee at every prison establishment <e> <s> i think that that is just as good as what goes on in industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i will not weary your lordships with a long detailed list of what we are doing about increasing the provision for the prison service and improving conditions there in a very difficult situation <e> <s> but no my lords we do not think it is the function of government to override the decisions of the judiciary in order to unload the prisons from time to time <e> <s> there is provision to do this in an emergency and that is all it is provided for <e>", "<cs> my lords as to the first part of the noble lords question i think it was a little wide of that on the order paper <e> <s> as to the second as i have already said we have put a great deal of urgent effort into finding alternative materials and we expect to put specifications out to tender within the next month <e>", "<cs> my lords in returning to the british nationality falkland islands amendment bill i should like to congratulate my noble friend lady vickers on her continuing advocacy of the cause of the falkland islanders <e> <s> my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter was i think the first to raise the matter in this house when he tabled a question on the matter in july <e> <s> the noble lord lord bruce of donington then brought in a bill on similar lines to the one we are debating today though there was insufficient time left to consider it in what remained of the last session <e> <s> todays debate therefore provides our first opportunity to debate the matter thoroughly <e> <s> we do so <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mottistone has been kind enough to give way and if i may intervene i would say to the noble lord lord gridley that his name appears a further four places down the list <e>", "<cs> i am sorry my lords i meant the noble lord lord gore-booth whose name is not yet on the list of speakers and i would suggest that he might care to speak when we reach what is commonly called the gap <e>", "<cs> my lords i begin as i began before by congratulating my noble friend upon the persistence of her pursuit of the cause of the falkland islanders <e> <s> i do so now strengthened in the knowledge of the eloquent sympathy of so many members of your lordships house <e> <s> by your lordships leave i shall try to reply very briefly to points which were raised after i spoke the first of which was made by the noble lord lord bruce of donington who is as keen as any of us on getting this bill adopted <e> <s> but he received the news that the government would not obstruct it with no more enthusiasm than did the noble lord lord tordoff <e> <s> its arrival on your lordships table was greeted by him not with applause or gratitude or even with any very lengthy approval <e> <s> he treated us instead to a fascinating exercise in exegesis in which he sought to divine what possibly could have caused her majestys government to be less at variance with his own and his partys views than usual <e> <s> he mined every possible seam in search of material and the noble lord lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite certain to which clear statement the noble lord is referring <e> <s> whatever it is i did not refer to i shall refer to it tomorrow and if it is what i think it is it will entirely bear out what i have just told your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the independent broadcasting authority has told central independent television that it wishes the programme to be balanced by a separate complementary programme <e> <s> this is entirely the ibas decision and the government have not sought to influence it in any way <e>", "<cs> my noble friend is doubtless aware of the obligation under which both broadcasting authorities work to satisfy themselves that they achieve due impartiality on matters of political controversy or relating to current public policies <e> <s> those are the obligations of the authorities <e> <s> it is not for the government to enter into the balancing act with them <e>", "<cs> my lords the question of how matters are presented is a matter for producers <e> <s> the question of the political or other controversial content being balanced between one programme and another is for the broadcasting authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always a great temptation at this dispatch box to follow ones noble friends down long lanes of hypothesis but i shall resist it <e>", "<cs> my lords i think most of your lordships would find impartiality reassuring rather than disquieting <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord nugent of guildford has drawn your lordships attention tonight to a most important aspect of our national life <e> <s> the society of this country is made up of an enormous range of different sorts of people who live their lives upon widely differing sets of principles arising from diverse cultural backgrounds and completely dissimilar sets of experience <e> <s> one of the principal concerns of our present generation rests upon that very diversity <e> <s> if so much is different what is there that is the same throughout <e> <s> are we one nation as the founder of the conservative party was determined that we should be and should remain or are we a centrifugal collection of different groups each at odds with the other without any unifying principle other than geography <e> <s> beyond saying it again and your lordships have heard it from me often before the determination that we shall be one nation is as strongly held within my party today as ever it was in the days of disraeli <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot answer that off the cuff <e> <s> if i can do so before the end of this debate i will if not i will write to the noble lord <e> <s> the report goes on to remark that complaints about taste and decency often express viewers concern about the general moral standards reflected in the programmes rather than objection to a specific incident <e> <s> they also say that during the year only nine programmes attracted more than complaints on any grounds whatsoever <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to say that i find it odd that the noble lord should say in one breath that survivors might be expected on his admission in half the london boroughs and say at the same time that no provision should be made to increase their ability to survive <e> <s> i would add in the national context that the intention of our policy is to present a credible policy of deterrence and this is part of it <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords interrogatory process outruns the bounds of possibility <e> <s> if it could be in action my lords i would require more than two sessions a year to answer the questions the noble lord would ask of that body <e>", "<cs> my lords anybody who tries to frighten the noble lord lord shinwell is pursuing a lost cause <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a good deal of misapprehension and some inaccuracy in the assumptions that underly the noble lords question <e> <s> be that as it may the concern of her majestys government is to see first that a nuclear war does not arise and secondly that if it does the maximum number of people shall survive under the best possible conditions <e> <s> both those aims require a credible and effective system of civil defence <e>", "<cs> indeed my lords <e> <s> i am often at pains to avoid pursuing hypothetical questions in the house but the weight direction location and number of nuclear strikes in a war on this country if it took place cannot be predicted by us because we would not be pressing the button <e> <s> we are concerned to see that the button is not pressed <e> <s> the way to do that is to make people on the other side realise that there is a credible response <e> <s> to make that reponse credible we have to arm ourselves against the possibility of war and the need to see that members of this country who are your lordships fellow citizens survive in as a great a number and under as great a chance of recovery as is humanly possible <e> <s> that is the aim of this policy <e>", "<cs> my lords as i am a rowing man rather than a cricketer i shall not answer that question for fear of catching a crab <e>", "<cs> my lords it is beyond the competence of any british government to alter the constitutional arrangements in the soviet union <e> <s> but that said i trust that those who live on the other side of the iron curtain realise that they are as exposed as we are to the consequences of any nuclear exchange and that we have a mutual interest in seeing that it does not occur <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be useful if the noble lord in his next opportunity to question the supposedly democratic institutions of the soviet <e>", "<cs> my lords i will of course ask my right honourable friend to read the remarks which the noble baroness has made which may attract some sympathy <e> <s> i would like to emphasise that in this <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones is right in that the generality of sentences do not attract public concern <e> <s> it is only occasional cases in which very often the public is not aware of all the facts on which public concern is concentrated <e>", "<cs> my lords in that the board is the only body which has a purview of all the cases in the whole of great britain its view must be of interest and i believe that the board should be allowed to express it <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the desire of the government which i have often voiced during the debates on what is now the criminal justice act that sentences should be appropriate to cases <e> <s> i think there is no difference between us that some people should have long sentences there are others who should have shorter sentences and by providing alternatives to custody we make more room for those who ought to be in prison <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are aware that there is considerable pressure for the liberalisation of the licensing law <e> <s> proposals for change must however be weighed against public concern about drunkenness and alcohol misuse generally about which your lordships will hear more later this afternoon <e> <s> the health department published a document <e>", "<cs> my lords i would always have great respect for the views of licensees in scotland <e> <s> while these indications are encouraging we consider that more time is needed to assess whether there is any change in the level of alcohol abuse in scotland which does remain a serious problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i can think of a number of reasons which might anticipate the debate which is to take place this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot answer for what other noble lords may say in the debate which is to come <e> <s> however if the noble lord himself reads the document to which i referred <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has had his whack <e> <s> i do not wish to be discourteous to him <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has a very effective way of wringing my conscience <e> <s> i shall give way <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the noble lord cannot follow the argument because it is a fairly elementary one <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord thinks it is too simplistic <e> <s> the fact is that in the teeth of the most formidable difficulties the government are containing public expenditure in every aspect <e> <s> as the noble lord lord wigoder said earlier in every debate people say that public expenditure should be contained except in that area which is the subject of the debate <e> <s> when one is running a department or bits of a department every bit is put under the microscope for any suspicion of spending money that should not be spent <e> <s> this was money that was more easily given up than money in other parts of the service where there are people actually trained and serving <e>", "<cs> my lords i will try and come back to that if i may because i mistrust my arithmetic at all times but particularly when i am on my feet and speaking about something else <e>", "<cs> my lords i can answer the question i think it was <e>", "<cs> my lords that may be <e> <s> in fact i have undertaken to monitor the number of applicants and to keep the national association of probation officers informed on what i find <e> <s> i shall be quite happy to discuss with them what the findings are <e> <s> i hope the noble lord lord wells-pestell will take that as an indication of my good intentions <e> <s> i have other observations to make about the salary received <e> <s> the department pays the employers national insurance contributions and superannuation contributions of per cent <e> <s> and per cent <e> <s> respectively and this adds to the savings achieved <e> <s> i think i shall take those figures and work them out again because i intend at the end of this debate to consider very carefully what has been said by your lordships and i will write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i am told that that is quite superfluous since he already knows and knew a long time ago <e> <s> i did not want to bring him into this <e> <s> if the noble lord will accept that i shall nonetheless be happy to see him with two or possibly three of his friends to discuss this matter further on the basis that i am not actually offering a concession but i do want to hear more of what he has to say <e>", "<cs> my lords reluctant as my noble friend is to catch me unawares i am afraid he has succeeded <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i should respond to that very graceful question by saying that the sanction is reflected not so much in the fine itself as in the sacrifices a person may have to make in order to pay it <e> <s> of course social security benefits are not increased to enable people to pay their fines so there is an element of punishment involved in this <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall of course inquire but the effect which i understand is exerted by these provisions is that people finish up with money to live on that is less than they otherwise would have by the amount of the fine which may be spread over a period of time <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord asked me what i would do with people in either condition <e> <s> of course i am not in a position to do anything except inform the house of what is the law as it stands <e>", "<cs> my lords i could not hear what it was the the dhss had inquired about <e>", "<cs> my lords that is very wide of the question on the order paper but i will write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords since they are not now enfranchised they will not be disfranchised <e> <s> but in answer to the substance of the noble lords supplementary question i would say that we would not intend to legislate before agreement is reached <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have been at pains to explain it is not our intention to legislate ahead of agreement reached in the council of ministers on this matter <e> <s> to do so would in the end prove nugatory <e>", "<cs> my lords the variety of provisions within europe is considerable <e> <s> different countries have different arrangements and the question is which is the best arrangement <e> <s> it is the best arrangement to which we wish to subscribe <e> <s> that will be the arrangement that is agreed by the council of ministers <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite right there are many important and difficult considerations all of which are at present with the european council and which her majestys government will have to consider when the matter comes to us <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not join the noble lord in any such description of the assembly but i would endorse the point that her majestys government are always sensitive to issues of economy <e>", "<cs> my lords as to the sense of burning injustice my right honourable friend is aware of all the representations that have been made and i shall draw his attention to the representation that the noble lord has made <e> <s> as for the rest of the noble lords supplementary question i can only revert to my original answer that it is our view that it would be untimely to legislate in advance of a decision that might render entirely out of context and improper the legislation that we passed <e>", "<cs> i think it might be useful if i were to use this opportunity to explain to the committee the position of the government on the bill <e> <s> i will not detain your lordships for long <e> <s> the siren calls not only for my noble friends second reading but for the debate on the unstarred question set down by the noble lord lord mayhew and indeed the christmas recess would make that perilous <e> <s> as i made clear at second reading there is very little between us and the noble lord lord wigoder as to ends each wishes to ensure that those who have shown their rejection of the essential values of our criminal justice system by their own way of life should be disqualified from jury service <e> <s> we agree about ends but we differ about means <e> <s> the government do not believe that the proposals in this bill go wide enough <e> <s> my noble friend was kind enough to point that out <e> <s> our own preferred approach would be to exclude from jury service anyone convicted of an imprisonable offence in the last ten years <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones and the noble lord lord wigoder have rightly emphasised the gravity of the occurrence which has prompted this statement <e> <s> as to the clarity and safety of the principles laid down for the use of firearms <e> <s> i would refer the noble and learned lord to the rules themselves which i understand will be in the library later this afternoon and also to the figures which i gave to indicate the large number of occasions on which weapons are issued the fact that every time they are withdrawn from the holster a report is made and the fact that shots have

carrying firearms <e> <s> i cannot give a specific answer but the temperament and suitability of officers for this work is one of the considerations borne in mind in giving the authorisation <e> <s> i think that this will become clear to the noble lord when he looks at the rules which will be placed in your lordships library <e>", "<cs> my lords the initial results of the commissioners inquiry will be passed to the director of public prosecutions tomorrow afternoon <e> <s> the noble lord lord shinwell will know that it is then a question for the director of public prosecutions to decide whether this is an occasion for criminal prosecution or otherwise for pursuit of the complaint through the police complaints board <e>", "<cs> my lords the question of a public inquiry does not arise at this stage because of the possibility of legal proceedings which could be prejudiced by the course of the inquiry itself <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall have to give the noble baroness this assurance subject to correction which i shall endeavour to obtain if necessary very quickly <e> <s> my understanding is that these issues are additional to normal static and personal protection duties <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not observing the noble lords complexion at the time but i understood that he thought there was an absurdity i think he was referring to <e>", "<cs> my lords i really do not like responding to this because i had sat down we have other business before us and the noble lord asked me to justify myself in committee <e> <s> but what the noble lord imputes to the government is so damaging that i must reply <e> <s> this is not a racially prejudiced piece of legislation <e> <s> i was at pains and the noble lord was already in the chamber when i did so to say that the powers to which he refers and to which he takes exception would be used only subject to the prejudice test exercised by the registrar in other words if they were prejudicial to the operation of the policy in one of those five areas endorsed by parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed i am very much aware of the importance of considering the family interests of all prisoners within the prison system but there are other considerations both of justice and of the management of the prison system in this country and the prison system in northern ireland <e> <s> in these cases i think that those considerations supervene <e> <s> the home secretary does <e> <s> however look at each of these cases on its merits <e>", "<cs> yes my lords indeed the government do <e> <s> where a prisoners family or nearest of kin are on supplementary benefit or a low income they are eligible for assistance to travel to take up their visits <e> <s> provided the prisoner is in prison for three months or more then they can do this once a month <e> <s> if it is necessary to stay overnight then there is also assistance by way of subsistence and this is as available to the relatives in northern ireland of

the question and answer relate to those prisoners convicted of terrorist offences committed in this country <e> <s> that is the subject to which i addressed myself in answer <e> <s> the considerations relate both to the management of the prison population in northern ireland among whom tension is at the moment somewhat increased because of a campaign to segregate republican and loyalist prisoners and also to the management of the prison system in this country <e> <s> in each case matters for decision are put first to myself to advise and then to the home secretary <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord referred to the difficulty of travelling from northern ireland to the isle of wight and i have said what steps we have taken in mitigation of that <e> <s> as to the deep longing of the prisoners concerned to return to what they regard as their native land i have to say that one must look at both sides of the coin <e> <s> these are prisoners who have been convicted of crimes in association with terrorist organisations which deal massive blows against the happiness and indeed the survival of families in this country <e>", "<cs> first my lords soldiers in northern ireland are not convicted of terrorist offences secondly the soldiers in northern ireland have gone there in pursuit of their duties under orders and thirdly the people we are talking about have committed crimes in this country of their own volition <e>", "<cs> my lords there are two countries one province and one principality which comprise the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords in spite of the public protestations of mr odocherty there is no convincing evidence to suggest that he has broken his links with the terrorist organisations and he continues to refuse to comply with prison rules which bears out my suspicions <e>", "<cs> i should like very briefly to welcome my noble friends readiness to amend the bill so thoroughly in order to ensure that it achieves all that she and her majestys government wish it to achieve <e> <s> she has correctly explained the effects of the bill as they will be if your lordships committee accepts the amendment and i am glad to advise your lordships to agree with it <e> <s> as we come to further amendments it might save time if your lordships will take my silence to indicate a similar advice on each of them <e>", "<cs> i do not want to be in any way discourteous <e> <s> the noble lord is entirely free to hold what opinions he wishes about the antecedents of this bill but there were opportunities to discuss the point that he is now making both in the debate on the report on the falkland islands and at the second reading stage of the present bill <e> <s> therefore would it not be helpful if we were to proceed to consider the amendment before the committee which is amendment no <e> <s> without considering the context further <e>", "<cs> all is fair in politics as in love and war no doubt <e> <s> all that i am seeking is the convenience not of my party but of your lordships committee <e> <s> this is the committee stage of a bill and i thought that we ought to consider the amendments to it <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the next amendment is to leave out clause <e>", "<cs> it will be given in the final print but it does not have a number and therefore the number cannot appear on the marshalled list <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> records of adjudications are internal official documents which it is not government policy to disclose other than in connection with posssible judicial proceedings <e> <s> accordingly they may be made available to the legal representative of a prisoner considering an application for judicial review and to the court undertaking that review

am sure that we are all grateful to my noble friend lord campbell of alloway for precipitating a very useful discussion of some important principles in the bill and the discussion ensued despite the very diffident manner in which he moved his amendment <e> <s> he described its intentions as authoritative and i should not wish to add to that <e> <s> but i think that i should explain the governments view on the various aspects of the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already made clear the governments position on the bill as a whole and therefore i will seek not to detain your lordships for long <e> <s> as i said at second reading we very much welcome the opportunity it affords to debate an issue of increasing concern and of an importance which many of your lordships have underlined this evening to all involved in the administration and indeed the receipt of justice <e> <s> however we do not think that this bill goes wide enough in disqualifying from jury <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble baroness explained the amendment is to enable the functions of the secretary of state in respect of the royal palaces not in the occupation of a member of the royal family to be transferred by order in council to the commission <e> <s> in response to a slightly similar amendment moved in committee i gave a clear statement why the government decided against including functions in respect of royal palaces <e> <s> i pointed out that all buildings with the status of a royal palace are in a very real sense royal <e> <s> people regard such places as hampton court palace and the tower of london as closely connected with our national heritage and with the monarchy <e> <s> it is indeed to an immeasurable extent the royal linkage with these places which makes them such attractions <e>", "<cs> my right honourable friend intends to bring forward proposals in the spring to amend prison rule in particular to remove the requirement which he regards as unhelpful and inappropriate that the information be conveyed in the prisoners cell or room <e> <s> this requirement has led to great practical difficulties partly because documentary information provided as part of cell furniture has proved vulnerable to damage and destruction <e> <s> the proposed new rule will preserve the requirement that the information which it is necessary prisoners should know be given in writing but my right honourable friend intends to achieve this by the introduction of a booklet to be issued individually to each inmate on reception <e> <s> such booklets will be easier to revise than the existing cell cards <e> <s> because of this and because inmates will have their own copy of the booklet rather than being dependent on the unsatisfactory cell card system the home secretary hopes that these new arrangements will be more helpful to inmates <e> <s> they will also be easier for our hard pressed establishments to operate <e> <s> my right honourable friend intends to propose similar provisions for young offenders establishments at present the borstal and detention centre rules require only that a careful explanation which is done orally be given to inmates following arrival <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> the local authority associations and the glc have been consulted on the proposed new civil defence regulations <e> <s> their views were invited by st january <e> <s> further discussion and meetings with ministers will occur during february and it is hoped to lay the final draft regulations before parliament in march with a view to debate after easter <e> <s> the noble lord will find the answer to his question therein <e>", "<cs> my lords i find myself at one with the noble lord on both his analysis and his amazement <e>", "<cs> my lords most of your lordships had the opportunity of seeing the book upon which the script of this play was based <e> <s> nobody would stand at this dispatch box and say that nuclear warfare was desirable or something to be looked at with anything but horror <e> <s> the function of this government is to preserve this people in the face of that threat <e> <s> we believe that to do so we must not only be armed so that we cannot be seen to be a push-over but also be prepared so that we are seen to be ready to run the risk that is necessary in order to preserve peace both for this country and for mankind <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect if anybody is trying to condition the british public it would appear to be the noble lord with this endless series of questions suggesting that what we do out of motives of compassion and prudence is dictated by either folly or some kind of cruelty <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that that is a different question although there are similarities <e>", "<cs> my lords as to why an individual coroner takes a decision to do something on an individual occasion i could not properly hazard a guess <e> <s> but as to the earlier part of the noble lords question although he was directing it at the police i should point out that it is the duty of the coroners pathologist to examine all factors relevant to the cause of death of a victim and the level of blood alcohol at the time of a fatal accident may be relevant even if normally it would have no bearing on the accident itself <e> <s> whether it did so cannot be established until the level is known <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to repeat or to rephrase what i said <e> <s> the coroner is an independent judicial officer within the scope of the law and subject <e>", "<cs> my lords i am seized of the point which the noble and learned lord is properly making but not being familiar with the case in question i can only surmise <e> <s> since coroners pathologists take blood samples and test them for alcoholic content in virtually all cases where people are killed in motor accidents whether they are drivers passengers or indeed pedestrians i would suspect that the information came to the coroner from that source and there would be nothing improper in that <e>", "<cs> certainly my lords if i find that anything improper has taken place and if the noble lord would be kind enough to tell me which the case was <e> <s> i am merely saying that <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed <e> <s> the role of alcohol in accidents is an important matter upon which it is proper that we should be informed <e> <s> in individual cases however it may be important for the actual contributory causes or influences surrounding the death of a passenger other than the accident itself to be known <e> <s> for cases of insurance for instance and other reasons this may be necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords we could stray for long and diverting periods into the realms of hypothesis <e> <s> what the noble lord lord avebury has pointed out is i believe valid that we need to know the role of alcohol in fatalities and that this can be known only if samples are taken <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it there are two questions <e> <s> the first is the one which the noble lord has repeated <e> <s> the second is whether indeed the information was properly obtained <e> <s> i shall certainly try to discover whether there were any forms of impropriety <e> <s> i cannot go further than that this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i have only been in this house or years and i have never yet succeeded in satisfying the noble lord lord donaldson but i shall always continue to try <e> <s> if he will allow me to finish my speech which is not quite so near the conclusion as <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the correction in good part but nonetheless what i said was that we wished to increase the numbers there so far as was consistent with preserving the rgime <e> <s> i hope he thinks that aim is laudable he may not think it is capable of being achieved <e>", "<cs> very well my lords <e> <s> i think it is something i should look at because i want to have as clear a picture as i can <e> <s> i referred earlier to a number of matters to which i would return <e> <s> it appears from this debate that there is concern certainly among the board of visitors and among some of the staff about the adequacy of the accommodation for some of the therapeutic group sessions and about the arrangements for transfer of inmates into and out from the prison <e> <s> these are things which directly affect the rgime <e> <s> taken together with the commitment of those concerned to a rgime entirely special to their particular prison these seem to me to be matters of some importance about which i ought to be better informed <e> <s> i will therefore take the earliest opportunity that my other duties permit to visit the prison and see for myself what is going on <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble lord <e> <s> it was one of the notes i wrote on a smaller piece of paper to remind myself to reply but which got tucked away <e> <s> i cannot be as helpful to the noble lord as i should like to be because i cannot give a date and that is what he wants <e> <s> but i can assure the noble lord that this is under consideration in the department <e> <s> it is also being discussed with the relevant outside bodies <e> <s> the noble lord will think that it has taken too long but because i have no further information at the moment i cannot say more than that it will be decided quite soon <e> <s> if i can be more precise at a later stage i shall write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> the report of my right honourable and noble friend lord jellicoe of his review of the operation of the prevention of terrorism temporary provisions act is published today <e> <s> my right honourable friend the home secretary is most grateful <e>", "<cs> my right honourable friend has today laid before parliament a statement of further changes in the immigration rules to replace the statement laid before parliament on th december hc and disapproved by a resolution in another place on th december <e> <s> the rules as changed will come into effect on th february <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness was kind enough to warn me that she would make this allegation <e> <s> as a result the department has already reminded establishments that those detained under the age of must not be sold tobacco and cigarettes <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> from this side i should like to open the proceedings this afternoon by thanking the noble lord lord mishcon and the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones for tabling their copious and <e>", "<cs> as i addressed my whole speech to trying to dispel that illusion i must apologise for not doing it better <e> <s> they are in the definitions clause in order that each shall be given a separate and distinct meaning for the purposes of this bill <e> <s> throughout the bill they mean what they are said to mean in the definitions clause <e>", "<cs> i entirely accept that the definition of data as framed in the bill embraces information recorded in a vast range of circumstances <e> <s> before i <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> i think we are not so much concerned with elegance and symmetry as with the effect of the bill <e> <s> the effect of this subsection is as i have described it given that it has to be taken with the definitions of data user and of personal data <e>", "<cs> the effect of the noble lords amendment would be radically to restrict the scope of the bill <e> <s> since the whole bill is concerned with the control and regulation of personal data the definition in clause is central to the effect that the bill will have <e> <s> as cast this provision recognises the existence of three categories of personal data <e> <s> first there are factual data <e> <s> they may cover a multitude of matters such as names addresses ages marital status number of children level of income i could go on indefinitely <e> <s> there can be no question that such data must be caught by the bill and i think that that is something with which the noble lord would agree <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i could just reassure the noble lord <e> <s> the bill is about controlling data <e> <s> we now all know what data are and i still want to say is <e> <s> they are fugitive uninterpretable to the human eye <e> <s> transferable at the speed of light to distances possibly via a satellite to another continent they can be collated instantaneously with other unknown masses of information <e> <s> they ought to be under public control <e> <s> the piece of paper which the boss keeps in his drawer or the filing clerk keeps in the registry to which the noble lord lord mishcon said that certain information of a judgmental type might be consigned cannot be so transferred and is not so dangerous to the individual <e> <s> as soon as the boss or the filing clerk decides that it ought to be collated transmitted or in other ways handled so that it becomes data it falls within the bill <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for that explanation of the amendment <e> <s> i am bound to acknowledge that the bill as drafted could in certain circumstances be used by for example self-employed persons to discover what was thought about them in a business context in a way that would not be open to a larger organisation and i acknowledge the difficulty in this field <e> <s> however i am not as confident as is my noble friend that it is possible to distinguish as he attempts to do between opinions about the business activities of a self-employed person and opinions about the person himself <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord for his lucid and brief explanation of what he is about <e> <s> as we have already found in debates on the earlier amendments the definitions in clause cover a very complex area and they have been drawn up with great care <e> <s> it is therefore of the first importance that the bill applies to those persons and those kinds of information that it needs to apply to for the proper protection of data subjects but to no others <e> <s> i understand the temptation to add transferring to the operations referred to in clause as constituting processing <e> <s> i note that the lindop committee included transfer under what it called handling which is the equivalent of what we call processing <e> <s> i note too that the council of europe convention includes dissemination in its definition of processing <e> <s> but in both those cases a rather different approach was taken to the definition <e> <s> we have looked again at those in the bill and we are confident that the addition of transferring is not necessary <e> <s> i shall try to explain why as lucidly and briefly as the noble lord has explained why it is necessary <e>", "<cs> i think that i need to take a moments thought about that <e> <s> i had relaxed a second too early <e> <s> i had put the whole idea out of my mind in anticipation of amendment no <e> <s> or no <e> <s> a as it happens <e> <s> a transfer between machines is certainly the handling of data is it not <e> <s> i think that this is one of the occasions when i gratefully recall what the noble lord lord wigoder said <e> <s> i want to think about this point but the advice is that such an occurence involves an extraction before there is a transfer <e> <s> but i think my noble friend is thinking there might be some kind of electronic key which would enable information data to be transferred between one computer and another on as it were a delayed command without even the knowledge of the user <e> <s> i believe that later in the bill we shall come to an <e>", "<cs> it was good of the noble lord to apologise for the late tabling of his amendment <e> <s> a number of amendments were tabled late and although <e>", "<cs> i did not wish to make a meal of this <e> <s> however this amendment proposes a further modification to the definition of processing in clause of the bill <e> <s> what it would do would be to provide in the case of personal data that to qualify as processing the listed operations would have to be performed by reference to an identifiable data subject rather than simply by reference to a particular data subject <e> <s> i do not i confess even after having listened to the noble lord appreciate the need for this amendment <e> <s> the concept of an individual being identifiable is already present in the bill by virtue of subsection if the data do not relate to a living individual who can be identified from the information they are not personal data in our terms <e> <s> and since to carry the argument one stage further one can only be a data subject if one is the subject of personal data the subsection definition must carry with it the idea of being identifiable <e> <s> if the noble lord wants further precision i am happy to write to him <e>", "<cs> the trouble with wide umbrellas is that they poke other peoples eyes out <e> <s> it is the case in this bill that an apparently innocuous minor modification in one place turns out to be a change that fundamentally affects the carefully constructed edifice that the definitions together represent somewhere else <e>", "<cs> in matters of procedure and the drafting of bills i regard myself in some respects as a pupil of my noble friend lord renton <e> <s> i always secretly flatter myself upon having been the first person to make use of a keeling schedule after he brought in his report <e> <s> i do not know whether there was a mad rush of other people to do so but i hope that my noble friend took that as a gesture of my respect <e>", "<cs> to save time i would refer the noble lord to our debate on the first amendment in which i believe i covered this point <e> <s> it is a question of interlocking definitions and of the effect of one definition not being complete until the occasion is caught by the effect of another <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the noble lord <e> <s> i was endeavouring to go fast and i went too fast <e> <s> as to a child access will be dependent on a courts decision as to whether the child is competent to exercise his rights <e> <s> that will depend on his age <e> <s> if the child does not have access then the parents will <e> <s> that i understand is the state of the law generally <e> <s> as to husbands and wives and families nobody can have somebody elses data without their consent <e> <s> if the noble lord looks at clause <e>", "<cs> the amendment would as the noble and learned lord has said remove from the secretary of state and place in the hands of the registrar the power to modify or supplement the data protection <e>", "<cs> the male as always embraces the female <e>", "<cs> the right of subject access is a key element in the scheme that this bill establishes <e> <s> it is both an end in itself the means by which individuals may reassure themselves about the data held on them and a stepping-stone to further action if access reveals evidence of a breach of the other data protection principles <e> <s> i have therefore listened with particular attention to the noble lord in moving this amendment for it is vital that we establish full subject rights in this area <e>", "<cs> the point i was making is merely that if one says i want to see my data please and the answer is i havent got any data on you then one has confirmation <e> <s> if there are data and i have data on the noble lord i have to give them to him <e> <s> however i shall certainly look at it <e>", "<cs> the governments thinking is not as my noble friend will realise as profound as i should like because it has been conducted at some speed <e> <s> as i understand it my noble friend is now not so certain that he is content with the definition of personal data in clause of the bill as i earlier took him to be <e> <s> now he has said that i am a little less puzzled by what he proposes <e> <s> but these two amendments seek to restrict the entitlement which the bill establishes to subject access which of course is at the core of what we are doing <e>", "<cs> at second reading i spoke of the need for this bill to strike a proper balance between data subject and data user <e> <s> we shall hear more of this in this committee <e> <s> to err in one direction will mean that we will provide inadequate safeguards for the subject and to err in the other will mean that we will place unacceptable burdens on the data users <e> <s> i accept that it will often be a nice judgment as to whether the bill has got that balance right <e> <s> but i should like to try to set out why in this instance we think the balance in the bill is right and why we think that the noble lords amendment would tilt the balance unacceptably against data users <e> <s> the interpretation of the first principle in paragraph of part ii of schedule is not exhaustive <e> <s> the requirement to consider whether the person providing information has been deceived or misled deliberately singles out two positive actions that can be presumed to be tantamount to unfair collection of data <e> <s> that does not of course preclude other considerations being weighted in the balance when the particular circumstances of the case so demand <e> <s> and on some occasions leaving somebody in ignorance will amount to deceit <e>", "<cs> long was the search and earnest the consideration which we devoted to trying to find amendments which we could honestly say would improve the bill which had been suggested to us by the noble lord and his noble and learned friend <e> <s> i regret to say that we have not yet reached the point at which we have been rewarded with a modicum of success <e> <s> it is right that entries in the register should give a proper picture of the purposes for which data are being held <e> <s> that is not at issue <e> <s> but i do not believe that the noble lords amendment will add to what the bill already provides in this respect and there is a danger that it could actually confuse this aspect of the provisions <e>", "<cs> i too have sat on the bench opposite i too have laboured long and hard to find amendments acceptable to government and then to persuade government to allow me to move them and not to take them over and table them at the next stage <e> <s> the noble and learned lord has all my sympathy <e> <s> i suffer as much sorrow as he does that yet again i am unable to meet him on this <e> <s> the fact is that though my heart and the brief may divide my head and the brief do not <e>", "<cs> whether it will be good or plain i very much doubt <e> <s> that is a matter of sad disappointment on so many occasions when dealing with large organisations <e> <s> but it will certainly be in english welsh or some other intelligible language <e>", "<cs> i have listened with interest to this debate particularly as when the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones did not move amendment no <e> <s> which i thought was a paving one for this i feared that we were going to miss this opportunity <e> <s> may i first briefly talk on what my noble friend suggests since we are talking to both of the amendments and then go on to look at what the noble lord lord mishcon proposes <e>", "<cs> something good usually comes out of our deliberations <e> <s> in this case exactly how good i do not know because all i can say is that i shall consider very carefully what noble lords have said in this debate as is always my practice <e> <s> i remind the committee that the registrar will be perfectly free to consult and take advice without a statutory mechanism to do so <e> <s> the types of advice that he is going to want are almost totally unpredictable because one does not know in what direction the new technology is going to be pointed <e> <s> for instance seven or years ago it was unthinkable that there would be databanks used for introducing people for the purposes of marriage <e> <s> maybe there will be some new departure like that there probably will be almost annually <e> <s> the composition of the advisory body therefore is something which will almost certainly have to fluctuate if it is going to be appropriate <e> <s> as i wrote my original remarks i was going to say that the noble and learned lord had suggested that we needed a fir tree and he has presented us with a flagpole <e> <s> in other words there are many functions and refinements in his mind which do not appear in the amendment <e> <s> i shall be able to look at what he said and consider further what the position is without i hope unduly encouraging him <e> <s> my heart has been hungry for many an amendment and i want to say something agreeable before we have our dinner <e>", "<cs> i listened with interest to the noble and learned lords introduction to this amendment and to the reflections on it by the noble viscount lord craigavon <e> <s> the bill as drafted provides that the initial office holder shall serve for a full five-year period in order both to oversee the setting up of the register and to establish the direction which the registrars office shall take during the first few years in which the provisions are fully operational <e> <s> thereafter it was the governments view that there might be grounds for an element of flexibility in the lengths of appointment made so that for example if a good man were found for the job who for some reason could only serve for a more limited period one would not be inhibited from appointing him for that shorter time <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble lord inadvertently failed to speak to this amendment with his amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it is consequential on amendment no <e> <s> is it not <e>", "<cs> these amendments refer to the parts of schedule which give the secretary of state a role in controlling the registrars manpower expenditure and accounting procedures <e> <s> the noble and learned lord has argued that the secretary of state should be relieved of that role and that the full burden should ultimately rest on the treasury <e> <s> he suggested that this is necessary to avoid the secretary of state who in this case would be the home secretary being faced with a dangerous conflict of interests on the one hand he is responsible for approving the registrars resources on the other he might be suspected of wanting to avoid the registrar looking too closely at data held by the home office <e>", "<cs> i have been deeply interested by these exchanges as they unravel mystery after mystery <e> <s> my attention was caught by the fact that unlike my noble friend lord mottistone and the noble and learned lord lord gardiner the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones and the noble lord lord mishcon have put their names down to these amendments as well as to those beginning with no <e> <s> on the marshalled list <e> <s> the fact that they may be inconsistent or alternative i do not think suffices to prevent me from teasing noble lords opposite a bit either they are so confident that the first amendment will fall that they have put their names on the second and the second one would be superfluous or maybe it is merely the enormously persuasive presence of my noble friends name on the marshalled list which has served to give <e>", "<cs> i will not delay longer speculating about what happens if both are accepted <e> <s> i think we should all find it confusing <e> <s> i fear that we have nonetheless if i may now concentrate on the amendment before the committee which is what i should have done before had i not been in a very naughty mood a number of very substantial objections to the present group of amendments <e> <s> if i can summary them briefly first we can scarcely agree to the registrar drawing up codes of practice without any statutory guidance to him as to what they should contain <e> <s> he would not know where to begin <e> <s> and since they are to have such a far-reaching effect the force indeed of the criminal law parliament could not pass its responsibilities to him <e> <s> there would have to be some parliamentary scrutiny if the criminal law was to be invoked and that would involve a minister having to be responsible for putting them before parliament <e> <s> furthermore while my noble friend shows admirable concern for data users in certain other amendments he has tabled he is now contemplating placing such swingeing additional requirements on users as are represented by these amendments <e> <s> i find this surprising <e> <s> to face prosecution for breach of a code of practice is a formidable we would say unreasonable extension of the bills requirements <e>", "<cs> as i understand it we are speaking of the implication in the amendment <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord looks at the amendment which strikes within this group on clause then he will find <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to my noble friend for giving me notice of what he was about to say <e> <s> he raises the question of the application of the bill to those who trade in lists of names and addresses <e> <s> i ought first to point out that such list brokers will be caught under the bill only if they constitute data users or computer bureaux in terms of clause <e> <s> when they do not their regulation is no part of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lords question and the answer which it has elicited will result in

the falklands as though they were links directly with the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of your lordships house i think i can only say that junior ministers in the lords do not have disposal of government time in the commons but my noble friend does know how we feel about this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords if i was patient i would listen to the programme and marshal my arguments

situation <e> <s> it will indeed apply for the next election <e>", "<cs> my lords although my noble friend will not agree with the noble lord that there is a danger of being rushed i have to say that the anxiety which he expresses is one of which we are well aware and this whole matter is in fact the subject of investigation by a select committee in another place <e> <s> it is in the light of the findings of that committee that we would wish to examine the whole question <e>", "<cs> my lords the test for voting in an election is at present universal and that is to be on an <e>", "<cs> my lords

are many recesses in the home office some of them very deep but in none of them have i encountered the mr smith to whom he referred <e> <s> the precise question to which the noble and learned lord addresses himself is whether we are to be dealing with the secretary of state as an individual or i presume as an officer of state or as a body corporate <e> <s> i am not certain i think that it may well be a matter to which we should return at a later stage unless i can be enlightened very soon i have only been told where to place my money it is on the home secretary <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord has addressed himself to a particular point and therefore i shall not address myself to the whole of the amendment <e> <s> the information he seeks to elicit is where in the bill is the power for the registrar to give advice <e> <s> the answer to that is in clause where the noble and learned lord will see that <e>", "<cs> in the light of that question i have to look more closely at the amendment and that particular point in it <e> <s> the difficulty is if the registrar is to be under a duty to give advice to every single person who asks him about any matter he might well become absolutely submerged <e> <s> we therefore want him to be able to give advice in the form most expeident for its use <e> <s> on occasion a very large data user may come along with a very important question which applies to many other people and require direct advice in some quantity and some length <e> <s> but other matters which apply generally are more suitable for general publication <e> <s> i think and it must be for the registrar himself to respond to the different situations as they arise rather than for us to try to preconceive what each single one of them will be <e>", "<cs> i always read what the noble lord says with great attention <e> <s> if i am wrong i will be ready to say as much <e> <s> my present understanding is that by becoming a data user one does not stop being a member of the public that one is entitled to advice and that the terms in which clause is phrased are not such as to preclude the registrar from giving advice in particular cases <e> <s> that is the anxiety which the noble and learned lord has and which his noble friend has underlined <e> <s> i do not think that the clause has that effect <e> <s> i will make certain that i am right before the next stage <e>", "<cs> i am certain that there is an ordinary power to give advice and i am equally certain that there is no power to charge for it <e>", "<cs> that sort of thing is required to allow him to insert expensive notices in newspapers to publish pamphlets and circulate them to have posters put up in libraries and all the other ways of which he may wish to avail himself <e>", "<cs> as i have said i believe that there is a natural right anyway and my noble and learned friend has said that better than i can <e> <s> i believe that the particular is subsumed in the general and i believe therefore that the registrar is perfectly capable under the bill as it stands of doing exactly what the noble lord lord foot and i and the noble lords lords wigoder and mishcon and so on all want the bill to do <e> <s> the only question is whether it does <e> <s> i have already undertaken to take expert advice and make myself doubly sure that it does do so <e> <s> i do not know whether i can give a more committing undertaking than that <e> <s> i see that the noble lord lord wigoder is about to try to make me do so but i do not think it will be possible <e>", "<cs> the effect of the amendment proposed is to alter subtly but quite significantly the manner in which the registrar will approach his task of compiling the register <e> <s> the bill as drafted establishes a stiff test to be met by the registrar before an application is refused registration <e> <s> he shall not refuse an application unless one of the considerations set out in subsection has been satisfied <e> <s> this is quite deliberate since the government do not believe that the registration stage is the appropriate point at which to submit data users to close scrutiny <e> <s> to do so would be to risk overburdening the registration process not only at the first setting up of the register but subsequently when it may be crucial for individual users for applications to be considered quickly <e>", "<cs> i am not certain that i did not lose the last and vital half sentence of what the noble viscount was saying <e> <s> could he repeat his conclusion <e>", "<cs> as i read the bill it says that the registrar shall not refuse an application for registration or for the alteration of registered particulars unless the situation to which the noble viscount adverts arises <e> <s> if that arises then i suppose if there is a lingering doubt in his mind that the operator may be marginally infringing a principle which could be properly protected by a small alteration of the way that he runs his operation it would be quite proper and the committee will think that it will be proper that if nobodys interests were harmed in this matter then the operator should be given the opportunity to put it right <e> <s> if on the other hand there was a flagrant breach of principles intended or expected if the registrar felt the anxieties which the noble viscount lord bledisloe has suggested he might feel then it would be proper for him to refuse to register <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has asked me to speak again which i do with reluctance <e> <s> i would say as i said before that what he proposes reads a little too like the good housekeeping seal of approval which was something which threw him into great anxiety when it was proposed more overtly by my noble friend lord mottistone earlier on i think properly <e> <s> what he requires is a degree of detailed inspection before registration which would greatly delay the operation of this bill which both he and i want to see operating <e> <s> the noble lord is quite right i am always open to reason but i am open to rather more of it than he has on this occasion presented <e>", "<cs> i hope that i shall be able to serve your lordships committee by allaying the anxieties of both noble lords who have spoken and to reassure them that an extra stage for the production of submissions by applicants as set out in this amendment is not needed <e>", "<cs> let us cross that bridge when we come to it <e> <s> my noble friend feels that the terms in clause <e>", "<cs> this amendment represents a small but welcome oasis on the long and thirsty march in search of a concession which i can make to the noble lord <e> <s> while it is a very small oasis and i think it may slake the noble lords thirst better than mine i do not think <e>", "<cs> i was expecting an intervention from the other party whose support appears on the marshalled list but i see that they have observed their customary silence on this bill <e> <s> i recognise that in proposing a mechanism in which voluntary codes of practice drawn up by data users are certified by the registrar the new clause attempts to find a path somewhere between the statutory approach to codes of practice which was recommended by the lindop committee and the voluntary approach which was put forward by the government in their white paper <e> <s> i acknowledge the care with which noble lords have reached a compromise between those two approaches <e> <s> it will enable those who wish to prepare codes of practice to do so at their own pace and then receive some official recognition for their efforts <e> <s> that is a most attractive prospect <e> <s> however seductive as this path may seem i am not entirely convinced that it will lead us to where we want to go <e>", "<cs> i think i must return to the box to dispel something approaching an illusion which i may have generated <e> <s> your lordships should realise that we accept the value of voluntary codes of practice drawn up as general guides to users in particular areas and the registrar has the power under clause to assist in developing such codes as he thinks appropriate <e> <s> but i do not think we can require him to crawl laboriously over every code submitted by uncounted individual users and leave him with no time to do anything else <e>", "<cs> i am seized of the force of the view that my noble friend has put forward <e> <s> we would be the first to agree that data users once they had registered should not be required to renew their registration unnecessarily frequently <e> <s> indeed we have been thinking in terms of something like three years as the period to be prescribed in the regulations which would be made consequent upon the prescriptive power contained in clause <e> <s> but rather than specify a particular period on the face of the bill we prefer to retain maximum flexibility partly because we felt that at some point in the future for reasons which we cannot now foresee we might regret being statutorily limited to no shorter period than three years <e> <s> nevertheless i am attracted by what my noble friend has said <e>", "<cs> i am undertaking to consider it and that customarily means that one has it in mind to bring forward an amendment or advise ones noble friend how to bring forward an amendment if ones consideration turns out in the way that ones noble friend hopes that it will <e> <s> i cannot be more specific than that <e>", "<cs> clause of the bill places the registrar under a duty to make the contents of the register available for inspection by members of the public <e> <s> clause requires him to supply on payment of such fee as may be prescribed certified copies of register entries <e> <s> the amendment proposed by my noble friend lord mottistone is designed to prevent abuse of this entitlement to these certified copies <e> <s> i think there is no need for concern on that score if i have his intentions right <e> <s> the bill makes adequate provision to ensure that the process of public <e>", "<cs> that is exactly the problem to which the bill as drafted addresses itself <e> <s> we had a debate on this earlier <e> <s> the registrar can require information in sufficient detail to satisfy himself that the principles will not be breached <e> <s> but equally he is allowed under the parts of the bill i am now discussing to accept registration in such general terms as will protect the data user from revealing commercially damaging information not necessary for the protection of the interests of the data subject <e> <s> there is therefore no need to fear what my noble friend implied there might be need to fear <e>", "<cs> the penalty for not providing the information is not to get registered and therefore not to be able to operate <e> <s> that is the sanction <e> <s> it is for the user to satisfy the registrar of the degree of detail in which registration should be accepted <e> <s> the bill provides for those cases i find it difficult to give an example and i do not want to be tied to this in future debate where the information might be only from clearing banks or might be only from married women but it would not say from which clearing bank or from which married woman <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord avebury rightly says the substance of these issues is something that we come to later in the bill and specifically in clauses and when we come to exemptions on which i think we shall have a number of exchanges <e> <s> except on matters of national security all computers are embraced by clause <e> <s> i think that that is the assurance that the noble lord lord avebury wants <e> <s> it is of course the register kept by the registrar that we are talking about <e> <s> it is the summary of all the installations in the country that fall within the description of computer and that is just a guidebook to the data subject as to where he may direct his inquiries if he thinks that his name is being held somewhere to his disadvantage <e> <s> therefore the important feature of the register is that it is sufficiently comprehensive to show people where to look and sufficiently detailed to eliminate needless causes of anxiety about the purposes to which information comprising data is put or about the sources from which it is to be found <e>", "<cs> the substance of what the noble lord seeks is behind clause and in clause <e> <s> i am sure that he is aware of clause which sets out the categories and of paragraph <e>", "<cs> this amendment which the noble lord has elegantly explained is designed to restrict the discretion which quite deliberately the registrar has been afforded by the bill to decide the circumstances in which his powers are to be exercised <e> <s> as drafted the registrar must be satisfied that the data protection principles have been or are being contravened before he may serve an enforcement notice under clause <e> <s> but he is left an entirely free hand to decide whether or not in an given case he will exercise that power <e> <s> the registrar is required once he has decided that there has been or is a contravention to consider whether that contravention has caused or is likely to cause damage or distress to any person <e> <s> again he is given a free hand <e> <s> he is not obliged to take action in every circumstance in which the harm test has been met nor is he precluded from acting even when there is no harm <e>", "<cs> i am advised on the one hand that it is an ordinary dictionary word and on the other that it gives therefore the registrar discretion to decide what it means <e> <s> i am not sure whether that will entirely satisfy the noble lord lord wigoder <e> <s> if he has remaining doubts perhaps he will discuss them before the next stage <e> <s> now i merely take note of his anxiety that the term distress is imprecise <e> <s> as i have just said that materially is imprecise it would be disingenuous of me not to take note of what he has said and if it is necessary to do more i shall be in touch with him <e>", "<cs> indeed <e> <s> i have just said that i shall think about it <e> <s> when i think about legislation i always think very carefully because i always find it necessary to do so in order to understand it <e>", "<cs> if i can just recapitulate as i emerge from a flurry of irrelevant papers the noble viscount is asking whether there is an appeal not only on the grounds specified in the earlier subsections but also about when it is unreasonable to be required to make it within the period set out in subsection <e> <s> am i right <e>", "<cs> i think i should refer the noble viscount to clause which deals with emergency procedures <e> <s> the committee will be addressing itself to this clause later <e> <s> that might be the appropriate time to deal with this matter <e>", "<cs> we are on somewhat familiar ground <e> <s> i have already indicated in responding to the similar amendments moved by the noble lord in clause that the government do not believe that the protection provided under this legislation will be made more effective by attempting to place obligations on the registrar <e> <s> our belief is that nothing will be served by attempting in advance to identify the circumstances in <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones does not wish to move his amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> every time i concentrate on the future and forget the past noble lords teach me lessons from history so i am a little averse to taking that advice <e> <s> as i understand it what noble lords sought to do by the last amendment and we ought to address ourselves to this one was to see that in certain circumstances the registrar had to take the extreme step of a de-registration notice <e> <s> what my noble friend is now saying is that he should not be required to do that until something else has happened and people have had an opportunity to put themselves in the right as it were with the registrar <e>", "<cs> of course there is force in what the noble lord lord avebury says about everything having come through the first filter of registration that the number of cases we are likely to be looking at will therefore be small and that most of them will be in breach of the requirement to register a change of use <e> <s> but we are trying to think of other hypothetical cases <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord has not addressed himself to his own amendment and he will forgive me if i do not either <e> <s> he started by addressing himself to the weight to be given to a lord chancellor as being double that of any other and then pointed out that there were two ex-lord chancellors on the bench opposite and that this formed a sort of equilibrium in which i sit delicately balanced more or less in the middle <e>", "<cs> i am very happy to do so but i do not think this is the occasion <e>", "<cs> clearly i did not speak for long enough to impress upon the noble lord lord elystan-morgan the importance which we attach to the investigative function of the registrar which is evident if you read the bill and you see the centrality of the notice giving powers without which he is after all powerless <e> <s> really the imagination cannot conjure up a situation in which a person who can only act by exercising these powers should not exercise them for the simple reason that he was not going to inquire into the circumstances of the cases presented to him <e>", "<cs> the amendment as i understand it is not about accessibility by the data subject to a patient and sympathetic ear <e> <s> it is about the owner of the patient and sympathetic ear being allowed to go out with a penetrating and perceptive eye to see whether the complaint is justified or not in other words to investigate <e> <s> what the noble and learned lord has said he is concerned about is the power to investigate <e> <s> his first concern was that the power to investigate was not actually stated on the face of the bill <e> <s> to that i replied that since so many provisions of the bill in order to be put into operation depended on the power to investigate i was reliably informed that it was implicit in the bill and that the noble and learned lord need not have any worries on that score <e>", "<cs> this amendment comes before us as an orphan or bereaved because i was expecting it until my noble friend was kind enough to tell me otherwise to be trotting off with amendment no <e> <s> and others in company <e> <s> however we are now to look at it on its own and i understand the reasons <e>", "<cs> i think this is a question of comprehension <e> <s> as i understand it the purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the registrars attention when deciding whether to serve a transfer prohibition notice is not to be confined solely to the risk of harm to individuals but that he can consider whether a category of persons will be placed at risk <e> <s> i sympathise with that desire to enable the registrar to look broadly at the harm which might be caused if the transfer in question goes ahead and to ensure that he would not be inhibited in the use of his powers by the fact that he was unable to identify individuals put at risk as opposed to categories of persons <e>", "<cs> perhaps i might refer to the purposes of these provisions <e> <s> the international nature of the information technology industry came up on second reading on a number of occasions <e> <s> it means that if there were no controls on the transfer of personal data from this country to one which lacked equivalent safeguards for data protection the purposes of the bill might be defeated <e> <s> indeed if there was no control over the passage of personal data from this country others <e>", "<cs> may i seize this opportunity to straighten the record particularly since the noble and learned lord lord gardiner took me up on the point and referred to it during the debate on the schedule <e> <s> your lordships will recall that i was asked under difficult circumstances who would be the registered data user in the home office <e> <s> after a certain hesitation i said that i would put my money on the home secretary <e> <s> i very much regret to have to tell your lordships that i lost the bet <e> <s> i am advised that the <e>", "<cs> it would have shortened that debate <e>", "<cs> i fear that i must oppose my noble friends amendment and for two reasons <e> <s> the first is largely technical <e> <s> a data user as defined by the bill is one who among other things controls the contents and use of data <e> <s> yet this amendment would apply to such people the quite separate concept entirely valid so far as bureaux are concerned of providing services on behalf of other people <e> <s> i fear that the idea of control and that of being authorised to perform certain tasks are not ones that will sit happily together and that the amendment as it stands must be regarded as defective <e>", "<cs> i do not quite follow that last question <e> <s> if no offence is committed the fact that the place is searched cannot destroy the livelihood of the person whose equipment <e>", "<cs> it may not be very good for him but i suggest that it will not happen very often <e> <s> the noble lord lord wigoder pointed out that the applications will not be very numerous <e> <s> my noble friend has <e>", "<cs> it is one of the paradoxes of legislation and many other aspects of life that it takes much longer to write a short speech than it does to write a long one <e> <s> in order to satisfy your lordships anticipations at this hour of the night <e> <s> i do not propose to deliver the whole of the speech that i had prepared to deal with this amendment <e>", "<cs> i can stop shrinking in my bench and indeed give a sympathetic nod in the direction of the noble and learned lord <e>", "<cs> my lords it is just over a year since this house last had an opportunity to discuss the system of local government elections and it is local government elections that we were discussing and i shall not be tempted down the path which many noble lords have gone down to discuss national elections whether in this country or elsewhere <e> <s> on that occasion just over a year ago the noble lord lord evans of claughton rose to call attention to <e>", "<cs> my lords i am addressing myself to the bill put forward by the noble lord lord harris of greenwich <e> <s> whether the elastic built into it is <e>", "<cs> but if your lordships want and i must not

size and if at the same time your lordships wish to leave all the worst examples of malpractice untouched the noble lord has produced here the outlines of a means of achieving it which your lordships should support <e> <s> the choice is for your lordships <e> <s> for me it is simple <e> <s> i shall not be throwing up the cap with which my noble friend lord holderness has invested me <e> <s> i

coming here to marry and consequently to settle down or to settle down and therefore to marry <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i must limit the number of interruptions <e> <s> could we spread them out a little <e> <s> on this subject the noble lord lord avebury asked me whether i intended to continue to live with my wife <e> <s> i am happy to tell him that the question is in no way embarrassing

application <e> <s> that is not impertinent <e> <s> it is strictly pertinent and i would expect to have to satisfy those concerned with my admission to that other and no doubt desirable country that i did indeed intend to marry her and that i was not using her as an excuse to secure entry only <e>", "<cs> my lords cases will differ will they not <e> <s> in my case i would be able to point to a long association would i not <e> <s> before i married her the association was somewhat shorter <e> <s> but i think it was conducted in terms which made my original intentions pretty clear to me if they did not make them pretty clear to her <e>", "<cs> my lords i am tempted to say that i find most of the noble lords arguments better on their heads but i will not <e> <s> the way the noble lord has put it is the one which i should like to tackle <e> <s> if the total number of immigrants rises beyond a certain proportion of the national total clearly that is a destabilising and threatening facet <e> <s> everything which has been said from the opposition front bench appears to echo that <e> <s> one cannot arrive at a total without it being made up of individual cases and in order to restrict the total it is necessary also to scrutinise the individual cases <e> <s> the noble lord writes to me and to my honourable friend with such a plethora of individual cases that i thought i ought to take this opportunity to mention to him that even those added together amount to a considerable total <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i had sat down <e> <s> it is customary to make an interjection but not a speech <e> <s> the noble lord asked me if i was aware that i had referred to commonwealth immigration <e> <s> i am not aware that i referred to it in any sense in which it was

it might be necessary to ask for legislation <e> <s> i was not frankly personally aware of that but i shall see that my right honourable friend is made so aware <e> <s> as to the two broadcasts to which the noble lord referred <e> <s> i heard that given by the noble lord lord jacobson <e> <s> on the question of people leaning on other people i think those matters are best left out of the

again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may take a second of your lordships time to put right a misconception which may have risen from an exchange earlier in our proceedings <e> <s> at an earlier stage last week the noble viscount lord bledisloe made the point that legal entitlement to the receipt of information subject access to information only arose once the person in question had established that such data existed <e> <s> therefore there was no means of discovering by asking for information from a computer whether or not one was a data subject because there would be no right to get the information if one was not a data subject <e> <s> i merely wanted to put on record at this stage that of course the legal entitlement actually subsists <e>", "<cs> i respond to this amendment looking over my shoulder at amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i had half thought that no <e> <s> was the one that we would struggle with at great length and that the noble lord would then substitute the secretary of state for the registrar in a swift and scarcely perceptible movement and i would fall exhausted into his arms <e> <s> that it seems will not be the outcome <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord will now permit me to come back because what he said was that i had not sufficiently covered the ground and i did not deploy all my distaste for his amendment on the basis that he had not deployed all his enthusiasm for it <e> <s> the fact is that the provision which the noble lord proposes would be likely to entail the secretary of state prescribing very detailed requirements in regard to every possible set of circumstances <e> <s> in other words it would take us back into the realm of codes of practice which as i have already said we believe cannot sensibly be imposed from above <e> <s> indeed the sort of codes of practice being suggested here are if anything even less attractive than those postulated in the noble lords earlier amendments <e> <s> he must recognise this since there is no requirement for them to be devised in consultation for instance with the users who will be affected <e> <s> we have heard considerable criticism during the debate in committee up to now of the functions which the bill gives to the secretary of state <e> <s> in theory the secretary of state would be able to use his power to impose sweeping additional checks on data which enjoyed the exemption provisions and parliaments intentions in providing for exemptions would be nullified <e> <s> if the noble lord reads the bill he will find that parliament has power to nullify the order which the secretary of state would bring but he is required to bring it by the amendment regardless of that process <e> <s> so even if he is quite confident that parliament will withhold the order which he is required to lay he still has to bring it before parliament <e> <s> maybe that is going too much into the detail of the amendment and i am prepared to argue it later <e> <s> but the fact is that this is giving to the secretary of state who the noble lord has often said has too many powers under this bill a whole sweeping area of new responsibility and in this i see a certain inconsistency <e>", "<cs> when i first rose to disappoint your lordships by appearing instead of my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor whom noble lords expected and neglected to endorse his opinion that the noble lord lord mishcon would be an ideal candidate in view of the qualifications required for registrar the noble lord lord mishcon

ministers were in this house and that the term meant little <e> <s> i can agree that if it means such as i then it means very little <e> <s> on the other hand if it means such as the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor then it means a great deal <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend sits down i must make clear that there are great difficulties and what i am undertaking is to look at them <e> <s> the noble lord should not count on my being able to resolve those difficulties <e> <s> it is quite clear that neither i nor my noble friend would wish junior officials to be happily rubber-stamping illegible signatures on documents which perhaps expose people to influences which might make them very worried <e> <s> that is what i am trying to avoid <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has moved into his customary eloquence and put before your lordships the gravity of what we are dealing with and i do not seek to detract from that <e> <s> we need to recall that this is creating new safeguards which do not at present exist because of the different way in which information which is already held may be held in the light of technological advance <e> <s> the noble lord addressed himself to the very great importance of defending the national interest in the matter of security and we are at one with him as regards that <e> <s> he then tackled me and quite justifiably on my inabilty to define at my finger-tips the meaning of the term a minister of the crown and i take the point <e> <s> as it happens i took the point some minutes ago when i last addressed your lordships from this box <e>", "<cs> can the noble and learned lord tell the committee whether in fact he will be returning to speak to each of those subsequent amendments separately and to move them separately or do they all fall together with the present amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may intervene at this stage because i propose to avoid the difficulties into which i fell on the last amendment by addressing myself to the amendment on the table before us at the moment <e> <s> when the noble and learned lord comes to subsequent amendments he may feel that he can move them formally and rely on what he has already said <e> <s> i can then bring forward my arguments against them without confusing myself and everyone else as well <e>", "<cs> i rather thought the noble and learned lord had already delivered that speech and therefore that we were not to have it again <e> <s> the noble and learned lord concluded by suggesting that the exemption in clause <e>", "<cs> as i tried to explain fraud is a crime and crime is otherwise caught <e>", "<cs> with respect that would come on clause stand part <e> <s> there is no amendment on clause <e>", "<cs> if i may deal with this straightaway as the noble lord lord avebury has pointed out this paragraph of this subsection is linked to the next and that is and important consideration because in the next subsection there are two paragraphs and not one <e> <s> this clause provides exemptions from subject access that is from people inquiring after information held about them to data held for purposes among which is that stated in paragraph <e>", "<cs> if i can answer that question now whereas records kept in manual form are subject to the normal law and conventions we have been pressed by the public europe and noble lords opposite to legislate for information which is turned into data and is kept on computer records <e> <s> it is quite clear that if there is an absolute right to access to all that material which there is not when it is written then certain things will have to be revealed by the revenue which would not be revealed if they were kept manually <e> <s> certain things have to be kept confidential if there is a question of people not paying their taxes <e>", "<cs> the noble lord seems to be shooting a couple of hounds when he only wants to get rid of one <e> <s> subsection deals with subject access and subsection with non-disclosure <e> <s> all the concerns he is now voicing refer to non-disclosure <e> <s> he has returned to that theme again and again <e> <s> surely what his amendment ought to do is to destroy the link between the two subsections because otherwise what he will do will be to deny what i think on reflection he might regard as being something we cannot do without and that is the exemption from subject access in matters which are not criminal <e> <s> that would be the effect of the amendment <e> <s> it may well be that we should test the mood of the committee in any case at this stage <e>", "<cs> it is not long since we were discussing the issues of immigration across this very table <e> <s> only <e>", "<cs> it was not a question and it does not require an answer unless the noble lord believes there should be no control of immigration into this country <e> <s> i am happy to give way to hear him say that because it will make his position very clear <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the noble lord for clarifying the position <e> <s> he has certainly made clear the fact that he accepts that there should be control of immigration and that it should apply equally to people of all colours <e> <s> my mother as it happens was a norwegian immigrant and i am very happy to agree with the noble lord in this respect <e>", "<cs> i was debating within myself whether to say that i was not conscious of having used the phrase that he says he was certain i was going to use and this reference may reveal more about what the noble lord thinks about me than what i think about the amendment <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether all the anxiety that has been so eloquently expressed is entirely well founded <e> <s> the noble lord lord wigoder argues that clause is inconsistent with clauses and of the police and criminal evidence bill now being considered in another place <e> <s> we are in an interesting situation with the two bills in opposite houses <e> <s> shortly we shall have the changing of the guard as our bill marches down there and theirs marches up here and i suppose they will salute each other on the way <e> <s> the noble lord suggested that in doing so and in catching each others eye they will recognise a sort of incompatibility about each other in the area of the ninth or tenth waistcoat button <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may intervene at this point to give the noble and learned lord the assurance that he seeks <e> <s> of course i did not intend him any discourtesy <e> <s> he had already shot his bolt earlier <e> <s> i shall be looking at all the bolts that he shot at that stage as they apply to each individual amendment that is moved <e>", "<cs> the paragraph which the noble lord seeks to amend is designed to secure the exemption of data from the non-disclosure provisions where for instance the prevention of crime or the apprehension of offenders or their prosecution <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to my noble friend who has said several of the things that i intended to say much quicker than i would but not all of them <e> <s> i understand that the noble lord is seeking to require users making what we might call exempt disclosures to notify such disclosures to the registrar <e> <s> he would then be required to publish them in general terms and by that i understand is meant that no names would be revealed <e> <s> finally an entitlement to subject access to such data may be established on application to the registrar <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord spent some time construing these subsections together as i did <e> <s> i think that my answer must be simply a paraphrase of what lies within the sections <e> <s> i understand that the distillation of the meaning of the two subsections is to the extent to which they are exercisable by reference to the first data protection principle that <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to both noble lords for putting in my mind considerations which i think should be there before we reach the report stage <e> <s> i noticed the smile but not the intervention of the noble lord lord wigoder as his favourite progeny <e>", "<cs> i am sorry <e> <s> the generality was applied to the criminal fraternity <e> <s> each person is able to inquire about himself <e> <s> the noble lord is suggesting that burglar bill the rapist the arsonist and so on should be as free as anyone else presumably to inquire whether his misdeeds are accurately recorded and whether the suspicions that are held against him can be confirmed or denied <e> <s> it is a proposition which at first blush i do not find attractive <e> <s> but of course as always i will consider between now and report what he has said <e>", "<cs> i do recognise as your lordships all will that the application of data protection legislation to the health field raises difficult and delicate questions which can only be resolved through informed comment and debate <e> <s> in considering this amendment i would say one thing before addressing the particular question of how data about health should be treated <e> <s> the amendment seeks to place the secretary of state under an obligation to exempt certain data by order <e> <s> on that ground alone the amendment would be objectionable <e> <s> under clause all such orders are subject to the discretion of parliament <e> <s> it is not the secretary of state but parliament which is in control of whether the order is made or not and noble lords will accept that the bill must not force the registrar to do what elsewhere it empowers parliament to prevent him from doing <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the noble lord for bringing us back to ground which we nearly trod on during consideration of the mental health amendment bill as it then was <e> <s> certainly i am seized of the anxieties expressed and i shall see that they are part of our consultation <e>", "<cs> the term social work is not used in the bill in a technical sense <e> <s> we are as we have said in the process of consulting interested parties and representative groups in the social work field as to what particular data will need to be covered by order under clause <e> <s> at this stage i do not wish to prejudge the outcome of those consultations so i hope my noble friend will understand that i cannot give a firm assurance as to whether these particular data will be covered <e> <s> but in principle we accept that education welfare officers do sometimes perform functions which involve the carrying out of social work and that their records contain similar data to those contained in those of social workers and that to that extent their records may well for the purposes of clause need to be treated in the same way as those of social workers <e>", "<cs> we are now embarking on a series of amendments with a common theme that certain data are of a kind that have no potential for harm or misuse and that therefore they do not need to be brought within the scope of this bill <e> <s> a happy thought but one we may not be able to seize upon <e> <s> my noble friend has ably indicated the attractions of this approach <e> <s> they are first the fear that if every single data user is caught by the bill the size of the register will be quite unmanageable secondly that it is just plain unnecessary for certain users to come under the registrars supervision at all <e>", "<cs> i am sorry but i lost the beginning of what the noble lord said and i think it is crucial to the end <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to my noble friend lord teviot for the notice he gave me of the reasons for this amendment which enabled me to reply rather more intelligibly than i could otherwise have done <e> <s> i was not aware of his interest in the pursuit of genealogy on the small scale for which i apologise to him <e>", "<cs> perhaps my noble friend will forgive me if i am brief because he has so narrowed his definition that i can discard much of what i had planned to say <e> <s> the nub of it is that his amendment does not have the effect of excluding electronic mail personal data carried by electronic mail as described by my noble friend are not in the normal course of events covered by the definition of processing in clause <e> <s> my noble friend may find himself reassured by that but i shall further consider what he said in the interim period between now and report in case i have not understood him correctly <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to delay the committee but it will help me if i can take this on board <e> <s> my noble friend is talking about machines which are not simply word processors which work as addressing machines in correlation with correspondence produced on them but they also update the addresses and move them around <e> <s> i take it that he is asking whether that is processing and if it is caught by clause what about word processors <e>", "<cs> there are devices which allow one to immerse these things in water for a time compress them and use them as solid fuel but that is not within the scope of this bill <e> <s> subsection of this clause refers in particular to personal data held by unincorporated members clubs and by those who use names and addresses for the purpose of distributing articles <e> <s> the example in this area may help specialised clubs and societies who use micro-computers to record their membership lists and circulate their regular newsletter and bodies such as churches who may not be unincorporated clubs but who also may use a micro-computer for example to circulate the parish magazine some parishes are very go-ahead <e>", "<cs> first let me indicate how we see the very limited exemption in clause <e>", "<cs> i never object to people hunting unicorns and i always hope that they will eventually succeed <e> <s> since the hour is late i am almost tempted to leave it at that but i think i should go on to say that the noble lord is seeking to categorise data as harmless and to exempt them from the bill if they have three characteristics that they are not sensitive as itemised in clause that they have come from the subject himself or from published reference material and that they are not disclosed to anyone <e> <s> on the surface of it what could be more innocuous <e> <s> unfortunately however we cannot rely on the surface alone <e> <s> we have to go a little deeper and what do we then find <e>", "<cs> after that spirited intervention i will deal first if i may with my noble friend <e> <s> i hope i can explain quickly why clause needs only to refer to exempting data from the subject-access provisions even though clause refers also to modifying those provisions <e> <s> the purpose of clause is simply to allow for certain existing statutory restrictions to be preserved so that they are not overridden by this bills subject access provisions <e> <s> we shall consider in a moment the circumstances under which this may be necessary <e> <s> only total exemption <e>", "<cs> the word and is usually used to conjoin two separate pieces where both have to be taken into consideration <e> <s> i think that answers the noble lords question whether there is a semi-colon there or not <e> <s> the noble lord is looking baffled <e> <s> they do stand together <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> it might clarify things if i said that data to be covered by an order under clause which is very narrow in application contrary to what the noble lord lord mcintosh feared would have to satisfy two tests <e> <s> they will have to consist of information of which the disclosure is prohibited or restricted by some statute other than this one <e> <s> that is the first test <e> <s> and it will have to appear to the registrar that for one reason or another the confidentiality afforded by that other statute ought to take precedence over the accessibility afforded by this one <e> <s> if it does not so appear then the exemption will not take effect and all will be revealed whether it be an examination or not if it is touched by statute which i would doubt <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has set himself a famous example and me a very difficult task <e> <s> i am prepared with all sorts of answers to all sorts of points that he has not raised <e> <s> i shall be interested in the punctuation in the <e>", "<cs> i agree that there are all sorts of research <e> <s> the noble lord has required them to be bona fide historical or scientific <e> <s> i merely cast a fly as it were <e> <s> what he said is that research ought to be more accurately defined <e> <s> i think i could more readily undertake to look at that further if he would undertake just to give me a little inkling of the sort of definition he would want if it is other than what he has here <e> <s> if it is what he has here i have a number of reasons for suggesting that that is not sufficient because it excludes for instance the whole range <e> <s> there is musical topographical geological otological palaeontological and so on research of which only the latter falls into either definition <e> <s> once you start defining you start excluding and i think that the noble lord would need to take very careful thought before inserting the words after bona fide in his first substantive amendment <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the noble lord lord mishcon would be as ready as i am for religions to be researched into <e> <s> it would be a very great handicap to theologians who already suffer from an absolutely staggeringly large subject to cope with if they did not receive the benefits of this amendment <e>", "<cs> i am always delighted to go faster <e> <s> but sometimes i think that we go too fast for elderly and muddled ministers such as myself <e> <s> the bill in clause already does for the legal profession much of what my noble friend wishes it to do <e> <s> it identifies a category of data those to which legal professional privilege applies and recognises that subject access to such data would offend against the principle that lies behind that privilege by allowing third parties to gain access to data that lawyers hold about them provided by the lawyers clients <e> <s> i submit that to a very large extent that provision meets my noble friends point <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for that explanation which bears out the motives that i thought lay behind this amendment namely in making the amendment he wishes to ensure that data covered by the part iv exemptions can still be subject to the registrars general supervision <e>", "<cs> i had rather supposed that this amendment on the advisory committee had fallen at the end of the line of dominoes <e> <s> as there is no advisory committee as a result of earlier amendments having been withdrawn it does not seem to me to be appropriate to refer to it here as if it did exist <e> <s> unless the noble and learned lord wishes me to address myself again to the general principle of the advisory committee which we did when we considered all these amendments together i am not sure that i can add greatly this evening to our common wisdom <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble and learned lord will not be disappointed by what i am about to say but by a slip of the tongue my noble friend was disapplying the whole of clause in fact the reference should be to clause and that is embraced by the amendment but i should not want the record to be misleading <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord does not move his amendment may i on behalf of my colleagues both learned and otherwise respond to the kind words that have been said and respond in kind <e> <s> your lordships have for the most part been most patient pretty lucid and fairly forgiving <e> <s> moreover it has also been possible for me to resist your lordships when it has been necessary <e> <s> we are all grateful for that and for the good spirit in which your lordships have taken our success <e>", "<cs> my lords had the programme succeeded in getting my right honourable friend they would not have been rewarded with platitudes <e> <s> in fact the exact nature of what was wanted was not revealed until monday st january and that was only two days before the programme was broadcast <e> <s> regrettably secretaries of state are not available off the shelf in that way <e> <s> that was why my right honourable friend could not participate <e>", "<cs> my lords by your lordships leave i shall respond to this happily less acrimonious debate than that which the noble lord lord cledwyn referred to in another place <e> <s> the noble lord said that there was no music in politics <e> <s> i must say that it was a delight to hear him recapitulating the names of so <e>", "<cs> my lords we recognise that any proposal to take away the vote from any section of the population is a serious constitutional issue deserving the most thorough consideration <e> <s> that is why we welcome the select committees inquiry into the matter and it would be wrong for me to anticipate what they may have to say <e> <s> the irish government announced on th january that they intend to introduce legislation at the earliest opportunity to give british citizens resident there the right to vote in dail elections <e>", "<cs> my lords on the face of it it would be an extremely difficult change to bring about <e> <s> there are about irish citizens here and incidentally about of our citizens in the republic <e> <s> i do not in any way belittle the difficulties that might arise <e> <s> nor am i saying with eager anticipation what may be in the report when it comes <e> <s> i am merely saying that we should not anticipate and come to a conclusion on anything the select committee may eventually publish before we have seen it <e>", "<cs> my lords apart from the republic of ireland i am advised that several commonwealth countries including australia new zealand and at some elections canada do so <e>", "<cs> my lords we always consider what the select committee has to say with the greatest of care <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that most irish citizens in this country are well integrated and law-abiding and agreeable fellow citizens of this realm <e> <s> i do not believe that there is a period of uncertainty <e> <s> all i have said is that we have no plans to do this but i cannot tell the noble lord what the select committee will say <e> <s> if he knows better than i perhaps he could reassure us <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the draft parliamentary constituencies england order which was laid before this house on th february be approved <e> <s> the boundary commission for england submitted its third periodical report on th february and this order is intended to give effect to its final recommendations without modifications <e> <s> article of the order substitutes the constituencies described in the schedule for the present seats in england <e> <s> the draft order has already been approved in another place <e> <s> the draft order has been considered by the joint committee on statutory instruments <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with great interest and attention to the points raised during this debate <e> <s> it would be foolish in the light of it to claim that the commissions final recommendations are perfect in every way and that none of the criticisms made of them has force <e> <s> what i do say however is that it is impossible to please everyone in a task of this kind changes made to meet one set of objections would almost inevitably provoke fresh opposition from other quarters <e> <s> the noble lord lord underhill rightly and generously pointed out that the task of the commission required and was met with not only arithmetical skill but also with judgment <e> <s> i believe that the commission has done the best it can to balance the frequently conflicting need to reduce the disparities between the electorates of existing constituencies and to preserve local ties <e>", "<cs> my lords any system which is devised to cover such a disparate country as our own is bound to have disadvantages of one sort or another <e> <s> it seems to me to be honest that the present system has the fewest disadvantages <e> <s> it keeps constituency members closest to constituency electors and to constituency problems <e> <s> it produces what we all deplore in speeches but admire in practice which is a basic two-party confrontational system of government <e> <s> that is why we debate in a chamber with two sides opposite each other and the cross-benches that very few of them sit across <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord asks what about that <e> <s> perhaps there will be more nut cutlets on the table later on <e> <s> basically this house and another place demonstrate by their architecture the philosophy upon which we conduct our democracy that is there are the ins and the outs <e> <s> if one goes to almost any other chamber one finds a sort of circle shading from one to the other <e> <s> that is ideally adapted to the sort of shifting kaleidoscope of coalitions which the proportional representation system would produce <e> <s> it is not appropriate to what we have now saving the grace of the noble lord sitting on the cross-benches <e>", "<cs> my lords the government propose to introduce new civil defence regulations imposing additional duties on local authorities shortly <e> <s> these include the training and exercising of staff and volunteers and the provision of emergency control centres <e> <s> they also strengthen planning requirements <e> <s> we shall certainly do everything necessary to see that this law is observed <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that my duty is to reply to the noble lord rather than to the bma <e> <s> i can say that the government will take account of all relevant factors and all opinions given by qualified people people qualified to give opinion on the circumstances on which they are consulted and not on others <e>", "<cs> indeed my lords but we are dealing with personal data are we not <e> <s> therefore we need not concern ourselves with that <e>", "<cs> my lords i said it was not personal data it certainly is data <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount has raised an important point and it is one on which he and i have already corresponded <e> <s> but i am sure he will forgive me if for the benefit of your lordships i go over much the same ground now <e> <s> in many respects this amendment turns on whether manual records should or should not be controlled in the same way as automatically processed data <e> <s> the arguments on both sides are by now well known and i shall not dwell on them unduly <e> <s> quite simply it is the speed and ease with which computers can process and link information about individuals which poses the greatest potential threat to privacy <e>", "<cs> my lords i perfectly understand my noble friends wish to achieve the objective which we share of including within the scope of the bill only those activities which are rightly so included <e> <s> i note his particular concern and that of the noble lord lord wigoder with word processors and with other methods of storing data whether using word processors or not which may unwittingly and unnecessarily have been caught by the bills provisions <e> <s> perhaps i should begin by outlining how the government see the definitions working out <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend for his explanation of the concern which led to the tabling of the amendment <e> <s> initially it escaped me <e> <s> having listened to my noble friends explanation i am bound to say that i do not think that <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord swinfen was kind enough to give me notice of his intention to make this approach to the bill <e> <s> i am grateful to him for that and for his explanation to your lordships as to why he has done it <e> <s> i appreciate his desire to make sure that nobody is left unaware of the fact that possibly important data about him are held but i wonder whether this amendment is not in fact an unnecessary duplication of the provisions already in the bill <e> <s> the job of the register as well as providing a point of reference for the registrar will be to inform the public of the data processing activities being undertaken so that they will be able in a general way to decide whether data about them are likely to be held and can then decide to make use of their rights under clause to be informed whether data are held about them and to be supplied with a copy of the information therein <e>", "<cs> my lords i merely wished to say that i hope the noble lord took note of the result of his brevity <e>", "<cs> my lords i undertook in committee as the noble and learned lord has reminded us to reflect on the arguments that had been advanced for a <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord is coming to a conclusion and before he does so i wonder whether we are on the same wavelength as regards this matter <e> <s> i am saying <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house let me say that at committee stage i advanced a number of reasons why i did not think that the statutory road was the right one to go down even though i accept that advice will be needed <e> <s> i will not weary the house by repeating those reasons now as i think the noble lord is inviting me to do and therefore i must tell the noble lord that i cannot accommodate him and he will doubtless now move his amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend indicated in committee his intention of keeping the government up to the mark on this issue and he has now produced <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid my noble friend has not resolved the doubts i expressed in committee <e> <s> as the bill stands the registrar is able to accept particulars in general terms whenever that is appropriate <e> <s> if my noble friend looks at the earlier part of clause he will see that that is the interpretation <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the noble lords first question as to what kind of occasion there might be for requesting registration in terms more general than those required i would say that the first example that comes to mind is that of a commercial organisation wishing to avoid a very detailed description in a case where that would reveal to its competitors information about its activities which it might be damaging to divulge <e> <s> it is very difficult to speak in precise terms but i think that it is easy to conceive that where an organisation was drawing information of a particular kind from particular sources and putting it together in a particular way that might reveal to competitors in the same field something which would unfairly be to the advantage of the competitors so far as the commercial organisation was concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend addressed much of his force to explaining why he wanted to get as many users as possible off the register altogether <e> <s> that is an aim which is shared by the noble lord lord wigoder and the noble lord lord avebury made it more explicit and my noble friend lord swinfen wished to add the small businessman in some respects to that number <e> <s> this is an objective which all of us share and which all of us have great difficulty in achieving <e> <s> that is why i likened it last time to the hunting of the unicorn <e> <s> what we are looking for is that sort of data which in the hands in question is totally innocuous something quite harmless <e> <s> it is a characteristic of the unicorn that it can only be caught by that which is quite harmless <e> <s> if we come across one we shall certainly make use of it <e> <s> we shall not allow it to escape <e> <s> if there are data that can safely be exempted and satisfactorily defined and whose exemption will be of real benefit to users we shall give every consideration to that exemption <e> <s> but when my noble friend lord mottistone comes leading a beast by the halter to the loud applause of the noble lord lord wigoder the encouragement of the noble lord lord avebury and the satisfaction of my noble friend lord swinfen <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not difficult to sympathise with the intention of the noble lord in moving this amendment to give full publicity to significant conclusions by the registrar and to draw those conclusions to the attention of those most affected by the use of the data to which his conclusion relates <e> <s> i understand his wish to ensure that a data subject should know when those holding data about him had been taken to task by the registrar <e> <s> but i do not believe that it is necessary in order to achieve this aim to go further than the bill already provides and i fear that the approach advocated by this amendment could place a substantial burden upon the resources of the registrar <e> <s> clause even without the amendment to it which i shall be moving later already requires the registrar to disseminate such information and advice as he thinks expedient about the matters for which he is responsible and where he thought it necessary to give publicity to a particular conclusion or action promoted thereby in the interests of data subjects or for any other reason it would therefore be open to him so to do <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house if the noble lord is inviting me to put down an amendment to require the registrar to do certain things that i could not undertake to do <e> <s> if the noble lord is asking whether the registrar will use the powers already in the bill in a reasonable manner then obviously that i can endorse <e> <s> i cannot go into particular cases because i cannot foresee particular circumstances <e> <s> but the noble lord will have seen clause <e>", "<cs> my lords in responding to this amendment i should like to say a word of appreciation for the close attention which the noble and learned lord who moved the amendment clearly paid to the concern i expressed in committee and for the efforts he has made to satisfy my earlier objections <e> <s> in responding to the predecessor of this amendment i laid great stress on the danger of the registrar being placed at the mercy of every complainant with a grievance against data users <e> <s> the noble and learned lord has sought to meet my fears with the saving provision in this amendment in regard to complaints which the registrar considers trivial or manifestly ill-founded <e> <s> the noble and learned lord took the word trivial from my lips <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that he would not <e>", "<cs> my lords under clause the recipient of either an enforcement or a prohibition notice would have a right of appeal to the tribunal but where a prosecution followed the only question before the courts would be whether the recipient had complied with the notice or not <e> <s> in the case of an enforcement notice and many transfer prohibition notices as well this will be a simple matter of whether the specified steps have been taken <e> <s> this is designed to ensure that the reasonableness of the original notice cannot be questioned before the criminal courts and to place the recipient under a positive duty to ensure compliance with the notice <e> <s> having set up an elaborate appeals mechanism under the bill it would be wrong to cast the offences involved in a way which permitted the issues to be reopened all over again before the criminal courts <e> <s> this would render the appeals mechanism redundant <e>", "<cs> my lords i should just like to answer the noble earl lord longford <e> <s> the noble earl said that this case is anonymous at present but i do not doubt that he will reveal it to me afterwards so that i may pursue it <e> <s> the noble earl said also that this was probably a fairly ordinary case although earlier he said that instances of this sort were extremely difficult <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord quoting at length a member of the other place who is not a minister <e> <s> because i think that that would not be in order <e>", "<cs> that is perfectly in order my lords i am so sorry <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with the greatest interest and attention to the views your lordships have expressed <e> <s> of course in deciding whether this act should be renewed the home secretary of the day and parliament must seek to strike a balance <e> <s> my right honourable friend has freely acknowledged in another place that the act makes regrettable inroads into our civil

friend lord mottistone indicated that he would seek to refine the amendment that he then moved and bring it back to your lordships <e> <s> that he has done and the amendment now focuses solely on national security data rather than on all data exempted in any way under part iv as it did previously <e> <s> under the amendment the registrar is empowered no he is obliged and that is important to conduct a special investigation whenever anybody complains that data are being held about them in breach of any of the seven principles <e> <s> the registrar cannot go back to the data subject with his findings but he can go to the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords i must not be drawn too closely into the committee format which in his opening remarks this afternoon the noble lord drew to

"<cs> my lords i wish i could be as concise as the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge and thus secure even greater support for what i am about to say than i otherwise would but it is not possible <e> <s> i should start by giving some background on the nature of our immigration control and the way in which it is operated <e> <s> i hope that noble lords will find that useful <e>", "<cs>

permit me to reply to a number of the shafts which have been directed towards me <e> <s> they were so numerous that i am not sure i can recall them all <e> <s> may i start with the matter of the white paper and the convention to which the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones directed me <e> <s> the noble and learned lord asked me particularly how the exemption for immigration control can be reconciled with the derogation provisions of the european convention <e> <s> i ought to explain that in this context we are relying on the provision in article <e>", "<cs> my lords to answer the noble lord lord mishcon no we have not gone to the council of europe or to the european parliament or to any other european institution to get clearance of our domestic legislation <e> <s> it is not our practice to do so <e> <s> it is for us to decide what is right <e> <s> then it is for us to defend that decision if it is thought to be in breach of the convention <e> <s> that is the straight answer to the noble lords question <e> <s> i am glad that he brought it before me again <e> <s> may i remind all noble lords in answer specifically to the noble lord lord pitt of hampstead that this exemption does not apply to the whole of immigration information which is very considerable <e> <s> it applies only to information the release of which would be prejudicial to the control of immigration into this country <e> <s> in other words it relates to those things which assist the immigration department and immigration officers to determine who ought and who ought not to be considered for lawful admission to this country and which if it were revealed would assist in defeating that purpose <e> <s> i do not believe that this house thinks that that is such an unimportant purpose that it ought to be set aside for an alleged conjunction with reasons of our relationships between different communities in this country which is entirely fictitious <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i ought not to give way any more this is not committee stage <e> <s> i have said as much as i have to say <e> <s> it is quite clear to me that this amendment seeks to take out of the bill a provision that is not sinister and which relates only to the efficient conduct of a function that is necessary to the well-being of the whole community <e> <s> it does not extend to other parts of the same mass of information which is not so related <e> <s> your lordships are invited to take away an important provision for insubstantial and emotive reasons and i hope that my noble friends at least will support me in the division lobby against it <e>", "<cs> my lords i have done so on numerous occasions in committee <e> <s> on any occasion where that which is under investigation is not a criminal act but involves the intention to enter this country on the part of someone not entitled here then it is needed <e> <s> there are many such cases <e> <s> if the noble lord wants more precision then i will write to him but i cannot rise to my feet for a fourth time at report stage <e>", "<cs> it is not my lords <e> <s> it is not a crime under certain circumstances to attempt to enter this country it is only a crime to be here when one is in the country unlawfully <e> <s> with the <e>", "<cs> my lords the effect of this apparently modest amendment would be considerable <e>

able to satisfy the registrar that giving access would be likely to prejudice the prevention of crime or one of the other clause matters could he then avail himself of the exemption <e> <s> in practice that would mean that on each occasion a representation would have to be prepared for the registrar and on each occasion the registrar would have to be satisfied that granting access would be likely to prejudice the purpose for which the data were held <e>", "<cs> my lords with your lordships leave i will merely say that there is of course always some sense in what the noble lord says <e> <s> i regret rashly assuming that on this rare occasion he had overlooked something in the bill <e> <s> i am also grateful to him for being charitable for my much lesser legal experience than his and for giving me time to marshal my arguments if indeed there are arguments against what he says <e>", "<cs> my lords the point from which the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones departed on his foray against the bill on this occasion was its congruence with what we propose to provide in the police and criminal evidence bill at present in another place <e> <s> perhaps i can get that issue out of the way first by reminding your lordships of what i said in committee about the relationship between this clause and clause of that bill <e>", "<cs> my lords perfectly simply if it is a palpable fraud it has been continued from time immemorial <e> <s> this bill gives no authorisation to disclose no encouragement to disclose it merely removes the prohibition on disclosure contained in the bill itself <e> <s> it is absolutely without effect on anything else <e> <s> the noble lord is straining at a non-existent gnat if i may say so in that context <e>", "<cs> my lords on amendments nos <e> <s> and we considered whether immigration control was a matter which should benefit from the exemption contained in clause and your lordships agreed that it should <e> <s> on the last amendment no <e> <s> we discussed the general question of whether there should be exemptions from the non-disclosure provisions and again your lordships gave the view that there should be <e> <s> now we are moved from that general area to one that is more particular and are asked to consider whether data used for the purposes of immigration control should benefit from the non-disclosure exemption <e>", "<cs> my lords my intention was to say that there were not resident here <e> <s> i am sorry i have moved the decimal point my lords <e> <s> the approach of <e>", "<cs> my lords i am indebted to the noble lord lord wigoder for the care he has taken to <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord avebury will be aware that this amendment would have diametrically the opposite effect to one moved in committee by his noble friend lord wigoder <e> <s> that amendment sought to require the secretary of state to introduce orders providing exemption from subject access to health data <e> <s> this amendment on the other hand seeks to make all health data available to subjects by preventing the secretary of state from having such powers <e> <s> but as this is a probing amendment i think that is merely a matter of elegant tactics <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord drumalbyn is in effect offering with this amendment a slightly less restrictive version of the exemption already in clause <e>", "<cs> it is indeed my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i ought to start with the words <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords amendments would alter the circumstances in which statistical and research data qualified for the exemption from subject access which clause provides <e> <s> as drafted the exemption could be claimed provided the results of the work in question were made available in a form which did not identify any of the data subjects that is to say the results did not in themselves identify the individuals in question <e> <s> the apparently minor modification which the noble lords amendments would introduce of allowing the exemption only where the result did not enable the data subject to be identified would in fact be a substantial change as a result of which i suspect this exemption would become worthless to the majority of those engaged in work in this area <e>", "<cs> my lords my starting point in dealing with the amendment as i indicated to my noble friend lord swinfen in reply to one of the amendments which he moved earlier during the report stage is that an order-making power is not necessarily unobjectionable because there is no obligation to use it <e> <s> any such power on the face of the statute raises the expectation that it will one day be used and generates <e>", "<cs> my lords we are becoming familiar with the suggestion by the noble lord that the secretary of state should be given new powers and on this occasion it appears to be even more far-reaching than on the last <e> <s> for what is being suggested is that the secretary of state should by order be able to reverse significant areas of the bill as decided by parliament <e> <s> those who have been most critical of the exemption provisions in part iv of the bill have asserted that these are issues of fundamental importance we have spent some considerable time on them in your lordships house and i have no doubt that they will attract a lot of attention elsewhere in another place <e> <s> believing though i do that these provisions are right and necessary i would be the last to deny the need for parliament to give them the greatest possible scrutiny <e> <s> but having said that it seems to me inappropriate to suggest that those decisions should be made capable of reversal after a less thorough scrutiny than parliament has given to their original formulation <e> <s> i acknowledge that the noble lords consequential amendments to clause would subject any attempt to use this order-making power to the most rigorous of the forms of scrutiny available in the case of subordinate legislation to resolution by both houses of parliament but we do not need to go far back in <e>", "<cs> my lords if it was me who lost my money perhaps i ought to reply to the noble and learned lord <e> <s> the user is we envisage under clause the department <e> <s> the responsibility and answerability of the minister shelters civil servants from criticism for all the reasons that the noble and learned lord gave but he can direct the whiplash of his tongue as he is accustomed to to the home secretary or to the other secretaries of state in other departments <e> <s> as to differences of opinion between permanent secretaries and secretaries of state to some extent they probably revolve around personalities <e> <s> but the noble and learned lord will know from his own experience of government what the responsibilities are and they are not changed by this bill as i see it at all <e>", "<cs> my lords we are aware of the difficulties which the noble lord has mentioned and we sympathise with them <e> <s> the guidance notes for completion of application forms recommend to applicants that if they are likely to need their passports or other documents within six months then they should explain why and should not enclose the documents concerned with the application <e> <s> the documents will then be requested when the application reaches its turn for consideration <e> <s> however our nationality division are always ready to comply with requests for the return of documents in individual cases and will in the majority of instances not require to see that document again <e>", "<cs> my lords they might meet the case for verification but if every document received had to be photostated and there are many pages in some of these documents the waiting time would be increased and not reduced <e>", "<cs> my lords i can confirm that we are anxious as i have already said to reduce the waiting time <e> <s> it may help to illuminate the difficulties under which we labour if i say that in january and february there were and applications respectively and in the same months this year the numbers were and respectively <e>", "<cs> my lords i felicitate the noble lord on joining us in his nationality by a procedure which is that which i have already described <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only assure the noble lord that we wish to accelerate the process in the way that he describes <e> <s> he was kind enough to tell me the line on which he was thinking and i have already inquired about this matter <e> <s> i am informed that it will take longer to deal with it in this way and it will not be quicker <e> <s> if the noble lord cannot accept that i ask him to take a passport up to the copying machine on the first floor of this building and see how long it takes to put through and then multiply that by approximately <e>", "<cs> my lords in this case there will be other people there <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> the purpose of this bill is to enable the united kingdom to ratify without reservation the convention on the physical protection of nuclear material <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to start by thanking the noble lord lord boston of faversham for his generous recognition of the basis on which we have approached this matter and to thank the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran <e> <s> it is nice to see him with us supporting this bill <e> <s> if i may be brief i would respond to lord bostons first point by saying that although this bill will put us in a position to ratify the convention we shall be able to do so only when our partners in euratom are also ready <e> <s> therefore we have been consulting with them in an effort to ensure that the process of ratification is as rapid as possible <e> <s> the iaea itself will monitor progress by member states and we hope that our example will encourage other countries to take action <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his intervention <e> <s> it is our intention to see that this bill is well known <e>", "<cs> my lords i was thinking of coming back to them <e> <s> perhaps when the noble earl hears my return he will decide whether in fact it will satisfy what he has in mind <e> <s> i was going to leave a good deal else because the evening draws on <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for regarding the question as rhetorical <e> <s> we debated at length the power of the registrar to have access to information and to go and look for it actually to inquire and get evidence <e> <s> that is the sort of power i have in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret to tell the noble lord that the power is implicit and not explicit which is why i cannot give him a line reference <e>", "<cs> my lords since the noble lord has tempted me may i a third time intervene to say that if he will look at clause what i have in mind are the powers of entry for instance <e> <s> it is implicit in that the powers of entry would not exist if the registrar were not expected to inquire but it is explicit in that the powers of entry are given under the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that it is of course essential that the registrar should be able to obtain sufficient information about data users and computer bureaux to enable him to perform his functions under the bill <e> <s> on that the noble lords opposite and i are at one <e> <s> indeed in drawing up the bill we considered the very point addressed by this amendment should the registrar be given an explicit power to require users to provide him with information for which he has asked or should he not <e> <s> after careful deliberation we concluded that there should be no such power and that we should instead ensure that the bill was so constructed as to allow the registrar to operate effectively without it <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be that the illustration of the dog which need not be as savage as lord aveburys doberman pinscher was not a good one <e> <s> if the noble lord has cause to send out bills of account to people who owe him money he does not send out a notice saying that he will take them to court if they do not pay <e> <s> everybody knows that that will happen if they do not pay a bill <e> <s> therefore the existence of a power to use in the event of a failure to meet an obligation does not seem to me in any way unreasonable when one is saying why the obligation should be met <e>", "<cs> my lords if the house will permit it is the purpose of this provision to protect this relationship <e> <s> in the noble and learned lords example if things were being learnt about patients who were all patients of one doctor which were supposed to be confidential then the registrar would say that there was a breach of a principle and he wanted to be told how it had happened <e> <s> his duty is to protect the data subject and not to threaten him <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord mishcon for reminding us of this complex point <e> <s> when my noble friend lord glenarthur spoke to a similar amendment on report he repeated that the government acknowledged the existence of an important point of principle and he explained why for the moment we were doubtful about going so far as proposed in the amendment <e> <s> our reservation stemmed from a recognition that most instances in which the registrar might seek access to a solicitors premises and i cannot believe that they will be at all frequent would be in investigating suspicions of breaches of the legislation or contraventions of the data protection principles by the solicitor himself as data user <e> <s> he might for example have grounds for suspecting that the solicitor was disclosing data other than as indicated in his registered particulars or that inadequate security measures were being taken to protect the possibly very sensitive data which he held <e> <s> in those circumstances it would clearly be in the interests of the clients of the solicitor concerned that the registrar should make his investigation <e> <s> the blanket application of a doctrine of legal professional privilege as proposed in this amendment would actually reduce the protection available to those who place information about themselves in the hands of their legal advisers <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by thanking noble lords who with such assiduity have given their intellects and time in seeking to amend this bill at all points and particularly as the noble lord lord mishcon invites me to do so at this point <e> <s> i regret that my letter to him did not extend to cover this point also <e> <s> on looking at this pair of amendments we discover that they have a substantive effect and one that to our minds is not desirable <e> <s> what would happen would be that a person seeking information for national security purposes in order to allow the holder of the information to qualify for the exemption would have to show that the disclosure was necessary for the purpose of safeguarding national security <e> <s> that would require a degree of prescience that would be beyond even those who discharge national security duties <e>", "<cs> my lords if it really appears that everything is so obvious to me i am a great deal cleverer than i thought i was <e> <s> i have found this a very difficult bill to master and i had hoped that by tackling those difficulties in public i had helped your lordships a little towards understanding it <e> <s> i must rehearse again for the benefit of your lordships arguments that i have already put to the noble lord lord mishcon in correspondence <e> <s> for it is again a matter on which after consideration of what he said at the last stage i can find no defect in the bill <e> <s> i will turn to my noble friend in a moment <e> <s> i shall first address the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> the noble lord has suggested that if the test for exemption in clause is left at large simply that one of the matters listed in that subsection is likely to be prejudiced by giving subject access then neither the registrar nor the courts will be able effectively to challenge a claim of a data user that prejudice was likely to occur <e> <s> if that really were the effect of clause as drafted we would seriously consider amending it <e> <s> but it is not <e> <s> it could only be as the noble lord suggests if the provision were cast in terms of the data user being satisfied that prejudice was likely to occur or it appearing to the data user that prejudice was likely to occur <e> <s> but no such words are found in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i presume that that embraces the matter of security <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has dropped the matter of security <e>", "<cs> my lords i have therefore to give the same answer to my noble friend as i gave to the noble lord lord mishcon that the courts are the guardians of the liberties of this country and if there is a misuse of powers it is to the courts that the person against whom they are misused must look for protection <e> <s> i hope my noble friend can accept that <e> <s> it is a matter which we have looked at at some length and i am satisfied that that is the right answer <e>", "<cs> my lords by your lordships leave if i may speak again the noble lord lord mishcon has <e>", "<cs> my lords if the house is happy for me to accept that invitation i will read out subsection of clause <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord keeps asking me to speak after i have finished speaking <e> <s> i think this is my fourth intervention and it must be my last <e> <s> the provision in clause is that there shall be an exemption when there is likelihood of prejudice not in anyones mind but an absolute likelihood at large for the court to decide <e> <s> if the noble lord goes to clause there is nothing there which says that it should be the department which must be satisfied <e> <s> the noble lord wanted to ascribe it to the registrar he must be satisfied <e> <s> he now says that the bill somehow says that it is the department which must be satisfied <e> <s> it does not <e> <s> it is not in the bill <e> <s> the noble lord cannot get me to read it out because it is not there <e> <s> it is prejudicial to his case <e> <s> i cannot speak again <e> <s> if i cannot make myself clear at this stage i never shall so i hope the noble lord will get on with it and divide the house so that we can see who is right <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord avebury returns here to a proposal that has been considered in one form or another both in committee and on report <e> <s> it is a proposal for a mechanism whereby exempt disclosures under clause will have to be notified to the registrar <e> <s> both in committee and on report i drew attention to how difficult a question this was and how important it will be to ensure that if the bill were to retain any such provision its detail should be exactly right <e> <s> i can best illustrate this difficulty by making brief reference to each of the amendments moved by the noble lord lord avebury and his noble friends at earlier stages <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships will recall the exchanges we had to which the noble lord has referred <e> <s> during that last stage we as a government accepted that the original casting of clause had the strange effect of allowing exempt data to be disclosed once the subjects consent had been given to their being held <e> <s> the person receiving the data could then continue to claim for exemption even though the subject knew nothing about his holding the data <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a great deal of sympathy with my noble friend lord mottistone because i also thought that it was a unicorn we were being lured away in pursuit of on report <e> <s> looking more closely at what my noble friend then said and <e>", "<cs> my lords if your lordships will allow me i can just say that the word articles in this context is used in the sense of a thing not a written piece in a newspaper but almost anything the noble lord chooses to name including all the very respectable and tempting things that the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge was referring to in the mail order business <e> <s> it is an unrestricted phrase <e>", "<cs> my lords i can see no reason why it should not include anything from holy writ to brochures <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble and learned lord lord gardiner moved an identical amendment on report he said that his aim was to obtain information and he has made clear that that again is his intention and that last time i rather failed to satisfy his wishes <e> <s> i shall try and do better this time <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know what the noble lord means by already <e> <s> if he is talking about the statute which we are about to pass i think that i can give that undertaking <e> <s> the intention of the bill is not to create secrecy it is to protect the data subject in a way consistent with the efficiency and liberties of the data user <e> <s> the distinction between departments was very clearly put into the bill in order to expose the traffic of any information not specifically exempted between departments <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged to the noble and learned lord for his summary of what occurred when discussing the two-year period during which powers should be compulsorily dormant <e> <s> after certain things said by my noble friend certain of his noble friends retired to bed doubtless also to be compulsorily dormant until the following morning <e>", "<cs> my lords he would have elastic ability and i suppose he might just rubber-stamp two years on each and meet it that way <e> <s> it is necessary for parliament to visualise the way in which legislation is implemented and not to place upon an individual the necessity of deciding when its wishes shall become effective <e>", "<cs> my lords if the house permits may i say to my noble friend that of course it is an interesting thesis he has advanced but it is necessary for users to have some fixed point in time at which they have to be ready <e> <s> the government cannot really go on surveying the scene until they see that everybody is up to the starting tape and then say right now the thing is going to work <e> <s> i have the point on board <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord sits down i must put that right on the record <e> <s> as i say it is what everybody else is doing <e> <s> it is not a breach of the convention <e> <s> it is perfectly in order with our international undertakings <e> <s> i cannot see that data users would be happy at the prospect of possible but not certain deregistration because of non-compliance with the principles when the user had not had time to get things right <e> <s> there must be a fixed point in time for which large users of data can get themselves ready <e>", "<cs> my lords we have already discussed these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords this is indeed a difficult bill and i commend my noble friend lord massereene and ferrard for his evening reading the second reading speech that i made and the speeches which other noble lords made <e> <s> he will find in fact that what we are guarding against is the arrival of george orwells world of <e> <s> but as i say this is a difficult bill <e> <s> it deals with a subject that is new complicated and on occasions abstruse <e> <s> it brings with it a new language of subject access and computer bureaux of data subjects and data users and there are few of us who on occasions have not got them muddled <e> <s> it requires us to bear in mind constantly the needs of a technology with which many of us are far from familiar and to guard against imposing in all innocence burdens that could cripple an industry of increasingly crucial importance to this country <e> <s> it is also a very wide ranging bill with implications for everything from medicine to national security from tax collection to genealogy from home computing to statistics and research <e>", "<cs> my lords until the ordinances are passed in the respective places it is difficult to be specific <e> <s> i cannot therefore make a categorical statement at this stage but we do not expect many people if any who were formerly citizens of the united kingdom and colonies to have their status <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give undertakings of the nature which the noble lord lord avebury has asked me to give but i can take his concern to my right honourable friend <e> <s> if it is appropriate for him to do so he will write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord lord avebury has had an undertaking it is not necessary to give another <e> <s> if he has not it would not be appropriate for me to give one <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to assist my noble friend in giving publicity to the commission the first annual report of which shows that of the complaints it received during the period st june to st march fell within its jurisdiction <e> <s> of those six were still before the commission at the end of the period <e>", "<cs> my lords i imagine that if the mistake had been less flattering to the noble lord he would have proceeded to submit his complaint in writing <e>", "<cs> my lords the complaints in question relate to individual cases and if my noble friend has a complaint as to the frequency or manner in which publicity has or has not been given to his own pronouncements it would be proper for him to approach the commission <e> <s> otherwise i cannot help him <e>", "<cs> my lords the remit of the commission relates to individual complaints <e> <s> i should have thought that this year we might have an increase of the volume of one-twelfth in response to the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge and my noble friend lord ferrier <e> <s> but if the remit is to be expanded to deal with

that is perhaps for later reflection <e>", "<cs> my lords i have given way three times already <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness will appreciate the relevance of what i am to say a little later on that point <e> <s> what i am doing now is establishing what i would have thought are the eminently reasonable grounds on which our immigrations are by general accord based <e> <s> a person who comes here for asylum as a refugee must have reasons other than economic reasons that are valid <e>", "<cs> i have given way enough my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords it has been suggested that there were political motives in this case <e> <s> i have looked at the papers we have received <e> <s> i have noted that at his interviews mr papusoiu was given ample opportunity to alter or elaborate his claim to asylum and i have to say that at no time was anything written or said that gave him any sufficient claim to refugee status <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that i overlooked the last paragraph of the noble lords article in todays issue of <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i was going to say which was sufficient notice of the question which he raised in his speech <e> <s> my honourable friend will inquire into the matter of mr papusoius belongings and their return <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall indeed try to answer <e> <s> the noble lord referred first i think to energy resources <e> <s> i would remind him that as he well knows from his past experience the united kingdom produces more coal than it uses and that the replenishment of coal is unlikely to be a problem <e> <s> that should enable the supply of electricity to be maintained <e> <s> our gas supplies are entirely based on north sea production <e> <s> denial of these supplies by enemy action would cause us to lose all gas and throw a heavy load on alternative supplies of energy including of course electricity <e>", "<cs> my lords the importance of the human element in war has never escaped this country and has usually accounted for its victory <e> <s> i give due importance to that and also to what was stated by lord shinwell for whom i have had a steady regard from the day he inspected me as a cadet in when he was already i thought very senior and likely to retire <e> <s> the noble lord lord bishopston appeared to ask us to deploy million unemployed in war effort before the next general election <e> <s> we intend to abide by democratic rules <e> <s> it is unlikely that the general election will be delayed beyond the outbreak of the next war <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has played a prominent part in the winning of victories by this country standing shoulder to shoulder with others in two world wars <e> <s> i do not need to remind him of that <e> <s> i shall of course convey his conern to my right honourable friend the secretary of state for defence <e> <s> as to the all-party group it is not i think a function of a minister in this house or indeed of a member of any front bench to dictate what that august body shall do with its time <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the duty of the secretary of state for defence to supply our forces in time of war <e> <s> i have no doubt that he will do so <e> <s> as to the duration of the campaign and its nature the noble lords opinion is as good as that of many others <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i can follow either the musical or the syntactical idiosyncracies of what the noble lord seeks to remind me of but i am glad that he is reassured by the answer i gave him <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> but they are similar to those in the constitutions of many other countries including some in the commonwealth <e>", "<cs> my lords under the provisions of the british nationality act a person who has renounced british citizenship is entitled to re-acquire that citizenship by registration if he is aged or more and is of sound mind and provided that the renunciation was necessary to enable him to retain or acquire some other citizenship or nationality <e> <s> this provision may be taken advantage of only once <e> <s> i suspect that i have perhaps taken the noble lords question further than he intended <e> <s> if he is concerned only with the re-acquisition of a passport as opposed to nationality i can say that while it is true that in certain exceptional circumstances for example where a british national has voluntarily surrendered his passport as a condition of bail it may be appropriate to withhold replacement of a passport held by the authorities of another country i can nevertheless assure him that as a general rule any british passport impounded by those authorities would be replaced on application by a british consular official subject to the applicants satisfactorily establishing his identity and his claim to citizenship <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord harris has drawn your lordships attention tonight to a matter which he rightly describes as being a pressing concern <e> <s> he prefaced his question most appositely by tributes to the recently promoted director-general of the prison service mr dennis trevalyan and i was glad to hear noble lords precede my own endorsement of what he said with theirs <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has put me on to what may or may not be a cold scent my lords but i will follow it up <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the noble lord <e> <s> it is our intention to keep this use to the short term for obvious reasons <e> <s> i can assure the noble lord lord avebury that the police will continue to identify those with medical problems swiftly and give

in police custody overnight one can never guard against transport <e>", "<cs> my lords we are looking at the whole range of questions and the question of how we deploy the staff most effectively is

does not suggest that it is great <e> <s> i may have misinterpreted what the noble lord said <e> <s> i may have taken the wrong reference <e> <s> i shall certainly do whatever is proper under the circumstances <e>", "<cs> your lordships will recall the legislative steps we have taken to enable the courts to reduce the pressure on the prisons <e> <s> the house will recall the range of administrative and other steps we have taken to ease the impact of the pressure on police cells in london and the south east and your lordships will i trust also remember the succesive programme of refurbishment and building that provides a backdrop to this whole issue <e> <s> above all noble lords will realise that this issue is just one aspect of the vastly intractable problem posed by the decaying and largely archaic set of prison buildings that all of us have inherited <e> <s> the steps we have taken to resolve it and which i have described are similarly just one aspect of the massive programme of building and refurbishment with which we are tackling it <e>", "<cs> on the first of those two points my lords i should very much regret making a statement about the probable date of a decision on the reduced threshold of the qualifying period for parole and then have to make another statement apologising for misleading the noble lord so i am not going to do it <e> <s> as for the question whether i have in fact made an <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly accept the first part of the noble lords proposition <e> <s> as to the second there are various voluntary agencies involved in seeking alternative accommodation <e> <s> perhaps i should remind the noble lord of the undertaking given by my honourable friend in another place on the st march at col when he said <e>", "<cs> my lords on the first question the noble baroness asked me i am not certain of the administrative detail <e> <s> i shall have to write to her <e> <s> she is suggesting a change and naturally i could not undertake that on my honourable friends behalf <e> <s> on the second question what my honourable friend has <e>", "<cs> my lords i can neither endorse nor contradict statements made in the press but the statements are fairly current and your lordships will know by whom they are made <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords first question repeats that asked by the noble baroness lady birk immediately before him as i understood it <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may respond to the question as i believe it to be the noble lord will correct me if i am wrong <e> <s> he would like information to be passed to the ukias immediately after interview which is what the noble baroness asked me <e> <s> i have replied that all i can undertake is that that information will be given as soon as a refusal is proposed <e> <s> i am not saying it should be when a final decision is taken which is what happened in this case but when it is proposed which is very much earlier <e>", "<cs> my lords this is what my right honourable friend did in this case <e> <s> i think it was the right thing to do <e>", "<cs> my lords i have taken very great care not to make use of allegations as though they were fact and your lordships will notice that i did not even advance what my noble friend lord nugent of guildford put forward which was commonly current in the press <e> <s> i have merely stated the facts as they have come to hand <e> <s> more have come to hand since this person left this country which further place his credibility into question <e>", "<cs> my lords i never find it necessary to pretend to be obtuse it always comes naturally to me <e> <s> in this case the noble lord is correct in that the right exists after he has been removed from the country <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a right of appeal to the adjudicator but after the person has left the country <e>", "<cs> my lords any activities of foreign intelligence agencies are kept under close scrutiny <e> <s> if there were evidence of illegal or improper activity by any agency the appropriate authorities would not hesitate to take action <e>", "<cs> my lords i have considerable sympathy with the question my noble friend has asked me <e> <s> your lordships will be aware that where one has very large numbers of people spread over a large area the police force responsible for seeing that traffic flows and life continues normally need to be able to see what is going on all at one time <e> <s> it is essential to use modern technological devices to enable the senior officer to see what is going on <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not certain that the noble lords question does not go beyond the one on the order paper in some respects but photographs need to be taken for operational reasons and these are used for the proper purposes <e> <s> i am not certain that i have satisfied the noble lord but i am not sure that i have understood his question <e>", "<cs> my lords i would be surprised if they were <e> <s> i cannot see the purpose for which they would be <e> <s> the noble lord who asked the original question was referring to greenham common which of course is not the concern of the metropolitan police but if there is anything to be concerned about i will let the noble lord know <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that we are talking about peaceable demonstrations which are not illegal and that of course cannot be of interest to interpol <e>", "<cs> my lords i said that some peaceful demonstrations were photographed or filmed and that such films were used for operational reasons <e> <s> if the noble lord does not follow me if one has a human chain miles long and one senior police officer responsible for good order in the area it is necessary to know where he should place his policemen to secure good order <e> <s> that means he needs a film of what is going on <e> <s> it is also very useful with demonstrations of this sort or of a less peaceable sort to have a record for training purposes to see how it is possible to control the movements of large bodies of people in a peaceful manner <e>", "<cs> my lords i have said already that anything that is improper is the subject of control by this government <e> <s> but the noble lord is moving to questions of security in a rather detailed manner <e> <s> it is the long-standing practice not to comment upon security and intelligence matters <e> <s> if we replied to a <e>", "<cs> indeed they are not <e>", "<cs> my lords in that case i have several further answers to give but i will not give them <e>", "<cs> my lords i collected the statement but not the supplementary question <e> <s> i have noted the statement implicit in the question <e>", "<cs> my lords as to my noble friends second supplementary point the -day rule in scotland does not apply to delays which arise other than from delays by the prosecution <e> <s> i understand that his concern is for delays arising at the instigation of the defence <e> <s> if courts are not aware that a juvenile is held in residential care in a secure unit they cannot accord special priority to his case as they would otherwise do <e> <s> it follows that the legal representatives of such juveniles should inform the courts of the circumstances in which they are held and the department of health and social security is therefore asking social services departments to remind legal representatives of juveniles held on remand of the desirability of so doing <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the secretary of state for health is aware of your lordships and others anxiety about this matter <e> <s> he is bringing it to the attention of the directors of social services who of course would be the proper people in the case mentioned by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> no my lords not without notice <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only surmise but in the cases to which my attention has been directed following my noble friends question it appears that delays have arisen due either to the desire of the defence to prepare a complicated case or simply to a lack of awareness on the part of the court that the child was held in that situation which meant it could not embark on a structured rgime towards rehabilitation and we are taking such steps as we can to see that the courts are so informed <e>", "<cs> my lords the government intend to introduce legislation to amend and update the cruelty to animals act as soon as parliamentary time permits <e> <s> detailed proposals will be published shortly <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for the welcome that he gave to my answer <e> <s> i have seen the paper to which he refers which is jointly produced by the british veterinary association and the committee for the reform of animal experimentation and the fund for the replacement of animals in medical experiments <e> <s> the home secretary was most grateful to the group for sending him their proposals <e> <s> i understand that the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby took a large part in that <e> <s> they were published last week and are being carefully studied <e>", "<cs> my lords as to the use of such substitutes as tissue cultures these are being increasingly used but it is i regret necessary in many cases finally to test the effect of substances upon living animals <e> <s> as to the tests on cosmetics and toiletries they amounted to about half of per cent <e> <s> of all the tests made in <e> <s> we hope that they are kept to a minimum but they are still sometimes necessary and i believe that there is a wide understanding of this <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is absolutely right <e> <s> i am sure that my other noble friend intended no discourtesy to those who do have these very serious needs <e>", "<cs> my lords we hope that the convention will be ready for submission to the committee of ministers by next month <e> <s> ratification by the united kingdom will be possible only when we have a new act on the statute book but we are very close to the starting gate now <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that it was given in rather more precise terms and i hope that the noble earl will afford me an even greater degree of credibility than he has given to my noble friends <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will be aware that the theft act already provides severe penalties for the handling of stolen animals and the dogs act prohibits the police from handing over strays to laboratories <e> <s> nevertheless the noble lord may take further assurance from the fact that controls over the supply of animals for laboratories will be introduced in our legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords i have always thought that the inhabitants of the thames valley in which i was born are particularly prone to good sense in judging such matters <e> <s> as to the requirement to pay for this sort of demonstration we are considering the suggestion that those who demonstrate should contribute <e> <s> in our review of the public order act and related legislation we sympathise with the feelings that often lie behind the suggestion but the practical difficulties seem formidable <e> <s> my right honourable friend the home secretary hopes to announce the conclusions of the review in the not too distant future <e>", "<cs> my lords the first part of the noble lords supplementary i endorse <e> <s> it was a lawful demonstration apart from a few sporadic occasions and i should like to put on record my admiration for the way in which in the face of some considerable stress the police force controlled it peaceably <e> <s> as to the question about what it costs to open parliament i am not at all certain whether in some indirect ways the noble lord may not already contribute if only at lunchtime <e>", "<cs> my lords that is perfectly true even when one does not always agree with what is being demonstrated for <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is entitled to ask any question which he wishes particularly of a sensible nature which he has just done <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not certain what it is the noble viscount is asking me to look over the shoulder of these people to see <e> <s> if it is staging demonstrations where miles of people hold hands i am not certain that we have a great deal to learn <e> <s> if it is a question of getting the people holding hands to pay for that then obviously we should be interested to see what other peoples experiences were <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot anticipate the results of the reflections of my right honourable friend on this matter <e> <s> i will certainly place my noble friends views on this matter before my right honourable friend <e> <s> it covers a very wide field and i would remind your lordships that both the popes visit and the london marathon could be regarded as national occasions too <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the administrative difficulties to which in part i referred would look after that issue <e> <s> there is another principle of course which is the principle of the independence of individual police forces <e>", "<cs> my lords a new television channel has been launched financed entirely on a current account basis <e> <s> it is only to be expected indeed it always was expected that the profits of itv companies would diminish sharply in the introductory years <e> <s> the receipts from levy and corporation tax must also therefore go down until the new channel generates sufficient advertising revenue to be self-supporting <e> <s> this we expect it to do <e>", "<cs> my lords the fourth channel did not come on the air i think i am right in saying until some time in november of last year <e> <s> it is impossible to predict the results of the profit and loss account so early in the financial year <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not certain in what terms the noble lord is asking his question but i think the right answer is cultural diversity and the provision of material which minority groups would not otherwise have the opportunity to see <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will be able to deduce that from the text of my first and substantive answer <e>", "<cs> my lords if they know their business as well as i think they do they will be aware of it in approximately seconds <e>", "<cs> my lords we understand from the chief constable of the thames valley police that a running total of the costs of policing demonstrations at or associated with greenham common where demonstrators first arrived in october has been kept since st january this year and is current to th april <e> <s> the total manpower costs of policing such demonstrations between st january and before the easter demonstrations is estimated at approximately and the same total costs of policing the easter demonstrations some of which took place at burghfield and aldermaston as well as greenham common are estimated at approximately <e> <s> of that figure of some was attributable to additional costs <e> <s> police expenditure is shared between local and central government and attracts per cent <e> <s> specific grant from central government <e>", "<cs> my lords i suppose the proper comment is that those who pursue aims of public policy by means of demonstration should seek to do so in ways which are less than offensive to those whom they seek to persuade <e>", "<cs> my lords it is scarcely the function of a minister of government to advise persons opposed to their policy how best to pursue that aim but i can see a certain logic in what the noble lord proposes <e>", "<cs> my lords the presence of the police on any such occasion is entirely impartial <e> <s> their duty is to protect the peace and this they have done with considerable success <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware that any such offer has been made <e> <s> i do not doubt that if it was made those to whom it was made would consider very carefully whether it was to their benefit to accept it <e>", "<cs> my lords i have always had the highest regard for the effectiveness of women when acting on their own or in concert <e> <s> on the question of using up the time of this house however the women have not acted alone but have had the notable support of the noble lord himself <e>", "<cs> my lords i answered the question in the terms in which i thought it was directed at me that is in terms of the police costs <e> <s> there were of course incidental costs borne by the local authority <e> <s> one of these has been the collection of litter <e> <s> they do not have an obligation i think they maintain to collect refuse which the people of the camp disposed of elsewhere in a manner which my noble friends original question leads me to suspect was not entirely effective <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to my noble friend for that information <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said earlier anybody who seeks to secure public support should do so in a manner that does not offend the public to whom their request is made <e>", "<cs> my lords we are of course aware of reports that these disgraceful statements were made on that occasion <e> <s> it is however for the police and not the government to consider whether any criminal offence may have been committed and if so what action to take <e>", "<cs> my lords while i have considerable sympathy with the noble lord i should say first of all that the question of a reference to the director of public prosecutions would be for the police who would have to be aware of the circumstances to a greater degree than i am <e> <s> secondly as the noble lord rightly says the right of free speech is very precious <e> <s> i understand that this utterance was made on an occasion in a debate on something that was called capitalist imperialism and terrorist violence and the remarks i gather received little support if any on that occasion <e> <s> that perhaps suggests that we should not dignify this event with a great deal of opprobrium when it was in fact an extraordinarily foolish unpleasant distasteful and disloyal thing to do but no more than that <e>", "<cs> my lords i think terrorist methods are abhorred inside and outside this house by all right thinking people <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i will now repeat a statement being made in another place by my right honourable friend the home secretary <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both the noble lord lord ponsonby and the noble lord lord winstanley for their reception of the statement <e> <s> both noble lords are anxious that there should be a debate <e> <s> i understand that it is likely to be on rd may <e> <s> the noble lord lord ponsonby suggested that the principal motivation of the white paper is to generate private profit <e> <s> to that suggestion i can only say that private profit will only be generated by public interest and support <e> <s> the public only pays for what it wants and if there is private profit that will be a vindication of the policy which we are pursuing <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said i do not want to get drawn too much into the detail of this statement when a debate is to follow <e> <s> the appointments will be made by the home secretary <e> <s> as to the question of obscene publications i would rather not commit myself to a statement which on consulting the lawyers i might regret <e> <s> but the noble lord was sufficiently industrious in his pursuit of me on the last occasion to make me sure that he will not allow me to get away with such an answer when it comes to the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the right reverend prelate for his reception of this statement <e> <s> we will look forward to useful and constructive contributions from the bench of bishops during the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords the device of having interim arrangements in advance of legislation was recommended in the hunt report <e> <s> as the noble lord suggests the house will have an opportunity to debate the matter before the interim arrangements are brought into effect <e> <s> this will provide an opportunity for what the noble lord refers to as ordinary people to bring matters to our attention <e> <s> my own view is that both houses of parliament are full of ordinary people <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the support of the noble lord lord annan for the idea of having experiments in advance <e> <s> on the question of the <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a subject to which doubtless my noble friend will return in the course of the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed that would be looking into the crystal ball <e> <s> i cannot tell your lordships the extent to which or the rate at which what is experimental will become successful <e> <s> what i can tell your lordships is that the government believe that this is an important area not only for entertainment which we believe is the necessary infrastructure to provide the paths through which information can pass but also for a later generation of technological developments such as that to which the noble lord lord winstanley was alluding when he spoke about interactive services which to use an americanism in what we hope will be predominantly a british enterprise is a whole new ball game <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is right <e> <s> we have to get these things in the right order <e> <s> accession to

discontinuity to which my noble friend refers between our law and that of other countries <e> <s> to bring the whole into harmony would take a very long time indeed <e>", "<cs> yes my lords including thoroughness and patience <e>", "<cs> my lords the subject of home office file k was interviewed on th june in connection with his application for asylum in the united kingdom <e> <s> all relevant factors are taken into account when considering a claim for asylum and although all applications are considered case by case in the light of their individual circumstances there are occasions when a group of applications must be considered together <e> <s> several pakistanis of the same persuasion as the subject of the noble lords question have applied for asylum here and i hope that we will be in a position to resolve these applications in the very near future <e>", "<cs> my lords the interview which is what the noble lord asked me about was on th june according to the advice i am given <e> <s> as to the disadvantages of being the subject of an unresolved claim to asylum i should point out that the individual in question is at liberty and is not held in custody in case any of your lordships should be under a misapprehension about that <e> <s> the considerations which my honourable friend has in mind when resolving these issues extend to a list longer than that of the subordinate clauses with which the noble lord furnished his third supplementary question <e> <s> in this case the circumstances of his release from imprisonment in pakistan which resulted from the hijacking of a civil aircraft in the course of which one <e>", "<cs> my lords the principal consideration which subsumes all others is that of article of the united nations convention of relating to

right that i think three members of this group have in fact received clearance <e> <s> he is wrong in the assumption that every case is equally simple to resolve <e> <s> i can however tell him that we hope to resolve the remaining cases very soon <e>", "<cs> my lords under the broadcasting arrangements which have been endorsed by successive governments the british broadcasting corporation is entirely responsible for deciding what programmes to broadcast subject to the law and to its obligations on programme standards <e> <s> the government do not answer for the corporations programme decisions nor would it be appropriate for us to intervene with it in respect of particular decisions such as its decision not to transmit the programme about the arts council to which the question relates <e> <s> in other words my lords no <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord began his supplementary question by hoping that the arts council would consider the exchanges in the chamber this afternoon and he concluded by hoping that the british broadcasting corporation would so do <e> <s> i am sure that <e>", "<cs> my lords balance is one of the standards which we expect to be kept <e>

introduce the discussion of another bill <e> <s> if i can do so i shall return to the subject <e> <s> in the meantime i spare the noble lord the pain of interrupting me further <e>", "<cs> my lords the other bill to which the noble lord refers does not have an element of compulsion and we are in favour of the voluntary principle <e> <s> the noble lord will not expect me to announce the governments proposed second reading speech on the other bill before it reaches this house which is what i thought he wished me to do <e> <s> but if the noble lord asks me whether we are consistent in being opposed to compulsion the answer is yes <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i have said very nearly as much as i can on this subject <e> <s> i have told your lordships of a principle which we find objectionable in this bill your lordships have asked whether it is in the other bill and i have said no <e> <s> but i think my noble friend should consult through the usual channels if he wants to take the matter further because i cannot take it further <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure how long the conventions of this house allow us to play ping pong across the table at second reading <e> <s> on the question of compulsion not being exercisable upon a testator who had departed these realms to another place the wishes of the testator nevertheless survive him in the hands of the trustees <e>

<s> as the noble lord wants me to pick up particular issues on the issue of renal services in there were more than kidney transplants in the united kingdom which was a record <e> <s> there is certainly still a waiting list of over but the noble lord should realise that the problem is not lack of money but lack of donor organs <e>", "<cs> my lords inevitably i must conclude <e> <s> i hope i

church he might believe that it was even more effective if they were to pray about it <e>", "<cs> my lords there is only one place higher than this i do not know when the noble lord intends to go there <e>", "<cs> my lords i can really only return to my earlier answer that i do not think this is a matter of such great importance philosophic importance yes but in practical importance not sufficient to engage the time of both houses of parliament in research and legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords i was hoping that the noble viscount would continue after the conjunction and provide me with time to devise an answer to the first part of his question <e>", "<cs> my lords i am suspicious of measures which have the support of the opposition <e>", "<cs> yes indeed my lords <e>", "<cs> my

me <e> <s> as i said i am not suggesting that the association have been obstructively contentious on the subject of finance or indeed of running the service <e> <s> quite the contrary i should like <e>", "<cs> my lords on the detail i must write to the noble baroness but the intention is to concentrate the reporting in the areas where it will be of most constructive use to the court <e> <s> plainly that must include those about to be sentenced <e> <s> the terms of this concentration and where the margins come are i am afraid a refinement which escapes me and on which i may be illuminated later today <e> <s> i will write to the noble baroness because she has certainly made a point that requires consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords we are of course concerned for the welfare of british citizens serving sentences in foreign countries where prison conditions are very different from those in this country by reason of the climate culture diet or custom <e> <s> our consular officers do all they can to help <e> <s> but my point is that we shall shortly be coming to a conclusion on this matter and it would be precipitate to embark on these bilateral discussions ahead of the more general issue which will then be decided <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that there are at present nine british citizens serving sentences in thai prisons nine on remand and one on bail <e>", "<cs> my lords we certainly have this issue on board <e> <s> the result of our cogitations about the convention will be available in the next few weeks <e> <s> in the meantime i am sorry to hear that the noble lord thinks that there is anything lacking in the operation of the foreign and commonwealth office <e> <s> of that i was not aware <e>", "<cs> my lords the question relates specifically to thailand <e> <s> the number resulting from that country would at the most i understand be which in the present context of our prisons is not a large increase <e>", "<cs> my lords i had no intention of prejudicing anything that might be done bilaterally <e> <s> i was merely saying that it should not in all reason be done ahead of anything that is done multilaterally <e>", "<cs> my lords in my opening remarks i considered how last sessions bill had been changed to produce the new one now before your lordships house <e> <s> noble lords opposite have chosen to concentrate more on what has not changed but in their view should have been <e> <s> i did not expect that our amendments would satisfy them <e> <s> after all there are certain points on which we fundamentally disagree with noble lords opposite and it is of course the oppositions business to oppose <e> <s> it is therefore the noble lords prerogative to dwell upon the ground we trod in the early months of this year and to remind us that they will be making sure that we tread it again in the coming months although i hope not with too tedious regularity <e>", "<cs> my lords i think not <e> <s> i do not wish to be discourteous but there is another debate after this one and i am certain that the noble lord will be returning to the charge in committee <e> <s> if i have him wrong he will put it right there i am sure with all the acclaim that is due to him and the publicity which he believes necessary to keep the record straight <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel i should be discourteous to the noble lord lord hatch if i were to give way to the noble lord lord avebury <e> <s> the noble lord lord hatch who will doubtless move to intervene again sought to persuade us that information about immigrants related first specifically and exclusively to coloured immigration <e> <s> even if the noble lord is not aware of the large volume of cases related to non-coloured immigrants received by the home office he must surely have some inkling at least of the pressures of concern in this field from our recent debate on the case of mr papusoiu which i believe he attended <e>", "<cs> my lords i am indeed aware of the concern on this issue and on all humanitarian issues that are not peculiar to any part of this house but <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly consider the concern of the noble lord and the

overnight expenses if it is necessary to stay there <e> <s> i shall however look with care at what the noble lord suggests <e>", "<cs> my lords every case is considered on its merits <e> <s> i could not give a portmanteau answer as to what particular difficulties might be considered enough in an individual case <e> <s> a case could be considered only when it arose <e>", "<cs> my lords there is an agreeable air of authority and completeness in todays debate <e> <s> the legislation on cable systems to which we are proceeding will rest upon the white paper published in april and the white paper

honourable friend who commissioned both the report and the white paper as a distinguished member of another place is none other than my noble friend who is the distinguished and very welcome member of this place who opened the debate today <e> <s> his release from silence in this place has done a great deal to inform your lordships debate <e>", "<cs> my lords this is an issue to which i do not doubt we shall return <e> <s> i take note of what the noble lord said and will read it with care <e>", "<cs> my lords i congratulate the noble lord lord irving of dartford on introducing this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i share the noble lords gratitude to my noble friend <e> <s> i endorse her view of the distress caused by this to families involved and i can assure the noble lord that all expedition will be followed that is consistent with thoroughness and a proper result <e>", "<cs> my lords we are very well aware of the views of the press council <e> <s> we shall be treading this ground tomorrow afternoon but i can certainly say that we welcome the way in which the press council strengthened its guidelines after the sutcliffe case and we believe that the press would be very well advised to observe them <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a matter of close concern to my right honourable friend <e> <s> it is proper though that the necessary groundwork should he done before he gives his full attention to what the proper solution should be <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it it is the whole question of the propriety of this conduct which is a matter of concern <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> in committee on the earlier bill we considered an amendment by the noble lord lord wigoder which would have removed from the definition of personal data anything which was not a plain statement of fact <e> <s> expressions of opinion about the data subject would have been expressly excluded from the definition so that the data subject would have been deprived of access to what was thought about him <e> <s> i argued that that would radically restrict the <e>", "<cs> a statement that a man is a good man is a matter of opinion a statement that he deserves a reward or promotion for that is a statement of opinion <e> <s> the only matter that the bill catches in this way is the statement that as a result it is intended that he shall be promoted <e> <s> noble lords opposite are suggesting that managers all over the country will start concocting an elaborate code whereby they will say one thing to the computer and mean another <e> <s> i daresay that there are other ways too in which they could do this they could fudge the issues all over the place <e> <s> i do not believe that it would be practicable to do so because if the organisation in question is one that actually does have intentions then they will have to distinguish between genuine intentions and intentions which are no more than stalking horses for opinions <e> <s> i do not see that that is a likely eventuality which is why i did not return to that point when i first spoke <e> <s> i cannot see the threat as being very real or very dangerous <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble lord is really suggesting that there will be this tide of evasions as a result of the drafting of the bill <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord does so i should like to congratulate him on the way in which he urged us all to provide legislation which can never be the subject of litigation <e> <s> i earnestly hope that we may do that although the noble lord and some of his friends may be the poorer as a result <e>", "<cs> there is little danger of its happening <e> <s> may we just look a little more closely at what has been suggested by the noble lord <e> <s> it is an interesting idea that one can take an opinion and bury it in an intention <e> <s> an intention is presumably normally the result of opinion it is either the result of a set of facts or it is the result of an opinion which you hold <e> <s> the example was taken this man is clever and i intend to promote him or this man is drunken and i intend to sack him or he may prove to be drunken and if he does i intend to send him elsewhere to other less bibulous places <e> <s> what would appear on the tape would be one entry which contains two components one is an intention i intend to promote this man and the other is an opinion this man is clever <e> <s> i intend to promote this man because he is clever <e> <s> the opinion is caught by the bill and is the subject of access <e> <s> it is only the intention the conclusion you arrive at after considering the cleverness or drunkenness it is only what you then decide that is to be concealed from him <e> <s> it is not the intention of the bill to conceal your opinion <e>", "<cs> i always get a little worried when the noble lord lord mishcon is either complimentary or when he exonerates me of an intention <e> <s> he was fairly complimentary at the beginning of the afternoon but not enough to worry me <e> <s> but he then exonerated me of misleading the house deliberately <e> <s> i understand the point that he makes that the servants of the corporate body the company are themselves all the data user and therefore he is right in saying that their intentions are the intentions of the data user they are the intentions of the corporate body which is running the affair and they are the management <e>", "<cs> i hope that i can help the noble lord <e> <s> the definitions contained in clause as i recall saying frequently on previous occasions have been constructed with the utmost care to ensure that when they are taken together we cover all those activities that we need to cover but do not bring in innocent and unsuitable operations <e> <s> put simply the bills obligations bite on those who hold defined in subsection personal data defined in subsection which means processing those data defined in subsection as mentioned in subsection that is to say by <e>", "<cs> no we cannot have data before it has been collected <e> <s> when it has been collected it is harmless unless there is an intention to process it <e> <s> as soon as the intention exists the bill bites <e> <s> that is really all i was trying to say <e> <s> it appears that this is what the noble lord lord mishcon wants to happen <e>", "<cs> i speak subject to correction on this <e> <s> we shall doubtless return to it <e> <s> we are straying a little from the amendment <e> <s> clause defines a data user as <e>", "<cs> the definition of processing is of course crucial to the scope of the bill <e> <s> the bill imposes obligations on data users who hold personal data and on computer bureaux who provide services in respect of personal data <e> <s> an important element in the definition of holding data in clause and providing services in respect of data in clause is the concept of processing <e>", "<cs> i have studied the telegraph and the answer is yes <e>", "<cs> it is refreshing to be on a new piece of turf since this point was not in the bill when we last saw it <e> <s> as i mentioned on second reading clause is an attempt to meet the concern which had been expressed to us that the definition of processing in subsection could catch some straightforward word processing activities that were quite incapable of causing harm to anyone and i am grateful to my noble friend for his recognition of the work that we have done in this direction <e> <s> in the case of for example a word processor programmed to produce a standard letter to a firms customers the very fact of the equipment looking for the name of the original recipient and replacing it on each occasion with a new name could under subsection possibly be held to entail processing by reference to the data subject <e> <s> the government accepted that it would be both burdensome and pointless to apply the registration and other requirements of the bill to such activities and we spent some time in deciding how best it could be made plain that they were not covered by the bill <e>", "<cs> i think i have to take hesitant issue with the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey who has revealed useful depths of experience in this field <e> <s> i am advised that the term equipment comprises both hardware and software <e> <s> in any case what the bill provides is that where a person is equipped to process text and produce text in the sense we mean it in common parlance letters and documents in other words and where that is all he does the two legs together make the definition which is then clear <e> <s> the distinction between hardware and software which is not a distinction for the purposes of this definition anyway does not arise <e>", "<cs> it might shorten things later if i try to make more clear what i said previously <e> <s> the noble lord came to your lordships committee with an anxiety that word processors in every office would be caught and that every office would be registered to no purpose when some were only sending out standard letters with different names on them <e> <s> the reason we have not used word processors as the bench-mark is that given by the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey <e> <s> a word processor can be many other things and can do things for which the noble lord does not want an exemption <e> <s> what we have done is to say that any machine that can do what he and i mean by word processing satisfies half the definition <e> <s> the other half of the definition is that you only use it for what he and i call word processing <e> <s> if all he wants is to exempt word processing on whatever machine it is done i think that he should be content with what is in the bill <e> <s> if he wants more than that i am not at all sure that i am prepared to give it to him <e>", "<cs> indeed yes <e>", "<cs> i am much obliged <e> <s> i mean for that operation because it can also then be switched to do pay lists leave rotas or whatever <e>", "<cs> i am much obliged to the noble lord for introducing a very beneficial new procedure in which those moving an amendment do not make a speech but simply listen to the answer <e> <s> it perhaps suggests rather too clearly that the minister has decided what to say without having heard the speech anyway <e> <s> i assure the noble lord that i always listen to what he says <e> <s> on this occasion the stratagem is justified <e> <s> if ever we can reach a point at which he does not make a speech and i do not reply to it we shall get on a great deal faster still <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to noble lords who have taken part in this unaccustomedly thorough debate that clause stand part of the bill <e> <s> i begin with the noble lord <e> <s> lord avebury who opened i scarcely dare call it the bowling any more on this stage and start by thanking him for the notice he gave of his intentions to raise this matter now and for his co-operation in handling the matter in this way <e>", "<cs> not the latter so i absolve myself from going on too long if i revert to that because it is difficult to drop the right part of the speech if one starts dropping it after one has begun it <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the fault lies on my side rather than on the noble lords as to the explanation <e> <s> i hoped that i had made it clear that the distinction which we regard as essential is that of the intention or otherwise to process these identical forms and indeed almost any printed sheet can be recognised by a computer <e> <s> if there is in one pile a mixture of those which it is intended to process and those which it is not intended to process then the office obviously is in a great muddle <e> <s> the noble lord suggests that because one piece of paper is not destined to go on to the companys records but is destined to go into the wastepaper basket while it remains in the office it should be available under the bill <e> <s> i will take careful thought about what the noble lord has said <e>", "<cs> i hope i can sweep up all the ground the noble and learned lord has put before us but if i do not doubtless he will bring me back to the despatch box to deal with the omissions <e> <s> the eight principles set out in part ii of schedule to the bill contain a number of difficult and imprecise concepts <e> <s> for instance there is no objective indication of what ought to be taken to constitute obtaining information unfairly under the first principle <e> <s> equally under the second and third principles it is not clear how the purposes for which data are held are to be specified <e>", "<cs> is the noble and learned lord leaping up <e> <s> i am very happy to have further time to cogitate <e>", "<cs> on a number of specific points i want to say first that the convention has a commentary but it has no interpretation section as part of it <e> <s> equivalent legislation in europe has interpretation sections and this is proper because with all the difficulties of language it is right that individual countries should apply the definitions which are appropriate to their own language and indeed to their own constitutional and litigious experience <e> <s> the convention uses general terms such as reasonable in the full knowledge that differing interpretations will be appropriate in different states <e>", "<cs> the provisions about correction and erasure occur in the body of the bill <e> <s> i did not follow the noble lord when he was saying that what he did not like about the provisions was implicit in the part of schedule which his noble and learned friend wishes to remove <e> <s> it may have been a momentary lack of attention on my part and if he would be kind enough to direct me to what he referred to <e> <s> i shall try to deal with it <e>", "<cs> i am happy to state that the noble lord lord avebury having spotted the linkage that i did not see has also produced the reply which i did not produce <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for the able explanation of his amendment and for revealing the source of his inspiration if as he says that is the right word <e> <s> i admired almost everything about his speech although i am not sure that i admired the conduct of the rest of the committee <e> <s> the sort of delighted levity which spread across the benches opposite when the prospect of my eventual demise was mentioned was something which i found rather disheartening <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is familiar with rudyard kiplings story of the snake which bit the footprint of an unfortunate person many miles away who died and of the celebration at the funeral being so merry that the snake decided that the bite was powerless and sicked up its venom upon every other snake in the kingdom thus reducing its own lethal capacity <e> <s> possibly this is the effect of the analogy which i have drawn but i am not at all sure because i have gone rather far from the starting point <e>", "<cs> i suppose that we are all of us interested in our obituaries <e> <s> i would interrogate the relevant computers only with the greatest hesitation not from fear of not being mentioned which i should not find all that disagreeable but from fear of finding an unfavourable mention <e> <s> i believe that luck is distributed between families on a fairly even basis <e> <s> my grandfather actually did come back from a holiday north of the arctic circle to read his obituary <e>", "<cs> if the data were used for historical statistical or research purposes then plainly they would fall within that paragraph and the noble lord would have no worries <e> <s> if they did not fall within it because i imagine that there is a vast range of information and some data are used for one purpose and some for another and the data were used for some other purpose such as presenting a news programme then i suppose it could be argued that it was an application concerning very recent history <e> <s> if it were not it would still be a very legitimate purpose for holding the data and i should have thought there would be no great need for justifying this to the registrar and making him understand that what was on the data bank was necessary for the function performed by the bbc just as what is being built on the data bank in the library of your lordships house is necessary for what goes on in this chamber <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the noble lord lord donaldson for directing my mind to that part of the bbcs assembly of information which is known as the archives and is internationally famous <e> <s> i had understood from the noble lord lord winstanley that he was referring to a bank of information for current affairs programmes and it was to that that i addressed myself <e> <s> the noble lord nods <e> <s> the noble lord lord winstanley addressed our minds first of all to publishers as such and asked whether they could not be exempt from the provision of the bill for activities other than those described in paragraph of part ii of schedule as bestowing particular benefits or exemptions on those pursuing them that is to say historical statistical and research purposes <e> <s> we went over those in some detail last time round <e>", "<cs> we have had a most interesting and well-informed debate and there has been some cogent argument from the other side of the committee and indeed from this <e> <s> it has convinced me of one thing the value which attaches to independent advice in this field <e> <s> on this we are on common ground <e> <s> but i have not heard anything as yet which has persuaded me that the advantages of placing an advisory committee on a statutory basis sufficiently outweigh the disadvantage of doing so <e> <s> the objections are i suppose familiar <e> <s> but then so are the arguments that have already been advanced <e> <s> i think i must repeat them <e>", "<cs> i see <e> <s> i take note of which end of the telescope the noble lord looks through <e> <s> equally the registrar will no doubt make full use of all types of expertise in carrying out his functions <e> <s> inevitably however providing for such a committee in statute would lead to an element of rigidity <e> <s> one of the reasons why one might want to appoint a committee would be the rapidity with which technological change had taken place in this area precisely the circumstances in which it would have been better not to have prescribed in advance the functions and role of such a committee <e> <s> however widely the terms of reference were to be cast there would always be the possibility that some new aspect of data protection could arise on which the committees advice would be most welcome but which would not be covered by its terms of reference <e>", "<cs> i am getting through to the noble lord lord avebury with less and less clarity as this debate goes on <e> <s> i spent the first three-quarters of my speech if that is the right proportion in explaining that we absolutely agreed that external advice might be highly appropriate and desirable but that we thought on balance that it was inappropriate and undesirable to make it statutory in form <e>", "<cs> i think i have been invited to make one or two comments <e> <s> the principal issue in my mind is this <e> <s> the amendment was introduced as a specific amendment a fairly closely drafted example of what noble lords opposite wanted <e> <s> they wanted a statutory committee of stated proportions which they might take leave to alter at a later stage but which was written on the face of the bill as to its composition and without specific powers <e> <s> that seemed to me a fairly straightforward proposition <e> <s> the noble lord lord avebury whose name also appears on the amendment suggested that we were addressing ourselves to the very much wider question of whether it was desirable that the secretary of state and/or the registrar should take outside advice at all and if so whether there should be a statutory requirement for him so to do <e>", "<cs> it is the claws they are discovering <e> <s> there are various things that one cannot do if one <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will forgive me there is i think a fairly considerable difficulty here <e> <s> the issues in the two codes of practice are different <e> <s> i want to say a good deal about this code of practice and there is a good deal that i want to say about the other <e> <s> i would not want all that to be divorced from the rest of the argument by a dinner break which if we deal with both amendments now is bound to start before we finish discussing both amendments <e> <s> therefore i am just wondering whether we are wise to take the amendments together and whether we could not treat this as a probing amendment to which i could give a fairly swift reply <e> <s> then we could return to amendment no <e> <s> at the appropriate time <e> <s> it is up to the committee and the noble lord <e>", "<cs> this is obviously the first leg of a two-part debate and we shall return to the issues on amendment no <e> <s> as the noble lord lord mishcon has courteously said that he will use that as the occasion on which to deploy his arguments <e> <s> i do not doubt that he now has a sneaking hope that i shall expend all my ammunition on this part of the debate and await his arrival at the top of the objective in the <e>", "<cs> we were not discussing it but i shall have plenty to say later <e>", "<cs> clause to which the offending words are a cross-reference deems the registrar his officers and servants to hold office under her majesty for the purpose and only for the purpose of section of the official secrets act <e> <s> that is a purely technical device for ensuring that the registrars office are properly constrained so far as the unauthorised communication of information is concerned and it sits alongside the provisions of clause which provide a further check on the disclosure of information other than in the course of their duties under the bill <e> <s> nothing in clause undermines the independence of government of the registrar and his staff which may be part of the noble lords concern which we have been careful to ensure in the bill <e> <s> clause is a straightforward provision to ensure that the registrar having obtained the information he needs to perform his duties thereafter uses it responsibly <e>", "<cs> i think that the loophole which the noble lord has generously given to me is one through which i ought speedily to progress <e> <s> i shall at the same time investigate the interesting prospect of all ministerial lapses being covered by the official secrets act which would make life a lot easier for all of us <e> <s> i do not really think it is on but i will not detain your lordships at this stage <e> <s> i will write to the noble lord about what is a fairly complicated matter <e>", "<cs> yes but if the list gets much longer i will have copies put in the library <e> <s> for the time being i will write to all the front-benchers concerned and all those who have raised their voices <e>", "<cs> first may i say how nice it is to see the noble lord lord elystan-morgan back from the fastnesses of wales <e> <s> secondly i must congratulate him on a brevity which i cannot altogether match but which i will seek to match <e> <s> the effect of the amendments he has proposed would be to convert the register from what is predominantly a list of data users who hold personal data to a list of what are here termed data banks <e> <s> i must first comment that having set themselves that task the authors of the amendment promptly <e> <s> and i think understandably give it up <e> <s> some of the problems implicit in the conversion in the clause surface yet even they are ignored so we are presented with data banks instead of data users when the data users are just that and nothing else but we still have data users where they are data users who also carry on computer bureaux <e> <s> so we have a sort of hybridity here and the register is to contain a list of data banks but the first participation to be shown must be the name and address of the data user <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that there is not <e> <s> i agree that it is the question of communication which matters and therefore presumably the communicator ought to be registered because it is to the communicator that the data subject must address himself if he wants to know what is in the data bank <e> <s> i do not want to pursue this point too far because it is not the substance of our difficulty <e> <s> i was merely pointing out that at present the amendment is not drafted in a workable way <e>", "<cs> your lordships may recall that under the principles at the heart of this bill it is only legal to hold data and we have described holding in the definitions clause for one or more specified and legitimate purposes <e> <s> if your lordships will look at clause and the powers which the registrar has to refuse applications which do not reveal as much as is required by the bill your lordships will appreciate that the two taken together will provide the reassurance which the noble lord lord elystan-morgan seeks <e>", "<cs> i hope i have followed my noble friends argument sufficiently to answer it <e> <s> a fact of life in the computer world is that many data users who own or lease computers have considerable spare capacity and many of them find it an economic use of that spare capacity to hire it out as it were to other users who may not possess their own computer <e> <s> in this way the original user is acting as a computer bureau <e> <s> this is sufficiently usual for us to feel that we should avoid users in that position having to make a separate registration to cover their bureau role <e> <s> under clause a joint user/bureau that is one person doing two things can merely indicate that he does both and then under clause can provide particulars in respect of the data that he holds as a user <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether we may start by trying to put ourselves into the shoes of applicants facing the registration form <e> <s> under clause <e>", "<cs> my noble friend has said that the amendments before us are designed to avoid inappropriate criminal liability being imposed under clause <e> <s> i hope to be able to persuade him that he really has nothing to fear since the bill is carefully drafted to achieve the effect that both he and i wish <e> <s> clause makes it an offence to contravene clause or knowingly or recklessly to contravene the other provisions of the clause <e> <s> clause provides that a person shall not hold personal data unless registered as a data user <e> <s> this therefore is a matter of strict liability <e> <s> but my noble friend has suggested that a person might do this unwittingly for instance where personal data were intermingled with a mass of non-personal data <e> <s> thus he argued we should amend clause so that to contravene clause is an offence only if it is done knowingly or recklessly <e>", "<cs> i hope to reassure the noble lord lord elystan-morgan that there is nothing sinister in our proposal to allow what we might call pluralist or multi-purpose users to choose whether to apply for single composite entry on the register or for separate entries geared to separate purposes <e> <s> we think that they should be given a choice <e> <s> what the noble lords opposite are worried about i think is that the various individual purposes for which data are used will not be adequately revealed on the register and that therefore the restrictions on the use of data that hinge on the purposes being specified in the public register will lose their impact <e>", "<cs> i am sorry about that <e> <s> the whole purpose of this bill is to protect the data user and to enable us to conform with the convention with the same object in view <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mcintosh has awoken to this fact rather late <e>", "<cs> i shall read <e>", "<cs> i am very happy to apologise and correct what i said <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the learned support that i am receiving on this difficult wicket <e> <s> may i start afresh and say that a central concern of this legislation is to protect the interests of the data subject <e> <s> that is a central concern of the principles <e> <s> one of the principles is that data may be held only for specific legal purposes and a function of the bill is to empower the data protection registrar under an alteration put into the bill at the request of noble lords opposite to pursue that objective <e> <s> he is given the means of so doing in clause <e> <s> he is given the power to pursue that

fortunate they are the greater the sympathy <e> <s> it does not mean that i agree with what is proposed <e> <s> we are on familiar territory <e> <s> we had more than one debate in the context of last sessions bill on codes of practice and the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones gave notice on second reading that he would return to the subject <e> <s> last session the noble lords opposite proposed codes of practice that had direct legal effect <e> <s> observance of a code would have meant that the user in question was not breaching the principles <e> <s> and at second reading the noble and learned lord appeared to continue to favour what he called codes with the force of law <e> <s> but as we have heard there has been a change of heart <e> <s> the noble lords opposite now propose something quite different <e> <s> before i consider what that something is let me make one thing crystal clear <e> <s> the bill does not rule out codes of practice <e> <s> i have said that already tonight and i will not expand on it except to quote to your lordships a passage in last years white paper <e>", "<cs> i am in a good mood and i had not thought that i had said anything offensive <e> <s> it seemed to me that i was not referring to what the noble lords proposed but to the way they had set about trying having failed to persuade us in one direction to persuade us in the other <e> <s> that is a legitimate approach and if the noble lord does not like it to be called wily which i regard as a rather complimentary term i will not use any terms at all <e>", "<cs> resourceful persistent <e> <s> i can only say that i intended no offence and i regret it if any was taken <e> <s> if i may address the amendment itself the first approach of the noble lords and the noble and learned lord was a statutory code with legal force <e> <s> we did not like that <e> <s> they then came back with a statutory code with no legal force and at that point i pointed out that either extreme would not work and that it is impossible to go in between because if you have a code with legal force then it must outrank the principles but the principles are supreme that is in the convention and if it has no legal force when it comes to the tribunal the tribunal will have to consider the principles in preference to the code of practice and therefore the code of practice will not be relevant <e> <s> it might be relevant if it had arrived by a different route but when the case goes before the <e>", "<cs> i think i dealt with most of the points the noble lord referred to <e> <s> there is nothing wrong with voluntary codes of practice <e> <s> there is nothing wrong with the data protection register assisting or advising in them <e> <s> what i sought to point out was that this amendment gave the imprimatur of the data protection registrar which might lead to a tribunals being asked to consider it as an indication that probably no infringement of a principle had taken place <e> <s> in fact however it would only have come to the tribunal because the registrar was thought by the user unfairly to have imputed such an infringement in the first place <e> <s> that seemed to be a paradox which it was not possible to get around <e> <s> i do not want to pursue the link that the noble lord seeks to make with the police and criminal evidence bill beyond saying that the codes under that bill stand on their own as arbiters of good practice and can therefore quite properly be given express evidential value <e> <s> but that is not the case under the bill before us because here it is the principles that are the essential yardstick <e> <s> i consider we have gone on long enough <e> <s> i think i have said as much if not rather more as i wished to say and i shall sit down <e>", "<cs> would it be helpful if i said what i thought i had conveyed before <e> <s> i intended nothing <e>", "<cs> we all start from a common position on this question <e> <s> we agree that the registrar must be able to obtain sufficient information from data users and from persons carrying on computer bureaux in order to perform his functions that is obviously crucial <e> <s> where the government differ from the noble and learned lord who proposes this amendment is in believing that the bill as drafted already provides the registrar with adequate and appropriate powers for this purpose <e>", "<cs> that is just the point the actual taking to court is the only part of the process i illustrated <e>", "<cs> of course i will look at what the noble and learned lord has said <e> <s> however he will understand that i cannot undertake to come back with a change of heart <e> <s> but i will genuinely look at the matter again <e>", "<cs> the prospect of a saving in public resources is always profoundly attractive but i am afraid i must rest on the arguments which i advanced earlier strengthened as they are by the changes we have made since we last looked at this area and to what is now clause on the general duties of the registrar <e> <s> i absolutely agree that the registrar is likely to be uniquely placed to know of the uses and abuses of personal data and i fully accept that it will be through him in many instances that data subjects will learn that things have gone wrong whether through the publicity which his actions attract the reports he publishes or the other steps he may choose to take to make information available <e> <s> clause establishes very clearly the expectations we have of him in this regard he must publish an annual report and disseminate information as he thinks fit and he is specifically empowered we put this point in to avoid all doubt to give advice to any person as to the operation of the bill and his functions under it <e>", "<cs> i think that the question is addressed across the floor <e> <s> my view would be that the data protection registrar would not pronounce upon <e>", "<cs> only to remind the noble and learned lord that there is the permissive power which he seeks in clause <e> <s> it is not only a question of an annual report <e> <s> the registrar is also required to disseminate information as he thinks fit <e> <s> in order to put the matter beyond doubt he is specifically empowered to give advice to any person as to the operation of the bill and his functions under it <e> <s> as i see it the data protection registrar will be in a perfect position to communicate with individuals when it is appropriate so to do <e> <s> but it seems to me that there will be occasions when perhaps a million people have suffered a fairly trivial inconvenience as a result of a breach and it will be sufficient for him to place an advertisement in the newspapers or indeed to rely on the popular press to report it <e> <s> perhaps we should both consider what the other has said between now and report <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are aware of the dangers of being a pedestrian in any part of the street <e> <s> in march the government introduced a two-part driving test for motor-cyclists whom the noble lord considers to pose the greatest threat <e> <s> the first part is conducted off the road and is designed to make riders safe and competent on the road <e> <s> the second part of the test is conducted on the road and is very similar to the previous test <e> <s> the government also introduced <e> <s> in october of last year a two-year limit on the duration of provisional motor-cycle licences with the object of encouraging learner riders to take training and to pass both parts of their test early in their riding careers <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships will all be thankful that my noble friend was spared <e> <s> i might add that in the last two years there was one reported accident involving pedestrians on crossings <e> <s> that was on th august when a minibus overtook a stationary vehicle at a pedestrian crossing and hit a year-old man causing slight injuries <e> <s> i do not think that that could have been my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords the house is aware that the noble and learned lord is always quick in every sense of the word <e>", "<cs> not without notice my lords and probably not then either <e>", "<cs> my lords the police are diligent in enforcement and as i have said we are doing quite a lot to encourage education <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord john-mackie asked me what it would cost to convert all crossings to light-controlled ones <e> <s> i think the answer is that it would cost a very great deal merely to discover the answer <e> <s> if we are considering specific crossings that is another matter <e> <s> i will draw the concern of my noble friend to the attention of my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords having been a pedestrian a motor-cyclist and a motorist in my time i can see great force in what the noble lady has suggested although whether it is practicable is another matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that all noble lords who are members of clubs and particularly those who are members of clubs in st jamess street always conduct themselves with very great decorum <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have no plans to abandon the simple majority system which is well understood by the electorate provides close and direct constituency representation and contributes to stable government <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> in this country we elect a government <e> <s> under the system or the variety of systems which the noble lord suggests what is produced is a group of politicians who decide between themselves who shall be the government <e> <s> that is an answer which the electorate themselves have not given <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his intervention <e> <s> i would add that when the noble lord lord mayhew implies that a majority voted against the present government a very much greater majority voted against the alliance <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i shall not engage with the noble lord on mathematics <e> <s> but it is certainly the case that we are very glad to see the noble lord where he is although we think it is the wrong part of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i think that that is another and very large question <e>", "<cs> my lords i presume it is that which gives them a seat on the front bench of another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i always regard stability as a virtue provided that it is democratically arrived at and it is my view that the system we now have is a practical effective popular and well-tried democratic system <e>", "<cs> my lords the political system is indeed important and i share the noble lords perception of it though i do not necessarily share his view as to which party ought to come out on top <e> <s> but there are other issues since every variation of proportional representation weakens the link between the representative and his constituents and we regard that as a fundamental and beneficial aspect of our system <e>", "<cs> my lords we always sympathise with virtuous people in misfortune but we believe that the misfortune was necessary as a result of the system <e> <s> and that the system is an essential part of the democratic government of this country <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said earlier a principal feature of the present system which would be weakened by any form of pr is the closeness of the link between the constituency member and his constituents who are able to know him individually <e> <s> on a multi-seat constituency basis or on any of the other <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only consider the members of this house of course and i have generally supposed and it has been borne out by experience that changes in position in the chamber are born out of wisdom resulting from experience <e>", "<cs> my lords that is so long ago that i have really forgotten <e>", "<cs> my lords i disagree with the noble lords premises and thus also with his conclusion <e> <s> i am not aware that it is generally disliked <e> <s> i am aware that if the public are asked would you like a fairer system of election <e> <s> they not unnaturally answer yes <e> <s> but they have not been asked which sort they would prefer and if they were to examine them they would discover all the weaknesses to which i have <e>", "<cs> my lords i should be very reluctant to pass comment on any other countrys system of government from these benches <e> <s> but i suggest to the noble lord that it is not in any case the function of a system of election to control the eccentricities of the electorate <e> <s> in fact it is usually the electorate which has the function of controlling the eccentricities of the parliament house <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all grateful to the noble lord lord harris for providing this opportunity to discuss the report of the press council on <e>", "<cs> my lords even if i had all the details of the case before me the noble lord would not expect me to undertake the task of the court and come to a judgment <e> <s> it is for the courts to decide when they have the material before them <e>", "<cs> my lords i have nothing to add to the reply i gave to the noble lord yesterday <e>", "<cs> my lords the elected representatives of the people are doing what they were elected to do <e> <s> they are choosing how to run this country and the electoral system <e> <s> seventy per cent of them voted against the parties which want proportional representation and i see nothing unjust in that <e>", "<cs> my lords first as to a referendum a referendum works only if you can ask one straight simple question to which the answer is yes or no <e> <s> that cannot be the case with proportional representation because there are so many different sorts <e> <s> the government believe that they are standing in the path of a hallowed national tradition which is respected by all except those who feel that they could gain political advantage by changing it <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend likes to ask me such a question i shall answer it but it is a different one from the one that i am answering now <e>", "<cs> when we considered last sessions data protection bill considerable attention was paid in committee to clause <e> <s> various comments criticisms and suggestions were made and on report i was able to bring forward a revised clause which i was glad to discover met most of the points that had been made in committee <e> <s> one of them was the importance of ensuring that an exemption on national security grounds was not available without the authority of a government minister at the highest level <e> <s> we recognised the force in that argument <e> <s> and we revised the provisions of clause accordingly <e> <s> it now provides that any question of whether an exemption is required for the purpose of safeguarding national security must be determined by a minister of the crown <e> <s> and a minister of the crown is defined in subsection as a member of the cabinet the attorney-general or the lord advocate <e> <s> the noble lord lord avebury does me too much honour in suggesting that i might be included among that number in the foreseeable future <e> <s> we thus sought to ensure that decisions of this kind of a sensitivity and seriousness that are perhaps unique rest where they can only properly be taken at the highest level of government <e>", "<cs> i am relieved to find that in his secret heart of hearts the noble lord lord avebury regards this as an enlightened government because much of his correspondence has suggested the contrary <e> <s> i can answer one specific point and one general point <e> <s> on the specific point the noble lord is right the certificates would not be lodged with the registrar <e> <s> certificates would be held by the minister and produced where necessary to provide evidence that the exemption is required for the purpose of safeguarding national security <e> <s> that is the general practice where certificates of this sort are concerned <e> <s> so the noble lord is right in that <e>", "<cs> no they will not be available for display but they will be produced as individually required <e>", "<cs> although as the noble lord lord avebury has made abundantly clear this is a very <e>", "<cs> i think the issue to which the noble lord lord donaldson directed your lordships attention was the issue that criminal information was already covered by exemptions and that non-criminal information must be so innocuous that there is no harm in revealing to the person to whom it related that it was being sought <e> <s> in fact as i understand it the regulations applying to those who are and who are not entitled to live in this country are complex and are not entirely a part of the criminal law <e> <s> there are occasions when people in this country seek to foster the introduction or the concealment in this country of people not entitled to be here <e> <s> it is not in the interests of controlling such activities to reveal at the outset of an inquiry that this information is being sought <e>", "<cs> i shall be very careful in my reply to that quite understandable intervention because i do not want in any way to inhibit what now takes place <e> <s> i have said that we are aware of the anxiety to which the amendment is addressed and that we will seek to alleviate that anxiety if that appears to us both proper and feasible <e> <s> by what means that might be i really could not say and if i were to answer the noble lords question in terms i am afraid it could only be read outside this chamber as making one solution or another more or less likely <e>", "<cs> i must begin with an apology because i am going to repeat myself <e> <s> i explained the need for the exemption in clause and sought to dispel some of the misapprehensions about it at some length in our committee consideration of last sessions bill <e> <s> i did so again on report and i did so once more at second reading of the present bill <e> <s> i now find myself required to do so yet again <e> <s> i do not believe that arguments gain strength from constant repetition <e> <s> at least that certainly goes for other peoples arguments and therefore i accept that it must go for mine as well <e> <s> but i have no choice because noble lords opposite have trod the same measure again and i must join in <e>", "<cs> i always find it charming when the noble lord lord avebury makes himself heard above my voice when he is seated <e> <s> he will forgive me if i do not respond <e>", "<cs> the reactions of people and comments which the noble lord himself has made suggested that this must be the case because otherwise there is no explanation of them <e> <s> but it is a belief that has been <e>", "<cs> i shall be obliged if the noble lord will let me get on or else stop me <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will be kind enough to give way i regret that i mislaid my note on that point <e> <s> the answer is that indeed they do the consideration extends to the whole of clause and therefore to both the subsections the noble lord is interested in <e>", "<cs> i quite understand but i think when the committee comes to decide it should do so on the right facts <e> <s> i must return to the first part of the remarks the noble lord made rueing the terrible dilemma which will face a data user when the bobby knocks on the door and wants to know whether fred was at work last tuesday <e> <s> this is no more and no less than the terrible dilemma which now faces him if the records are manual he still has to decide whether the bobby is legitimately after facts or whether he is being misled <e> <s> he has to rely on his own judgment now and he will have to rely on his own judgment in the future <e>", "<cs> may i just repeat because the noble lord invited me to repeat the fact that the liabilities are exactly the same now the informant is already under such a threat as there is in the bill <e> <s> that is the point the noble lord lord donaldson has latched on to and i would like to say that that is valid <e> <s> i will not go into the other matters the noble lord raised <e>", "<cs> i understand that the noble lord is seeking to divide the committee and i merely say that i stand by everything that i said <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is right in thinking that the considerations he is concerned with will be swept up in the considerations on the earlier amendment which he and his noble friends were good enough to withdraw <e> <s> therefore i do not think there is much point in my referring at length again to the anxieties to which he has referred <e> <s> my acknowledgment of them was genuine as was my undertaking to review <e> <s> i hope it will stand on the record of our consideration of both provisions that this is so and i shall not return to it <e>", "<cs> is the noble lord by any chance referring to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i think that amendment no <e> <s> goes with amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i fear that i cannot match the noble lords admirable brevity <e> <s> i well recall that at various stages on last sessions bill the noble lord and his noble friend moved amendments to the effect that disclosures made under clause should be notified to the registrar who might then be required to take action of one kind or another <e> <s> the idea is not without attractions and they have put it forward in various forms <e> <s> the data user had to publish details of the disclosures and provide data subjects with a copy of the data about the subject that had been disclosed <e> <s> at report stage the provision was reduced to a requirement to notify the registrar but then there was nothing further that anybody had to do and on third reading the noble lord was suggesting that the registrar should publish the facts and details of disclosures within years <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether evasion is the right word it was meant to be a response <e> <s> i may be out of date with my mechanics but we are still left with the registrar are we not <e> <s> opening this vast pile of envelopes and deciding what they tell him <e> <s> it is very difficult to know what they will tell him and it is even more difficult from the amendment to know what he would then do about it <e>", "<cs> i was about to say that the noble lords plans for my summer holiday are beginning to diverge a little from my own <e> <s> however i always like to take advice in good heart <e> <s> i do not want to impose too much work on others <e> <s> most of the ground has been gone over previously <e> <s> if it seems to us that there is ground that has not been gone over and that has been revealed by what the noble lord suggests and by what the noble lord <e> <s> lord donaldson has remarked we shall certainly look at it <e> <s> i shall perhaps be writing to the noble lord if he will give me his holiday address preferably in the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> i hope that what i am about to say will address the noble and learned lords concern <e> <s> if it does not he will have to put me right and i shall return <e> <s> as clause indicates the non-disclosure provisions include clause <e>", "<cs> the burden is nothing to me <e> <s> i fear that it might be too much for the house <e> <s> would the noble and learned lord prefer me to do this now or by letter <e>", "<cs> with pleasure <e>", "<cs> as i explained when we discussed amendments on clause of last sessions bill these order-making powers have been included in order to allow us to undertake full consultations before deciding what if any restrictions upon the right of subject access shall be imposed in this area <e> <s> as your lordships obviously appreciate difficult and sensitive issues are involved issues that were also obvious to the authors of the convention <e> <s> that is one of the reasons why article <e>", "<cs> i am seized of the point and i am sure that my honourable and right honourable friends will be <e>", "<cs> in clause we bring home our unicorns those elusive beasts the completely harmless categories of data that can be exempted from the bill without danger to anyone <e> <s> clause has been carefully constructed at the urging of noble lords on both sides of the chamber and of bodies outside it <e> <s> it reflects suggestions put to us from a number of quarters among them the opposition members of the committee on last sessions bill in another place who put their names to an amendment exempting payroll and accounting data <e> <s> we have been particularly careful to limit both the purposes for which the data are held and the disclosures that are permissible in order to ensure that no harm is likely to befall data subjects as a result of the exemption of data <e> <s> i see no prospect of that expectation being disappointed <e> <s> if we were not confident of that we would not have amended last sessions bill in the way that we have <e> <s> nor i suggest would the opposition parties have joined together to urge us to amend it <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is as courteously persuasive as ever <e> <s> i thought i had a unicorn with one horn and he has presented me with a dilemma which has two <e> <s> therefore if he will bear with me although i am not enormously attracted by what he said i think there is some force in his argument and i should like to look at it before the next stage <e>", "<cs> the government were persuaded as a result of exchanges on the earlier bill that there was a case for exempting two sorts of data used in specific and very carefully defined circumstances <e> <s> they are described in clause as data held only for payroll and accounting purposes <e> <s> the clause exempts them provided that the limitations on their disclosure are met <e> <s> my noble friend lord mottistone is now asking us to add a third category data provided by an employee to his employer and used for administering the employee <e> <s> my noble friend has indicated the kind of information that he has in mind here <e> <s> it is the basic information about staff that managers are increasingly holding on desk-top micro-computers name address qualifications employment history and the like <e> <s> but i have grave doubts as to whether this ought to become a third category of exemption <e>", "<cs> as i have already said we thought very carefully about the way in which exemptions such as those to which the noble lord has referred should be described so as to ensure that they applied only to those strictly limited circumstances in which exemption would cause no harm <e> <s> we did this not simply by the manner in which the activity was described but by specifying that the exemption could be claimed only where disclosure took place in strictly limited circumstances <e> <s> we believe that by specifying both use and disclosure in this way we have ensured that such data cannot be misused to the detriment of the subjects <e> <s> had we not believed this we should not have come forward with the proposals <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble lord for raising the issue of the convention and for pressing this matter further because in fact it is article a of the convention which enables us to justify the exemption which we propose <e> <s> a further obstacle to what the noble lord lord elystan-morgan and his noble friends propose is that it would not be possible to adopt the proposal contained in his amendment and remain consistent with the council of europe convention in that respect <e> <s> this may sound surprising but the fact is that the article to which i have referred entitles a state to give notice that it will not apply the convention to <e>", "<cs> i hope your lordships will forgive me as i pause <e> <s> i was reflecting whether i could not curtail what i was going to say <e> <s> i have so decided <e> <s> if therefore there is a certain incoherence i hope that my attention will be drawn to it and i shall try to put it right <e> <s> it is perhaps proper if i start by explaining why i believe that a reduction in the scope of the register as drastic as that which i believe to be implied in the amendment would fundamentally change its character <e>", "<cs> i am a little saddened and surprised that the noble lords opposite were not entirely enchanted by the word promote because it was taken from a proposed amendment of their own at third reading last time round when they asked us to place upon the registrar the general duty to promote and facilitate compliance by data users with the data protection principles <e> <s> we did not like the rest of the amendment but we rather liked promote and i am sorry that the noble and learned lord now finds it nebulous <e>", "<cs> i have already tried to make clear the dangers of placing precise duties on the registrar and i am afraid this amendment does attract those difficulties <e> <s> before i deal with them i think i should point out another <e> <s> while it would be in order for the registrar to investigate any complaints that subject access had been refused under clause the remainder of part iii conveys various rights exercisable through the courts <e> <s> the amendment as it is drafted at present requires the registrar to investigate them also <e> <s> clearly it would be wrong for the registrar to oversee the work of the courts <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the noble lord will understand if i try to reply very briefly to an amendment which has required a great deal of research <e> <s> this is a tortuous area to which we are addressing ourselves <e> <s> the concern behind this amendment is that clause could have the unintended effect of making chief constables servants of a government department or more particularly of the home office rather than separate data users <e> <s> this is certainly not the governments intention nor i am advised is there any question that this could possibly be the effect of clause as drafted <e>", "<cs> clause provides that the bill does not apply to a data user in respect of data held outside the united kingdom <e> <s> but if one looks at clause it can be seen that we use these terms in a rather special sense so that data are to be regarded as held where control over the contents and use of the data is exercised irrespective of where the data are processed <e> <s> broadly speaking then the bill will apply where the person in charge within a data user bureau is within the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> we have come to the end of a second long hot afternoon and

he said <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend for his reception of the amendment and for relieving me i hope for the rest of this sitting from the crick in the neck which i got looking for him at the beginning of the proceedings <e>", "<cs> my lords i have tried very carefully to follow what the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey has been saying and what the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge has been supporting in amplification of this amendment <e> <s> i hope that i am in a better position now than perhaps i was during the committee stage to explain why i believe his fears to be unfounded <e> <s> i then sought to reassure your lordships that there was not anything in clause which would reduce the safeguards afforded by the bill to data subjects and i should like to reaffirm that view perhaps more precisely today <e>", "<cs> my lords if the house will give me leave i shall reply straight away <e> <s> this is exactly the situation that we wish to avoid and that is why we have amended the subsection <e> <s> perhaps if the noble lord himself would be kind enough to write to me exemplifying the way in which we have failed to do this i should be better able i hope to dispose of his misconceptions or alternatively to correct my own <e> <s> however the present state of play is that the amendment achieves what i have described without the subsequent amendment offered to your lordships by the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey and i hope that he will not pursue it at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i was counting on loquacity to give me a moment <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i am perfectly content with that <e> <s> the noble lord lord mishcon will find that i was just as friendly to him in his absence as i was to my noble friend lord mottistone in his absence <e> <s> i wonder whether after the next little break i shall be saying the same thing again <e> <s> finally i can reassure the noble lord lord avebury that the data subject can go to the registrar in the circumstances which he foresees <e> <s> therefore i hope that these amendments achieve in every respect what your lordships wish although the noble lord lord mishcon and his noble and learned friend lord elwyn-jones wish to discuss the matter when they reach their appropriate places <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord digby for his explanation of the amendment and the concern that lies behind it in his attempt to snatch another stage of this bill between the quickly succeeding statements we are having to cope with this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords to use a metaphor which may not appeal to the noblelord he is hunting a little ahead of the hounds but only a yard or two <e> <s> i was about to come to that <e> <s> that is the exact question i am asking <e> <s> if there is a statutory committee with a remit that turns out not to extend to giving advice in the particular circumstance what will the registrar do <e> <s> he will surely be reluctant to ask the committee to go beyond its statutory remit and the committee will be equally reluctant to go beyond the duties and powers voted to it by parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not a flippant illustration it is a very real one <e> <s> if the man is to have a statutory committee charged with giving him all his advice either he gets all his advice from it or he gets some from elsewhere but if he can get advice from elsewhere there seems to me little point in having the statutory body <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not doubt that i am being stupid in this but the noble lord has said that of course the committee will not have every sort of expertise and of course the registrar will get advice from the right experts when they are not on the committee <e> <s> therefore what he has not now convinced me of is why we need to have the committee at all <e>", "<cs> my lords may i start by apologising if i caused offence or confusion by uttering rhetorical questions during the process of discussing the last amendment <e> <s> they were indeed rhetorical <e> <s> i thought i had answered them but possibly not to the satisfaction of noble lords opposite though at least they had an answer <e> <s> i shall try to avoid doing that further <e> <s> we all know that we are on familiar ground here again <e> <s> indeed my noble friend moved an amendment in committee on this subject as did noble lords opposite <e> <s> i should like to take this opportunity of acknowledging the great care taken by the movers of the amendment to take note of the objections that i voiced on that occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of your lordships and contrary to normal convention here because this is report stage may i respond to those two points <e> <s> in answer to the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey i would say that certainly we do not expect one code per machine <e> <s> that would be nave <e> <s> we expect as many users of machines as possible to come together to create the minimum number of viable codes <e> <s> that i hope will be the result <e> <s> but the number of genuses of user is enormous because there is almost no public or private function which is not in the future going to be aided by machines capable of using personal data <e> <s> therefore there are going to be very many codes of practice that was all i wished to say <e>", "<cs> my lords amendments nos <e> <s> and are i think alternative means of achieving the <e>", "<cs> my lords with your lordships leave the noble lord has asked me two questions <e> <s> first he asked for an illustration of a case where it might be beneficial to hold back such information <e> <s> i do not speak from a brief but the case that occurs to me immediately is this <e> <s> suppose there is a computerised national list of people suffering from a dangerous noninfectious but incurable disease <e> <s> is it right that such a person should be told that his name is on the list but no more is to be revealed <e> <s> is it not better in some circumstances with the advice of the medical practitioner in charge to withhold the information that that person is on the list at all <e> <s> it may be a bad example but there are others which need not be medical where one can see the difficulty <e> <s> we recently had a debate about adoption and establishing parenthood in which we decided in the opposite sense <e> <s> i do think there might be occasions when there would be advantage in preserving this power <e>", "<cs> my lords with this complex series of amendments we return to the difficult question of the extent to which the right of subject access should apply to social work records <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord lord donaldson both for his notice and for his patient exposition of the intention of these amendments because i have found them a little difficult to follow <e> <s> now let me recap on their effect <e> <s> clause provides the secretary of state with an order-making power to exempt from the right of subject access or to modify that right in relation to social work records <e> <s> as i explained during committee stage we have included this power because while there is general agreement that some special provision will be needed concerning subject access to such records the precise nature of that provision must depend upon the views of the practitioners in that field <e> <s> that is why the department of health and social security issued a consultative document on the content of the order under clause ensuring that the relevant professions and other interested parties had a full opportunity to express their views <e> <s> responses to their document i gather are still arriving <e> <s> as i have said earlier i think that about two-thirds have arrived and we await others <e> <s> the department has yet to digest fully the representations that it has received <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not the custom for ministers to join in twice on other peoples amendments but i feel i must respond to the point which the noble lord lord mishcon has just contributed <e> <s> i am not concerned to defend the governments record as to the speed with which they have sought advice because i do not think that is <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord has explained the concern which lies behind this amendment and it is a concern which i fully understand <e> <s> it is i think i am right in saying the first time that it has been raised in the context of this bill and i am afraid that we cannot do it the justice which we could have done it had he raised it at committee stage but i shall do my best <e> <s> the noble and learned lord is anxious lest the right of subject access should prove in some circumstances to be a hindrance rather than a help to data subjects in particular in the field of employment <e> <s> this is a possibility which had not escaped us and we have in fact considered whether something might be done to avoid the sort of abuse which the noble and learned lord has in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords so many of your lordships have trailed your coats that perhaps you will allow me to tread briefly upon them <e> <s> i think the tone and content of the speeches has absolutely borne out my point that it is a committee stage proceeding that we need <e> <s> i shall deal briefly with the points which have been made <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his courtesy in giving me warning <e> <s> the date that he is looking for is the date in clause the date on which the subject suffers damage by reason of the inaccuracy of the data <e> <s> that inaccuracy must exist at the time the damage is caused and subsection cannot on any reasonable construction nullify that by allowing the user to remedy the inaccuracy after the damage has been caused and so avoid liability <e> <s> so the idea of somebody coming up to him on the steps of the court and saying sorry old chap but i put this right last night does not arise <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether by any chance we are at cross-purposes <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> is one to which i spoke with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the amendment to new clause is in amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the noble lord is addressing himself to the amendment we debated earlier <e> <s> i see that he is <e>", "<cs> my lords i was hoping that someone else might express a few lengthy views on the subject <e> <s> it is rare that i ask others to consider <e> <s> i am advised to re-advert to material which i thought i had already used <e> <s> if the noble lord finds it wanting in any respect i shall happily come back at a later stage as he suggests <e>", "<cs> my lords building on the powers of the courts under our new clause the noble and learned lord seeks to extend those powers in a significant new direction <e> <s> in the new clause now accepted by your lordships the courts have the power to order the correction or erasure of inaccurate data <e> <s> it is now proposed that as well as ordering correction or erasure they should also be able to order the user concerned to inform all persons to whom he has disclosed the inaccurate data that they are inaccurate <e> <s> by virtue of our amendment to clause which keeps the registrars power consistent with those of the court here the registrar too would be able to serve on users an enforcement notice having the same effect <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i am tempted to a flippant reply but the answer is that i think we intend to leave the bill as it is because it is the best that we can do <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the question of whether the noble and learned lord wants to dispose of the matter now is going to rest very largely with him <e> <s> i cannot encourage him to expect a beneficial result from patience <e> <s> obviously i am prepared to look at anything that he puts forward but my immediate advice is that there will be nothing that i shall be able to say as a result of so doing <e> <s> therefore if the noble and learned lord wishes to try the issue now he should do so <e> <s> i am not in favour of deferring matters to third reading but if he wishes me so to do i am prepared merely to say that we will look at it but i have no reason to suppose that i shall be able to do anything other than say no <e>", "<cs> my lords that was a welcome observation from the noble lord lord pitt which has given me more comfort than anything else that i have heard in the debate <e> <s> i came to this house four times on the last piece of legislation and three times on this one <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendments before the house bring together two strands of our previous deliberations on clause that is restricting the application of the exemptions and requiring certain disclosures to be notified to the registrar <e> <s> as the noble and learned lord explained clause exempts personal data from the non-disclosure provisions in any case where the data are disclosed for one of the clause purposes that is the prevention or detection of crime the apprehension or prosecution of offenders or the assessment or collection of any tax or duty where the application of the non-disclosure provisions would prejudice any of those matters <e> <s> it no longer exempts them where they would prejudice the control of immigration <e>", "<cs> my lords i have only one shot in my locker <e> <s> if the noble and learned lord wishes to intervene it would perhaps be better if he did so now <e>", "<cs> my lords i understood that the noble and learned lord was inviting me to respond <e> <s> i hope i have not misled him <e>", "<cs> my lords we share a common purpose and a common duty to the public good and i am very grateful for the courteous and friendly way in which the noble and learned lord concluded the argument on his side of the house <e> <s> with the leave of the house i should like to take up a number of the points which have been made and i think it proper that i should do so <e> <s> the noble lord lord mishcon pointed out quite rightly that we are engaged in drawing parameters within which and up to the borders of which it is proper for the police to operate in order to protect us <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall read my answer again with great care <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall of course take all considerations into view when considering the whole issue including the nature of the harm that is done to young people and the fact that they are going to congregate somewhere whatever we do <e>", "<cs> my lords in favour or against what <e>", "<cs> my lords i think they believe that there should be restricted entry to them but my right honourable friend will know more when he has spoken to them <e>", "<cs> my lords i should be nowhere without the comfort i constantly draw from the church but i shall make certain that my right honourable friend reads the document which the right reverand prelate has drawn to our attention <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that if my right honourable friend stands in need of the advice of the noble baroness he will ask for it <e>", "<cs> my lords the first thing to do is to decide whether legislation is needed <e> <s> the second thing to do is to take further advice should legislation be needed as to what form that legislation should take <e> <s> i can undertake that the consultations will be very wide if that should arise <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we are getting rather ahead of the present position <e> <s> we will consider such problems when they arise <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i intended no discourtesy and of course we shall look at the amendments <e> <s> but it may well be that our consideration of them will be strengthened by consulting the noble baroness at the same time <e>", "<cs> my lords we are aware that there is some dissatisfaction with the present planning controls and this can be looked at in our review of the whole subject <e> <s> but i rather think that what my noble friend has in mind is control by licensing rather than by planning regulation <e>", "<cs> my lords if such a bill were to be drafted it would be for consideration what terms should be in the bill and how it would be enforced <e> <s> i agree that that is a matter which we must consider very closely but i could not possibly give a view on it now <e>", "<cs> my lords under the race relations act the commission has a duty to submit to the home secretary proposals for amending the act when it thinks this necessary <e> <s> the commission has recently published a consultative paper covering a number of proposals on which it has invited public comment <e> <s> when the commission puts firm proposals to the home secretary they will be considered most carefully but i cannot indicate now what his response might be <e>", "<cs> my lords race relations are important and as i say we are not considering abolishing the commission <e>", "<cs> my lords in the financial year the cost to the exchequer of maintaining the commission was about million <e> <s> some million of that sum was in support of local community race relations councils <e> <s> in the current year the commissions grant will enable it to continue its activities at broadly the same level <e>", "<cs> my lords those are indeed the aims of the commission and i am grateful for the noble lords recognition of its achievements <e> <s> i believe that under the new chairmanship it will continue to improve on its performance <e>", "<cs> yes my lords that is the case <e> <s> central to my noble friends speech was the marked reluctance of some local authorities to recognise their moral responsibility to do more that what under the existing regulations is a minimal and insufficient amount to provide against the eventually of a war possibly a nuclear war in the future <e> <s> we sought to proceed by persuasion <e> <s> we failed <e> <s> we therefore come to parliament for legislation in its place <e> <s> our principal need is for a requirement that a local authority having once made plans for coping with war conditions shall keep them up to date and that they shall hold exercises to test them and to render them familiar to those of their staffs who are prepared to take part <e> <s> i stress that it is a voluntary concept there is no form of conscription in <e>", "<cs> my lord i beg to move the second motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords as to the relevance of my noble friends question to a forthcoming debate i am sure that there is a relevance and that the noble lord himself will make that more apparent when the debate takes place <e> <s> regarding questions of the efficiency of existing penalties i remind my noble friend that the penalties for the sort of offence to which his question relates are set out in the offences against the person act <e> <s> for assault with intent to resist or prevent arrest the maximum penalty is imprisonment for two years for assault occasioning actual bodily harm it is five years for wounding or causing grievous bodily harm the maximum is life imprisonment <e> <s> it would be difficult to be tougher than that <e>", "<cs> my lords her majestys government are opposed to minimum sentences because we can never foresee all the circumstances of every case <e> <s> my right honourable and learned friend therefore feels that if an occasional sentence gives cause for concern the proper body to take a view of it is the court of appeal <e> <s> that is why he proposes legislation to enable the court of appeal to reaffirm correct sentencing principles in cases where the sentences appear to be unjustifiably lenient <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are indeed seized of the importance of the principle of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful for the way your lordships have responded to my motion <e> <s> every single one of your lordships has been kind enough to thank me as i have thanked your lordships <e> <s> i am grateful to all noble lords <e> <s> i am particularly grateful to my noble friend lord mottistone and the noble lord <e> <s> lord donaldson of kingsbridge who were the only two who did not say but after they had said thank you <e> <s> i shall not reply to the series of buts in detail because i take it that they are addressed to another place and that they will be read there with the appropriate interest <e> <s> however it is fair to say in answer to the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey that certainly this is a reactive bill in some respects because it reacts to a present situation <e> <s> but it is i hesitate to use the word his dislike of which i share proactive in another sense in that throughout we have had to bear in mind the very rapid and quite unforeseeable developments which may take place in the technological field in which we are acting <e> <s> i take on board the point of my noble friend lord swinfen as to that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure noble lords will sympathise with me if i say that i was not aware of the direction of the noble lords question when i answered it <e> <s> it does not appear to me to have anything to do with drugs which are never used for disciplinary purposes <e> <s> i can assure the noble lord on that head <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> my lords as to the first of the noble lords second batch of supplementaries the verdict returned by the inquest was of death by misadventure <e> <s> i should tell the noble lord that as he would expect i require every case of death in custody whether by misadventure or otherwise to be notified to me within hours of working time <e> <s> i read the reports and take such action as appears to me to be necessary and i think it would be very wrong to publish these either selectively or as a blanket proposition to publish them all because they would then be less informative to me <e> <s> so i am not prepared to undertake publication <e> <s> if the noble lord wishes to pursue further the exchanges about a visit of the all-party parliamentary penal affairs group to the prison i do not think that the house will wish to be detained on that but i am quite happy to discuss it with him afterwards <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be unfortunate if the privilege of the house were used to cast aspersions upon people who are doing an honest and good job <e> <s> but i welcome the opportunity of placing on record the high regard which i and my colleagues have for the work done by the governor of holloway prison <e>", "<cs> my lords it is only some eight months since we had a very full debate in your lordships house on a previous european assembly elections amendment bill also introduced by my noble friend <e> <s> i do not propose to detain your lordships by repeating the points i made on that occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for my noble friends supplementary question <e> <s> indeed we are encouraged by our experience in this field <e> <s> policing is a matter of work within the community and not upon the community <e> <s> and this is a very good way of generating a community spirit and co-operation with the police force <e>", "<cs> my lords i do indeed remember the debate initiated by the most reverend primate and its central theme and i welcome the noble lords support for our view that the co-operation of the police and the community is the foundation of good law keeping and we shall of course support it <e>", "<cs> my lords on th september there were sentenced -year-old offenders held in prisons and remand centres <e> <s> this figure does show an increase over earlier years <e> <s> it may reflect recent changes in sentencing patterns but it is too early to draw any firm conclusions following the implementation of the criminal justice act and noble lords will be aware that it is for the courts to decide how each individual case should be dealt with <e> <s> initial indications <e> <s> however are that fewer detention centre orders are being imposed on boys under than formerly <e> <s> as to community homes community homes with education are not reserved for offenders and the courts have no powers to require a child to be sent to one <e> <s> in recent years the demand for residential care has decreased and the government are concerned to extend and strengthen the range of community based disposals for young offenders <e>", "<cs> my lords of course it is our aim to have as little recourse to imprisonment for this class of offender as possible <e> <s> but i think that in the cases to which the noble baroness refers the period in custody will have been short <e> <s> the allocation procedure is normally completed in between four and days and transfer allocation to another establishment is normally then done with despatch and at any rate within a week <e> <s> it is on occasion the case that so little of a short sentence remains that it is not in the interests of the prisoner to be put to the upset of removal to yet another strange place for the remaining period <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a question of administration and that is not meant to be a pettifogging reply but we do have to provide the means of allocation which is a specialised job <e> <s> the young people concerned are not kept in contact with adult offenders they are in separate parts of the establishment <e> <s> the allocation process is carried out as swiftly as possible and we find that it does not militate against the interests of the prisoners to the extent that i think the noble lord fears <e>", "<cs> my lords we are aware of this problem <e> <s> but i have to remind the noble baroness that the closure or maintenance in operation of a community home with education is the responsibility of a local authority and even before the implementation of the act a surplus of accommodation in such homes had already developed <e> <s> where this has led to establishments becoming uneconomic local authorities have had no alternative but to close them <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has put his finger on what i was trying to point out <e> <s> sometimes these homes are uneconomic <e> <s> we are trying to see how these facilities can be made more cost effective <e> <s> new provisions in the health and social services and social security adjudications act which comes into force shortly will widen the use that community homes with education may be put to and should stimulate this development <e>", "<cs> my lords the falklands episode is used as a yardstick for a great many things <e> <s> i am not sure that this is the most appropriate <e> <s> leaving that aside we are talking about individuals at any one time spread across the country in a number of institutions <e> <s> the offences occur all over the country not in specific places <e> <s> if we are to reduce the number of places in which they are to be held for allocation and very rarely for anything else we automatically make it a much greater distance for the family to travel in order to visit and support as well as a more expensive process for the system <e> <s> we have to balance the interests of all prisoners one against the other <e> <s> in the light of what the noble lord has said i shall of course look at the matter again but i am broadly satisfied that what we are doing meets the criteria both of cost effectiveness and of humanitarianism as it should <e>", "<cs> my lords i did catch the anxiety <e> <s> i thought that i responded to it in the terms in which i replied to the noble lord <e> <s> as to cost effectiveness i cannot agree with the noble lord but perhaps he does not quite take the point that i am making <e> <s> we have a finite budget and a finite amount of money to spend on the service <e> <s> within that service the more cost effective we are in dealing with one prisoner the better we can treat another <e> <s> i am therefore seeking the best way to use the money so that all prisoners benefit to the maximum amount <e> <s> i do not think that i can give disproportionate amounts of money to individual classes of prisoner beyond what may be required by their tender age and the fact that they may be first offenders <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that my noble friend is wishing to remind me of the remarks made by the noble and learned lord chief justice on the question of the suspension of such sentences <e> <s> as my honourable friend made clear recently in another place we do not at the moment foresee an opportunity for early legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware that the noble baroness has discussed it with some magistrates <e> <s> she was kind enought to tell me yesterday that she had done so <e> <s> i trust that in future discussions she will enlighten her friends in that quarter and that our exchanges in the house will serve to enlighten the rest <e>", "<cs> my lords i repeat that i think it is a little early to form a judgment on the working of the act <e> <s> i shall look at the working of the act in the light of what the noble baroness has said <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for drawing attention to what was intended to be a verbal felicity but not to limit the scope of my action <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have an exact figure for those who voted in the last election but i am aware of the concern expressed by my noble friend and as i say it is our intention to take this on board very shortly <e>", "<cs> my lords we would expect legislation to be necessary and the pressures of parliamentary time permitting we would hope to legislate in the next session <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the noble lords first supplementary question we judge that there is time within the existing timetable for the acting returning officer at a parliamentary election to issue a postal ballot paper and for it to be returned from most parts of western europe before the close of the poll <e> <s> wider issues are i think for the discussions that i have already described <e> <s> as i have told your lordships it is intended that this should be part of a piece of legislation which is under review <e>", "<cs> my lords we will look at all precedents and in particular that one <e>", "<cs> my lords the question relates only to those classes of person referred to by my noble friend but our review is concerned with enabling all absent voters including service voters to vote by post <e>", "<cs> my lords our concern extends to all members of her majestys forces and the other categories described by my noble friend <e> <s> the logistics of this matter will be closely considered in devising what is to be done <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i will now repeat a statement being made in another place by my right honourable and learned friend the home secretary <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank both noble lords for their comments and queries about the statement from another place which i repeated <e> <s> i am glad that the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos endorses the belief of all your lordships that it is better to proceed by constitutional methods and not by unconstitutional methods <e> <s> it is right to proceed by argument at westminster and not by intimidation at warrington when it comes to changing the law <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble marquess will realise that the statement is about the preservation of law and order in warrington and is not about the editorial standards of local newspapers throughout the country <e> <s> i entirely agree with him that the nga would have been better employed in almost any way other than they have been <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord wigoder is referring to a particular instance reported in the press this morning which may have been misleading <e> <s> i understand that during the arrest of a man in the night for a breach of the peace a automatic replica pistol fell to the ground <e> <s> the man made no attempt to display or use it and claimed that it was a collectors item which he had brought with him to sell <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very much aware of the position to which my noble friend rightly draws our attention <e> <s> we are prepared so to do <e>", "<cs> my lords operational decisions on the equipment to be used in any particular instance must rest with the chief constable <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely sympathise with what my noble friend has said <e> <s> that is indeed what is at issue <e> <s> this country is governed under a democracy and democracy proceeds by persuasion and the views of the majority <e> <s> where a minority does not agree with the law it is not open to that minority under a democracy to overthrow the law by violence or by any other means except through the ballot box and by persuasive argument <e> <s> i think the whole of your lordships house ought to endorse that on every possible occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not actually know of any individual though i am told there is one who is prepared to regard these events as having been spontaneous <e> <s> certainly the government do not <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that it did not happen and therefore whatever happened it cannot be repeated <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be helpful if i intervene at this stage to explain the governments attitude to this bill and the issues with which it seeks to deal <e> <s> i should like to start by welcoming the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs to the front bench and dispatch box opposite over which i hope i shall gaze at her with no greater hostility on future nights than i have tonight <e> <s> she is always able to smooth the path of her arguments with charm and i assure her that it was <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may begin with the end of my noble friends supplementary question may i encourage him to inform the police of the activities that he watches <e> <s> i am sure that that would be helpful <e> <s> as to his wider questions i can tell him that the goverment of pakistan are already well aware of the problems resulting from the illicit importation of heroin which has been illicitly produced in their country <e> <s> they are making substantial efforts with the support of many countries in the world including ourselves to stop the manufacture and export of illicit heroin <e> <s> we have offered in the first instance as aid for law enforement activities in that country <e> <s> we are very much seized of the threat of this evil trade and the best reply i can add to what i have already said to the noble lord is that the number of officers in her majestys customs and excise who are specifically allocated to the investigation of drug trafficking has been increased by per cent <e> <s> over the past five years <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i cannot give the figures that my noble friend wants though i will try to do so <e> <s> but i can tell her that the street value of heroin seized in was million <e> <s> regrettably i cannot tell her the equivalent price of cannabis <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i had best write to my noble friend because it will be employed in a number of ways which can best be described by my colleagues in the department of health and social security <e>", "<cs> my lords earlier this year the government consulted statutory professional and voluntary bodies on the scope for additional government initiatives on solvent abuse and on whether legislative controls would assist the work of local agencies <e> <s> this month the government will announce the outcome of that consultation <e> <s> the government also consulted retailers in november on the question of voluntary restraint in the sale of solvents <e> <s> we are pursuing further the possibility of drawing up guidelines for use by the retail trade <e>", "<cs> my lords the anxiety is shared by her majestys government <e> <s> the first thing that parents

children are of school age they should consult with the school and in any case with the medical authorities <e> <s> i should add that that is a personal contribution <e> <s> but i think it is sound

cent <e> <s> if the noble lord wishes to address himself to the wider implications of customs and excise policy that i am afraid is another question <e>", "<cs> my lords doctors who prescribe controlled drugs irresponsibly may be made subject to direction by the home secretary restricting their ability to prescribe such drugs <e> <s> the home secretary has issued recently three such directions <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i am not being of much help to my noble friend <e> <s> the important point is that childrens lives should not fall into two or three separate parts but that the people who are pastorally concerned with them should know the whole child which means close consultation between the parent and the teacher <e> <s> there is another area of activity but how that is pursued must be a matter for every family to resolve itself <e> <s> if however there is a drug abuse problem medical and other resources are available to parents <e> <s> i shall certainly give to my noble friend in correspondence closer directions as to these resources and if she cares to put down a question for written answer your lordships will be able to share the information with her

out of my speech to make it shorter and thanks to the stimulating nature of the contributions by your lordships most of this afternoon writing things back in to make it longer <e> <s> i only pray that as a result i have achieved a proper balance <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall of course take up with my right honourable and learned friends the proper nature of the christmas message to offenders this season <e> <s> i can tell my noble friend that already the police produce a list showing the registration number and the place and nature of the offence which is a sufficient guide to heads of missions who want to pursue the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords that will be as soon as the replating exercise is completed <e> <s> i understand that will take only a few weeks <e>", "<cs> my lords i stand by what i said <e> <s> where cars cause an obstruction they are removed <e> <s> i regret that at the moment i cannot put my finger on the number in question but i shall let the noble lord lord underhill have that information very shortly <e>", "<cs> yes my lords they do <e> <s> in the case of more serious offences under the road traffic acts representations are made <e> <s> i believe that i am right in saying that eight diplomats have subsequently left their posts as a result of such representations <e>", "<cs> my lords the difficulty of dealing with diplomatic cars is a matter i have already ventilated at great length and i believe that the noble lord will accept that we are doing quite a lot in that direction to get over that difficulty <e> <s> as to the frequent offender the police try to identify frequent offenders and when they find them they apply the necessary remedy <e> <s> but it is not an easy exercise although i dare say that the use of computers will make it easier <e> <s> regarding the arbitrariness of selection as it appears to the noble lord the clamping teams are directed into areas where their attentions are most needed <e> <s> the object of the exercise is to keep the traffic flowing in london when the streets are very congested <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the frustration of the noble lord and i am certain that other countries realise that this sort of conduct does not do anything to foster good international relations <e> <s> as to taking more draconian steps i think we should first see what the result of these steps may be <e>", "<cs> my lords the number of diplomatic plated vehicles which will be replated as a result of this exercise and which belong to administrative and technical staff of missions who are entitled to immunity by reason of their actions only will amount to <e>", "<cs> my lords the immunity of a diplomat with full immunity extends to him wherever he is <e> <s> the immunity to the other people concerned in this exercise extends to them wherever they are provided they are on the business which gives them the right to that immunity <e>", "<cs> my lords the list of the persistent offenders would not be visible to the noble lord but i will make inquiries as to whether one can be produced for the use of the police <e>", "<cs> no my lords he is not though the heads of mission of a number of countries do insist that he shall <e>", "<cs> my lords there are cars used by members of foreign and commonwealth missions entitled to diplomatic immunity <e> <s> a provisional total of fixed penalty notices were cancelled on grounds of diplomatic immunity in the first nine months of this year <e>", "<cs> my lords in my earlier substantive answer i told the house what steps we are taking <e> <s> i entirely share the noble lords sense of inappropriateness of this sort of conduct <e> <s> when a person who is entitled to immunity is alleged to have committed a criminal offence the police report the facts of the case to the home office and the home office then recommends to the foreign and commonwealth office such further action as is considered appropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords as to

members of british missions been clamped and on each occasion they paid the fine i am assured <e>", "<cs> my lords the differences between the vehicles mentioned in the noble lords supplementary question and those we are considering in the main question are so large that i do not think the question falls within the terms of reference <e>", "<cs> my lords because we uphold international law

signatories or non-signatories of the convention <e> <s> i will draw the noble lords concern and suggestion to the attention of my right honourable and learned friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is rather less than that but it is nonetheless a very significant reduction <e>", "<cs> my lords i recall the exchanges in this house quite clearly and i am aware of the exchanges in another place <e>

details of what we are now doing and the noble lords views on those will be welcome <e>", "<cs> my lords what makes a difference is money and activity <e> <s> we are launching the biggest prison improvement and building programmme of any government this century <e> <s> we are reducing the length of time it takes to create a new prison by up to months <e> <s> these factors will alleviate the conditions in prisons <e> <s> that does not mean that i do not think the standards are important or that the views of the noble lords should not be known as soon as they are available <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> every prison has a visitors complex and our experience with the old prisons gives us a clear indication of the mistakes to avoid in the new prisons <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot agree with the noble lords first two allegations <e> <s> i should like to reflect on what it is that he is implying <e> <s> i am not clear about that but the noble lord seems to be saying that the standards of provision we now have in view are lower than those we have had in the past and that is not so <e> <s> as to the temperature and other details they will be for discussion later when the standards are published <e> <s> as to the individual case mentioned by the noble lord it seemed to me sensible that as the prisoner in question had clothing available if he thought the cell was too cold he might have worn it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not in the business of making excuses <e> <s> i am acutely aware of what conditions are like in prisons because i visit a great many of them <e> <s> i do not need your lordships urging to realise that this is a serious important and in many cases a tragic position in which we find ourselves <e> <s> perhaps i ought to remind your lordships of the very large programme we have now initiated at a time of financial stringency when other departments are cutting back to rectify the situation in terms both of physical provision and of manpower <e> <s> anything i can do towards expedition i will do <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord mishcon for reminding me of his last supplementary question <e> <s> the material from which we have decided to draw the publication is voluminous and complex and will have to be reduced to manageable terms for the public <e> <s> i had the same reservations as the noble lord when i found that we could not publish as soon as i wished <e> <s> i can assure him that it will be done with the greatest despatch at my command <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to seem in any way discourteous or unfriendly to the noble lord but the question is about the state of progress towards publishing a code of standards for prisons <e> <s> the noble lord obviously has particular cases in mind <e> <s> i wonder if we could discuss this point at the same time <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i will take away the added sense of urgency the noble lord wishes to <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl <e> <s> lord longford asked her majestys government whether the parole system and the system for the release of life sentence prisoners on licence needs to be much improved <e> <s> he does so in the wake of

not wish to paint the noble earl in ungrateful colours <e> <s> i quickly own that what i was reading at that time was in my own handwriting <e> <s> i am glad that he accepts that it is a step forward

the noble lord does not strain my patience i hope that i do not strain his credulity <e> <s> i am seeking to make it abundantly clear that the british people regard the criminal law as their protection against the criminal and the punishment of criminals as the only way in which the law can be enforced <e> <s> we cannot proceed without the broad support of the british people <e> <s> therefore it is necessary to respond to that view <e> <s> the noble lord rightly exercises an educative role and very often i try to join him in this but the fact is that we must recognise public perceptions <e> <s> i think that the public see the nature of a crime as being in one hand and the sentence in the other of a not always blindfolded justice <e> <s> that is the scenario <e>", "<cs> my lords it sounds more like a statement to me than a question but the noble lord is right to put it on the record <e> <s> the new arrangements which my right honourable friend has announced will enable the board to concentrate on their primary role of advising on the risk without getting involved in considerations of retribution and deterrence which are the primary concern of the judiciary <e> <s> moreover every life sentence prisoner will in future know his position and how long he is likely to serve subject to the assessment of the risk in his case <e> <s> in future at an early date in each case the lord chief justice and the trial judge if he is available will be asked for a judicial view on the period of detention necessary to meet the requirements of retribution and deterrence <e>", "<cs> my lords subject to correction the judicial members of this review are looking at the crime and the need for deterrence not at the progress of the prisoner and the element of risk which is a matter for the parole board <e> <s> if i find i am wrong on that point i shall return to it <e> <s> i believe i am right <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl interjects that this is awful but he did ask for an element of impartial justice and it is the judiciary that is concerned with retribution it is the parole board that is concerned with mercy and progress <e> <s> in the light of the views of the judiciary my right honourable and learned friend has to fix a date for the first reference of a case to the local review committee and this arrangement will apply in every case without exception <e> <s> i apologise for speaking for so long but at the end of the day your lordships like answers to your questions <e> <s> i shall nevertheless have to write to some of your lordships with more promptitude than i have to the noble lord lord harris in the past <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to commit myself unwittingly to a commitment and i will return to this in a moment if the noble earl will forgive me <e> <s> the noble earl is talking about the review date not about the release date which he knows is inviolate <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble lord for the courtesy with which he puts his view <e> <s> it is contrary to ours <e> <s> what my right honourable and learned friend has done is to state the criteria he will be applying <e> <s> had he kept them to himself

that i look forward to seeing the report to which she refers <e> <s> i have not vet seen it <e> <s> in regard to the second part of the question the answer is no <e> <s> the power to make exemptions

the effectiveness of the police response to the heightened threat <e> <s> i think however that your lordships would wish to know that the commissioner is concerned that the need for the increased commitment of police to central london should not in any way diminish the resources available for policing greater london as a whole <e> <s> to allow for this training courses have been suspended

maintained at all times and in all places <e>", "<cs> my lords it is certainly a sad matter of note that the noble lord lord fitt has had such frequent occasion to make such observations as he has just made during the time he has been in your lordships house <e> <s> he has particular experience of this matter which we all respect <e> <s> as to the first point which the noble lord raised it is

receive an answer before i sit down i shall refer to it <e> <s> still on kindred subjects i revert to what the noble earl lord halsbury said on the obscene publications act <e> <s> i want to assure

more distant occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i am sure the house will share my grateful acknowledgement of that assurance <e> <s> i can now assure rather sooner than i expected the noble lord

not certain whether he is aware it would seem not that the whole subject is a transferred matter for the purposes of the northern ireland constitution act <e> <s> as such it would normally be dealt with by a northern ireland enactment <e> <s> northern ireland has its own legislation on the control of gambling <e> <s> i do not think that that has been taken into consideration in the drafting of this bill <e> <s> as it appears under clause that the act is intended to apply to northern ireland i should be less than helpful to my noble friend if i did not point this out <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to all noble lords who have spoken in this short debate <e> <s> i should like to deal briefly with the substantive points that have been raised <e> <s> the noble lord lord mishcon asked about finance and chivied me for being briefer than usual in terms which makes me feel that sometimes i speak perhaps at too great a length <e> <s> i take advantage of his invitation <e> <s> we

knows me well enough to understand why i say that <e> <s> i now have to deploy arguments which i shall repeat when after two brief interludes we come to the debate on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> there is a general argument about giving specific responsibilities to members of any body such as the authority in that one either inexorably increases the number of seats or one inexorably increases the number of hats worn by each person in a seat <e> <s> general experience suggests that often it is better to increase the number of hats rather than the size of the body <e> <s> we can argue about what is the optimum and maximum size and we have fallen into having as the maximum or is it <e> <s> following the helpful intervention of the noble lord lord aylestone <e> <s> therefore on that count

circumstances <e> <s> i shall reply to the noble lords riposte to the thrust made by the noble lord lord marsh in a moment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i should remind the noble lord that the broadcasting act

lord molloy on this matter <e> <s> very briefly since i think that the governments position ought to be on the record may i say that we feel as does my noble friend lady gardner of parkes that the

national representatives <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the words demand-led lack some of the force that i need to express my <e>", "<cs> i cannot hear the noble lord but i will sit down <e>", "<cs> the noble lord can now tell me why <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will allow me i am not adducing a general principle as to how we should run this country i am addressing myself to the matter on the marshalled list an amendment to the cable and broadcasting bill <e> <s> in that bill there is a system whereby we expect entertainment to be delivered to houses and other places and it will be delivered only at the cost and therefore at the invitation of the people who will be at the end of the cable <e> <s> if people do not want the cable to come through their door or their drainpipe it will not <e> <s> if enough of them do not want it to come through it will not start from the other end <e>", "<cs> if i appeared to dismiss it it was because of the enthusiasm with which i rose to the fly cast to me by the noble lord lord molloy <e> <s> i leap up to intervene before he casts another fly over me so that i do not mislead the noble lord again <e> <s> everything i say about entertainment and this being a demand-led service stands but i do not regard cable as being capable only of providing entertainment <e> <s> nor will the home secretary be concerned only with entertainment although entertainment is one of the special interests which the noble lord in this amendment seeks to have specifically represented on the authority <e> <s> my right honourable friend will indeed be concerned with the interests of the consumer in the broader sense to which the noble lord has referred and i hope the noble lord will accept my assurance on that <e> <s> i think we have gone on a long time about this and i personally want a decision <e>", "<cs> no i meant to refer to what was the first half of the amendment which was the last amendment which we have now discarded but

investment and the need for the business to be built up from scratch <e> <s> the cable television association argued very strongly then that that was insufficient and the government took their views carefully into account in reaching their own conclusions which were announced in another place on nd december and elaborated in the white paper of last april <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the noble lord lord mishcon for the length of his intervention <e> <s> i think that the answer to both my noble friend and the noble lord is that one does not need a licence until one undertakes a licensable

<s> it will be a matter for commercial judgment by the operator as to what point he should start the ball rolling and at what point the expenses of being licensed will be balanced by the revenue received from sending out programmes <e>", "<cs> i have stated what we intend shall happen <e> <s> of course noble lords are quite right to ask me to make sure that that is what will happen and to be familiar with the means by which it will happen <e> <s> i think that the anxiety of the noble lord lord mishcon will reduce itself to this will the authority be able to say that they will give a licence to company x when they are ready for it or in six months time and then start the licence running at that point <e> <s> in other words is that an undertaking that they can give <e> <s> as far as i am advised it is an undertaking that they can give <e> <s> therefore i see no difficulty there <e>", "<cs> what i cannot say is that i shall take my noble friends amendment away and look at it <e> <s> what i can take away and look at is the validation that i seek <e>", "<cs> my noble friend the duke of portland does not wish the cable authority to have an unfettered power to vary licences once they have been issued <e> <s> he suggests this might create unhelpful uncertainty for investors <e> <s> i think he will agree that there are a number of circumstances in which the authority may perfectly properly wish to vary licences <e> <s> in some cases the authority may wish to impose greater restrictions on licensees but equally in others it may wish to respond to a request from the licensee to relax those restrictions <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord mishcon for his intervention <e> <s> it was not my intention to suggest that the only variations that might be proposed by the authority would inevitably be helpful <e> <s> i am not only a member of the government i am also a member of the public and my experience is similar to that of my noble friend in this matter <e>", "<cs> that is an interesting proposition but we are faced with exactly the dilemma we were faced with earlier in the example that the noble lord has given us <e> <s> in spite of the fact that my noble friend lord peyton takes a somewhat pessimistic view of the likely operation of the individuals on the authority once they have become an authority it may well be that a successful franchise company may go to the authority and say we should like to extend our franchise from leicester to wigston magna for instance <e> <s> if they were to do that and the noble lord had the bill restricted as he has suggested they would not be at liberty to do it so i think we need to think this through a little further when amendments are put forward <e>", "<cs> i freely withdraw any unintended imputation to my noble friend for overstating his views on the nature of authorities <e> <s> i am afraid i tend sometimes to look for colour in my speech by over-emphasis <e> <s> i would not wish to associate him in that misdirection and i quite accept that he was not impugning any class of people or any individuals <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for his explanation of his amendment <e> <s> unlike my noble friend lord de la warr he did not declare an interest though in view of the fact that he lives on the isle of wight i slightly felt he might have done <e> <s> i appreciate the feeling behind this amendment the general object of which is to protect those to whom the cable authority issue licences from being called upon to pay more for them than is reasonable <e>", "<cs> i am not certain of the intention in the phrase <e>", "<cs> may i try to deal <e>", "<cs> in the light of that moving appeal i feel embarrassed to cavil yet further <e> <s> the noble lord lord marsh has raised an issue and the noble lord lord mishcon has as it were raised the reverse of the issue <e> <s> the noble lord lord marsh said that the cable authority ought to be under some inducement to conduct its affairs economically and efficiently <e> <s> the noble lord lord mishcon said that licensees have a right to expect that they shall not be submitted to unnecessary charges even if they fall within the terms of the act <e>", "<cs> i wish i had the advantage which my noble friend has of many years of service in another <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord mishcon for bringing forward this issue <e> <s> at present there is nothing in the bill to stop the cable authority from doing what he wants <e> <s> the present drafting of the bill is similar in this respect to the obligations placed on the iba by the broadcasting act <e> <s> the practice of the iba is to make available to the public copies of applications for itv and ilr contracts <e> <s> applicants are allowed to indicate if there are particular pieces of information which are confidential <e> <s> however the government are prepared to accept the noble lords argument for some strengthening of the cable authoritys obligation on this point <e>", "<cs> the amendment moved by my noble friend lord glanusk would have the effect that companies licensed to provide prescribed diffusion services could normally expect to have their licence renewed unless they had fallen short in some specific way whether in respect of the licence conditions relating to the general quality of the programmes or in respect of the terms on which the service is provided to the subscriber <e> <s> it is to the general principles of the renewability of licences that we should turn our attention rather than to the phrasing which my noble friend adopts in suggesting that we should do this in a different way <e>", "<cs> i am very much obliged for the support from the noble lord lord mishcon and i only hope that it has not rendered my noble friends more suspicious of my advice than they otherwise would have been <e> <s> may i say this to them <e> <s> my noble friend lord glanusk movingly pointed out the difficulties and risks which beset the original applicants for the original licence <e> <s> we have already reflected this in the bill by the granting of a licence initially for years and subsequently as my noble friend lord de la warr rightly reminds us for eight years <e> <s> therefore the initial risk has been taken account of and there is the further consideration that the clock will not run until the programmes go out which we discussed on an earlier amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i can explain what i believe the paragraph means <e> <s> ever since the report of the inquiry chaired by the noble lord lord hunt of tanworth it has been recognised that each local operator is likely to have the monopoly of the supply of cable programme services in his area at least for the foreseeable future <e> <s> against that background it is important that the cable authority should be in a position to see that its licensees use that privilege in a way that is in the best interests of consumers <e> <s> one particular consideration which in the governments view needs to be borne in mind is that operators might be tempted to acquire a disproportionate amount of programming from sister companies of theirs within the same group <e> <s> a situation could arise therefore in which the local operator unreasonably restricted the range of programme sources from which the local blend of services was constituted <e> <s> in other words he might use his monopoly position to the detriment of the consumer who would be denied access to a wider range of programming simply because of the corporate links of the licensees <e>", "<cs> it does not matter which side of a coin you look at you still know what it is worth <e>", "<cs> none of us wants to spend too long on this matter this evening <e> <s> what worries me is that although invited to do so my noble friends will not rely on the provisions of clause which i thought that they might say render the proposal superfluous <e> <s> that means that they intend to do dire and terrible things to subsection in clause <e> <s> but that is merely a straw in the wind <e>", "<cs> the idea did not seem to work but i am grateful to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i understand that the noble lord the deputy chairman is referring to a manuscript amendment which i have not seen but which i have heard referred to but that we

going to be pursued <e> <s> if i may i intend to speak to all the amendments including presumably amendments nos <e> <s> a <e> <s> b c d and e and i hope therefore to expedite matters because i regret to say there is quite a lot that i have to say though i shall try to compress it <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that the noble lord expects rather a lot of the dinner hour <e> <s> i hope that my reply will be rather like the way in which the noble lord described the committee attenuated but of high quality <e> <s> i am first opposed to the list before us because i think lists are dangerous things and we already have as much of a list in clause as we want <e> <s> my second and more particular response is to the technological arguments which the noble lord lord mishcon so persuasively put forward <e> <s> under clause the authority is bound already to push forward cable and although it is not responsible for cabling as it has been described it is responsible for seeing that the opportunity to be cabled arises as quickly as it can <e> <s> that is one of its statutory functions <e> <s> therefore it is already going to consider that matter although we do not propose to list it in clause <e>", "<cs> indeed and that is why we have clause which demands that the authority shall indeed <e>", "<cs> it is widely recognised that the provision of cable services will constitute a local monopoly at <e>", "<cs> my noble friends have drawn together a formidable and very distinguished alliance if i may use that term without causing confusion in support of what is obviously an idea of very great

think is appropriate i suppose they would favour this definition and if they conduct themselves with cruelty and inhumanity perhaps they would not <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord would be kind enough to tell me not in the exact terms but in the length that one would expect in a subsection what precisely he means <e> <s> he will find it extremely difficult <e> <s> i have not hit on a way to do it <e>", "<cs> i apologise for intervening again <e> <s> i mean that i cannot do it in conversational language <e> <s> i am not addressing myself to the difficulty of drafting language <e> <s> i

view but one which is quite different <e> <s> i do not doubt that the noble baroness lady carnegy of lour is similarly keen on different things <e> <s> somehow we have to find a criterion which fits all the views <e> <s> until that is done i cannot offer an amendment <e> <s> that has to be done first <e>", "<cs> perhaps for the sake of elucidation i may ask my noble friends whether by activities of local social interest or the other way round as the noble lord put it they mean local community activities that is activities which are going on in the local community <e> <s> that is not the idea that i had <e> <s> i thought that what were in mind were matters to do with age concern the handicapped and so forth which are quite different from matters to do with the local rugby club and the migration of the neighbourhood flora and fauna <e>", "<cs> i cannot be quite as brief as that i fear <e> <s> the noble lord lord mishcon is eloquent in the cause of the consumer <e> <s> it is a cause in which we all sympathise with him <e> <s> i should like to pause however to consider whether the means that he proposes for advancing that cause are entirely appropriate to our case <e> <s> clause which immediately precedes the new clause deals with the testing of applicants for licensing to see if they are fit to receive licences <e> <s> that clause lists five matters to which the cable authority must give particular attention before it grants a licence and i will not rehearse them <e> <s> the amendment as drafted takes those matters for consideration and says that it is not enough only to consider them <e> <s> considering them will only sort out the good applicants from the bad <e> <s> i suspect that it means some form of comparison and choice of the best or in some circumstances no doubt the choice of the least bad <e>", "<cs> i shall look forward to hearing what the noble lord has to say if he returns to this matter at the next stage <e> <s> i rose to my feet in self-defence to say that i did avoid the words mandatorily hypothecated <e> <s> if the noble lord in a speech after the one which used the word pilpulistic calls me a noble and learned lord he must be the lord chief justice <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that the amendment would have the effect that the noble lord wishes but the noble lady has picked up an anxiety voiced at the second reading stage by the noble lord lord howard of henderskelfe <e> <s> i think therefore that i ought to explain that the duties on the authority in the bill can in fact be divided into two types <e> <s> the first is where the objective is one which is clearly within the direct power of the authority to achieve <e> <s> in these cases the duty on the authority is absolute already <e> <s> for example clause says that the authority shall draw up a code governing standards and practice in advertising <e>", "<cs> both my noble friends and i accept that the authority needs to have the power to intervene in circumstances where the public interest may be at stake even though one of the bodies listed in subsections and of clause has not actually acquired overall control of the cable company <e> <s> where we differ is on the best way of formulating that power <e> <s> my noble friends view is that the bill goes too wide i hope i shall be able to persuade them otherwise <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord hale shares his concern about the increase in violent crime with many others and he will be familiar with the very vigorous steps which my right honourable friend has taken to combat that rise <e> <s> he will also be aware of the increasing numbers and efficiency of the police forces <e> <s> we believe that the security of both the citizen and his property properly rests with our police force which is not normally armed <e> <s> where there are private security forces we do not believe that they should be entrusted with weapons <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is very kind to give way <e> <s> he is raising a number of points at some length <e> <s> it is easier to deal with them one by one rather than to have a collection of points put to me at length <e> <s> i cannot say that i recollect the occasion to which the noble lord refers because it was the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor who answered the question <e> <s> he was good enough to do so because i could not be here <e> <s> i have however read the account in the record and can vouch for everything that my noble and learned friend said <e> <s> i have the figures before me <e> <s> they were rounded down which makes them less ambitious than the noble lord is seeming to infer <e> <s> they relate exactly to the figures i have given which were adjusted as the noble lord asked me to adjust them <e>", "<cs> my lords it is in the best tradition of this house which my noble and learned friend impeccably followed to answer questions according to the terms in which they are asked <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure how i can relate that question to the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i genuinely regret that i do not have the figures at my fingertips but i shall write to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that if i were to have the full range of information in such detail in my hands it would scarcely be portable but again i shall write to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that magistrates who give voluntarily of their time are an invaluable feature of the british judicial system <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer if i may be brief is yes <e>", "<cs> my lords with the whole of the first part of the noble lords question i entirely agree <e> <s> as to the resources devoted to the discharge of their functions i believe they are adequate and as both my noble and learned friend and i have sought to say they are also increasing <e>", "<cs> my lords such information as is available does not suggest that there has been any increase in recent years in the frequency with which serious fires occur in these and similar premises <e> <s> no information is available as to whether the premises are insured against fire or accident <e>", "<cs> my lords i will be in a better position to reassure the noble lord when i come to answer his next question <e> <s> i can tell him at this stage that we believe that the process of inspection is proceeding apace <e> <s> in fact about per cent <e> <s> of the premises to which the noble lord is referring have already been inspected <e>", "<cs> my lords the inspection and certification of hotels and boarding houses under the fire precautions act is carried out in inner london by the architects department of the greater london council and in outer london by the london fire brigade <e> <s> i understand that as at st december out of a total of premises known to those bodies had been fully inspected and issued with a fire certificate had been inspected and issued with a notice of steps to be taken before a fire certificate would be issued and remained to be dealt with <e>", "<cs> my lords her majestys government always have the fire precautions at prisons very much in mind particularly in the light of recent experience <e>", "<cs> my lords the change in our proposals for the government of london will bring very little change to these arrangements <e> <s> the only substantive change will be that the london fire brigade will probably take on responsibility for the certification of hotels throughout the whole of the greater london area instead of for just outer london as at present but that should not slow down the progress of certification <e>", "<cs> my lords i have noticed the noble lords optimism always particularly in regard to what might be on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords it is intended that the fire authority for london shall be a joint board drawn from the constituent borough councils <e> <s> they will have exactly the same <e>", "<cs> if my noble friend will forgive an interruption to an interruption the noble lord lord jenkins of putney has reverted to ground we covered at the last committee stage when debating amendments in the name of the noble lady lady saltoun <e> <s> i believe it was accepted by the committee that the words used are the strongest applicable and have at least as much force as those applying to the other authorities <e>", "<cs> the noble lords who have put their names to these amendments combine a formidable weight of experience and authority and they advance a principle which i personally espouse myself getting as much british material over the cable and as good a quality as we can <e> <s> i am somewhat in awe of present company <e> <s> the noble lord lord hill of luton in particular stands out in my memory as a familiar <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i sometimes wrap my meaning in something of a cloak i fear <e> <s> i was saying that i thought we could look at words but not at principles <e> <s> it seems to me that the government have got the principle right <e> <s> whether we should be saying proper or maximum although i doubt very much whether it should be maximum is another matter <e> <s> there might be some other phrases which i do not have at my fingertips <e> <s> there might be an adjustment in that but i do not think that we can place an absolute duty to arrive at a precise figure for reasons which have been so ably expounded that i do not intend to repeat them <e>", "<cs> on the other hand it is the licensing authority and therefore the final authority <e>", "<cs> i do not think the hypothesis is right or that the consequences suggested by the noble lord will flow from it and i am glad to see the noble lord lord marsh shaking his head in time with my remarks <e>", "<cs> when it comes to blandishments there is no one who quite equals the noble lord lord mishcon and i readily cede the crown to him <e> <s> none the less with even greater reluctance than the noble lord lord hill of luton i am not going to give him <e>", "<cs> i am going to be left in suspense as to what the right reverend prelate is going to say <e> <s> this means i feel rather like napoleon with marshal bluchers cavalry lurking behind the hill in unknown strength <e> <s> in the early days of independent television the whole question of quiz programmes generated quite a lot of hostility including hostility from the late lord pilkington <e> <s> his committee began by saying and i shall read only a couple of sentences from my extract <e>", "<cs> the noble lords conclusion and he never lacks confidence as appears from the marshalled list is that the cable authority should be treated as if it were a public service broadcasting authority <e> <s> the drafting of his amendment is based i believe he has said closely on that of section and of the broadcasting act <e> <s> those subsections set out the duties of the iba as regards prizes and gifts whereas the amendment seeks to impose the same duties on the cable authority <e> <s> the cable authority is to be treated in other words as though it were just another public service broadcasting authority with all the obligations and responsibilities which that status implies <e>", "<cs> my noble friend has drawn our attention to the fact that out of the many bodies concerned with advertising and standards of advertisements clause singles out the iba <e> <s> under that clause the cable authority will have a statutory duty of consulting the iba before they draw up or review their advertising code but as my noble friend lord glanusk has pointed out it specifies them and nobody else <e> <s> perhaps i might mention to your lordships that this duty of consultation is by virtue of paragraph of schedule matched by a parallel duty for the iba to consult the cable authority so that in future when it proposes to amend its own code it will have to talk to the cable authority <e> <s> so the first thing i wish to say is that this is a reciprocal duty and not a duty imposed upon one party only <e>", "<cs> what matters is that where there is one television screen in one sitting room and pictures may arrive on it either over the air from the broadcasting authorities or over cable from cable programme companies we should not have a markedly different set of rules for one as against the other <e> <s> otherwise as the right reverend prelate pointed out interests may prevail which would lead to the advertisements put over by for instance cable being more salacious or more improper than those put over the air by the broadcasting authorities <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mishcon accused my noble friend lord mottistone of seduction and my noble friend lord de la warr now casts very grave doubts on the parentage of parts of the bill <e> <s> this is becoming a thoroughly improper exchange <e> <s> but i wonder whether my noble friend accepts my proposition that where there is one screen in one room with pictures coming from sources governed by two different authorities it would be totally absurd if they were to be regulated on different moral principles <e> <s> the commercial principles are of course important to the balance sheet and the moral principles are important to the viewers and between us we have to get both right <e>", "<cs> this is not eloquence this is just trying to be helpful <e> <s> what i have done is put on the record very definitely that there is no question that the government are granting a status of <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> i must refute that otherwise it will remain on the record <e> <s> the consultation is free and it is open to both parties to move to a common position <e> <s> there is nothing in the bill in the white paper or in the mind of the government to say that it is the cable authority which should move to the ibas position and that is plainly the intention of the language in the bill <e>", "<cs> i may find myself responding to this amendment at slightly greater length than i had intended <e> <s> the report of the inquiry chaired by the noble lord lord hunt of tanworth recommended against setting down defined limits on the amount of cable advertising at the outset but stressed the need for a flexible approach <e> <s> it suggested that this was an area where after some years of experience it could become necessary to impose restrictions <e> <s> the itv and ilr companies argued strongly however that while they accepted that cable would break their present monopoly over the sale of television and radio advertising time it would be inequitable if they were restricted as to the number of minutes per hour which they could sell while cable channels which could be offering a very similar range of programmes were unrestricted <e> <s> the iba endorsed the view of the companies <e>", "<cs> we accept that cable could create opportunities for developments in forms of advertising which although not appropriate within the framework of independent broadcasting where there are as yet only two television channels are entirely acceptable in themselves <e> <s> i think that that is what my noble friend lord de la warr has in mind <e> <s> shopping magazines recruitment advertising and sponsored programmes are all possibilities which we do not wish to rule out <e> <s> certainly there must be safeguards but the effect of this amendment would be to make it very difficult for any of these developments to happen at all <e> <s> if it is a probing amendment i apologise for resisting it on those grounds <e> <s> but it would be contrary to the flexible approach which was recommended by the inquiry chaired by the noble lord lord hunt of tanworth and which has been endorsed by the government <e>", "<cs> i shall try to be as brief as was the noble lord but the matter is not quite so simple as that <e> <s> advertising time on cable is likely to be sold in a variety of ways and it is i think a mistake to try as i fancy may be the intention behind the amendment to draw too close a parallel with independent broadcasting in this respect <e> <s> the existing itv companies have a local monopoly of selling advertising time <e> <s> with cable though there may be only one operator there may be many channels carrying advertising and in each case the advertising <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord will allow me to intervene <e> <s> i think i detect that he is most helpfully and courteously about to withdraw his amendment and perhaps he will allow me to say that it may be that i did not quite clearly enough direct his attention to the difficulty <e> <s> it seems to me that the difficulty is not merely in regard to not comparing like with like <e> <s> the noble lord seeks to impose a requirement that something shall happen between second and third parties over which the authority has no control <e> <s> if there is a requirement that rate cards shall be shown in a particular form or should be up to a particular standard or whatever that will bear upon a whole variety of people over many of whom the authority will not have jurisdiction <e> <s> of course i shall look extremely carefully at what the noble lord has said as no doubt he will look at what i have said and thus we can both perhaps withdraw from our present positions <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord howard of henderskelfe has proposed a rewriting of clause in the hope that it would meet some of the concerns of the broadcasters about the effectiveness of the must carry rule among other things <e> <s> i must start by emphasising that the government also attach great importance to that rule <e> <s> both the hunt report and the white paper saw it as an important safeguard for our system of public service broadcasting <e> <s> everyone who is on cable should have access to the same range of services which anyone can currently receive with an individual aerial <e> <s> in addition we believe that once dbs begins cable should be required to make that service available to those of its customers who wish to take it <e>", "<cs> if i may counsel there i think i detected that the noble lord lord howard was hesitating on the brink of withdrawal <e> <s> if i am wrong the noble lord will of course have to leap into action but i hope he was deciding prematurely <e>", "<cs> i am sure that my noble friend is aware that the welsh are british <e> <s> they would be very offended if he were to suggest otherwise <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord give way for a second <e> <s> may i ask him whether it would be as well to discuss together with amendment no <e> <s> his amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> they seem to hang together <e>", "<cs> i think the numbers are and then we leap ahead to and but i can always remind the noble lord when we get there <e> <s> the noble lord moves only one amendment and speaks to the remainder <e>", "<cs> your lordships have already heard much concern about the must carry rule and the burden it might impose on services <e> <s> these amendments would significantly widen the potential scope of the must carry rule <e> <s> the present structure of clause presupposes that everything broadcast over the bbc and iba terrestrial networks is freely available off air and should therefore be relayed over cable without any financial transaction between the broadcaster and the cable operator <e> <s> in the case of dbs we accept that whether or not the service is offered on a pay basis cable operators should be able to negotiate financial terms with the broadcaster <e>", "<cs> i will be brief but i feel there is an obligation on ministers when noble lords putting amendments are very brief not to curtail their remarks beyond the point which the noble lords who have made the curtailment would wish to hear expressed <e> <s> when dbs starts there can be no guarantee that the negotiations between the parties would necessarily result in an agreement and the government therefore had to provide in the bill for a means of bringing the matter to a conclusion so that the must carry rule can apply <e> <s> we must remember that by the nature of the must carry rule neither party has the right to refuse to co-operate with the other <e> <s> the cable operator must consent to include the dbs service in his package of services and the broadcaster must agree for his service to be carried over cable <e>", "<cs> i can first undertake to have the drafting very carefully tested i suspect that the noble lord lord mishcon is right <e> <s> if there is doubt then on first blush anyway it is not satisfactory and we will certainly look at that point <e>", "<cs> i committed the forgivable sin of leaving out half a dozen words which i should have said <e> <s> the noble lord is right <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord howard of henderskelfe has brought us to the beginning of a series of amendments which address themselves to an issue of very great importance and very general interest <e> <s> i think that i must follow him by giving a brief introductory background as he did to what we have attempted to achieve in clause <e>", "<cs> indeed not <e> <s> the noble lord spoke to amendment no <e> <s> and said he would come to others later <e> <s> i have strayed i think into amendment no <e> <s> and possibly nudged amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> but these are all on the same issue <e> <s> it is the meat of amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i am not seeking to inhibit the noble lord <e>", "<cs> the broadcasting authorities have a long-standing agreement among themselves not to acquire exclusive rights for the great national events <e> <s> so once one has access to one event in practice both do <e> <s> that is why we prefered the singular to the plural but if there is a danger in this i will certainy look at it between now and report <e> <s> that goes also for the other danger to which the noble lord drew our attention <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord airedale is absolutely right there are other considerations which can be as important as the financial considerations <e> <s> the danger of elaborating any of the terms is that as we highlight one we put the others slightly into shadow <e> <s> i can assure the noble lord that the bill as drafted does cover all the considerations <e>", "<cs> i regret to say that the noble lord has advanced his amendment in terms of art rather than science <e> <s> if i am to reply in the same terms all i can say is that the tense which jars on his ear chimes correctly on mine <e> <s> i think that as it is not a matter of great substance in the bill but is a matter of great interest to the noble lord and myself rather than delve into this at greater length if the noble lord is content we might correspond or even talk about it at a later time <e>", "<cs> may i begin by briefly saying why clause is in the bill <e> <s> it is our expectation that pay-per-view by focusing the cash of viewers on specific events will give it considerable buying power <e> <s> the extent of the buying power will depend largely on the level of public interest in the event and nobody will doubt that public interest in many events has been generated very largely indeed by their having been regularly featured on conventional tv <e> <s> the more successful those programmes and the bigger their audiences the greater their potential value to pay-per-view <e>", "<cs> my noble friends first object is to narrow down what he sees as the rather wide category of events currently covered by clause <e> <s> the restriction would apply only to sporting or other events of national interest which had been regularly broadcast <e> <s> in support of this it has been suggested that an event of a class or description which has been regularly broadcast by a broadcasting authority could go very wide and include virtually all forms of popular sport at all levels <e> <s> here he followed the noble lord lord airedale <e> <s> that would be to give the words a rather wider construction certainly than we intend <e> <s> we obviously need to build some flexibility into the clause so that the authority has the power to specify a category of events rather than having to name each single time place and event <e> <s> to take an hypothetical example the authority might wish to say all rugby union international matches played in the united kingdom <e> <s> that would be a reasonable interpretation of the phrase class or description of events which has regularly been broadcast <e> <s> i very much

provision that broadcasters agreed not to compete for the rights to certain major events such as the derby and test matches <e>", "<cs> that was the point i was pursuing <e> <s> the purpose of the -hour delay is simply to prevent transmission of events live <e> <s> sporting events are rather like those flat slabs of bread one buys in morocco they are delicious for the first hours and after that they turn to cement <e> <s> the purpose of having the delay is simply to ensure that the really fresh article is not brought in as unfair competition <e>", "<cs> i believe my noble friends behind me will bear out that stale bread is not something that will win many customers and i do not consider that the noble lords fears are justified <e>", "<cs> i am much obliged to the noble lord for this amendment <e> <s> i cannot begin to think of a reason why we should protect the fa cup final south of the border and not the scottish cup-final north of it <e> <s> if that is indeed the effect of this provision or if it in any way offends against proper national sentiment we shall of course seek to amend it <e>", "<cs> i understand that the amendment as it stands would not do but i shall be happy to advise the noble lord of terms in which he can move it at a later stage when i shall be happy to accept it <e>", "<cs> while we have followed the pattern set for broadcasting in proposing a formal complaints system for cable we have placed the duty to consider complaints not on the existing broadcasting complaints commission but on the cable authority and that is the complaint of the noble lord lord howard of henderskelfe <e> <s> the noble lord suggested that it would be appropriate for the commission to be responsible for considering complaints and said that it would ensure consistency of treatment if the same body were to deal with complaints about cable as well as complaints about radio and television programmes <e> <s> i accept that there is some force in those arguments but i believe that there is rather more in the case for the choice of the cable authority to do the job <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the gratitude of both noble lords who have spoken to this motion and particularly to the noble lord lord kilmarnock in that he did not follow his honourable friend in another place by dilating at great length on the virtues of one form of election and another <e> <s> he quite properly deferred it to another occasion when i shall be happy to join issue with him on it <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret that i am not exactly seized of the noble lords

recommended changes in december and there is no problem about them but that the english commissioners recommended changes on the th of this month <e>", "<cs> my lords the level of fines is of course entirely a matter for the courts <e> <s> information available to the police does not record whether people who have been convicted more than once have received a higher penalty for the second offence

court <e>", "<cs> my lords we have an honourable and free society and in it people are free to demonstrate honourably they are not free to break the law or to cause criminal damage <e> <s> in saying that i can find no similarity with the overtones of tyrants thoughout history <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that my noble friend is right but speaking on behalf of her majestys <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed it could not be measured even in millions of pounds and that is why we take such a careful and disapproving view of those who nibble at the edge of such rights by using the right to demonstrate freely to commit illegal irresponsible and damaging acts <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed the courts are empowered to require compensation to be paid by those committing damage and the magistrates courts can do so up to a level of <e>", "<cs> my lords i and the government have the greatest confidence in the magistracy of this country and while i do not doubt that the comments of my noble friend and others will be of interest i repeat it is not for the government to tell the magistrates how to discharge their functions <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe i am right in saying that most of them have been paid but that some of them have not and where they have not been paid there has subsequently been custodial treatment of the offender <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that my answers do not discriminate between men and women <e>", "<cs> i entirely accept what the noble lord lord howard of henderskelfe has said <e> <s> the cable authoritys powers to give directions should not extend to programmes and advertisements included in licensed services by way of the simultaneous relay of the broadcast services <e> <s> it would clearly be wrong for the authority to have any say over the broadcast services when they are relayed by cable <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord for drawing attention to the possibility that clause as drafted might be read as giving the authority some jurisdiction over these services <e> <s> the wording in his own amendment may not quite do the trick but if he would agree to withdraw it i can happily undertake to have an appropriate amendment ready for report stage <e> <s> how lucky that we broke at this stage on the last day so that we could start in this tone this day <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has mentioned cigarette advertising and as he pointed out the advertising of cigarettes and cigarette tobacco is ruled out by the ibas advertising code <e> <s> the ban originated with a direction made by the postmaster general in <e> <s> the provisions in clause of this bill mirror very closely those in section of the broadcasting act and the cable authority must consult the home secretary about types of advertisement and methods of advertising to be excluded from licensed services <e> <s> the authority must give effect to his directions either by making appropriate provisions in its advertising code or if necessary by making directions of its own under clause <e> <s> i can give the committee an assurance which i think is what the noble lord wants that the government have no intention of permitting cigarette advertising on licensed services and will be prepared to use his powers of direction to secure that <e> <s> if in the future it becomes necessary for further categories of advertising to be precluded or in some way restricted i can assure the noble lord that if my right honourable and learned friend were considering making directions to the iba i have no doubt that we would wish to consider carefully whether to make similar directions to the cable authority <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for his explanation of his first amendment to this clause and hope that he will bear with me if in some of my remarks i allude to the subsequent amendments <e> <s> his first amendment would mean that the cable authority could require a licensee to keep recordings only if it had reasonable grounds to believe that the condition of the licence had been broken <e> <s> if it had no such grounds there could be no such requirement <e>", "<cs> i think this may be helpful <e> <s> two weeks does not we

mottistone asking me to table amendments early <e> <s> may i ask all members of your lordships committee to comply with that admirable advice <e> <s> i shall certainly do my best <e>", "<cs> i think i can confidently agree with the noble lords interpretation <e> <s> the intention of clause is to give the authority a power to give a direction to take the recordings if necessary <e> <s> the intention of subsection is to require the provision of copies of material to them in one form or another to verify or otherwise their suspicion that an offence has been committed <e> <s> there is no question of their building up a free library as it were of scripts for the delectation of the members it is merely in pursuit of their supervisory role that the power is in the bill <e>", "<cs> clause means exactly what it says if the authority are satisfied at any time <e>", "<cs> the government accept that the question of transmission standards is an important one particularly in relation to the relay of dbs services over cable and that is the noble lords concern together with the question of compatibility <e> <s> the technical standards by which programme services are transmitted relate to the running of a cable system and not to the content of a programme service <e> <s> it would not therefore be appropriate for this power to be included in this bill because this bill is not concerned with the running of systems <e>", "<cs> may i add to what i said before <e> <s> the power to issue telecommunications licences and thus to specify transmission standards resides with the secretary of state <e> <s> oftel can be delegated the power to issue telecommunications licences but there is no question of oftel being in a position to take a different view from that of the secretary of state <e> <s> if therefore i heard overtones of mistrust in what the noble lord said about oftel which did not reach as far as the secretary of state or his part of the government i hope that this will help him to be a little more reassured when he looks at this between now and report <e>", "<cs> i beg formally to move amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord is moving efficiently on to a winding-up

i will and that may be some reassurance to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down may i say that an offending cable operator will not be dealing with an unknown future <e> <s> he will if the order is revoked be dealing with bankruptcy <e> <s> it is therefore to be expected that he will do everything within his power to fulfil the conditions of the licence <e> <s> i cannot conceive that he will start putting out defamatory or indecent programmes secure in the knowledge that the authority will wish to keep something going into peoples living rooms until somebody else can put something preferable in its place <e>", "<cs> i resumed my seat rather early but i have not dealt with fines <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord wishes me to say a word to the committee about fines <e> <s> my noble friends have not heard it nor indeed has he <e> <s> the noble lords second amendment would enable the authority to impose fines on licensees who breach the terms of their licences or who do not comply with the authoritys direction <e> <s> it does not seem to us to be appropriate to provide for a fine where a licensee falls foul of clause because the ultimate sanction of revocation is available in these cases <e> <s> against that background the authority will no doubt want and will be able to persuade the licensee to reorganise his affairs so that the ownership arrangements become acceptable <e> <s> but i suspect that this is not the noble lords principal intention and it is with that intention that we are principally concerned <e>", "<cs> your lordships will be aware

lordships who attend the debate will be aware in looking at the print when it comes to us at report of what has happened and will read the reprint of the bill with it in one hand and the marshalled list in the other so that the missing parts of the clause will be in everybodys mind and noble lords will know what is the intention of the government at the report stage <e> <s> that is all i wish to say except to thank your lordships for what i hope i can say is the good progress we are making with the bill <e>", "<cs> the cable authority will depend for its income on the fees which clause <e>",

to him <e> <s> but i can now tell him what will be the answer from my noble friend when he stands at this dispatch box <e> <s> he will say that it is not necessary because whenever there is a diffusion service to go out over cable oftel and the dti will have to be consulted by the cable authority <e> <s> so the cosultation is there already in this bill and it works both ways <e>", "<cs> whether we are dealing with typewriters or cruise missiles perhaps the phrase that i chose is not one that lends itself to brevity in debate <e>", "<cs> in his usual charming and courteous way the noble lord lord mishcon has made various charges <e> <s> if there was a lack of conviction it was not on my part but on his <e> <s> i am sorry to hear of it because i am quite convinced of what i am

wish to prejudice anything that my noble friend would want to say on another bill nor would i wish to elevate the request that the noble lord has made into a difficulty <e> <s> i will certainly ask my noble friend to add to his considerable preparatory labours by reading the exchanges which have occurred across this table <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord howard of henderskelfe is perfectly right in saying that the advent of cable television will create a whole new area of opportunities for dishonest and unacceptable behaviour <e> <s> those investing in these new developments will want to be sure

the limited purpose which he has given it of setting out the principle <e> <s> it is to the principle that we are addressing ourselves not to the drafting so i congratulate my noble friend on his lucidity <e> <s> he wishes first to introduce a legislative requirement for consultation between the two departments of state <e> <s> secondly he wishes to codify the procedures which have to be gone through before a decision is taken on the granting of a licence <e> <s> thirdly he wishes to make what is decided after that process and therefore the process itself justiciable on its merits <e>",

<e>", "<cs> under the common law by virtue of the rule which is usually referred to i understand as <e>", "<cs> perhaps i should begin by addressing myself to the letter written by the two right reverend prelates who are members of your lordships house and who sadly cannot he with us <e> <s> i think in fact that they were misguided in more than the reference number that they wrongly attributed to the paragraph in the bill <e> <s> their letter said that the clause now before your lordships is drawn so widely that anyone who had been involved in the liberation struggle anywhere at any time could well be held for detention for up to seven days <e> <s> it goes on to say that britain has a long history as a haven for refugees fleeing from their own countries where they may have suffered repression torture or murder <e> <s> this country has a long history of providing neutral territory for the peaceful resolution of conflicts through negotiations <e> <s> the letter goes on to say that if the bill had been in force at the time of the lancaster house conference the participants from zimbabwe would have found themselves liable to arbitrary detention <e>", "<cs> if the powers were unrestricted they could he used against any person committing an act of terrorism anywhere in the world <e> <s> there are differing opinions in this country and sometimes quite strong views as to the relative virtues or vices of those who pursue them <e> <s> there are organisations which use acts of violence in causes which are so respectable and so well regarded by members of parliament as well as by members of society at large that they would not wish a power at large to he used against those people <e> <s> so what we intend in this bill is to make those powers available only where a charge could be brought in the british courts <e>", "<cs> yes i believe it is <e> <s> if your lordships will bear with me for a moment perhaps i might readdress myself to the other point which i am not sure that i made clear earlier <e> <s> i am not at all clear on the matter of rape and i am sure that the noble lord following his long investigation of these matters knows much more about them than i do <e> <s> but i am advised that there are offences under the hijacking of aircraft act and the internationally protected persons act which might be tryable <e> <s> however what we wish to extend to them by means of this bill is the right to interrogate for an extended period of five days which is not otherwise available <e>", "<cs> if i gave the impression that i was justifying this by jellicoe <e> <s> i apologise because it goes beyond what jellicoe recommended <e> <s> i believe that the justification is entirely adequate <e> <s> it is that these are very nasty offences indeed that we are in treaty with numbers of other countries to make them offences under our law as much as they may be under the law of the country where they are perpetrated and that means that they can be brought before our courts <e> <s> if they are to be embraced in that system given that the crime may have been committed as the noble lord said in the arctic or even further away then it is not at all unreasonable to wish to be able to extend the period of investigtion and interrogation while the person is detained for the greater period provided in this bill than is provided in the existing act <e>", "<cs> i should not want to advise your lordships on that procedural point at this stage <e> <s> i think i should say that the government have responded to the concern expressed in your lordships house and elsewhere by my right honourable and learned friend giving an assurance that the guidance about the use of the powers will be issued to the police by means of a circular to chief officers <e> <s> that is the first point that i want to put on the record <e> <s> they will be advised that the powers in respect of international terrorism should be used only where there is some prospect that a charge will be made before a united kingdom court or that the person will be deported under the immigration act <e> <s> that is the second point that i want to put on the record <e>", "<cs> it looks to me like light at the end of the tunnel but others have been looking for it for so long that i cannot encourage the noble lord to think that it is likely to be successful <e> <s> however i shall look at the noble lords suggestion to see if it would be a way out of your lordships difficulty <e>", "<cs> if my answer is brief i hope that the noble lord lord mishcon will not think it disrespectful <e> <s> it is a serious point <e> <s> the first of these amendments would require the secretary of state to decide whether or not a persons arrest had been lawful before extending for a period or periods specified by him a persons detention beyond the initial hours <e> <s> i should say first that a decision by the secretary of state to extend the period of detention does not make lawful an arrest which was unlawful <e> <s> more to the point perhaps a decision on the lawfulness or otherwise of an arrest must rest with the courts <e> <s> it is to the courts that a person who feels himself to have been unlawfully arrested or detained should turn for redress but the decision as to whether it was lawful or not cannot rest with the secretary of state <e> <s> nor can he convert into lawful arrest what was before his action unlawful arrest <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the noble lord <e> <s> i find that as the evening wears on <e> <s> i need more and more frequently to be led by the hand through the thickets of argument <e> <s> it is certainly not the intention of the bill to create the suspicion that the secretary of state might render something lawful that had been unlawful <e> <s> i am advised that it does not <e> <s> however i shall read the noble lords illumination of his argument with care <e> <s> if i find that it does illuminate it obviously we shall between us have to find a remedy <e>", "<cs> i quite understand that noble lords opposite wish to ensure that where the government and through the government the police are granted powers of detention that go beyond those normally available they should only be used for the minimum period necessary <e> <s> that is a very proper concern and one which we share <e>", "<cs> the effects of this amendment can be fairly simply described and would dramatically reduce the level of security which present and proposed legislation offer to the peaceful citizens of this country <e> <s> the arrangements for the port controls are set out in the prevention of terrorism supplemental temporary provisions order which will be made by virtue of clause <e> <s> except for the detailed changes recommended by jellicoe this will be drafted in exactly the same terms as the existing order <e> <s> your lordships may find it useful to be reminded that that is printed in full as annex b to the jellicoe report <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble lord lord hylton will forgive me if i do not follow him outside the legislation we are looking at although i see that what he proposes has attractions for at least one other noble lord in the chamber <e> <s> the amendment seeks to achieve an increase in the means for parliamentary scrutiny of the working of this legislation <e> <s> it is also intended to have the effect which could well be beneficial of ensuring that our annual debates on the legislation should be better informed than they have been in the past <e> <s> my noble friend lord jellicoe addressed himself with some care to the question of parliaments need to consider from time to time whether changing circumstances had resulted in a need to change the terms of the legislation and drew attention in the same passage to the fact that the renewal debates tend to be held late at night and to be allotted only a short time <e> <s> i must say that the first of those prophecies is being more fully fulfilled this evening than i could have hoped <e> <s> the last on the other hand is not <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord withdraws his amendment may i say that i shall of course inform my right honourable friend not merely of the substance of what your lordships have said but also of the obvious way in which it has been received by your lordships committee <e> <s> i would not wish to commit the government to the form of review which your lordships have severally proposed <e>", "<cs> although this is a procedural point it is an important one because it touches on the degree of supervision which your lordships house can give to the operation of a piece of legislation that is intended to be temporary and renewable if necessary in part rather than as a whole <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that i shall attract a similar beam myself from my noble friend <e> <s> the first new sub-paragraph proposed in the amendment would introduce a requirement designed to apply to arrests under clause and to detainees under the supplemental order <e> <s> the noble lords are here concerned with issues of importance not only under the bill but generally and we feel they should be more generally applied than would be the case if they were simply inserted into this bill <e> <s> we have therefore addressed ourselves to this issue in the context of the police and criminal evidence bill which is part of our general legislation on such matters and i think your lordships will agree that the arrangements set out in the draft code of practice on the detention and treatment of suspects issued in conjunction with that bill will go most of the way towards meeting the spirit of this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the contents of the report which the noble lord has described in colourful language <e> <s> it recognises that drinking is a problem in many occupational groups and that it may be more of one among policemen than in some others <e> <s> it also recommends preventive medicine as being a better way of dealing with it than a heavy-handed use of discipline <e> <s> the commissioner has accepted the broad assessment made of this problem by the psi <e> <s> research is already in hand to consider the problems of stress in the force and this has been widened to consider the related problem of drinking <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend and the metropolitan commissioner of police are in constant consultation about the discharge of the functions of the metropolitan police for which my right honourable friend is the police authority <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that there is probably a proper position between that of the noble lord lord avebury and the noble lord lord shinwell <e> <s> to put it into perspective in a total of officers were dealt with for the three drink or drink-related offences under the discipline code <e> <s> there are over police officers altogether in the metropolitan police <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot say whether the consultations included particular attention to that particular part of the large and important report hut i shall of course draw the noble lords views to my right honourable friends attention <e>", "<cs> no my lords but is is encouraging the police officer to commit an offence <e>", "<cs> my lords the report by the policy studies institute has made it clear that there are special anxieties about drink problems in a number of professions and that the police service is one of them <e> <s> the institute has suggested how it should be dealt with <e> <s> perhaps at this point i should return to the noble lord lord mishcon because my right honourable friend as i recall stands behind the acceptance of the commissioner of the broad assessments made of this problem by the psi and as i said research is already in hand <e>", "<cs> my lords if it did i should make haste to ensure that the idea is attributed to the noble lord who has just suggested it <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought i had already made clear the answer to that question which is yes <e> <s> i have also made it clear that it is an offence for a uniformed officer to drink on duty without specific leave from his superior officer <e> <s> the same is true for those who work in plain clothes but quite obviously there are times when one cannot gain information from somebody in a pub while drinking orangeade <e>", "<cs> my lords that is perfectly clear and true and what i was seeking to make clear <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble baroness for the appropriateness of her metaphor <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not at all certain but i know that the penalty for failure to observe them is often catastrophic <e>", "<cs> my lords no i cannot agree with that <e> <s> in fact i think that the teacup is becoming rather crowded <e> <s> there is a problem it is not a major <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down because convention allows him to speak only once i should like to be absolutely certain that i have got his question right <e> <s> the protection with which the noble lord lord howard is concerned is the protection of copyright that is the protection of material travelling over a network <e> <s> when the noble lord says that investors would not want to invest in interactive systems which were not so protected i presume he means that items travelling over that system would not be protected by the copyright act <e> <s> that again leads me to wonder what sort of traffic he would expect where copyright could be seriously infringed on a one-to-one communication basis <e> <s> i am saying all this so that the noble lord may have a moment to put his thoughts in order as i know how valuable it is to have a moment to do so before returning to ones feet <e>", "<cs> my lords i do now fully understand why the noble lord lord howard regards us all as people who are going into the marshes to pick blackberries <e> <s> i hope that we emerge without getting either scratched or stuck <e> <s> in moving his amendment the noble lord seeks to amend the definition of cable programme service to include as well as sounds and <e>", "<cs> with pleasure my lords <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> this is merely a restricted service <e>", "<cs> my lords we spent a little time discussing this problem in committee <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend for bringing us back to it now by means of this amendment which is rather different from the one which we had before us last time <e> <s> it shows a good deal of imagination <e> <s> i am not sure that there is very much between my noble friend and myself on the objectives <e> <s> where we may differ is on the means necessary to achieve them <e> <s> i am entirely clear that this point is an important one for the cable companies <e> <s> on the last occasion when we discussed these matters there was some suggestion that the bill was not sufficiently clear on this matter as it stood <e> <s> perhaps i ought first to spell out how we believe that things will work under the bill as drafted <e>", "<cs> my lords we have just added to clause a new provision which will require the authority to give notice to any of its licensees and enable them to have a reasonable opportunity of making representations before making any licence variations <e> <s> i think the authority is the right recipient of the representations if i may say so to my noble friend lord hawke <e>", "<cs> my lords i see the temptation that the noble lord is putting before me to renege on what i have just said but in fact we have given so much and such protracted thought and consultation to the appropriate length of the licensing period that i think the issue really is the one that my noble friend has put before your lordships and that is where it affects an individual licensee and not where it affects the whole spectrum of licences <e> <s> i think that what he has proposed is quite acceptable and i am glad to accept it but not in the terms on the marshalled list <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always very unwise to commit yourself to one word in a piece of drafting before you have seen the rest of it <e>", "<cs> my lords when we were in committee we had a long discussion of the needs of the community and of the voluntary sector in relation to cable <e> <s> we were i think in general agreement about the principle but we had some difficulty in defining even in ordinary conversational language what was required <e> <s> since then i have been in correspondence <e>", "<cs> my lords more a cloth cap i think <e> <s> in committee i said that the government accepted the <e>", "<cs> my lords with your lordships leave we shall of course do everything possible to meet the noble lords wish <e> <s> it is not altogether unknown for amendments which arise on a bill and which are not got right at committee stage to be taken eventually in another place when we are the originating house on the bill <e> <s> i should like to assure the noble lord that we are doing everything we can to keep up with the work <e> <s> your lordships are so productive and imaginative in <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord ardwick has once again argued most eloquently in favour of this amendment which would place a duty upon the cable authority to draw up a code of minimum standards to apply to those matters covered by clause of the bill and has initiated thereby a fascinating debate on the merits of open meetings <e> <s> i think ones opinion of open meetings depends very much on what open meetings one has attended <e> <s> if they are planning meetings against which there is a desperate campaign they are of one nature if they are open house for broadcasting studios they are of another <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house because the noble lord opposite asked a question upon the answer to which his next move depends i am afraid that i cannot offer him much comfort because we are not dealing with public service broadcasting aiming at very high ideals originally enshrined by the late and noble lord lord reith we are aiming at something very different <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friends lord glanusk and lord de la warr for providing us with the opportunity of discussing further the provisions of clause and <e> <s> to summarise again the purpose of these provisions it is to guard against three main things first the possibility of undesirable religious or political influence over local cable companies second the over-concentration of editorial control in any one area and third anticompetitive practices in companies engaged in activities related to cable <e> <s> i think that my noble friends accept the first proposition <e> <s> as to the others we entirely accept that the itv and ilr companies local newspapers and other interests in the media and entertainment fields listed in clause may have a great deal to offer to cable <e> <s> we are not suggesting that their involvement is undesirable indeed in many cases their experience may make all the difference between a mediocre performance and a very good one <e> <s> equally there is a risk of undesirable practices emerging precisely because the interests of companies in those fields are so close to those of cable <e> <s> my noble friends third amendment throws the scope of clause completely open in that the authority could find themselves having to consider whether shares in a cable company owned by any company whatever might act against the public interest <e> <s> i do not think that we should impose on the authority a duty which <e>", "<cs> my lords in this house one of the great disadvantages of being a minister is that one answers for the government not for a department <e> <s> i am reluctant to advertise the fact because it gives the rest of your lordships so much fun at our expense but there it is <e>", "<cs> my lords at last <e> <s> i was listening for a note of discord and scarcely detected it <e> <s> may i say at the beginning that we hear so little from the noble countess lady saltoun <e>", "<cs> my lords i do apologise but how can one attribute the qualification only to the distinguished term lady <e> <s> what i had intended to say although i have rather spoiled the courteous polish with which i had intended to say it was that the noble lady speaks so little that any amendment which brings her to her feet on three successive occasions is not altogether a bad one <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we can work on the detail of this aspect <e> <s> i was about to say that we shall be tabling amendments to this bill at third reading in this house <e> <s> it may be that discussion of the details will proceed beyond that point but i believe we can reasonably expect to achieve that <e>", "<cs> my lords as a preliminary let me say that when i say british i means british and ec as the noble lord lord mishcon has done <e> <s> i should like to establish at the start that we want what all your lordships want that is the largest possible proportion of british input to cable services consistent with quality and consistent with not drawing a ring fence around us that keeps us ignorant of the best products in the rest of the world <e> <s> if we are agreed on that we have a large area of common ground <e> <s> your lordships have considered whether a fixed point or fixed points on a scale of percentages rising from the lesser to the greater could be used as our industry became more adept and experienced in producing high quality material <e> <s> the trouble with both is that they are inflexible <e> <s> you have to be either at the fixed point or at a specific point on the scale at any one time and nowhere else <e>", "<cs> my lords i must not to use lord mishcons phrase keep bobbing up but any suggestions will be gladly looked at <e> <s> my immediate instinctive and entirely untrained reaction is that proper might be very substantial and substantial might not be the right word <e> <s> i am perfectly happy to look at these things and to be advised <e> <s> all i can say is that i see and am advised that there are great dangers in what is now proposed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord aylestone for drawing our attention to a provision which was not i believe discussed at committee stage <e> <s> the noble lords amendment seeks to preserve the substance of what is now in the bill but to add two qualifications <e> <s> before i come to what he proposes it may be helpful if i briefly explain why we included clause <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord mishcon said we are returning here to a point which we discussed in committee when considering an identical amendment based on section and of the broadcasting act <e> <s> the noble lords argument then and now if i can summarise it fairly is that if parliament thought that it was right to impose these restrictions on independent broadcasting then it must also be right to do the same for cable otherwise there might not he fair and proper competition between the two media <e> <s> we accept that in a very limited number of cases it is desirable to impose certain restrictions on cable not because they are intrinsically necessary but in order to ensure fair treatment as between the broadcasters and the cable companies <e> <s> that is why we think that some limitation is needed though only in the case of certain channels on the amount of advertising that cable can take <e> <s> it is also part of the argument for restricting the use of pay per view <e>", "<cs> my lords having encouraged the noble lord to be confident to no purpose i only wish that i could encourage him to be contented <e> <s> but in fact the government do not draw up the code and it is not for me in this house to dictate what should be in it <e> <s> i am afraid that the noble lord asks me for something which i am not able to give him even after dinner when as he recognises i am usually in a benign mood <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to my noble friends for the courteous and patient way in which they have explained their amendment <e> <s> may i perhaps start by responding to my noble friend lord campbell of alloway <e> <s> how nice it is from time to time to hear a good letter acknowledged <e> <s> i am grateful to him for that <e> <s> his first question was about the nature and extent of the consultation envisaged before drawing up the advertising code <e> <s> we expect the authority to consult a number of bodies involved with standards in advertising before it draws up the code <e> <s> the reasons why clause singles out the iba and there is a matching duty on the iba to consult the cable authority on the ibas code in future by virtue of paragraph of schedule are first that we expect that the two codes will share a common core because <e>", "<cs> my lords my principal difficulty is that this is not the committee stage and i ought not to reply to my noble friend <e> <s> however with your lordships permission i shall endeavour to do so <e> <s> i am not certain that i have followed what is my noble friends concern <e> <s> we are now concerned with consultation <e> <s> my noble friend is talking about control is he not <e> <s> the amendment talks about consultation <e> <s> my noble friend adduced a particular concern because of a particular sort of advertisement <e> <s> it is the sort of advertisement that does not appear on television <e> <s> my noble friend does not give me a nod as yet <e> <s> i understand however that he is concerned with advertisements of a specific <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as i am concerned my noble friend has not <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has made himself entirely clear but he has gone wide of the amendment although the point was raised on it <e> <s> i can tell him that services that do not consist of sounds or moving pictures will not be subject to the cable authoritys licensing powers <e> <s> that is the point that my noble friend has picked up <e> <s> as a result classified advertisements in a service that consisted of nothing other than still pictures would not be subject to the authoritys code <e> <s> for them self-regulation would apply as for print advertising <e> <s> at this point one is in the area of electronic publishing <e> <s> it is much more like newspapers than television <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment of the noble lord lord aylestone addresses itself to the question of how the cable authority will ensure compliance with its advertising code <e> <s> may i assure him for a start that as well as being under a duty to draw up an advertising code the authority will be under a duty to see that the code is complied with <e> <s> we do not think that it is necessary to set out in the bill how the authority should set about securing compliance with its code <e> <s> it is right that the cable authority itself should decide what mechanisms it wishes to adopt <e> <s> in this we have followed the same approach as that adopted in the broadcasting act that does not set out a mechanism for copy clearance of advertising on itv and ilr either <e>", "<cs> my lords the right reverend prelate asks for my own view <e> <s> my own view coincides very closely with his <e> <s> but i think what he wants is the governments view <e> <s> the governments view is that the advertising code deals with matters of good taste and decency and i cannot actually see something which will be seen by large proportions of viewers or perhaps not as large a proprtion as we would hope but a notable proportion of viewers as being blasphemous would be in any way acceptable <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the noble lord lord mishcon will not think me churlish <e> <s> we did have a short debate in committee on this amendment and i agreed to consider carefully what the noble lord said <e> <s> having done so and listened to his points again today i fear that i still have to come to the conclusion that it would not be wise to extend the duties of the cable authority in this way <e> <s> as i explained in committee advertising time on cable will be sold in a number of different ways for the different channels <e> <s> with a local channel the operator may sell the advertising time with a national channel it may be the national programme provider <e> <s> some channels will be a mixture of both local and national advertising <e> <s> the cable authoritys direct control is only over its licensees and as i pointed out last time it could not influence transactions between very numerous third parties for example the programme provider and the advertiser <e> <s> i take the noble lords point that this amendment does not introduce an absolute duty but it is nevertheless a duty for all that and a duty that in many instances the authority would not be able to carry out and on those grounds i think it would be an undesirable extension of its role <e> <s> as i said i hope the noble lord does not think me churlish but i am unable to be more friendly to him on this occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall try to be as brief as the noble lord in his admirably lucid remarks <e> <s> the duties which the bill places upon the cable authority are of two main kinds <e> <s> the first is where the objective is within the direct power of the authority to achieve and deliver <e> <s> for example we can directly require them to draw up codes about programme standards and advertising because they have that in their gift <e> <s> the second is where the objective is not within the direct power of the cable authority because the authority do not have direct physical control over cable transmissions <e> <s> they cannot be under an absolute duty to regulate what happens in cable programme services if they are not actually themselves providing those services <e> <s> as the noble lord is well aware the iba is in a different position in this respect because it actually transmits itv and ilr programmes <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house the person who has the absolute power is the person standing at the cable head with the apparatus in other words the person who has the cable franchise <e> <s> he has the franchise by virtue of the licence <e>", "<cs> my lords is it your lordships wish that i respond yet again to this charge which i think i dealt with three times in committee and at least once on second reading <e> <s> it is difficult for me to be clearer than i have been and i accept that that is a limitation on my part but i must tell the noble lord lord airedale that there is nothing odd at all in legislating in this way when we are dealing with the terms of licences <e> <s> the control over the cable operators is by way of their licence <e> <s> the licensing authority is the cable authority <e> <s> the cable authority says thou mayest do this and thou mayest not do that <e> <s> so long as those commandments are obeyed the operators are not in peril <e> <s> they are the commandments of the licensing authority which are handed down to the licensing authority on tablets of stone from the government <e> <s> the licensing authority is a bad analogy as the punishment lies in the hands of the licensing authority because it is the conditions in its licence which have been breached <e> <s> if the government were overseeing we should make it a crime but it is in fact the licensing authority <e>", "<cs> my lords i have seen some inswingers bowled in my day but i have never seen a ball turn so far off the expected line as this one <e> <s> there is a little help coming in from the slips <e> <s> the noble lords amendment addresses an issue which in fact i had thought i had an answer to but the noble lord has addressed himself to an allied issue on which i can only do my best <e> <s> the waiver of the must carry rule is being allowed by the government in order to allow new services to be supplied by cable only provided that satisfactory alternative means of reception are provided <e> <s> the government have no power to require that cable companies continue to provide a service if a cable system is not economic <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should add that the government have been getting assurances of picture quality where these waivers have been allowed <e> <s> of course i shall look into the matter which concens the noble lords and refer it also to my right honourable friend whose responsibility it is <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to start by acknowledging that in his present amendment my <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened with particular care to what the noble lord said in his interesting speech about a large and fairly new subject <e> <s> he will forgive me if i give a fairly brief reply but i was unable to see this amendment on paper until midday today <e> <s> the noble lord has of couse apologised for that fact and i am grateful to him for his recognition of the difficulty in which that situation has placed us <e>", "<cs> my lords the government entirely accept that so far as is possible this bill ought to cater for future developments within a flexible framework but there are limits <e> <s> in particular i think that we come up against those limits when there is a point of principle which can only properly be considered in the light of a specific proposition rather than a hypothetical example <e> <s> the noble lord is thinking about pay television services which the bbc and iba provide otherwise than by dbs for example from their existing terrestrial transmitters <e> <s> that is an entirely hypothetical proposition <e> <s> the government have received no proposals for any sort of terrestrial pay tv services of that kind <e> <s> if we were to be presented with such an idea no doubt we would consider it carefully to see among other things whether it was an appropriate activity for the bbc or iba to undertake for a start <e> <s> only if we thought that it was would we need to come to the secondary question of whether the must carry rule should apply to that service or those services <e>", "<cs> my lords i gave a preamble to that section of my speech to say that it was not intended to be a complete answer to everything with the knowledge of what i was about to say but the noble lord is right there is a power which can be used against what i would call a fugitive trespasser <e> <s> whether it would be used is another matter and this is something to which i do not doubt he will wish to return <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baronesss last nine words i would remind her were but it has nothing to do with the bill and perhaps i should pass on but i thought i owed her the courtesy to refer to something about which she has courteously corresponded with my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords on the basis that all the noble lords references were to the present decade i freely admit that we have been over-optimistic and i impute this to myself in the statement that i made in this house <e> <s> the work to be done has proved much more intricate and more extensive than i had supposed but in view of the exchanges on the last question your lordships may think that a few of a ministers words are a good part of his diet <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble and learned lord is probably referring to the west yorkshire probation service study in which case i can say that we are aware of that study <e> <s> i understand that the report on it is not yet complete <e> <s> whatever its conclusions may be of course they will be a good deal narrower than what is clearly becoming the very extensive work that we are engaged on ourselves <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i did not get the reference or the implication of the date in the noble lords supplementary question <e>", "<cs> my lords i presume the noble lord means his conference rather than ours <e> <s> i have already said when we expect the report to be <e> <s> it is not in our control and it would be quite wrong for us to force statisticians to publish figures before they were content with them <e> <s> the analysis is now being written up the whole of the results will be published the report will include an account of the techniques used to arrive at its conclusions and it will be supported by all the necessary statistics <e> <s> the whole of this is being overseen by a committee which includes two eminent and independent professors <e>", "<cs> my lords on the noble lords first question the step which has been taken to ensure that nobody is sent to these centres for whom such a rgime is not medically suitable is that they shall be medically examined on arrival and before they are committed to the rgime <e> <s> therefore the numbers mentioned by the noble lord refer i think to those who have not actually embarked upon the rgime at all but i will of course look into that <e> <s> as to the second of his questions as a layman i have a view of course as to which of the offenders is the most suitable for this treatment <e> <s> however it is not for me as a member of the government to instruct the court what sentence to give in any case <e>", "<cs> my lords it may help if i remind your lordships that before i was so politely interrupted last monday i was speaking to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> my lords in following the scheme of handling on which i think we are all agreed with these amendments i turn first to those numbered and in the name of the noble lord lord airedale and will try thereafter to follow a labyrinthine path through my notes on the amendments <e> <s> the question of what constitutes an event in clause is going to be difficult however we define it <e> <s> under the scheme of clause whatever descriptive terms or definitions <e>", "<cs> my lords i am loath to be drawn into too specific detail but the bill as drafted imposes a delay of hours on the transmission of what is on the tape <e> <s> i think that that is sufficient elucidation to the noble lord although what the announcer would say under the circumstances i do not think would be exactly what the noble lord has said <e>", "<cs> my lords with your lordships leave i will just say that of course the definition is something we will look at <e> <s> whatever we come to in the end the interpretation is going to rest with the authority and we are not producing something which is totally watertight <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords all our discussions have borne out the assertion that most of us have made that the definition of the events which under clause would be excluded from a pay-per-view cable service in order to safeguard the interests of the viewing public is very difficult to draft <e> <s> nor is the interpretation of a clause drafted to achieve this result of its nature easy either <e> <s> it is to that that the noble lord lord airedale has addressed his careful attention though i do hope that amendment no <e> <s> to which i have already spoken and which i hope i have persuaded your lordships to agree will go some way towards clarifying it <e> <s> therefore i appreciate why the noble lord has tabled the amendment which provides for a right of appeal to the secretary of state against a decision of the cable authority that any particular event is or is not one which should be protected under clause and therefore should be excluded from showing on pay-per-view <e>", "<cs> my lords at an earlier stage i spoke at some length to this amendment length which your lordships were good to put up with <e> <s> but the house will not wish me to repeat the arguments against the amendment <e> <s> i trust that the noble lord having begged to move the amendment was only seeking an opportunity to withdraw it <e> <s> if not i shall lobby your lordships very powerfully against what the noble lord proposes <e>", "<cs> my lords i take it that this is amendment no <e> <s> as not amended <e>", "<cs> in that case my lords i am happy to beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords so many of your lordships have with no great admiration summarised the arguments that i advanced at the committee stage that i feel it is only a matter of ritual to repeat them and i shall therefore do so very briefly <e> <s> but i think that i ought to pull the debate together by saying that there is nothing dividing the noble lord lord howard of henderskelfe and myself on the essential point which is the belief that it is proper for people considering themselves unfairly treated in cable programmes to have the right to have their complaints considered by a body exercising an impartial and independent judgment <e> <s> where we differ is over the question of the suitability of the cable authority to act as the complaints body <e>", "<cs> my lords then i think i do need just to say this <e> <s> the iba has a regulatory function and a responsibility for the programmes <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord withdraws his amendment may i say that i have caused understandable confusion by suggesting that we could have an amendment perfected by the third reading <e> <s> this suggests a slight difficulty because i cannot give a cast-iron undertaking to your lordships therefore that what the noble lord lord howard of henderskelfe wants will be available in precisely those terms <e> <s> i think i have made it as clear as i can what i believe our position will be <e> <s> if i may presume to advise the noble lord if he felt that the issue was insufficiently decided to let it go entirely i should have thought the place to pursue it would be in another place where i do not doubt he has powerful allies but i expect to be able as i say to give a very clear impression to my right honourable and honourable friends of what your lordships feelings are and i think that will weigh with them <e>", "<cs> my lords with your lordships leave i accept that it is alway desirable to send a bill from this house as near to perfection as possible though we are are we not <e> <s> in the initiatory rather than the revisory mode as it were a very clumsy phrase but your lordships will know what i mean and there will be revision elsewhere <e> <s> but i do not think it is a point of honour and principle that we should have everything finalised and i would rather get it right in another place than wrong in this place to be revised when the other place can say that we did not get it right <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope in view of the possible developments of the next stage the noble lord will not wish to press this <e> <s> at the same time i think i ought to put on record the response which is appropriate in my view to what he has proposed should be done if the position were to remain as it now is <e> <s> he has drawn attention to the risk that by having separate bodies to consider complaints of unfair and unjust treatments in broadcasting cable programmes a form of double jeopardy might arise where a programme is carried by both services <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend has many abilities but that of reading two speeches at once evades even him <e> <s> however i know what my noble friend means and i shall take it on board <e>", "<cs> my lords my attention flickered minimally right at the end of what my noble friend was saying <e> <s> i am not quite sure what were the two alternatives he was presenting <e>", "<cs> my lords the notice will be served when the authority feels that it will wish to see the recordings by reason of its belief that in some way or another the person who has put out the programme has infringed the provisions of the statute or the code of conduct <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> that requirement results from the notice being served <e>", "<cs> my lords that is i think a semantic question which could be better argued by a lawyer rather than by me <e> <s> this is a use of the word where which i have frequently seen used in both legislation and litigation <e> <s> i think that i have already made it clear <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i see now that the noble lord is present <e> <s> i did not wish to traduce him in his absence <e> <s> in fact i am not traducing him but simply putting a gloss on what he said <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interpose to say that we think that the amendment is a distinct improvement to the bill <e> <s> we are grateful to my noble friend lord nugent of guildford and to the noble lady lady saltoun for providing the basis of it <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord howard has once again stressed an important point <e> <s> as we said in committee when he tabled a rather different version of this amendment the government agrees that it would be inappropriate for cable operators to enjoy the right to diffuse broadcasts within their intended reception area free of copyright royalties where the broadcasts are subscription broadcasts and the operator because of his exemption from the need for a cable authority licence by an order under clause is not subject to the operation of clause <e> <s> since there could be a number of small relay operators in this position it is obviously important that the point is dealt with <e>", "<cs> my lords i would have some difficulty in doing that without repeating myself <e> <s> perhaps the right reverend prelate would be kind enough to look at the print of the bill that will result from the amendments <e> <s> i am happy to repeat the assurance that i have given that this is as watertight as it can be <e> <s> but when he reads it he will find it a great deal easier to follow than what is in the present print <e> <s> if he still feels doubt he may like either to write to me or to raise the matter on third reading <e> <s> i would be very happy to deal with the matter in that way when we can actually see the print in front of us <e> <s> but i think he will be reassured when he sees it <e>", "<cs> my lords will the right reverend prelate forgive me but could he tell me in the context of the word we who are giving the press conference <e> <s> i am sure that that would be useful to know and i think i missed it <e>", "<cs> my lords might i start by sympathising with the noble lord lord howard of henderskelfe for the loss of his batch of amendments and admire the restrained and courteous way in which he has <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i do not think that without notice <e> <s> i can turn up the specific statistics for which my noble friend asks <e>", "<cs> my lords there has been an overall decline we believe of per cent <e> <s> over the police forces of the country though the figures are subject to confirmation and may conceal areas where there have <e>", "<cs> my lords the rate of offending is always a matter of concern particularly when it is as high as it is at present <e> <s> as to the rate of clear-up i understand from the commissioner that the overall clear-up rate has increased from to per cent <e> <s> for offences of burglary from to per cent <e> <s> for robbery and other violent theft from to per cent <e> <s> and for sexual offences from to per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> our difficulty with these amendments is that they would introduce an unnecessary and possibly harmful complication into the repatriation arrangements <e> <s> the point is that the information required by a state for the purpose of agreeing to a transfer is likely to vary to some extent from state to state <e> <s> moreover it will be for each state to satisfy itself that it has all the information it needs in a particular case <e> <s> this will vary according to whether the transfer is inward or outward <e> <s> the information required will generally coincide only in part with the details contained in a warrant for transfer to the united kingdom and will not include the kind of detail contained in a warrant for transfer from the united kingdom <e> <s> warrants for inward transfer would provide for example the authority for custody of the prisoner in the course of transfer to the united kingdom for the delivery of the prisoner to a place of custody in the united kingdom and for the sentence to be served in the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> the intention of the legislation is that there shall be an agreement between three parties that is the home government the foreign government whichever way around that might be and the prisoner <e> <s> my first observation is that the prisoner and the prisoners advisers will be aware of what is in the warrant and will have agreed to that <e> <s> the noble lord is suggesting that a flaw might be revealed <e>", "<cs> i almost left a pause for the noble lord to mention the list of amendments to which he was speaking with amendment no <e> <s> but no doubt we can take them as read because they are legion <e>", "<cs> detainees are usually detained in detention centres <e>", "<cs> the noble lord says no but in common parlance a detainee is a person who is detained in a detention centre and a prisoner is a person who is kept in a prison <e> <s> perhaps this is just a matter of jargon <e> <s> however i do not want to exclude possibilities and i will certainly look at detainees and at anything else <e> <s> what i do want to be certain of is that what we decide upon actually works better than what we have now <e>", "<cs> i am perfectly willing to accept that and i was perhaps rash to leap to a conclusion when the noble lord made that suggestion <e> <s> it does seem to me improbable that there was not an objection given that we have already looked at the lexicon as it were but we will go on looking <e>", "<cs> it is not for me to argue the case for those noble lords who are moving this amendment but i think their purpose is to separate the term prisoner in the public mind from the people whose reputations they wish to preserve few though they may be <e> <s> if that can only be achieved by the general public reading the definition clause in the bill i do not think that would be achieved <e>", "<cs> we agree that a provision in the bill relating to the prisoner being provided with information in writing in his own language would be reasonable <e> <s> we have it in mind that in practice certain information should generally be provided to assist the prisoner to decide about transfer <e> <s> the amendment proposed faces us with some difficulties <e> <s> they are as much difficulties of practice as of principle but they are real enough <e> <s> i realise that what noble lords are after is a principle and that it is not entirely fair to challenge an amendment in detail at the committee stage <e> <s> however in order to put what i am about to say in perspective i think that i ought to draw some of the difficulties to your lordships attention <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord both for his welcome for what i have said and for his helpful suggestion <e> <s> i attempted to draw out the difficulties that would relate to outward transfers because i do not see how the secretary of state can be expected to know the detailed implications of the criminal law of every other country which may subscribe to a convention or make unilateral arrangements <e> <s> on the other hand he can be expected to have a reasonable working knowledge of the criminal law of this country and to recognise an obligation to see that it is brought to the attention in so far as that lies within his hand of a prisoner in a foreign country whom it is proposed to transfer inwards <e> <s> i think i have got your lordships intentions clear in my mind <e> <s> as i say if there are detailed points which occur to your lordships in the next day or two i should be very interested to hear them but we will address our minds to this matter <e>", "<cs> i hope conspiracy will not be necessary in any conference <e> <s> but as regards the substance of what the noble and learned lord has said of course i take it very much on board <e> <s> i just wanted to sound a word of caution on close parallels between extradition and transfer <e> <s> in particular may i remind the noble and learned lord and others who would have taken part in the conspiracy or the confabulation that we are to some extent bound by the convention <e> <s> in other words we cannot offer to your lordships anything which would fall outside the convention for fear of losing what we are trying to gain <e>", "<cs> may i just say that i have not actually taken on board the thought of a full-blown meeting with a sort of sub-committee of the committee as it were but the offer is kindly taken <e> <s> whether it is accepted or whether we would rather deal with the matter by post i hope the noble lord will not think me discourteous if i take leave just to think about that <e> <s> it may well be that he puts things on paper that we should like to discuss but if i have something on paper first this would be very helpful <e>", "<cs> we would indeed be content to make the second part of subsection <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble and learned lord lord denning for that intervention although it may deny us one of those fascinating periodic and ritual debates that we have in your lordships house at intervals of about six months on the difference between may and shall <e>", "<cs> i always listen to flattery with close attention <e> <s> i am not sure that the noble lord lord avebury has entirely convinced me of my own ability to complete an exhaustive list of the circumstances in which the secretary of state might properly exercise his discretion <e> <s> your lordships will appreciate that i am now thinking on my feet <e> <s> what about a prisoner who is going to go back to a country in which he expects to be received by a friendly regime but that regime has been overthrown by one which has sworn to spill the blood of people like him on the streets <e> <s> i should have thought that your lordships would have every sympathy with a case like that <e> <s> of course under those circumstances i can hastily assure the noble lord lord melchett that it would be open to the prisoner to withdraw his consent <e> <s> that is open to him at any stage until he is actually removed and i dare say that that will be a matter of reassurance to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is always courteous and persuasive <e> <s> i recognise the anxiety of noble lords <e> <s> of <e>", "<cs> i am much obliged to the noble lord lord avebury for his explanation of the thinking behind his amendment because it relieved me of misconception <e> <s> i had expected him to be hoping that the secretary of state would act as a sort of scarlet pimpernel snatching polish-speaking correspondents of the bbc world service from other parts of eastern europe to serve their term in this country rather than that which their conduct had offended <e>", "<cs> i quite see the force of the last thing that the noble lord lord melchett said which was that whatever was decided it would be protected as to its limits by the operation of the home secretarys veto <e> <s> but i do not think i am in such a difficulty as he imagines over the rest of what he proposes <e> <s> as i understand it it is perfectly right that the bill should commit the government to bringing back into this country people who if they had committed no offence would have a right to live in this country and who having offended were detained by a government which agreed with our government that they could properly be transferred to this country to serve the sentence and that government agreed with ours what the extent of that sentence should be on the face of the warrant or however expressed to which the prisoner himself agreed <e>", "<cs> it may not have been clear from what i said but i understand that in fact the secretary of states discretion would extend as far as his discretion to admit people outside the immigration rules <e> <s> if that is the case i think that the noble lords anxiety is almost met because that would be the effect of what <e>", "<cs> the properly cautious reply to that is that every case would have to be considered on its merits <e>", "<cs> indeed with only the knowledge that the noble lord has given to us i would say that the secretary of state would be able to consider it but what i cannot tell him is what his conclusion would be which is what i think is more germane <e>", "<cs> it is indeed our intention that the secretary of states decisions on requests for transfer should be conveyed in writing <e> <s> indeed it is difficult to know how else that could be done because there would have to be written communication between the authorities concerned in this and the other state <e>", "<cs> i shall take these points <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord allow me to intervene <e> <s> i cannot think of who the people serving years in jail in this country would be and it would be those to whom the noble lords proposals would apply in the circumstances which we have discussed because since we are dealing in hypothetical cases and this is the difficulty that is always involved in so doing we are talking about a threat to the security of this country and not of another country and the secretary of state is not going to refuse to have a british prisoner repatriated to britain in order to protect british security unless he cannot imagine how he is going to keep him inside any jail <e> <s> so it seems to me we are considering whether or not to let people go from this country and if so it seems to me that the noble lord has overdrawn his case <e>", "<cs> at the risk of wearying your lordships i would just say that the debate we have been listening to must have put a number of ideas into the mind of the mover of this amendment one of which emerged fairly late on that we are in the habit of discussing the conditions of those on outward tickets and those on inward tickets as if the cases were the same <e> <s> what the noble lord lord melchett has said has made it clear that they are not <e> <s> it seems to me that the noble lord lord donaldson may wish to consider this further <e> <s> your lordships know i always reflect on everything that is said between committee and report so far as i can and that is probably where this ought to be left for the moment <e>", "<cs> on the contrary it had the very salutary effect of making me examine very carefully my own reasoning which is not a bad thing to do <e> <s> but i think that the noble lord is right in his retraction <e> <s> perhaps it would accelerate matters if i said that the number of occasions when an inward transfer would be refused seems to me to be extremely small <e> <s> it really is quite possible that there might be no objection to conceding <e>", "<cs> that was very far from my intention <e> <s> my intention was to say that the giving of reasons might prejudice an operation against terrorism or drug smuggling which i regard as as great an evil if not a greater one <e> <s> where that might happen i should have thought your lordships would wish the secretary of state to stay his hand <e> <s> as to categories of prisoner i have said nothing and neither does the bill <e>", "<cs> the first circumstance the <e>", "<cs> the doubt to which the noble lords amendment refers is perhaps more easily avoided than most though there are always doubts in studying the drafting of bills <e> <s> there is only one clause in the bill which provides for the issue of a warrant and that is clause <e> <s> all references in the bill to warrants are references to warrants in clause because they are references to warrants under this act <e> <s> it follows that they are references to warrants issued under clause <e> <s> clause does not create a power to issue a warrant <e> <s> that power is created only under clause <e> <s> what it does do is to provide for a warrant for an inward transfer and a warrant for an outward transfer or <e>", "<cs> i hope i can reassure the noble lord lord avebury <e> <s> his concern is that the secretary of state by issuing a warrant might cause a prisoner to be whisked back to his welcoming but vindictive land because he was unaware that the prisoner had changed his heart on the matter <e> <s> subsection of clause does not refer to the timing of notification of the withdrawal of consent to the secretary of state <e> <s> the validity of the warrant will therefore depend among other things upon the chronology of events <e> <s> if the prisoner withdrew his consent at a point in time which preceded the issue of the secretary of states warrant the warrant would as a matter of law be invalid because one of the requirements for the issue of the warrant would not have been met <e> <s> even if notification of the withdrawal of consent reached the secretary of state several days after the issue of the warrant <e> <s> this would not affect the position in law and the warrant would still be invalid provided that it could be shown that consent was withdrawn before the time that the warrant was issued <e>", "<cs> the effect of these amendments would be to broaden the scope of the bill i am not trying to make a drafting point to the noble lord nor am i certain whether he intends this to embrace anybody who was detained by anybody else for whatever reason <e> <s> i appreciate that the noble lords intention is to embrace persons imprisoned for civil debt and people imprisoned under penal codes based on religious laws <e> <s> but the amendment goes further <e> <s> i take it that that is not his intention <e>", "<cs> we have introduced this legislation because there is clearly a readiness now among many countries in the world to enter into arrangements for the repatriation of persons serving custodial sentences as a result of having been convicted of criminal offences <e> <s> all international discussions of this issue <e>", "<cs> to take the noble lords second point first he is absolutely right my concern is that we should do nothing that will inhibit the operation of the convention <e> <s> indeed a doubt flickered in my mind when i uttered those words a second time <e> <s> i thought that i might merely confuse if i sought to qualify them but the noble lord has just done that for me and i am grateful <e>", "<cs> the noble lord will recognise that neither i nor her majestys government can do anything to bind a foreign government <e> <s> when i refer to the courts i mean the courts in their supervision of the <e>", "<cs> this amendment follows the lines of the speciality rule in extradition <e> <s> i agree there is a need for such a rule in extradition arrangements where a country has asked for the extradition of a person to stand trial on specific charges but the arrangements with which we are now concerned are very different <e> <s> the prisoner will be seeking repatriation to this country for his own benefit and that of his family and his transfer will depend upon his consent <e> <s> the prisoner himself should be well aware of any charges that could be brought against him for any past activities in this country <e> <s> therefore there is no justification for placing an obligation on the secretary of state to inform him of any outstanding charges <e> <s> if any such charges did come to the notice of the secretary of state when considering a repatriation request i should add in all fairness that the prisoner would be informed <e> <s> but to say that is not the same as to accept that there should <e>", "<cs> i am anxious not to split hairs with the noble lord and i am always in danger of doing that <e> <s> i think i should take advice on this which i shall do <e> <s> the principal difficulty may well prove to be what is meant in the bill by the term the secretary of state <e> <s> it may be that the secretary of state is technically seized of information which is for example in the hands of a junior consular official or some outstation of the immigration department <e> <s> it could be that the information does not come to hand in time to be of use <e> <s> that would then put the secretary of state in breach of the act if the prisoner came back to this country and was charged and it could be proved that the information was in the system but not in the head of my right honourable friend who has responsibility for these matters <e> <s> i can see that the noble lord is not much more satisfied with what i am saying than i am myself <e> <s> i will look at this further <e>", "<cs> i will read with care what the noble lord lord melchett has said <e> <s> i think that what he said went further than the amendment <e> <s> the amendment is curtailed by a <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord for bringing to my attention this concern of which i was not in fact aware <e> <s> he will recall that under his amendment no <e> <s> we agreed that people who suffered from this sort of mental disability would need to be spoken for by somebody who did not so suffer and who could speak in their interest <e> <s> as far as i am aware that is the extent of the protection within the bill <e>", "<cs> i entirely understand the difficulty which noble lords have in unravelling the provisions of clause <e> <s> i greatly wish that they were clearer and the dissatisfaction of members of your lordships committee with the obscurity of what we have found necessary to insert is noted <e> <s> but whether in fact it will prove as easy to improve the drafting as one always thinks it will is quite another matter and i shall not give an undertaking on that <e>", "<cs> having been addressed twice i think i ought to reply at least once <e> <s> on the general question i was careful to say earlier that we were not proposing to create categories of offence but to look at each case on its merits <e> <s> i shall read with very great care what the noble lord has said because it concerns a matter of great interest to myself and the government and indeed to all your lordships the question of the advisability or otherwise of returning people to a heros welcome for deeds which we believe to be a crime against humanity and i should expect to be able to reply to the noble lord in reassuring terms <e>", "<cs> if i can reply to the noble lord lord avebury i did take care to say that i thought it was unwise to create categories of offence within the bill and i also took care to say that i was aware of the difficulties of for instance i may have left out the words for instance returning somebody to a heros welcome for something which we thought was a crime against humanity <e>", "<cs> as drafted clause refers to warrants issued for the temporary transfer out of the <e>", "<cs> i think that it does not but for reasons which do not immediately spring to mind <e> <s> in other words i have more sympathy with what the noble lord is now trying to achieve which is slightly different fromwhat on the face of the amendment he was trying to achieve <e> <s> if your lordships will bear with me i will probe the matter further <e> <s> it may be that we can do something <e> <s> i would not want your lordships to leap to the conclusion that we will do something but we are well disposed to looking at the matter <e>", "<cs> there should be only very occasional need for the secretary of state to issue a new warrant imposing a longer term of detention <e> <s> we can therefore agree in principle with the aim of the amendment <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord is seized of what i am saying <e> <s> i regret that one can never be absolutely satisfied with anybody elses drafting <e> <s> the term less favourable in this case seems to us a little imprecise <e> <s> if the noble lord would consider withdrawing the amendment i would undertake to consider how to introduce a government amendment on similar lines at the next stage <e>", "<cs> the noble lord may be a little surprised to learn that on the whole we feel that an amendment on the general lines he proposes would be reasonable in view of the wide discretion which the secretary of state will have to vary or revoke transfer warrants <e> <s> we should prefer to consider the precise form further and we would wish to consider it in conjunction with the amendment i have already undertaken to consider requiring particular information to be given prior to consent <e> <s> both objectives may perhaps be achieved with a single amendment <e>", "<cs> clause deals with expenses incurred through the operation of the machinery set up by the bill <e> <s> those expenses may be fairly considerable because they may involve somebody travelling halfway across the world to bring someone else back in conditions of security and perhaps staying overnight in secure conditions on the way back <e> <s> i ought to make it clear as the bill itself makes it clear that the secretary of state will not be in a position to recover the expenses of any escorts he is concerned only with the expenses of the prisoner himself <e>", "<cs> i should have referred to those splendid words as the noble lord calls them had i known that these amendments would be taken as a group and not reserved some of my fire for a later stage <e> <s> let us be clear about what we are trying to do <e> <s> we are trying to identify people who under the terms of an international agreement or convention qualify to be repatriated in this case to this country <e> <s> that is a quite separate exercise from discovering whether or not they can pay for their ticket <e>", "<cs> no government <e> <s> however ingenious would be able to find the means of getting the money back if the power to do so is not in the bill <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has put his finger on a difficulty to which i do not have an immediate answer <e> <s> everything he says suggested that i ought not to have made the restrained noises i did in reassuring your lordships that nobody would ever be faced with staying abroad unless they paid for their ticket to come home <e> <s> i shall certainly look at what i have said with a view to whether i have said the right thing at the same time as i look at the whole question that the noble lord raised <e>", "<cs> for reasons which entirely escape me apparently it never is <e> <s> the noble lord is right in supposing that it is the home secretary <e> <s> apparently those who come to legislation are gifted with insight which i do not always have and know who the secretary of state referred to is <e> <s> if we were to name him i think we should be in breach of a convention <e> <s> it occurs to me that if the secretary of state for the home office happened to be in bed with flu or abroad it would have to be another secretary of state anyway and that is probably the reason <e>", "<cs> it is quite unusual to include in new legislation a permanent statutory requirement for the presentation of an annual report for the purposes of monitoring the operation of that legislation <e> <s> any necessary monitoring is usually facilitated by the maintenance of relevant statistics and in certain cases by monitoring a research study after a few years operation <e> <s> we certainly intend to record a fair amount of factual information about the operation of prisoner repatriation arrangements and this will be available as necessary for the purpose of answering specific inquiries <e>", "<cs> that reveals a very admirable process for checking how these things work <e>", "<cs> i should be perfectly happy to come back with proposals about what to put in the annual statistics and that seems to me to be quite reasonable <e>", "<cs> this amendment may be based on a misunderstanding of the rehabilitation of offenders act and the equivalent northern ireland order <e> <s> as i understand it the aim of the amendment is to ensure that a conviction overseas for behaviour which would not constitute a criminal offence in the united kingdom is not included in the persons criminal record in this country <e>", "<cs> the noble lord assures us that that is so <e> <s> in that case i fear the amendment would not achieve the desired effect <e> <s> it would however create confusion as to the appropriate rehabilitation period for the conviction in such a case <e> <s> the rehabilitation of offenders legislation does not affect the maintenance of criminal records it is concerned with a persons right in law to have convictions disregarded for most purposes after a period of time which is governed by the sentence imposed <e>", "<cs> in congratulating the noble lord lord avebury on the closeness with which he has read the provisions of this bill i have to say that the reason why the effective date for disqualification under the northern ireland firearms order is the effective date of the secretary of states warrant is because the northern ireland order does not apply to convictions outside the united kingdom and therefore can only apply to a sentence served within the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> i always like to take a moment appropriate or otherwise to thank noble lords for their patience and courtesy <e> <s> i hope they will agree that the government have been anything but inflexible on this <e> <s> how well i shall perform when i come back with all my promised returns remains to be seen but the effort will be genuine <e> <s> i am grateful to noble lords for the ideas they have given to her majestys

apologise <e> <s> it seems to me there is still force in the argument that journalists should be subject to the same legal and moral obligations as the rest of us and it ought not to be necessary to distort legislation in order to protect their profession for any purpose <e>", "<cs> yes my lords with the leave of your lordships house <e> <s> the noble lord has just quoted a specific case with which i am not familiar and which may indeed be <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret to tell the noble lord as a result of inquiries that i made about this on his behalf as it were between the stages in northern ireland that the results of these cases are not separately recorded <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord prysdavies will not need me to assure him of the effects of the common law <e> <s> i think that i ought only to reassure the noble and learned lord lord denning that we agree with him that the specific provision ought not to be in a bill so narrow as this one <e> <s> but with the noble lord lord prys-davies we feel that the constable ought to have these things very much in mind <e> <s> that is why we are seeking an opportunity in police and criminal evidence bill which the noble lord has rightly reminded me has not yet reached your lordships <e> <s> when it does so the noble lord will be able to satisfy himself as to this <e> <s> that is why we are putting it in that bill which applies generally as opposed to this one which applies particularly <e> <s> the actual requirement is very ancient very strong and very well known <e>", "<cs> my lords any of the grounds provided by the legislation which are to be found particularly in clauses and <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be because he has reasonable grounds for suspecting a person to be guilty of an offence under clauses or of the bill <e> <s> no doubt he would go on to explain which of those was involved and if he were a good constable he would see that it was clearly understood <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that helpful intervention <e> <s> as i understand the intentions of the noble lord lord wigoder whom we are pleased to find in <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord is asking me my attitude to the amendment in his name and that of other noble lords then i intend to be as helpful as it is possible to be <e> <s> without debating the whole thing i cannot delimit the confines imposed on me by the effects of almost any remedy one seeks to apply to something that we wish to remedy <e> <s> i shall be asking whether he feels that what i propose is good enough to let me struggle with it until the next stage <e> <s> if that is sufficient to relieve the noble lords anxiety i will proceed <e> <s> if it is not i think with your lordships leave i can always reply to any specific points later <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not at all surprised that a number of your lordships have tabled or re-tabled amendments addressed to the powers against international terrorism contained in clause <e> <s> the change in this area is undoubtedly the most significant in the bill <e> <s> indeed it is the only one in which the powers have been in practice extended rather than restricted <e> <s> i am glad too that it is not being objected to in principle that the powers should be available for use against suspected international terrorists <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to say that after what the noble and learned lord has said almost anything i can say would be otiose also <e> <s> it is clearly wrong to write otiose words either onto the statute book or in <e>", "<cs> my lords a number of noble lords have argued persuasively and eloquently both this evening and at committee stage that it would assist both houses of parliament if each year when they came to consider a continuation order they had access to a report about the working of the act in the past year on the basis of which to consider the case for continuation <e> <s> there are inevitably concerns in this situation about sensitive security information <e> <s> we also have to bear in mind that the act places direct responsibilities notably in respect of extension and exclusion orders upon the secretary of state <e> <s> each holder of that office let us not forget is personally answerable to parliament for the way that he exercises those powers <e> <s> those factors were reflected in the arguments that i used in the past to resist amendments on this point <e>", "<cs> my lords i am engaged in giving an undertaking to parliament in wording that has been very carefully thought about <e> <s> if the noble lord will forgive me i would rather not elaborate although he may wish to ask me a question afterwards or it may arise in some other way <e> <s> with your lordships indulgence i shall contine <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that intervention <e> <s> it would be important that his report should be published and published in good time before the house considered a continuation order <e> <s> we would expect that he would need to consult fully with the secretaries of state concerned before preparing his report <e> <s> his report might for example take the form of a published exchange of correspondence between him and the home secretary but covering of course the interests of all three secretaries of state concerned <e> <s> if he chose to do so points of security sensitivity could be covered in unpublished correspondence although given that his report would not be reviewing or identifying individual cases i would expect that this precaution should not often be necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords i would rather not answer that question without notice <e> <s> i do see the relevance of what the noble lord asks <e> <s> i am well aware of the dangers of leaping to conclusions that seem to be obvious and i think i must merely take that question on board <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord henderson of brompton for enabling me <e>", "<cs> my lords the activity and nobility of my friend is never in question and as always it has proved effective <e> <s> i am not sure how many examples i can under those circumstances produce but i can produce one <e> <s> for instance if part of the act had been allowed to lapse and then it was urgently needed owing to a change back to former circumstances i understand that to reactivate that part

that my successors may be lesser men and so we go on <e> <s> i hope that i have at least explained to your lordships why there is a need for a provision of this sort <e>", "<cs> my lords i was waiting for that piece of flattery and i am grateful for it <e> <s> but i am afraid i can say no more at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords if your lordships would be kind enough to allow me to speak more than i should at this stage i should like to say that of course between stages i always consider what noble lords have said anyway <e> <s> i would remind the noble lord that before third reading there is some very urgent work to be done by the same people as will be considering this matter as regards a form of statutory instrument and so on to which we would probably attach slightly more importance than we would to this <e> <s> we will look <e>", "<cs> my lords as i made clear during our debate on similar amendments in committee i entirely understand and sympathise with the feeling of frustration that your lordships may suffer when the only options open to your lordships are to agree or to negative an order <e>", "<cs> my lords by your lordships leave i do not think that these are flimsy or insubstantial undertakings at all <e> <s> they have been made after grave discussion among the very large number of people concerned <e> <s> they have been given in crystal clear terms which cannot be retreated from and which i have stuck closely to in the earlier debates as the noble lord lord howie of troon may have observed <e> <s> they do constitute putting in your lordships hands the influence which your lordships properly seek <e> <s> i do not think that i can go further <e> <s> i am in danger of embarking on an impassioned committee stage appeal to the house sitting down on interruption and leaping up and speaking by leave many times but i think you will find on reading <e>", "<cs> my lords at this late stage and with another bill waiting behind i think that i must stick to the amendment on the marshalled list if the noble lord will forgive me and reply to the letter in the normal way <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed the number of visits is i think reassuring <e> <s> the inspectorate has proved an effective means of ensuring that experiments are carried out in accordance with the terms of the act <e> <s> i can assure my noble friend that inspectors make unannounced visits and that licensees know that they can be inspected at any time <e>", "<cs> my lords the ministry of defence chemical defence establishment is registered under the cruelty to animals act for the performance of experiments <e> <s> like all other such establishments it is regularly visited by a home office inspector <e> <s> licensees at the establishment comply with all the requirements of the act and there is no attempt to cover up the practices there <e>", "<cs> my lords we do in fact intend to look into this <e> <s> there will not be a bill this session <e> <s> if room could be found in the parliamentary timetable we should certainly be ready for it <e> <s> we should be ready for it but because of the pressures of other candidates for the legislative programme the bill may not be ready until later this parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i cannot answer for the royal society for the prevention of cruelty to animals <e> <s> i can only answer for her majestys government <e> <s> the inspectorate does conduct a very large number of inspections <e> <s> i have already said that those inspected do not know when they are going to be inspected and they know that they may be inspected at any time <e> <s> the minimal use of prosecutions does not mean that the legislation is not in force because the removal of a licence is a final stroke which any erring experimenter is anxious to avoid <e> <s> your lordships should not infer therefore that the legislation is not firmly enforced because it is <e>", "<cs> my lords all normal people dislike the infliction of pain <e> <s> that is why we have legislation to prevent it being wantonly used <e> <s> it can only be used for a proper purpose and it can only be used under anaesthesia <e> <s> of course there is repugnance i do not think we need to be reminded of that it is shared universally but i do think that the protection of human life and the assistance to human beings to recover from a wide range of malignant diseases and profit from organ transplants which is wider than the concern which the noble lord has expressed but nonetheless relevant is something of which we ought not to lose sight <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to all noble lords whether they are relatives or midwives for the very courteous way in which they acknowledged the governments approach to this problem <e> <s> i understand the noble baronesss difficulty and the reason why we have to conduct ourselves in this way to achieve this result has something to do with the relative stages of progress of the two bills through parliament <e> <s> i think what matters is that we have achieved as much as we can in line with what she and her noble friends and others wish <e> <s> i am sorry we have not been able entirely to satisfy my noble friend lord campbell of alloway but he has been most gracious in expressing his disappointment <e> <s> i would hope to be equally gracious in acknowledging it <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mishcon brings us back to an important subject <e> <s> i hope i made it clear on the earlier occasions when we discussed it that there is nothing between the two sides of the house on the desirability of securing the greatest possible benefit from cable for the programme production industry in this country and throughout europe <e> <s> that is why we have three specific provisions in the bill to point the cable authority and its licensees in the right direction <e> <s> at the licensing stage the authority has got to take account of applicants intentions with regard to the use of british and other eec programming <e> <s> the authority has then got to include in the licences whatever conditions it considers necessary to ensure that a proper proportion of such programming is actually included and each year it has to tell the home secretary in its annual report how things are going <e>", "<cs> my lords it sounded like a catechism but it has clarified my mind and i am grateful <e> <s> i have to say that i find it very hard to maintain an unyielding line in the face of the eloquent enthusiasm and patient arguments of the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> indeed we are toilers in the same vineyard and i myself spent a good deal of time over the weekend and at other times considering alternatives and in discussion with those who understand parliamentary drafting much better than i do <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously i did an amazingly bad job on the last amendment if i left your lordships under the impression that i was not convinced by my own arguments <e> <s> i can only apologise for what i hope was an uncharacteristically poor performance at the dispatch box <e> <s> all that i was doing was expressing the temperate and reasonable way in which i was viewing the arguments of those who resisted me rather than using the full fury of personal commitment which is necessary when perhaps issues are more burning in your lordships minds <e> <s> but clearly they burn more brightly than i had appreciated <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his explanation of the amendment <e> <s> i have been awaiting with some apprehension his words since he first put down the amendment <e> <s> i wonder if i may say two things <e> <s> first let me get a drafting matter out of the way <e> <s> it would not have been appropriate to put clause together with clause because clause comes in a group of clauses concerning the duties of <e>", "<cs> my lords i am in the obvious difficulty that this is a very late stage in the bill and i cannot therefore undertake to take away and come back with a digested form of response to what my friend says <e> <s> i find the concept that he has addressed in his speech an exceedingly interesting one <e> <s> indeed i should add that i am speaking with your lordships leave because this is my second intervention <e> <s> however i fear that what i said previously and perhaps did not sufficiently elaborate remains the principal restraining fact in my mind namely that there are many things other than hatred which are deplorable such as greed or envy but which are constantly stirred up by the media sometimes unintentionally <e> <s> if we are to address ourselves to the task of defining that emotion and those aspects of it which could harmlessly he stirred up and those which could not and to defining what is stirring up as opposed to accidentally producing in ways which may look less than accidental to some more familiar with the field than others then we should be embarking upon a very large area of legislation and indeed philosophy <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships have been more kind than i could suspect or hope for in the remarks that you have made <e> <s> we have here a piece of legislation dealing with the future which we can as the noble lord lord winstanley has said see only darkly <e> <s> we are seeking in that future to protect the standards to which the right reverend prelate properly directs our attention <e> <s> like the noble lord lord mishcon i have no authority to comment on the ideas espoused by him personally and by my noble friend lord mottistone for a special committee <e> <s> however i <e>", "<cs> there is no accounting for taste my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the magistrates association has indicated its welcome for this overhaul of magistrates powers to impose financial penalties and says that sentencing practice is unlikely to change suddenly because they are obliged by law to take account of offenders means <e> <s> i take it that that answers my noble friends second supplementary question <e>", "<cs> my lords it would indeed be an undesirable situation <e> <s> that is why we have in section of the magistrates courts act a requirement that magistrates should have regard to the means of an offender before they fix the level of the fine <e>", "<cs> my lords i have an idea that if i was a little quicker with my papers i could answer my noble friend more rapidly than i am now doing <e> <s> i understand that about fines are imposed each year but that only of those fined have to be imprisoned for default <e>", "<cs> my lords it is both serious and unhappy <e> <s> the effect of the length of sentences is that at any one time only about members of the prison population are in prison because of default <e> <s> it is necessary i think to have this reserve threat to those who contemplate not paying fines <e> <s> if we did not have it the balance between those who pay and those who do not would be far more inappropriate than that which i revealed in my last but one supplementary answer to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords if i have understood the noble lord aright if a person has committed a crime and cannot pay the penalty in cash terms it is not right that he should escape paying any penalty at all <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble baroness for her question <e> <s> we are indeed considering making community service available as an alternative to imprisoning fine defaulters <e> <s> we are also about to send a circular to magistrates courts drawing their attention to a range of procedures and measures that can be used to improve enforcement and reduce the need for imprisonment <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know what the bases of the decision on the individual cases were <e> <s> as to the power of distraint i regret that i cannot give the noble lord a straight answer because i do not know <e> <s> i suspect that many of your lordships do and i apologise for my ignorance <e>", "<cs> my lords we are concerned to examine the possibility of intermittent imprisonment among others <e> <s> we wish to reduce the number of people in prison in default of fine payment <e> <s> it is better that they should pay and stay out <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i share my noble friends anxiety that parliament should not be inconvenienced by demonstrations of this or any other kind <e> <s> i can tell him that the steps which police officers can take to asssist members on such occasions include stopping a march to allow a member through enabling a members vehicle to move out of a traffic jam where that is possible taking charge of a members car while he makes his own way to the house or taking him in a police car <e> <s> when i say member <e> <s> i mean a member of either house <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware that my noble friend had made any complaint <e> <s> i thought that he made an honest inquiry for information which i gave him <e> <s> as to the interpretation which the noble lord <e> <s> lord molloy puts on it <e> <s> i have to say that in order to implement the effects of the sessional order which in fact applies to the precincts of the palace of westminster the commissioner seeks to keep empty of demonstrators an area very much larger than the precincts <e> <s> my noble friend was concerned as to why that area should be so empty <e> <s> the answer i suppose is that once one is in such an area it is possible as a member to come more swiftly to the house but it is first necessary to identify oneself as a member to a police officer who can facilitate ones arrival at the boundaries of the area <e>", "<cs> my lords i was aware that the noble earl had experienced difficulty i was not aware of its location or extent <e> <s> of course one must look at such occasions with very great care to see that they do not recur <e>", "<cs> my lords the operational decisions of the police are a matter for the chief officer of police who in this case is the commissioner of police for the metropolis and he must take those decisions as the occasion serves <e>", "<cs> my lords when i was last asked about this matter i recited to your lordships the various <e>", "<cs> my lords if memory serves and it is some time since i had a motor car of my own i believe that it is possible to acquire a sticker by belonging to the houses of parliament motoring club or the house of lords motoring club and i think it will cost the noble lord or possibly <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i shall see that the commissioner has the whole of these exchanges drawn to his attention <e> <s> my noble friend will recall that there are a number of actions which the police can take which i mentioned earlier which could be of assistance even when one is blocked in to a queue nowhere near the head of it <e> <s> but i think that the best way to answer my noble friends question is to say that i shall put this point to the commissioner <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords remark will be among those printed in the record which the commissioner will see <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we must recall that there should be a balance and that the freedom to demonstrate against a government who may not always be of ones own choosing is a valued freedom <e>", "<cs> i think that i am so unaccustomed to support from that direction that i have forgotten what else i was going to say <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend raises a question which deals with the operational matters of the police which i can only pass on for absorption elsewhere <e> <s> i think it is worth also mentioning that demonstrators sometimes i think ill-advisedly measure the success of their demonstration by the amount of aggravation that they cause to the noble lord lord monson and many others like him <e> <s> it occurs to me that they may actually be wrong in that assessment and that the better they succeed in that regard the more they fail in their main objectives <e>", "<cs> my lords they are indeed <e> <s> and also i observe increasingly young <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i have dealt with that and i am not sure that it is a matter for the commissioner <e>", "<cs> my lords it might be sensible since my position differs somewhat from that of the noble lord lord shackleton if i were to speak now so that your lordships can judge for yourselves and so that he in fact can judge between what he has said and what i shall be saying on behalf of the government <e> <s> i hope that the result of that may in fact be a meeting of minds <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps we may now return to the bill <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e> <s> the work of your lordships on this bill has been concentrated and effective <e> <s> it has not for once resulted in great changes in the way the bill is drafted <e> <s> it has resulted in considerable changes in the way its use will be supervised <e> <s> moreover your lordships have given parliament itself more power to supervise the working of the act <e> <s> when it comes before your lordships again well before the date of renewal your lordships will have more information about how its provisions have been operated and more information about the guidance given to the police about it than has been the case in the past <e>", "<cs> my lords in a minimal reply to that brief debate may i respond to the kind things which noble lords opposite have said <e> <s> i think that your lordships are perhaps too modest in taking so little credit for the quality of the work which has been done <e> <s> had it not been for the contributions of all noble lords who have spoken and of some others we should not have come to such a fortunate conclusion so swiftly <e> <s> having said that as we have done our work and as there is other work to do i commend the bill to your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords i stand at this dispatch box only because of the illness of my noble friend lord mansfield <e> <s> i know your lordships will sympathise with my noble friend and will join me in wishing him a speedy recovery and an early return to his ministerial duties when your lordships will get better answers than this evening by reason of his greater expertise <e> <s> may i dispel one possible misapprehension which might arise from my standing here <e> <s> although the home office inspectorate does inspect prisons in northern ireland its reports go to the secretary of state for northern ireland <e> <s> the northern ireland prison service is no part of the responsibilities of the home office and that has a bearing on one or two of the questions i was asked during the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that my noble friend accepts that it is for ministers to formulate policy and for civil servants to execute it <e> <s> of course there is an interface between them <e> <s> i can readily assure my noble friend that there is no barrier set between the prison service on the one hand and ministers on the other <e> <s> like the noble lord lord donaldson i see great dangers in this debate <e> <s> one thing that i would not wish to arise from it is the impression that these do not have the confidence of each other or to encourage a weakening of the confidence between them <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend for that acknowledgement which has enabled us to set the matter right as to the attendance of my other noble friend at hmp maze <e>", "<cs> we must remember that this is not my bill it is not the governments bill it is my noble friends bill and he will doubtless come to a conclusion on this <e> <s> i might be able to make a brief intervention which could help the committee <e>", "<cs> i think the noble lord lord airedale would agree that the bill must provide for the worst cases as well as the least bad and most trivial case <e> <s> we cannot have a separate clause for each <e> <s> the police may be pursuing to some other place the sort of person that my noble friend has suggested <e> <s> they may have twice already had an old peoples home or a childrens home or some other place terrorised by somebody who came in and disappeared <e> <s> on the third occasion he may have been identified and it may be known where he can be found <e> <s> are the police then to have to sit outside the home like terriers outside a rat-hole waiting for the offender to come out before they may arrest him or are they to go away and hope that they run into him by chance before he commits the offence again <e>", "<cs> just to say a word having been involved at secondhand as it were in the advice which my noble friend as it proved slightly misguidedly took may i thank the noble lord lord mishcon for the courteousness with which he pointed out the error and my two noble friends for the grace with which they admit it <e> <s> but i ought also to contribute to this exchange <e> <s> i am glad we got it sorted out <e>", "<cs> my lords the process i am describing is not the only process but it leads to training by one of several routes <e> <s> this is the process by which the department through a consultative group including a representative of the association of chief officers of probation and in consultation with the prison officers association and the national association of probation officers is both studying what is going on in the field and consulting those who work in the field and has commissioned research into what is going on in the field <e> <s> when it has digested all that information it will place it before the prisons board who will also be concerned in the matter of how to train people for any changes which may arise in the treatment of this subject <e> <s> training itself is of course a subject for review and that review also will come before the prisons board <e>", "<cs> my lords we have a relatively small number of women prisoners in the system and therefore a relatively small number of locations in which they can be held <e> <s> the principal constraint is on places for women in category a and i am at present considering whether we can provide satisfactory alternatives to durham for them <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the balance between category a and other category prisoners in durham prison <e> <s> i am not aware that there is further accommodation available for them in durham but i can assure the noble lord that i share the concern about the question generally <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware that the noble lord had found three women prisoners in brixton prison <e> <s> i have never found any women prisoners in brixton prison <e> <s> it is not a prison for women prisoners <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend has announced a number of initiatives in this direction <e> <s> he has also announced a massive programme the biggest this century for improving conditions in existing prisons and building new prisons the latter alone running to million and more which should mean that there is a place of his own for every prisoner in the prison system by the end of <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope i did not erroneously give the impression that i think that the conditions in durham h wing are totally unsuitable for male or female prisoners <e> <s> what concerns me is those who have to be kept there for excessive lengths of time <e> <s> that is why i am anxious to find alternative accommodation <e> <s> an important contribution on this will be the completion of work at holloway which will make the secure remand wing available <e> <s> progress on that to some extent depends on the prospects for upgrading the security for holloway generally <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of difficulties over exercising <e> <s> i will of course immediately look into this <e> <s> as to the education programme it has been <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may take this the other way round i am not actually of the opinion that i have had insufficient information to give your lordships <e> <s> i have said that i shall inquire about the availability of exercise for these prisoners <e> <s> nonetheless my concern remains and i would wish to keep your lordships posted of progress but what i cannot do at this stage is to suggest a date on which to do it because the moment at which i can most usefully do it is the moment when i have something constructive to report <e>", "<cs> my lords that is scarcely for me to judge <e> <s> the noble lord is free to put down questions at any stage <e> <s> if they are questions of an unusual nature of course he will wish to discuss them through the usual channels <e>", "<cs> my lords silence suggests that i should answer the noble baroness and i am indeed now aware of that fact <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down he asked one question to which i should reply before we go further <e> <s> there are of course many others <e> <s> he asked whether the government supported this bill <e> <s> he will be in no doubt that we do when i have finished my speech <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a long course to get round and your lordships will not want me to take long in getting round it <e> <s> i have a careful note of the concerns of each of your lordships but your lordships will forgive me if i therefore do not mention every name of those who took part in the debate <e> <s> one name however i have no intention of omitting and that is the name of the noble lord lord ashbourne who made a trenchant and very able contribution <e> <s> i look forward to hearing further from him both on this bill and on frequent future occasions <e>", "<cs> my lords although the noble lord did not put a question mark at the end of that intervention i think there was one there <e> <s> this is a somewhat large and complicated issue on which i do not want to spend time <e> <s> this evening i recommend that your lordships grasp what is within your grasp and let us return to the larger issues at the next stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the gracious way in which all noble lords have received our efforts to meet your lordships wishes <e> <s> if i may very briefly with your lordships leave address the three points raised i would say to the noble lord lord donaldson that if the prisoner or patient in question was incapable of making a rational decision the secretary of state would be empowered to overrule him <e> <s> the delicacy of the issue is on the judgment not so much of whether he should come back but of whether or not he is capable of a rational decision <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord avebury for his preface to the amendment <e> <s> while i accept that the star appearing against an amendment on a marshalled list is not usually a merit star i ought to tell your lordships that as we tabled amendments a day later than i normally set as the minimum and as i was also visiting various prisons away from london at the end of last week i was unable to sign the letter which had been prepared for me to send to the noble lord lord avebury and to other noble lords <e> <s> therefore i have no grounds for complaint although the lateness of the tabling has caused us a certain amount of distress <e> <s> i hope therefore that your lordships will be indulgent of any defects in the replies that they receive as a result <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i will be very brief because the noble lord has i believe given a signal that he will allow this matter to be re-addressed in another place and so i will not delay your lordships <e> <s> i just ought to say that i entirely take what i suppose was the drafting point of the noble lord lord melchett in respect of the discretion remaining in subsection b <e> <s> i thought it important to address the principle in the amendment which was i thought to seek to bring about the position to which i addressed myself <e>", "<cs> my lords i am indebted to the noble and learned lord lord denning because other noble lords are prepared to accept from him phrases which apparently they do not accept from me <e> <s> may i just repeat what i said when i introduced this amendment <e> <s> of course i spoke at some length and attention may have wandered but i will re-read one sentence <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure whether our rules of order normally permit your lordships to give me leave to speak three times but we are speaking to three amendments so perhaps you will be indulgent <e> <s> may i say to the noble lord lord mishcon that i do believe that the amendment which we have before us in my name will have the effect that he wants <e> <s> he would like to see it spelt out so that he who runs may read and he who runs abroad may read <e>", "<cs> my lords how i sympathise with the noble lord lord avebury when he says that he is not quite sure why the amendment has been put down in his name <e> <s> that is a position in which i occasionally find myself though not able to reveal a very similar feeling but i am happy to say that on this bill i am four-square with government policy <e> <s> the amendment picks up the point addressed by the noble lords opposite at the committee stage in their amendment no <e> <s> and that amendment itself picked up one of the points enshrined in their earlier amendment at that stage no <e> <s> <e> <s> the amendment that we now have before us is rather different but that is its ancestry and i refer to the earlier committee stage amendment because it was in our discussion of that amendment that the comparison between what is proposed to be done under the bill and what is in practice done under laws of extradition was first mentioned <e> <s> it was the noble and learned lord <e> <s> lord elwyn-jones who in a passage in which he coined the word extraditee i am sorry to bring that up when he is not here and i add that he instantly repented of it said that he was a little unhappy about the discrepancy proposed <e>", "<cs> my lords i was <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships were i think trying to sting me to my feet and you have certainly succeeded <e> <s> i always think that for people in our position it might be more comfortable to live in the victorian age <e> <s> i have however no illusions that i do <e> <s> nor i believe does the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran <e> <s> there is exchange of information between police forces and these forces do of course have <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said at the committee stage when an amendment along these lines was proposed <e> <s> i see no problem in accepting that the secretary of states decision should be communicated in writing since written communication with the other state concerned would obviously be necessary <e> <s> but i doubt the need for this to be a statutory requirement <e> <s> nor do i think we need to object to the suggestion that a refusal should be given in the prisoners own language <e> <s> we do not consider it acceptable however that the secretary of state should be required to state his reasons for refusing <e> <s> as i promised at the committee stage we have considered whether it might be possible to adopt a different approach to inward and to outward transfer <e> <s> we have however i regret to tell your lordships concluded that such a distinction is not feasible <e> <s> given that disclosure of the secretary of states reasons for refusal in a case of either inward or outward transfer might involve revealing information or sources of intelligence related to criminal activities or matters of national security the government cannot agree that reasons for refusal should be given <e>", "<cs> my lords as a preliminary let me say that clearly a prisoner abroad does need to be informed of the result of his approach whether that approach is made to the government abroad or to the government of this country <e> <s> the noble lord asks me where in the text of the bill i can find this obviously necessary provision <e> <s> i do not know what the inverse of a filibuster is <e> <s> but we are in need of making haste and there is other business to come <e> <s> i can now refer the noble lord to the contents of the international agreement under which the bill is drawn <e> <s> i understand that that is sufficient to secure that this exchange of information shall take place <e> <s> if i have reason to put a gloss on that reply i shall write to the noble lord and to the other two front benches <e>", "<cs> my lords it might perhaps expedite the proceedings if i say that our objection is to giving the reasons in writing not the information in writing <e> <s> i am quite happy to undertake to consider between now and a later stage whether we could include the giving of the decision in writing <e> <s> if we cannot come to a conclusion in this house i am sure that we could do it in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords with your lordships leave i have already conceded the first half of what the noble lord asks <e> <s> we shall look at the written decision <e> <s> as to reasons under certain circumstances i shall of course not refuse to look at that and i shall look at it <e> <s> i suspect that there may well be difficulties in that if we are talking about cases which no doubt will be rare dealing with national security the very refusal to give reasons is a declaration that the authorities are on to something which they would not wish to declare <e> <s> however that is a hypothetical argument <e> <s> i need to take advice on it <e> <s> therefore the noble lord may wish to withdraw his amendment until i have done so <e> <s> however i do not want to make him too optimistic <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will recall that he brought this concern to the committee and i fear that my answer will be very much as it was then <e> <s> perhaps i can make it a little clearer <e> <s> subsection of clause does not refer to the timing of notification of the withdrawal of consent to the secretary of state <e> <s> it refers to the timing of the withdrawl of consent itself <e> <s> under the bill as now drafted the validity of the warrant will therefore among other things depend upon the chronology of events <e>", "<cs> my lords i answer with a little hesitation that it is not necessary to have that phrase on the face of the bill <e> <s> it is a matter of fact in each case that the existence of the warrant is lawful only if the consent of the prisoner pre-exists it <e> <s> if the prisoner withdraws that it no longer has the prisoners consent <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to say that we shall always seek to achieve the best terms we can in the terms which the noble lord has suggested <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is entirely within his rights <e> <s> as i have not yet expatiated on amendment no <e> <s> i will not <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble lord lord donaldson <e> <s> he made my principal point for me <e> <s> it is not unreasonable if somebody is going to be flown back and let us not always pick on thailand it is a country with many merits from some far distant and hostile country where he is incarcerated in durance vile and he is told that that foreign government has agreed with our government that he can be transferred home that the terms of the warrant are such and such that he will serve such a length of time subject to such and such remission and consideration for parole on such and such a date and that the air ticket will cost so much not the air ticket of the escort but just the air ticket of the prisoner <e> <s> if he says oh yes <e> <s> you can forget that i do not think we ought to be in a position of being forced then to repatriate him at public expense <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord melchett for his recognition of what we have provided under our amendment <e> <s> we are at a point at which i find it very difficult to do more to assist the noble lord or at least to assist him to accept what we propose in the bill <e> <s> certainly there will be very deserving cases and the bill ought to take account of deserving cases as well as of undeserving cases and it does give the secretary of state some measure of discretion <e>", "<cs> my lords i will write to the noble lord about discretion and i will also write to him about the second matter which he has raised <e> <s> of course what will usually happen will be that young johnny in prison in some distant clime will say go to aunt margaret and she will pay <e> <s> the representatives of the authorities will go to aunt margaret and she will either pay or not pay and then it is up to johnny to put it right <e> <s> but i can see what the noble lord is after and i will write to him <e>", "<cs> my lords i got the impression at the committee stage that your lordships would be satisfied without an annual report so long as the availability of relevant statistics would provide the means for monitoring the working of the repatriation arrangements <e> <s> i therefore undertook to tell your lordships at this stage what we would be doing about <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i congratulate the noble lord lord donaldson and with your lordships leave i would say that if there is any candidate for the foreign office or the diplomatic service it ought to be the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> i must take this brief moment of your lordships time to refer to something which the noble lord lord melchett said and i am grateful to him for his intention of withdrawing this amendment and for his kind remarks <e> <s> i said something at the committee stage when i think i unwittingly misled your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords attacks on and by foreign nationals in this country occur from time to time <e> <s> i entirely agree that they are deplorable and my right honourable friends the home secretary and the foreign and commonwealth secretary are determined to reply to them in the appropriate manner should they continue to develop <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i have the drift of what the noble lord means <e> <s> the libyan authorities denied official libyan involvement and stated that they were unable to control the individual actions of all libyan citizens <e>", "<cs> my lords the immigration service is extremely vigilant and although we have more of these incidents than we would wish i think that we have fewer than we should otherwise have <e>", "<cs> my lords on the first question i am not aware of expressions of regret or condemnation but nothing should be read into that because i may not be fully up to date on the matter <e> <s> as to the question of the bureau i understand that its proceedings and status differ somewhat from some of the other diplomatic institutions in this capital <e> <s> but at the moment that is not causing undue embarrassment <e>", "<cs> my lords a student is a student and a diplomat is a diplomat <e> <s> there is no need to confuse the two wherever they reside <e>", "<cs> my lords on reflection i think that that question goes a fraction beyond the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble lord for his suggestion which i shall pass on <e>", "<cs> my lords what i can agree with in the noble lords pointed question is that it is utterly unacceptable for foreign nationals of any country to come to this country to kill each other <e> <s> in so doing they break the fundamental laws liberties and securities both of visitors to this country and of british nationals <e> <s> as to how to respond to this if it continues i think that if any such warning is to be uttered it should not be uttered by myself at this moment but i shall see that those who might utter it read what the noble lords says <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we all agree that they are outrageous <e>", "<cs> my lords may i at the outset of my part in this interesting and colourful debate on behalf of my noble and learned friend the lord advocate present his apologies for being at this moment boarding an aeroplane the business of your lordships house having taken a great deal longer than anticipated <e> <s> i shall reply to the points addressed to him <e> <s> i start by thanking the noble lord lord underhill for his reception of the orders <e> <s> he properly gave his recognition and that of many of your lordships to the hard and effective work of the commission in getting the orders available in time <e> <s> he <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i can safely say that this debate has been both shorter and more interesting than many to which one listens in your lordships house and it has covered a great deal of interesting ground <e> <s> i do indeed well understand the frustration which afflicts those who would like to modernise the mechanism by which the date of easter is chosen <e> <s> they would like to pin it tidily down in one place rather than see it wander about the calendar <e> <s> that would fit in much better with our modern secular way of doing things <e> <s> there is indeed as they remind us an act which has been waiting patiently on the statute book ever since for just this purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords on report i undertook to consider whether an amendment on the lines proposed would be acceptable to the government <e> <s> this we have duly done and i wrote as the noble lord lord mishcon was kind enough to acknowledge to the noble lord on th april setting out our views <e> <s> we see no difficulty about the secretary of states decision to refuse to agree to a transfer being given in writing and in the prisoners own language <e> <s> as i have previously made clear to your lordships it will clearly be necessary for the secretary of states decision about a request for transfer to be given in writing anyway so that it can be communicated to the other state <e>", "<cs> my lords it depends how alert they are and how complicated is the case <e> <s> i am always afraid of going too far down hypothetical lanes into constitutional mazes <e> <s> i take the noble lords point but i would not wish to be a home secretary obliged to blow the gaff on an undercover operation in order to let someone know that he was not being repatriated because of his involvement in something about which i hoped those concerned did not know i was interested at all <e>", "<cs> my lords there was a suggestion at the previous stage that the new subsection limits the secretary of states discretion to the consideration of the prisoners means and the practicability of recovery from the prisoner or from any other source and that that was too narrow a restriction <e> <s> the question therefore is whether the secretary of states discretion should be widened <e> <s> the example of the american hostages in iran quoted by the noble lord was a very telling one although the circumstances of course were quite different from those in which we expect prisoners to be dealt with under the provisions of this bill <e> <s> none the less it was a very good way of creating in the minds of your lordships the image of circumstances in which it would be beneath the dignity of the government to charge for a return passage <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i have that within my discretion in the time that we have available to us <e> <s> i am not sufficiently familiar with the mechanisms of arriving at conclusions in another place <e> <s> it is sometimes necessary both to speak and to listen at the same time <e> <s> what i heard confirms what i was saying <e> <s> it is better to do it this way round <e> <s> it always offends the purist to put in something which is defective in this house which has the reputation of being a careful house of revision <e> <s> i hope therefore that the noble lord lord mishcon will be content with the emblazoning of his name and those of his colleagues on the record against this idea and my undertaking that it will be pursued elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships have been extremely kind and i should like to say at once that it has been a great pleasure on this side of the house also to find myself so frequently in agreement with noble lords opposite <e> <s> in fact the only thing that gives me cause for concern is to my mind the sinister burgeoning friendship between the noble lord lord mishcon and the noble lord lord avebury because that implies tactical difficulties at a later stage <e> <s> when at the same time lord aveburys closest ally describes me as being not unlike the russians i think that the future bodes perhaps a little ill <e> <s> but i know that he meant it extremely kindly and i take it in that spirit <e>", "<cs> my lords i am speaking in this debate entirely as a private member of your lordships house <e> <s> my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor will be setting out the governments view both of this bill and of how it should be handled <e> <s> the views i express are entirely my own and i hope that your lordships will not attach undue weight to them because of the position at which i am now standing <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to take together the responses of the noble lord lord mishcon and the noble lord lord harris of greenwich <e> <s> i was glad that they added their sympathy for those injured outside the bureau to our mutual sympathy for the parents and family of the policewoman who was so murderously killed <e> <s> we share that <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i ought to respond to those questions <e> <s> as regards the first issue of which the noble lord has reminded me if i may so put it the secretary of state cannot actually say anything about a demonstration unless it is moving it is up to the police to decide <e> <s> as regards the police on this occasion the demonstration was by london standards a very small one and there were half as many police as there were demonstrators <e> <s> there was no reason to suppose that anything untoward was about to occur until this unfortunate woman and many others were gunned down from diplomatic premises <e> <s> this is unprecedented in the history of this country <e> <s> it is not something on which we can look to earlier examples to guide us on how to behave and can say this may be very dangerous they may shoot us from the embassy <e> <s> such a thing has not happened before <e>", "<cs> my lords at midnight on sunday all the people whether or not they have diplomatic immunity now will lose that immunity <e> <s> if they are still here there will be no differentiation and no protection <e> <s> up to that point the situation is as it is described in the statement <e> <s> they will all be required to go and to go out of this country for good <e>", "<cs> my lords i have tried to make it as clear as i can <e> <s> i can only add to what i have repeated from the statement already that the police view is that without the co-operation of those in the bureau it does not seem possible that evidence could be obtained which would sustain in court a criminal charge for the murder <e> <s> my noble friend is suggesting that we should do something which would have no fruit in this country but which might have fruit which we would regret elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords on the first of the noble lords points i can only agree <e> <s> as regards the noble lords second point he is aware of course of the successive deportations detentions trials and convictions of libyans that have taken place in this country <e> <s> but i ought to remind the noble lord lord paget of something that he said himself because it is a view with which i agree <e> <s> in th december at column of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i can best reply to the noble lord lord gladwyn by saying that indeed we are lobbying our european economic community partners on this matter and that we are receiving an increasing volume of international support some of it now being publicly stated <e> <s> so far we have received expressions of support from the united states australia canada belgium and norway <e> <s> the easter holiday has interrupted matters and so the responses are only just coming in <e> <s> we are keeping the united nations secretary-general closely informed and have placed on record our account of the incident of th april in order to refute a totally misleading libyan version which was circulated earlier <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall of course draw to the attention of my right honourable friend what the noble lord lord chalfont said in his first question <e> <s> however i think that one should regard with very great suspicion a proposal to prevent the peaceable expression of public opinion in public in a democracy when what we have to advertise is in fact freedom of expression of view in a free country <e> <s> as i said this has never happened before and on this occasion i rather agree with the noble lord lord paget that one ought not to be frightened by the assassin into buttoning up the liberty of expression of expatriate communities who ought to be free to express views of their home governments <e> <s> however i shall ask my right honourable friend to take into account what the noble lord has said <e>", "<cs> my lords i know the school which the noble lord has in mind <e> <s> we do not have such suspicious views as perhaps does the noble lord but there is a discreet police presence outside the school to make sure that nothing untoward goes on <e>", "<cs> my lords one cannot make particular rules for particular occasions <e> <s> the general rule is that this is a free country with freedom of speech <e>", "<cs> my lords the lobbying to which i referred and the support resulting from it which i also mentioned is in the first stages and is concerned with expressions of solidarity with us regarding the outrage we feel at the murder of an innocent girl under diplomatic privilege the outrageous breach of diplomatic privilege and the convention from which this sprang <e> <s> we are conducting that exercise on a wide scale and the prime minister has also sent personal messages to a number of heads of government <e> <s> however the question which the noble lord wishes to pursue is that of the review of the convention <e> <s> i can only say that my right honourable friend the foreign and commonwealth secretary will be embarking on that review and it will doubtless embrace all the matters which the noble lord has raised <e> <s> indeed i shall draw this debate to my right honourable friends attention <e>", "<cs> my lords my knowledge of such matters is not extensive but it extends this far <e> <s> these things never stop where you start them and i do not think that i could say what the end of that line would be <e>", "<cs> my lords that is an idea of some originality which i shall pass to my right honourable friend <e> <s> i would not like to respond to it in other terms <e>", "<cs> my lords noble lords will watch with interest what the response of fellow members of the european community will be <e> <s> i know that their hearts at least are in the right places <e>", "<cs> my lords i always regard as very unwise undertakings from this box to publish matters of security and intelligence importance <e> <s> i would not think that there would be great merit in publishing anything which may exist of the nature which the noble lord has said <e> <s> as to what is being done with the murder weapon i have no more knowledge than anyone else at this stage <e>", "<cs> i hesitate between silence in the interests of brevity and speech in the interests of fullness <e> <s> i think that the noble lord lord mishcon is not entirely persuaded by what he has so far heard and i speak from long experience <e> <s> i therefore thought that i should perhaps enter the lists briefly <e> <s> i am not sure whether the point is well taken and i shall not dwell on it but i should draw to the attention of the noble lord the point that as the amendment does not derogate from the provisions of clause it would not have the full effect that he intends <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness is entirely right <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord puts the matter to the test i would just ask the committee to consider this and i hope just give pause to the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> i am very anxious and i think he is too that the best shall not be the enemy of the good <e> <s> he has addressed a cause with which i entirely sympathise <e> <s> he wishes the exports from this country to carry the good name of this country with them and that nothing that is seen on foreign video screens shall besmirch our reputation by giving viewers there the opinion that it is matter of which the british parliament approves <e> <s> i am entirely in sympathy with that as i am with the whole tenor of the bill and a great deal of what the noble lord has said but we are here legislating and not merely adopting public positions and legislation is a sensitive and an intricate matter <e>", "<cs> i think i ought perhaps just put a gloss on what the noble lord lord harris of greenwich has said <e> <s> it is certainly true that those in another place are not the masters of your lordships <e> <s> it is equally true that your lordships are not the masters of another place <e> <s> in legislation we proceed by agreement <e> <s> that agreement has to be between the houses and between members of the houses <e> <s> it is open to members of another place to object to obstruct and stop legislation just as it is open to your lordships to do so <e> <s> we have had recent exhibitions of how effective your lordships can be in nearly doing that <e> <s> therefore i do not think i ought to go into the niceties of the management of government time in another place because i am not the proper voice to express those points <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord forgive me <e> <s> i intervene with the greatest diffidence because he was so courteous and kind in his reference to me <e> <s> however the noble lord did say that i have a function to provide advice <e> <s> i think that my advice although i may be wrong would be that the noble lord is discussing the long title on which amendments i think nos <e> <s> and appear on the marshalled list <e> <s> my advice is that when dealing with those amendments would probably be the proper time to address this issue but i am in the hands of the committee <e>", "<cs> restricting my desire to put my elbow on the dispatch box i should like to suggest to your lordships that we have had a fascinating debate on many of the general principles of the bill which i thought we had exhausted at second reading <e> <s> we are now looking at clause and the question whether it shall stand part of the bill <e> <s> although the noble lord lord houghton acknowledged the parenthood of my noble friend lord nugent of guildford i noticed that he pointed his eyes like gun barrels at me during every complaint about the way we are handling things <e>", "<cs> it may be convenient if i put the governments view at this time <e> <s> i will try to do so briefly but it is an important issue <e> <s> i will set aside comments on the drafting of the amendments which in both cases i regret is not perfect because what we wish to address ourselves to at this stage is the principle behind them which is that the judgment of the broadcasting authorities reflected in their broadcasting practice should be substituted for that of the authority designated under the bill reflected in their classification practice <e>", "<cs> i have listened with great care to everything that has been said from all sides of the committee <e> <s> we are anxious to get on with this bill and <e>", "<cs> i must clarify the position <e> <s> my intention was to start at least by having discussions with my noble friend and he may then persuade me to discuss further <e> <s> i doubt that there is a trap as regards what my noble friend has just said but he did not say exactly what i said <e> <s> i said that i would consider what had been said during this debate and discuss the matter with him in the light of what had been said during the debate <e> <s> it is fairly likely that the result will be discussions with the authorities but i would not want to prejudice the issue <e>", "<cs> i do not want to spend too long on this as i am sure your lordships are anxious to get on with the bill <e> <s> but i think my noble friend lord nugent would like a little respite for a moment while i deal with some of the points made <e> <s> i do not think there is a real case for exempting material simply because it was in circulation well over years ago though i do not think much of that material was available then <e> <s> there are two amendments here and one of them goes back to <e> <s> i imagine that there is not much of that about and i do not think the amendment to that effect would be responsible for saving the video industry or the designated authority and its examiner very much work <e> <s> i think that customers and retailers would wish to have guidance as to the suitability for particular age groups of this material as well as of more modern material <e>", "<cs> if i may first address the narrow point about news items a news item broadcast live is not covered by this bill <e> <s> this bill deals with video recordings and so there is no interference in respect of live broadcasts which are covered by existing legislation <e> <s> we have been given examples of horrors on the news <e> <s> the object of a tape of the news may be to inform people of the bestiality of belsen as the noble lord lord mcintosh suggested or of the horrors of war in general <e> <s> that is a very proper thing for people to set about doing <e> <s> but it is in the interest of people buying these tapes to know whether what is on the tapes is suitable for those under the age of or those aged or over or whether it is so appalling that the tape ought to be on sale only in a special shop where the individual may be aware before he puts the tape on his machine that he is going to see something very shocking <e> <s> that is what this bill achieves <e>", "<cs> we are not except in extreme cases talking about prohibition and i do wish we could get that clear <e> <s> the bulk of the bill is simply about putting labels on things so that people know what is inside them <e> <s> i quoted an extreme example because i thought it was important that the noble lord lord houghton who did not have the benefit of attending the viewing should know what is at the extreme end and what we intend should be totally excluded <e> <s> but for the most part once it has done that the bill is simply about putting on labels showing people who buy or borrow what it is they are buying or borrowing <e>", "<cs> if the noble lady will forgive me i should like to return straight to that point <e> <s> the object of the bill apart from the areas where it excludes totally is to tell people what they are buying <e> <s> it does not make much difference if what they are buying is genuine current affairs material and contains scenes which are likely to give children of six nightmares for the next fortnight or whether it is done artificially <e> <s> it seems right therefore that the distinction does not appear in this part of the bill <e>", "<cs> it will be the responsibility of the designated authority to decide whether what is on the film is such that it can legitimately be used for the noble purpose which the noble lord has suggested or whether it cannot <e> <s> he and i cannot substitute our judgment for theirs <e> <s> we can only do that by seeing the material <e> <s> i believe that there are activities which may occur in this world in connection with which it is not proper to allow material to be sold commercially to the general public for their information <e> <s> i do not want to dredge the less pleasant corners of my imagination to illustrate that but i believe it is possible and there may be occasions when the authority should have that power <e> <s> but it will not have prevented the news programme from which the material is taken from going out over the media to start with because we are are we not <e> <s> discussing tapes taken from what has already been broadcast <e>", "<cs> it does not follow <e> <s> the fact that they are not exempted means simply that they have to be classified <e> <s> that is all and that is the point that i was trying to make earlier on <e> <s> if they are exempted they do not have to be classified they go out as though they were cheese or marmalade being served where one just looks at the ordinary label <e> <s> but if they are not exempted then they have to go before the designated authority which we propose should be the british board of film censors and they get their label <e> <s> the noble lord is making the assumption which is quite unwarranted that the designated authority is likely to <e>", "<cs> with respect the noble lord is speaking to an amendment to put guidelines into the bill for the use of the authority but that is not the amendment to which we are speaking at the moment <e>", "<cs> i start by acknowledging the just and courteous rebuke of the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> i ought not perhaps to get myself drawn into such enthusiastic and frequent exchanges across the floor although i think that our emotions and intellects are properly engaged in a point of substance <e> <s> as to the justiciability of the activities of the bbfc i almost think that i ought to revert to this at the next stage rather than continuing to speak until i get advice at this stage <e> <s> i have a clear idea in my own mind as to what it would be but i would not then wish to have to retract it a moment or two later <e> <s> if i find there is a difficulty i will in any case write to the noble lord and we can manufacture an occasion at the next stage <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble lord is very close to tempting me to substitute my judgment for that of the authority but i do not think that he quite does <e> <s> as i understand it yes we are dealing with a different medium as has already been pointed out which can be re-run and re-run <e> <s> it may be that it would not be proper to show something which actually happened just as it might not be proper to put on video a recording of an orgy which actually happened <e> <s> it really must be for the designated authority to make these decisions <e> <s> it is proper for parliament to give it the power <e> <s> the noble lord lord mishcon has eloquently and clearly set out how parliament can exert its influence on this <e>", "<cs> i must of necessity be exceedingly brief because i am looking at the clock <e> <s> i would remind the noble lord <e> <s> lord mishcon with grateful thanks for his intervention that clause deals with the way exemptions are lost in the matter of exempted works and clause deals with the way it is gained for exempted supplies <e> <s> so in fact the effect is not precisely as he suggested <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble lords lord mishcon and lord harris of greenwich for their response to this statement i will not follow the noble lord lord mishcon in the rather philippic style in which he addressed the subject <e> <s> i entirely understand that there is a sense of aggrievement and frustration which i entirely share as does my right honourable friend the home secretary over the fact that we are not in a position to apprehend and punish the perpetrator of this foul deed <e> <s> but we have to look to the future as well as to the past <e>", "<cs> my lords i have nothing to add to what i said on th april which was if your lordships will remember that it was under observation and that we had no reason to suppose that it was improperly used in the sense which my noble friend infers <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships will know that my noble friend lady young will be making the statement on the foreign office side of this matter and although i am sorely tempted to join in argument with my noble friend i think that i had better leave it to her <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not in possession of information about aid which may have been given to the ira <e> <s> only do i know that on numerous occasions the threat of doing this has been adduced by libyan diplomats seeking to achieve their own ends about how their affairs should be managed with this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not expect them to deny anything of that nature <e> <s> i would not wish your lordships to be in any doubt that we regard such support as being entirely intolerable and an act of the greatest hostility to this country <e> <s> but i have no chapter and verse to give to the noble lord <e> <s> if some comes to hand i will let him have it <e>", "<cs> my lords i can repeat what i said before that we had no such information to lead us to expect that to happen <e>", "<cs> my lords the two people about whom the suspicions are harboured were both accredited diplomats who had been through the proper process for the appointment of diplomats <e> <s> no diplomats were accredited to the libyan peoples bureau after th february which your lordships will remember is where events started to take their more sinister turn <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know the answer to that question <e> <s> i should not be surprised if it were true <e> <s> i should not expect to be able to endorse it <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not hear the broadcast <e> <s> the government are acutely interested in the whole of these proceedings and they will not neglect to look at them <e> <s> as to the setting up of a formal inquiry i have already given the answer <e>", "<cs> my lords there is very little difference in the case of a child of parents either of whom is a british citizen born in the united kingdom before and there are not many others around at present <e> <s> all that is necessary is the presentation to the passport office of their marriage certificate together with the birth certificate of that parent and of the child <e> <s> in the case of the child of a single woman of course it is not necessary to produce even a marriage certificate <e> <s> if the parents birth certificate is not readily available a passport will suffice and this can be conducted through the consulate in the place abroad where the parents are <e>", "<cs> my lords without notice i do not have a table of the timescale <e> <s> but if there is difficulty in a case the consulate would need to refer to the passport office for guidance <e> <s> however as i have made clear decisions are normally based on material that is readily available <e>", "<cs> my lords i always seek to be as tolerant to the noble lord as he is to me <e> <s> i do not think that his tolerance would extend to stretching the question on the order paper as far as that would require <e>", "<cs> my lords as to their citizenship status which is what i presume my noble friend refers to it is necessary to be in the crown service in order to qualify for automatic british citizenship other than by descent to which i have referred <e> <s> the crown service embraces the home civil service the diplomatic service and the armed services <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe so but that is the supplementary that i always dread one to which i do not have an immediate answer <e> <s> i shall let the noble lord know <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for pointing out what might be a difficulty arising from the correspondence between the certification system for broadcast and cinematic material <e> <s> i think in fact i was talking about correlation rather than a common classification system but there will be very close consultation on this and the noble lords remarks will be very relevant to it <e> <s> i do not think i can say any more than that except that i should like to thank the noble lord for bringing it to our notice <e>", "<cs> if i may shyly join in this festival of amity perhaps i may say that i find myself to some extent in agreement with the noble lord lord <e>", "<cs> i believe that i have answered the noble lord lord houghton and that one of my noble friends has answered the other <e>", "<cs> i only intervene lest my silence should be misconstrued on one point and that is to put myself full square with the noble lord lord mishcon and my noble friend on our view of the trade <e> <s> it is an honourable trade <e> <s> it wishes to disembarrass itself of dishonourable allies <e> <s> this bill is a means of doing it <e> <s> we are not impugning the industry for which we have a high regard <e>", "<cs> if the supply is a supply for reward then it is caught by the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am anxious to intervene as little as possible in these debates in order to secure expedition but the question was specifically asked whether the government were committed to approaching the british board of film censors to be the designated body <e> <s> the answer is yes we do propose to do that <e> <s> i would remind both my noble friends that of course that is subject to parliamentary procedure under clause so we are not actually taking from your lordships any say in the matter at this stage <e> <s> we think that it is a very proper body for the reasons which my noble friend has given <e>", "<cs> i wonder if i may help the noble lord <e> <s> this is not a bill only about children <e> <s> it is a bill about the home whether it has children in it or not <e> <s> it is a bill to enable people to know what it is they are buying when they are purchasing a cassette which will throw a picture and sound on to a screen in their house <e> <s> it is a bill that excludes some material from going through that medium altogether not because it is offensive or dangerous only to children but because it is offensive and dangerous to all human beings <e> <s> the noble lord will sympathise at least with the instance that i gave at the last day of committee of a prolonged viewing of the live depiction of the torture of an animal <e> <s> i say all this to remind your lordships that these are second reading points <e> <s> what we are now discussing is how to implement what your lordships by giving the bill a second reading have decided should be implemented <e> <s> i do not seek to rebuke the noble lord who if i may say so has been very restrained in some of his interventions this afternoon but it is important that we should try to stick to our last now that we are at it <e>", "<cs> may i officially endorse what my noble friend has said <e> <s> it would be foolish to be led into a long exchange on the report since i think the majority of your lordships are convinced that this bill is needed whatever is in the report <e> <s> that may not be a very placatory thing to say to the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby but it is a statement of the balance of opinion in this chamber and we should respect it <e>", "<cs> that is a nice point <e> <s> i have not seen it in writing and i shall certainly respond to it in due course <e> <s> but i would not wish to commit myself now or further to delay proceedings on this amendment <e> <s> if it requires something on the record which i suspect it does i shall arrange an opportunity between the noble lord and myself to see that that is done <e>", "<cs> let me briefly reply to that point and at the same time return to the matter raised by the noble lord lord robertson <e> <s> this clause must be seen in the light of clause and our debates thereon in that in those debates it became clear that we are dealing primarily with video films to be seen in the home and that video works for other specific purposes will be exempt unless they have certain characteristics which means that they will require to be classified although they are not intended for use in the home <e> <s> that is why it is not possible to use the phraseology the terminology my noble friends suggest which relate only to viewing in the home <e> <s> it is necessary to have in mind the fact that they are likely to be seen in the home <e> <s> that enables the board to look at both sides of the margin <e>", "<cs> i am anxious that we should not fall back into committee stage debates <e>", "<cs> second reading debates <e> <s> the purpose of the clause is what i have already reminded the committee it is <e> <s> the people we are trying to defend are of all ages including children <e> <s> the children have the most immediate appeal i suppose because they are the most vulnerable to the largest number of products <e> <s> the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby spoke to the amendment i think minutes ago probably for the first time <e> <s> we have certainly been going over minutes on the two amendments together <e> <s> i detected in his tone of voice an anxiety to bring the matter to a conclusion <e> <s> if he wishes to divide the committee i suggest that someone now presses the button that makes the bell sound and we should not then have to debate the amendment further <e>", "<cs> to ease my noble friends path i should like to put on the table something which may reassure the noble lord lord mishcon before he replies <e> <s> it is simply that i can confirm that it is our intention to set up such a body and that it is also our intention that there shall be representatives of the local authorities on it <e> <s> if that is the assurance that the noble lord seeks <e>", "<cs> again with deference to my noble friend the noble lord lord mishcon will recall that parliament can actually exercise its authority over the designation procedure under clause by the negative procedure if that is the correct way to put it <e> <s> it will have ample opportunity to satisfy itself that the government have actually done what i have told the noble lord they intend to do <e> <s> if the noble lords anxiety is about a later stage then i am not sure that i can be so specific <e>", "<cs> if my noble friend is content for me to continue i would say that between now and the report stage i shall of course consider what the noble lord has said <e> <s> i shall of course have to consider what would follow legislatively as it were from what he proposes that is to say having said that there shall be a consultative committee with representatives of local authorities will it not be necessary to say more about its composition <e> <s> then having spoken about its composition will it not be necessary to say more about its remuneration and powers and so on <e> <s> i am anxious not to make a meal of this and i am sure the noble lord is as well <e> <s> we both want the same result <e> <s> the question is whether parliament can be assured that that result will flow from what i am saying <e>", "<cs> on a point of order there is a late amendment no <e> <s> a which falls between amendment no <e> <s> and amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> it is indeed a different point but the lord chairman put amendments nos <e> <s> to <e>", "<cs> there are in general two sorts of appeal procedure and two sorts of appeal <e> <s> one sort is that where arrangements are made so that points of law can be decided by a higher presumably judicial or quasi-judicial authority <e> <s> in other cases the arrangements will enable a person aggrieved by the decision of one group of people to have that decision removed and reconsidered by another <e> <s> it seems to us pretty clear <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged to noble lords better informed than me because <e>", "<cs> it might save the time of the committee if in acknowledging the noble lords proper concern with this aspect i refer him to columns and of <e>", "<cs> maybe i should intervene because i sat down for the noble lord lord mishcon because i thought that the honeyed tones of somebody on a noble interveners own side might be more persuasive <e> <s> i think that the noble lord lord mcintosh has left two points that need answering <e> <s> the first is that there is a pretence that this is a bill in defence of children <e> <s> that is a very major part of its work but we have never i do not think that my noble friend has ever said so sought to conceal the fact that it is to protect people such as myself the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby and the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey <e> <s> from certain unspeakable things which some of us have seen and agree that we should be protected from <e>", "<cs> i am not aware that the clause is unworkable <e> <s> if the noble lord is able to tell me afterwards why it should be i will reply to the points he makes <e> <s> but in general terms i am confident that the bill as amended is workable in this clause <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that i cannot regale the noble lord with any rumours to that effect <e>", "<cs> i hope i can dispose of this quite quickly <e> <s> it is the intention that the secretary of state shall make regulations for this purpose <e> <s> the only difference between us is whether or not the require-ments should be on the face of the bill <e> <s> labelling is a fairly technical matter when it comes to dealing with cassettes <e> <s> it is extremely technical when it comes to dealing with existing tapes <e> <s> i think we would be wrong to go into the detail of labelling in the bill and that it is proper that the secretary of state should deal with this in regulations which of course will be subject to parliamentary veto and which i hasten to add will not be made without full consultation with the trade <e> <s> but it is the intention of the government as it is of the sponsors of the bill and of the noble lord himself that <e>", "<cs> yes my lords the noble lord and i can understand that <e> <s> they were not consulted and that was the noble lords concern but they had been asked to comment on the statement <e> <s> it seemed preferable to get something out as a basis for discussion and consultation and into the field rather than consulting as it were in a vacuum <e> <s> time seemed to be of the essence <e> <s> it would not have been sufficient to consult just these two organisations but other bodies and other members of the higher judiciary and this could have taken a long time in view of the need for the statement as a basis for the financial management initiative <e>", "<cs> my lords i am coming to that <e> <s> if i have not come to it by the end of the speech will the noble earl interrupt me again because it is there somewhere <e> <s> this brings me to the place in the order of priorities given to voluntary after-care <e> <s> the fact that it is not high on the list should not be interpreted to mean that my right honourable friend does not attach importance to the contribution which proper and relevant after-care should make to reducing the likelihood of a person re-offending <e>", "<cs> clause describes an exempt video <e> <s> if you have a video of such a description it is an exempt video <e> <s> that is of course open to testing in the courts but if you are about to be dealt with by the law for having what is not an exempt video the clause allows you to protect yourself by convincing the court that you thought that it was an exempt video and had good reason for so thinking <e>", "<cs> a condition i would not altogether regret under certain circumstances <e> <s> but the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i obviously cannot speak as briefly as the noble lord lord monson and put so much effect into it because i wish to advance an opposite view <e> <s> i wonder if i can briefly help your lordships on this matter <e> <s> i take absolute note of what the noble lord <e> <s> lord mishcon has said <e> <s> although i suppose good <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank the noble lord lord mishcon for the very courteous way in which he has put me right on a very important point of fact on which i was wrong <e>", "<cs> on the question of precedent two years ago your lordships passed the local government miscellaneous provisions act <e> <s> i am not at all sure that the noble baroness lady phillips did not assist us in that i am sure that my noble friend did <e> <s> with effect from st may this year offences under that act will carry penalties of up to and offences under that act are also triable only summarily <e>", "<cs> i was about to have a word in the ear of my noble friend as to the response but i am quite happy to utter those words via the floor as it were and to say that i recognise the weight of authority which has now been brought to bear on this issue <e> <s> i do not have the experience to come head-on in collision with such notable authorities as the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale <e> <s> therefore i should say to my noble friend that it would be prudent to look at this matter between now and the report stage though from this box i could not give encouraging noises as to the result <e> <s> i was about to suggest that my noble friend might like to say that but i have now put the gloss on it and hope he is taking the point rather than the reverse <e> <s> therefore if the noble lord does not press his amendment further this afternoon we shall undertake to look at it again <e> <s> however i cannot give him any encouraging thoughts as to what might happen at the next stage but it is for him to find that out then <e>", "<cs> if i may put in but one sentence i would remind your lordships that this bill in no way sets aside the provisions of the protection of children act or the obscene publications act under which of course custodial sentences can be given if a case warrants it <e>", "<cs> i look into the crystal ball from the opposite side <e> <s> it seems to me that the power to increase is what is most likely to be required if the friends of the noble lord lord houghton ever triumph at the polls otherwise of course the provision may not be used for a very long time <e>", "<cs> the effect of this amendment would be to put video material classified under the bill on the same footing as films of a width of millimetres or above that is <e> <s> films designed to be shown in cinemas <e> <s> therefore the amendment relates to the obscene publications act <e>", "<cs> i rise to answer the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> i was trying to find precedents in the short time available to me and i am not sure that i have been successful <e> <s> i wonder whether your lordships are addressing yourselves to the right question <e> <s> not very long ago it was suggested that the offences in this bill were such that they should be imprisonable <e> <s> your lordships decided not <e> <s> the question surely is whether the bill would work without this power <e>", "<cs> the bill came to us from another place with clause in it <e> <s> so if there is an inconsistency it does not lie with us in that respect <e> <s> but i accept that your lordships have a great interest in this and that it is an important issue <e> <s> again i never give encouragement from this box to expect a happy issue out of a reconsideration but i will look very carefully at what has been said <e> <s> i also note what was said from the liberal benches <e> <s> they have a good point and i suspect that i shall not bring comfort to your lordships at the next stage <e> <s> but i think that your lordships would want me to look at this and at the linkage with the other legislation in the light of what has been said in this debate <e> <s> that i am happy to undertake to do <e>", "<cs> it deals with the short title of the bill <e> <s> clause page line amendment no <e> <s> i do sympathise with the noble lord <e> <s> i have often before been in that position myself <e>", "<cs> it is intended that the provisions of the bill will be brought into force in three stages <e> <s> clauses to and clauses and will be brought into force first <e> <s> this would allow the secretary of state to lay before parliament his proposals to designate an authority to classify video works <e> <s> it would also allow the secretary of state to approve a tariff of fees to be imposed by that authority under clause and to make regulations on the labelling of video recordings and their cases or containers under clause <e> <s> the remaining provisions of the bill are expected to be brought into force first in respect of new video works that is works in which no copyright subsists at the specified date the date of designation under clause of the bill and at later stages in respect of video works in which copyright subsists at that date <e> <s> this is to allow sufficient time for those works to be submitted for classification for the classification procedures to be completed and for the labelling requirements to be met <e> <s> this is a reasonable arrangement <e> <s> i hope the noble lord will find the information that he wants in it <e>", "<cs> my lords we believe that it is proper to help governments concerned in the efforts that they are making already to fight this dangerous damaging and illicit trade <e> <s> the united kingdom makes an annual contribution of to the united nations fund for drug abuse control we made a special payment of in to strengthen law enforcement in pakistan we have recently pledged an additional million over five years towards rural development programmes in the opium poppy growing areas of pakistan and a customs officer has recently been posted to pakistan to liaise with the authorities there so matters are in hand <e>", "<cs> my lords wherever possible they are identifying and arresting them <e> <s> the number of persons found guilty or cautioned for drug offences in was as follows <e> <s> for unlawful supply which is more than the year before for possession with intent to supply which is over more cases and for unlawful possession of drugs other than cannabis <e>", "<cs> my lords there is close interest and close consultation between departments <e> <s> the report of the advisory council on the misuse of drugs on the prevention of drug misuse will be published next month <e> <s> prevention programmes will be developed in the light of its recommendations and i think that they will touch on that <e>", "<cs> my lords there has been a dramatic increase <e> <s> i would not swear to the noble lords figures but the figures are very large <e> <s> as to treatment in february and april this year my colleagues in the department of health gave details of the central funding of nearly million to support new local initiatives for the treatment and rehabilitation of drug misusers and a further million has yet to be allocated <e>", "<cs> my lords i think not because they have not been removed from that effort <e> <s> in fact the numbers directed against drugs have recently been increased <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall of course take that idea to my right honourable friend <e> <s> i cannot indicate what reception it will then receive <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said earlier we are awaiting the report of the advisory council and that is certainly a matter to which we shall turn our attention <e>", "<cs> my lords there is both international concern and international co-operation <e> <s> as to the particular area to which the noble lord directs my attention i am not aware of what the formal arrangements are but i shall write to him <e>", "<cs> my lords my personal advice would be to start with the local general practitioner and get into the chain there <e>", "<cs> my lords as to the noble lords first question i am not aware without notice of the particular case or the particular article but i shall certainly have it read <e> <s> as to the noble lords second question the tenor of my remarks and of a recent speech by my right honourable friend make it clear that the home office has this matter very close to its heart and that there is more co-operation than formerly was the case between the departments <e>", "<cs> my lords at present the maximum penalty is years imprisonment or a fine of i believe <e> <s> those are the highest determinate penalties that we have and we believe that they are adequate <e> <s> it is a question of catching the people involved and applying the penalties to them <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree entirely with the noble lords thesis that heroin addiction is a deadly killer which to that extent is self-limiting <e> <s> however it is not self-limiting in that the death of the addict does not break the chain <e> <s> it is therefore more deadly than the noble lord suggests <e> <s> as to the noble lords question about whether other forms of addiction are related to it i hesitate to come to a view <e> <s> however there is a view that addiction of one sort predisposes to addiction of a worse sort <e> <s> therefore i should be very hesitant to say that we ought to open the door to other sorts of addiction <e> <s> finally may i return to my answer to the previous supplementary question <e> <s> there is no maximum to the fine <e> <s> although i was right about the -year maximum term of imprisonment the fine is without limit <e> <s> i think that answer ought to satisfy the noble lord that we have adequate powers <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have already stated million has already been allocated for new initiatives and a further sum of million is yet to be allocated <e> <s> there is no doubt about the governments commitment nor is there any doubt about the noble baronesss commitment <e> <s> this is an effort which has to be made right throughout society not just from the centre <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> that is a short answer <e> <s> i was under the impression that the short answers i was giving would tend to curtail the length of the questions <e> <s> i wonder whether your lordships feel that the minutes we have spent on this question is long enough <e>", "<cs> my lords representatives of the african national congress are at liberty to remain in this country so long as they do not engage in unlawful or otherwise unacceptable activities <e>", "<cs> my lords no matter who visits this country those who are entitled to live here will continue to be free to engage in what is lawful and acceptable <e> <s> i hope that that interpretation of my answer satisfies the noble lord <e> <s> i am not a party to the agenda for the discussions which will doubtless take place when mr botha comes to this country but i do not doubt that they will be wide-ranging <e>", "<cs> my lords the freedoms of this country are not curtailed by anybodys visit or anybodys conversations <e> <s> the freedom of the world is strengthened where nations talk to each other regardless of their differences <e> <s> we talk to many countries with whom we have differences as great as those which we have with south africa <e> <s> in that light this visit should not he seen as offensive even to those who find the policies of other governments offensive <e>", "<cs> my lords it will be very difficult for him to avoid drawing that conclusion <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord should not be encouraged to read too much into the lack of precedent or otherwise of this visit <e> <s> that is the only response i can give to that point <e> <s> i will certainly draw the attention of my right honourable friend to the noble lords words <e> <s> it will he for her to decide how to handle her own agenda <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not certain that i have clear in my mind the substantive but hypothetical question that the noble lord asked about future events but the general answer to his question is that they should be acceptable in terms of the national interest and the interests of ordinary freedom-loving people <e>", "<cs> my lords i anticipated the noble earls question in view of the fact that i have twice been called to this dispatch box to defend demonstrations in which i had no personal interest but which had interfered with the noble earls access <e> <s> i do hope that they choose a suitable route <e>", "<cs> control units at wakefield were closed <e> <s> my lords we stopped having them several years ago <e> <s> he was in the segregation unit <e> <s> i know because i have visited there <e>", "<cs> my lords maybe we are indulging in semantics <e> <s> we both know where he is <e> <s> he was not under the regime or in the accommodation described as a control unit which was the subject of great controversy and which was abandoned long before i came into the prison service <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> recognising the pressures of conviction and emotion under which the noble lord speaks i think he was very restrained in what he said <e> <s> he did not ask us to rush pell-mell into a new arrangement <e> <s> however the question to which we have to address ourselves is whether the new arrangement is something at which one can arrive at any speed <e> <s> what i am saying is that it depends on the criteria the nature of the crime the behaviour of the prisoner the question of his reverence or otherwise from previous connections with terrorist organisations and of course the agreement of the receiving organisation to take him <e> <s> that is the question i am addressing and i think that those aspects have to be met <e>", "<cs> my lords i come tonight to speak at the end of a procession of legally eminent peers headed by my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor of england and containing law lords coroners magistrates solicitors and barristers <e> <s> i am a mere layman and i speak with a proper and i should add a real deference in this debate <e> <s> but after all it is overwhelmingly laymen who are going to be affected by this bill and laymen will benefit from it <e>", "<cs> my lords i perceive that i would take longer than your lordships would wish if i replied to every point <e> <s> in fact the code is tied into the bill first by the requirement that it shall be observed and that any breach of the observation shall be a disciplinary offence for which the responsible police officer may be punished <e> <s> that does not protect him from criminal proceedings if the breach was in fact in itself a criminal offence <e> <s> moreover the code is subject to parliamentary procedure as the noble and learned lord lord scarman has said <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may add my mite of clarification i shall be as brief as those who have spoken before me <e> <s> starting with lord mcintosh of haringey i think the noble lord lord ardwick has put his finger on it <e> <s> the purpose of clause is to provide that a work which would otherwise be an exempt work under clause shall not be exempt from the need to be classified <e> <s> it does not mean it shall therefore not be shown <e> <s> the video nasty is normally a very violent thing that is the creature which is not classifiable and because it falls in clause it would be subject to the need to be classified and therefore would not be marketable <e>", "<cs> if i may explain what is going on my lords the noble lord moved the amendment and he has the right to reply in other words he may speak twice <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that we want to get into a muddle with overlapping amendments <e> <s> i am quite sure that my noble friend having heard the questions put is capable of replying to them himself <e> <s> i was not intending to intervene and thereby protract this debate which presumably means that the noble lord will then be himself speaking to his own amendments in a separate debate <e> <s> is the noble lord content with that <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall come to my noble friends aid to preserve the conventions <e> <s> what we are arguing about is a very simple point though it is wrapped up in a lot of subsections <e> <s> in clause we are dealing with exempted works and in clause we are dealing with exempted supplies <e> <s> if you produce a work which is nominally for a psychiatrist let us say or first of all if you produce one which is genuinely for a psychiatrist then it will be supplied only to psychiatrists and that would be perfectly all right <e> <s> the noble lord is not worried about that <e> <s> but what happens if your unscrupulous producer produces something in a sham clinic which is in fact a pornographic film of which the public ought to have notice from the label that it is a pornographic film <e> <s> if it masquerades successfully it becomes an exempted work and it may be that one or two crooked psychiatrists will justify the production by accepting it <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether your lordships consider that the feelings of your lordships are sufficiently on the record now for me to reply to them <e> <s> we are addressing ourselves as both my noble friend lord buxton of alsa and the noble lord lord ardwick said to an amendment which is in the same form as when we saw it before <e> <s> during the committee proceedings i explained the governments principal objections to the proposal that material which had been broadcast by the bbc or the iba should be exempt from the need to be classified under the arrangements set out in the bill <e> <s> my honourable friend mr david mellor has since had some very useful discussions with my noble friend lord buxton of alsa the noble lord lord howard of henderskelfe and other representatives of the broadcasting interests to see whether some of the difficulties we see could be resolved to everyones satisfaction <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord once kindly said that he found me more acceptable after dinner than before <e> <s> on that occasion he referred to my dinner <e> <s> on this occasion i refer to his <e> <s> it is always a pleasure to see him coming back if as i believe he has already delivered himself of one speech to rapturous applause elsewhere <e> <s> i can only say that perhaps he is too eager for success if he comes here immediately expecting a repetition <e>", "<cs> my lords i start by answering a point which i think i heard the noble lord lord jenkins of putney make which anyway is of substantive if curious importance to his amendments <e> <s> the british board of film censors is not a body corporate <e> <s> it is simply a name given to an extra-statutory collection of people <e> <s> it is therefore not a legal entity as such <e> <s> the substantive importance of course is that the noble lord uses it as a point of reference in his amendment <e> <s> to that extent it is substantive because it makes the amendment effective <e> <s> but leaving that aside i am not certain that i have altogether followed the noble lord because i take it that his reference is to the principal officers of the board who are to be the designated authority and i do not see why the secretary of state should be required to consult them about the proposed designation when they are in fact intended to be the designees as it were <e> <s> again it would be odd would it not if as the amendment proposes the secretary of state in making a designation which could in theory at least involve the replacement of the principal officers of the bbfc were to be permitted to propose only those persons who have in turn been proposed by them <e> <s> it stretches the imagination to expect such a conflict but it would be an odd way of tying the secretary of states hands <e> <s> i wonder whether i have set at rest the noble lords concern at not finding there a form of words which is perhaps customarily present in other circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords with your lordships leave i know it is not lightly given i would say that the proposal in the bill is that the government should designate an authority and that is the designated authority <e> <s> we have from the outset made it clear what our intention is and we have made it manifest by long discussions with the british board of film censors which i understand i can refer to in conversation but not in statute because it has an existence which i can recognise but which the statute cannot that it is our intention to designate their principal officers but that does not appear on the face of the statute and i cannot bind successor governments <e> <s> however i would be very surprised if a body which has survived without a statutory entity for so long a time were now suddenly to fade into insignificance because it is not mentioned in this statute either <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for bringing us succinctly to ground on which we are in discussion with the british board of film censors <e> <s> as it now stands clause <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord tests the opinion of the house i think it would be as well to pause for a moment to consider <e> <s> i am not clear what are the grounds on which be thinks the age of consent might appear to the government to be more appropriate at a level higher than the age of majority <e> <s> the age <e>", "<cs> my lords it is only abnormal in that i forgot the customary preface of before the noble lord sits down <e> <s> i add it posteriorly perhaps <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise an amendment which is intended to be helpful when i see one <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord for his good intentions <e> <s> it is aimed at reducing the considerable backlog of existing video works which the board will have to examine <e> <s> it seeks to do so by requiring video works which have already been classified u pg or for cinematograph exhibition to be given the same classification under the arrangements set out in the bill without further examination <e>", "<cs> my lords will your lordships permit me to speak briefly <e> <s> i think the minister is allowed sometimes to speak twice if your lordships are willing <e> <s> the noble lord lord mishcon has been extremely helpful and absolutely right <e> <s> it is in clause that the need to determine is placed and it is up to the authority to decide how it determines <e> <s> the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey has suggested both an ingenious way of doing this and an ingenious way of circumventing it <e> <s> but the fact remains that it is up to the board to decide and we are anxious that the process of determination should be as rapid and practical as possible <e> <s> in other words the bill does allow what the noble lord lord jenkins of putney wishes it to allow <e> <s> i do not wish to offend him in any way but perhaps i cannot stand up again and if he is still wedded to the idea i have to say that were i to return to my feet i would tell him three matters in which the amendment that he has put down is defective so that it would be necessary for him to return at a later stage anyway <e>", "<cs> my lords if i understand correctly that the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby is not intending to speak more than those few words i would only respond that i think my noble friend has spoken so ably on this motion and given such cogent reasons it is not necessary for me to speak further <e>", "<cs> my lords i can agree with the noble lord in this <e> <s> there is a close analogy with the confait case <e> <s> indeed the analogy is so close that that is why we feel that a separate inquiry is not necessary <e> <s> the fisher inquiry examined the confait case and precipitated the royal commission on criminal procedure the result of which is the bill <e> <s> as to the code of practice i do not wish to lead your lordships into the debates that doubtless we shall have on the committee stage of that bill but i think it is apposite to say that the code of practice is tied into the bill by sanctions and is as effective as though it were on the face of the bill and that it is designed to deal specifically with matters <e>", "<cs> my lords on the noble lords first question my answer must remain what it was in my first answer that is that it is a serious case that we have taken note of it that we believe that the provisions in the bill i referred to will cater for it <e> <s> it is open to the noble lord to continue the reflections which he referred to a moment ago on the suitability of the provisions there when the bill is discussed <e> <s> as to the correspondence to which the noble lord refers i am not aware of the detail but i can assure him that if there has been any discourtesy on the part of my right honourable friend certainly it is unintentional <e> <s> i regret the necessity of advertising the length of time taken to answer in this context but i can assure the noble lord that as a result of the time taken it will be a very careful answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i will reaffirm for the last time that we see this as an important and unfortunate case <e> <s> i will also confirm for the last time that we believe it is dealt with in the bill <e> <s> i do not believe that i ought to weary your lordships with a detailed analysis of the provisions in the bill <e> <s> if my noble friend thinks they are not sufficient to deal with this problem i am certain he will bring amendments to put that right <e>", "<cs> my lords i always draw my right honourable friends attention to things said in this house by your lordships which touch his responsibilities and i will certainly do that on this occasion <e> <s> i would however point out that the events in question took place some considerable time ago the people who might be required to give evidence might not all be in the service in which they were at the relevant time and the interest which your lordships have shown relates to what one of your lordships described as possible misconduct of the police in ignoring the judges rules <e> <s> there are procedures for complaining about such misconduct and no such complaint has been made <e> <s> if it were to be made it would doubtless be followed up <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships are concerned with the miscarriage of justice <e> <s> it is a proper answer to say that the home secretary will be more ready to refer cases which appear possibly to fall within that category to the court to decide <e> <s> your lordships would not expect the home secretary to decide these cases he can only act as the filter between the cases and the court <e> <s> as to the number of cases in the past months i regret that without notice i cannot give the noble lord the answer but i shall write to him <e>", "<cs> my lords the case was brought to notice because of the two offences to which mr foster had given entirely convincing admissions of guilt one was the subject of a subsequent admission of guilt by another person which proved to be wholly credible and which was accepted <e> <s> when that came to the notice of the police they referred it to the director of public prosecutions <e> <s> when it was brought to the home office the home office immediately reviewed both cases <e> <s> but the second of the two cases convincingly admitted to was in no way touched in the context of <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely understand the noble lords interest and also the delicacy which he has expressed as regards this matter <e> <s> there were in fact two cases to which foster admitted guilt and one of those was touched by the confession <e> <s> as to the final proceedings in this case of course they arose from an appeal following the grant of a royal pardon in the first case <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i am right in saying that the noble lord is already on the record as having spoken to the long list of amendments which he has just repeated so they are on the record <e> <s> the amendments which we now come to cannot stand on their own because the paving amendments have fallen <e> <s> therefore the noble lord would be moving something which could not stand and he would be in an illogical position <e> <s> i think that the house quite sympathises with his enthusiasm in this case but i hope that i can persuade him that the rules of order and logic mean that he should say not moved as he comes to each of these amendments and rely upon the record already in <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> perhaps i may just say and i am always happy to bow to superior experience and wisdom that the schedule must depend upon the original clause which the noble lord sought to insert in the bill <e> <s> presumably the schedule cannot exist in the bill without the clause upon which it is dependent <e> <s> the noble lord wants the schedule to be printed in the official report but it can be printed in the <e>", "<cs> my lords we return here to a matter discussed at committee stage <e> <s> the amendment would ensure that offences under clauses and are triable <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will forgive me for interrupting him before he embarks on that fascinating subject i think i can help him <e> <s> the offence may be having in his possession works which he intends to supply <e> <s> he may deny the intention of supplying them when the offence is the supply <e> <s> if there is then an invoice or a letter of acknowledgment of an order that surely must be evidence that an offence has been committed and without that evidence the prosecution would fail <e> <s> that is only one example <e> <s> there may well be others <e> <s> but i think i have said enough to show the noble lord that it is not just the objects themselves that have to be taken <e>", "<cs> my lords we return here to a point which i said i would look at after the committee stage <e> <s> subsection of clause provides that if a constable has reasonable grounds to suspect that a person has committed an offence under the bill he can require him to give his name and address and if the person refuses to do so or fails to comply or gives particulars which the constable reasonably suspects to be false like charlie chaplin the constable can arrest him without warrant <e> <s> thus the effect of the subsection is to provide the police with a power to arrest for an offence under the bill if and only if it is impracticable or inappropriate to proceed by way of summons <e> <s> the normal way of proceeding should be by way of the police laying information before the magistrates court and the court deciding in the exercise of its judicial discretion to issue a summons <e> <s> but we must be realistic and acknowledge that there will be fly-by-night characters who may sometimes be involved in the illegal supply of videos <e> <s> in committee i mentioned the man at the factory gate who had a case full of unclassified or unclassifiable material and when stopped refused to say who he was and scarpered <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the broad answer is yes <e> <s> i was hoping to turn up the reference but again i am not sufficiently dexterous because i find it very difficult to carry the clause numbers of two bills in my head simultaneously <e> <s> but the intention is to sweep up many scattered and incomplete pieces of legislation <e> <s> i do not really want to get on to stop and search and so on but your lordships addressed this in the second reading debate on the police and criminal evidence bill which happily we have already held <e> <s> your lordships will be aware that the purpose of this is to bring our law into an understandable and complete form and it will have that effect <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down and with the leave of the house to which i think i am entitled may i just ask him to put the record straight on the police and criminal evidence bill <e> <s> if he turns to clause he will find the general arrest conditions which come into effect when a constable has reasonable grounds for suspecting that any offence has been committed <e> <s> the general arrest conditions are <e>", "<cs> my lords with the further and final leave of your lordships in order to save time and i hope to mollify the noble lord would it help if i say that if the powers of arrest in the police and criminal evidence bill are amended so that clause of the video recordings bill is no longer consistent with that bill the government would not stand in the way of amendments to this bill to which we expect to receive royal assent before that bill put forward during later stages of the other bill <e> <s> i hope that i have carried your lordships through those bills correctly <e> <s> if the noble lord understands me i shall sit down <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords lord mishcon and lord hooson have voiced anxieties which her majestys government and everybody in this house share <e> <s> it is our duty to be vigilant about the use of police powers and the rights of citizens <e> <s> that is why we have the guidelines which the noble lord lord mishcon summarised so aptly and that is why there is now to be an inquiry to see whether these guidelines have been met and whether criminal acts have been committed <e> <s> the report will cover that aspect of things <e> <s> i understand that in fact as the statement said the procedures as to the issue of police firearms have been properly followed in this case but of course the question as to their use must be a matter which is <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for giving me the opportunity to say that while one must come to no conclusions about this event before the inquiry is concluded it is very much in our minds that the police need to be in a position to respond appropriately to armed threat <e> <s> i understand from the post office that in the single week ended nd june there were no fewer than attacks on post office staff or premises and in eight of the attacks the assailants were armed <e>", "<cs> my lords the work of the police is both dangerous and difficult and we all stand indebted to the members of the police forces of this country <e> <s> nothing i have said bears on the issue in this case which must of course be the subject of an inquiry <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to adduce general principles much as i sympathise with them in the context of the statement about a particular event <e>", "<cs> my lords we do not underestimate the threat of violence in our society <e> <s> i believe that the steps taken by my noble friend and my right honourable friend who succeeded him have done a great deal to alleviate a situation which would otherwise be far worse than it is now had it not been for the action which has been taken <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a boundary line which is ably and vigilantly patrolled by your lordships and you will continue to do so during the proceedings on the police and criminal evidence bill <e> <s> i do not think that we can usefully prolong this discussion which is about one event which is <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we shall view that with a certain poignant regret <e> <s> i of course see the attractions which the noble lord lord winstanley sees in the amendment standing in the name of both noble lords in that they feel it directs the attention to something in the bill which they regard as of paramount importance <e> <s> however as the noble lord lord mishcon has very ably told your lordships that <e>", "<cs> my lords i think convention requires me to intervene at this stage <e> <s> i should like to welcome the vigour and robustness with which both noble lords who have spoken have on behalf of their parties supported law and order and those who enforce it <e> <s> i believe it is crucially important that the nation should be united in resistance to any resort to bully-boy strong-arm tactics to achieve what the law denies in the protection of other members of the community <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the right reverend prelates intervention and for his perceptions <e> <s> i am certain that the church aptly the church militant can be of help in the field and the home in this matter though i would not at this stage be able to suggest a national role if that is what he had in mind <e> <s> however his good wishes are almost as welcome as his prayers without which we would not survive <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord again tempts me to discuss how the nationalised coal industry should be run <e> <s> as i understand it our interest at the moment is not whether the miners should be on strike but whether they should be conducting themselves in the way that they were conducting themselves last night <e> <s> that is the question on the order paper <e> <s> therefore although i am tempted to reply to the noble lord i simply say that the way in which the strike was conducted last night is at variance with the experience of british history that it is contrary to the british character that it is destructive of the queens peace of this country and that it should not be tolerated <e>", "<cs> my lords i am of course obliged to the noble lord i will give the undertaking that he wants <e>", "<cs> my lords the question of law enforcement is in a situation like this continually under review <e> <s> it may be useful although i cannot list every provision of the criminal law that may be used not all of them in relation to the leaders or godfathers of these events to give the example that any unlawful infliction of violence against the person is a criminal offence <e> <s> violence against property is dealt with under the criminal damage act <e> <s> obstruction of the highway or of the police are criminal offences and there is a range of offences of intimidation <e> <s> conduct conducive to a breach of the peace is an offence and there are the common law public order offences of affray unlawful assembly and riot <e> <s> but my noble friend has rightly pointed a finger at those responsible who are supposed to be leading a responsible national body and who with every intention of causing a vast assembly of their membership at one place cause it to take place in the full knowledge that its intention is to stop a lawful procedure which the police will be bound to protect it seems to me that the consequences that flow from that decision must lay a very heavy burden of responsibility indeed upon those who take it <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lords question was does her majestys government think that wherever possible enmity should be turned into friendship and that those who protect the law and those who live under it should be on the same side in maintaining order in our society <e> <s> the answer is unequivocally yes <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i think that the circumstances were a little different <e>", "<cs> with the greatest brevity and only for the sake of completeness because we have an almost entirely complete set of arguments before us <e> <s> i would just remind the noble lord lord mishcon in case he has forgotten although i do not suppose he has that article of the european convention on recognition and enforcement of decisions concerning custody of children and on restoration of custody of children says <e>", "<cs> i understand that lord justice lawton was consulted about this change and agreed to it <e>", "<cs> i just want to put this reflection into the mind of the noble lord lord mishcon in dealing with this matter which i hope we can do swiftly <e> <s> it arises from his original speech because he is apparently under the impression that the defence is that one parent believes that the other person has acted unreasonably <e> <s> but if he looks at subsection he will find that the requirement that the belief should be in the mind of the parent is contained in only subsection <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may try to draw this question to a conclusion <e> <s> it seems to me that my noble friend has put forward fairly strong arguments <e> <s> but it also seems to me that in a case where a child is taken abroad by one parent without the consent of the other if the conditions in paragraphs <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the misuse of drugs act modification order a draft of which was laid before this house on nd may be approved <e> <s> this draft order has been considered by the joint committee on statutory instruments which made no comment

always loathe to do that australian performance at the dispatch box <e> <s> i would <e>", "<cs> i think i am on safe ground when i say that all your lordships agree that a power to stop and search is necessary for the enforcement of law and order and for the protection of law-abiding citizens and their property <e> <s> the question to which your lordships are addressing yourselves is the circumstances under which that power can be given to the police for their exercise the extent to which it should be controlled and the limits within which it should be exercised <e>", "<cs> i can see both sides of that question <e> <s> let us consider that we are outside harrods with the innocent noble lord lord mishcon and a constable who is not in uniform picks on us and not him because we look less innocent and guileless than the noble lord habitually does <e> <s> i said we because i am not imputing this to myself alone <e> <s> if i were among that suspect group i would rather be asked to turn out my pockets on the spot than to go off in an unmarked van to kensington police station <e> <s> therefore i think there are two sides to that question <e> <s> the point i want to make is that power is needed <e> <s> my examples may have been insufficient or controversial but we are dealing with an important means by which the police are empowered to protect us and all other innocent citizens <e>", "<cs> it is amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> on the list which i have which i take it is the revised list <e> <s> i will check while other noble lords are speaking <e>", "<cs> in answer to the noble lord lord donaldson yes it is amendment no <e> <s> on the marshalled list -ii which i think was printed last night <e> <s> it occurs on page about halfway down <e>", "<cs> the brief answer to that question is that not all policemen wear uniform <e> <s> a lot of policemen do their work not in uniform <e> <s> the criminal investigation department for instance habitually do not wear uniform on duty <e> <s> they would then be inhibited from doing this essential duty on duty as well as off it as the rest of them would be if the amendment was passed <e>", "<cs> the possibility of fraud and forgery are always with us <e> <s> it is possible to have a faked uniform just as it is possible to have a faked warrant card <e> <s> the penalty for impersonating a police officer is severe

station <e>", "<cs> that is not entirely a frivolous thing <e> <s> if a person wishes to be searched in private he can say that he does not wish to be searched in public <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord invited me to consider further <e> <s> i do not know whether in fact that was a way of putting the question <e> <s> i do not want to delay that <e> <s> i merely want to say that it was perhaps an unfortunate turn of phrase when i suggested to my noble friend baroness vickers that she should tell a policeman to get lost <e> <s> i regret that <e> <s> what i say is that if the noble baroness refused to be searched she might well put herself in a position where she would be courteously arrested and delicately taken to the police station <e>", "<cs> this amendment would remove the power to detain a vehicle for the purpose of a search under clause <e> <s> the power to stop a vehicle for such a search is of course conferred by section of the road traffic act <e> <s> i think that it is common ground that there should be a power to search a vehicle on reasonable suspicion indeed the noble lord has <e>", "<cs> subsection requires a constable to have reasonable grounds for suspecting that stolen goods or prohibited articles will be found before he may exercise the power to stop and search a person or a vehicle <e> <s> in moving the amendment the noble lord suggested that this criterion should be expanded to refer to the specific circumstances that gave rise to this reasonable suspicion <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has very ably illustrated in terms that i did not choose myself that the amendment is at most superfluous <e> <s> i thought that i heard him agree that the bill already made it unacceptable for a person to be stopped and searched on grounds of general suspicion <e> <s> that is what the noble lord tells us his amendment is intended to bring about <e> <s> if he says that that is already the effect of the bill he is saying what i have said <e>", "<cs> yes <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord for his courteous acknowledgement and i might add my own courteous acknowledgement of the pressure that there has been for this from his friends <e> <s> we are at one in believing that there should be a code of practice <e> <s> the opportunity will be taken to clarify this matter in the text of the code <e>", "<cs> i should be less than frank if i did not tell your lordships that i am not encouraged to expect the code to be ready by then <e> <s> i am engaged in trying to expedite this work but your lordships will know that the undertaking was recently given the work has started but the drafting of the code of practice has to be as carefully done as the drafting of the bill <e>", "<cs> i find it very agreeable to say that the committee is broadly right <e> <s> the noble lord lord mishcon has asked me not to pursue the detail of this amendment but the principle <e> <s> therefore i will not draw out the perhaps unexpected consequences if his approach was to be accepted <e> <s> however as he has suggested clause should indeed make provision for the retention of seized articles and the return of them but the appropriate way of achieving this is to apply to seizures under clause the provisions of clauses and which apply to articles seized in other circumstances <e> <s> they already make adequate provisions for the length of time articles may be retained and require the police to grant access to them on request <e>", "<cs> perhaps i might intervene at this stage and try to bring the debate together <e> <s> the noble lord

"<cs> the pleasure with which we look forward to that will be heightened by the word shortly in the noble lords remark <e> <s> the debate has turned on three issues <e> <s> behind it all and i suspect behind all the debates on this clause and perhaps on many others is the aggravation which we are anxious to avoid at the points where there is contact between the police and suspects <e> <s> i do not want to weary your lordships with a recitation of what is already in the bill to alleviate that danger <e> <s> i have spoken of it twice already on two major amendments and some of your lordships have been kind enough to say that one part of what we propose which is the introduction of guidelines is very reassuring <e> <s> it is worth bearing in mind that the aggravation which causes noble lords such as the noble lord lord gifford to table this sort of amendment will not be the same after this bill is implemented as it now is <e> <s> i say no more on that aspect <e>", "<cs> as this is committee stage and the noble lord is kind enough to allow me to intervene i want to emphasise with the greatest emphasis at my command that one of the main purposes of the bill is to stop this sort of abuse of police powers to bring it under control <e> <s> not only is there to be a code of practice not only are there requirements in clause of the bill which are themselves efficacious they will not only bite on the behaviour of the constable actually on the spot when he is doing the search but they will enable his supervising officer to see what he has done in every case to detect the different practices of different constables and for senior officers to detect the different practices of constables at different police stations and police districts <e> <s> that is why we are legislating <e> <s> the noble lord can be reassured at least on that point <e>", "<cs> there is a need for this power to search for other kinds of prohibited articles than those which <e>", "<cs> this amendment is one of those that has considerable appeal at first blush and the case both for and against it rests on what i call lawyers arguments <e> <s> i think on closer inspection that i actually prefer the bill as it is and i shall try to explain why <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is kind to ease my path to the dispatch box by the use of flattery <e> <s> i wonder whether in the light of what he and other noble lords have said he will allow me to take this matter away so that i can go for further persuasive arguments to deliver and possibly legal assistance in delivering them at a later stage <e> <s> it may be that the arguments are less persuasive than i think but i will consider before the next stage what he has said <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord forgive me <e> <s> i was advised that amendments nos <e> <s> and were grouped with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i may be wrong but if i am right does the noble lord intend to take amendment no <e> <s> with amendments nos <e> <s> and when speaking to amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> that is my mistake <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i might put to the noble lord lord mishcon a practical question of policing <e> <s> i am sure he has read

searching a large number of people under absolutely necessary circumstances he himself dealing with or people <e> <s> if he is going to keep a list of names and addresses so that they can be identified when their requests come in that is an enormous increase in the amount of work he has to do <e> <s> it enormously slows it up and it will make it less effective <e>", "<cs> i am on common ground with the noble lord lord gifford in one respect and that is that i do not think that what the noble lord lord mishcon proposes achieves what is intended because the record <e>", "<cs> i can only half-help the noble lord <e> <s> he wanted to know where he would be at report <e> <s> i can tell him where he is at committee <e> <s> he is at committee very nearly where i said he was when i last intervened in that it seems to me that the bill places a specific duty to produce a specific document containing specific information upon policemen in specific circumstances <e> <s> it is not credible that there will not be occasions when those requirements cannot be met but that is what the noble lord is seeking to avoid <e> <s> he is seeking to say that they must always be met <e> <s> if he wishes to say that it should be possible to meet them in part then i think that is something to which he should give his mind between now and report stage <e>", "<cs> i am grateful first to the noble lord lord elystan-morgan for bringing to our attention the fact that the owner of an unattended vehicle which has been searched will not immediately know on his return to the vehicle why it has been searched <e> <s> we agree that it is only reasonable that he should be entitled to information <e> <s> we therefore agree with the spirit of his amendment but we could usefully take matters one step further as has been proposed in the amendments tabled by the noble lord lord gifford <e> <s> when a search takes place even of an unattended vehicle a record will have to be made as required by

are set out in schedule and that is dependent on subsection of clause which is the clause we are looking at <e> <s> i do not think he intended to infer that there was an inconsistency there <e> <s> what he seeks to change is the basis on which a person may be considered as committing a serious arrestable offence if he interferes in what we call the administration of justice and what the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones would like us to call the course of justice <e>", "<cs> the first amendment of this group amendment no <e> <s> would remove paragraph <e>", "<cs> i have been caught a little unawares because i saw a list of groupings which in fact included amendments nos <e> <s> and and i understood that those had been accepted through the usual channels <e> <s> but as the noble lord ought to have been at the end of the usual channels obviously something has gone wrong <e>", "<cs> i am quite content to stop at that point in dealing with this <e> <s> i do not know what the military analogy is for converting a counter-attack into an attack so that one can counter-attack it oneself but i shall not be led into that <e> <s> we come back to this question of the test of what is substantial <e> <s> i return again to the question what sort of yardstick can we provide <e> <s> i think the committee will agree that we cannot manage without this test <e> <s> i chose only one example for brevity but i think it is quite clear that we do need the test for the use of these powers <e> <s> what is in the bill is a common-sense approach which can be tested in the courts if it is in doubt and it does not lead to the difficulties that we find in every alternative but i do not think we can just take it out and at the moment that seems to be all that is offered to us <e>", "<cs> i would not subscribe to the phrase an unholy mess <e> <s> i see that the noble lord has aptly put his finger on some difficulties <e> <s> we are concerned not merely with the wisdom which comes from the reflections of judges but also with the decisions which have to be taken by policemen in the field <e> <s> and i would wish to be satisfied that what is provided is workmanlike <e> <s> but i have shown to your lordships some of the difficulties which are set around the path which has been suggested <e> <s> if we are to relate the substantialness of the financial gain to the criminal i would not want to think that rich criminals would get away with more than poor criminals <e>", "<cs> i cannot usefully speak very long to the noble lords amendment <e> <s> i will merely say that i believe the amount will vary with the circumstances <e> <s> i do not think that aspect concerns noble lords <e> <s> i think that what does concern noble lords is that the circumstances may be interpreted differently when seen by different people <e> <s> therefore i would hesitate to put a figure at this stage but i have noted what the noble lord has said <e>", "<cs> it is about poisoning <e> <s> need i say more <e> <s> i will say more <e>", "<cs> the list is short for the sake of simplicity <e> <s> arson is not included in it because it is already caught <e> <s> the noble lord lord monson has accurately anticipated what i was going to say in this respect <e> <s> this is a topical matter <e> <s> if i am right in thinking that the committee are like minded with the noble lord lord monson <e> <s> i have regrettably to say that as drafted the amendment will not quite do <e> <s> this always seems to be the case <e> <s> however if the members of the committee were to nod at me in numbers then i should think we may as well have the amendment that the noble lord wants drafted by the government <e> <s> that being so i am happy to ask him to withdraw the proposed amendment on those terms <e>", "<cs> my only hesitation which perhaps i should have expressed was that i hoped we would not have an ever growing list of offences to add to the schedule <e> <s> arson can be very serious but i am reminded it can also be very minor <e> <s> so it is appropriately covered by the tests in clause rather than constituting an offence arson has different results in different places <e> <s> however if the committee are content to leave it with me i am prepared to come back with an amendment to satisfy the noble lord lord monson <e>", "<cs> the purpose of the schedule is to try to set out those offences of which really there cannot be relatively harmless examples <e> <s> i will come in a moment to no <e> <s> the indecent assault one but one cannot have a minor case of murder an insignificant case of manslaughter or a trivial case of rape <e> <s> incest with a girl under the age of is always serious <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> it is late <e> <s> i should like to develop my theme and the noble lord can puncture it when it is complete <e> <s> the purpose of the clause is to catch those offences which are not in that stark condition <e>", "<cs> no the answer is that the figures are not broken down in a way which makes it possible to relate them to the items in part i of schedule and i regret that <e>", "<cs> not without notice <e> <s> i see the force of the noble lords interest and i will write to him <e>", "<cs> i do not see how where there is both assault which means that there is either resistance or else the victim is too young to give consent and genital contact it can be thought of as trivial <e> <s> and i do not see how people can be thought of as being at risk in the normal pursuit of life if this particular activity should attract the attentions of the police and they should have the powers available to them which are not draconian of the serious arrestable offence <e>", "<cs> that was what i intended to convey by a friendly heterosexual pat <e> <s> the assault need not be serious and that is why it is coupled with the phrase gross indecency which then may combine to give the effect which a moment ago i described and which the criminal law revision committee was satisfied <e>", "<cs> my lords i will do what i can to make your lordships happy <e> <s> i readily acknowledge that these amendments are different from those which were tabled at earlier stages <e> <s> the principal difference is that they are permissive <e> <s> their purpose is to empower the secretary of state to designate the british broadcasting corporation and the independent broadcasting authority to classify works comprising certain material which has been broadcast that is material which either was broadcast live or which the broadcasting authorities made or commissioned <e> <s> thereby they make provision for the bbc and the iba in effect to classify their own material <e> <s> no doubt they would operate in much the same way as the british board of film censors <e> <s> and the criminal sanctions in the bill would apply in the same way <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the intervention of the noble lord lord mishcon in everything except that he has undermined the balance of my peroration <e> <s> because there is little more for me to say <e>", "<cs> my lords will the house permit me to interrupt and will the noble lord give way <e> <s> i do not want to enter into an exchange of salvoes on the question of how the bill should be handled but it is worth reminding your lordships that we are addressing ourselves to a particular amendment <e> <s> at no time have i said that it is the constraints of time that make us take a view of this amendment <e> <s> if there were all the <e>", "<cs> my lords may i add just a few words <e> <s> the noble lord lord monson <e> <s> is of course to be congratulated on his research <e> <s> but he actually conceded the principle in the examples which he gave <e> <s> the reason that i hope your lordships will be content with the title is that we are following a clearly drawn parliamentary convention whereby the first or principal act in any series carries the very shortest title <e> <s> we have a road traffic act which is the principal act for road traffic <e> <s> the noble lord aptly said that we also have a road traffic drivers ages <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord does that with the leave of the house i think i ought to respond to one or two things that have been said <e> <s> i have not sought to dissuade your lordships on this issue because of the peril in which it might put the bill in another place <e> <s> i have sought on entirely purist parliamentary grounds to explain that a short title ought to be an exact and accurate description of a bill and that if it stands at the head of a succession of bills it ought to address itself to the generality <e>", "<cs> my lords i intervene briefly to raise two matters <e> <s> on the first i shall refer to your lordships fairness and on the second to your lordships sense of determination <e> <s> i rise because the noble lord lord winstanley was very courteous and kind in distinguishing between me and my noble friend on the one hand and the government on the other a distinction not easily made in constitutional terms <e> <s> i am grateful to him for the innovation <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships will agree that we have gone on long enough <e> <s> i would only say that my noble friend lord nugent has my unstinted admiration for the way in which he has borne this burden <e> <s> those of your lordships who assisted him deserve much gratitude <e> <s> i hope that nobody who follows me will speak for longer <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord mishcon for his thoughtful warning of this question which would otherwise have left me in some difficulty <e> <s> as the noble lord has said the convention has been ratified by spain before legislation is actually in place in that country <e> <s> but like any other member of the council of europe spain must do what it thinks right <e> <s> that applies to portugal as well <e> <s> spain has certain provisions in its constitution which it regards as relevant in this matter <e> <s> for our part we take the view that we cannot ratify the convention without data protection legislation in force <e> <s> that is due to the particular circumstances of the case <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> with the leave of the house i beg to move that the house doth agree with the commons in their amendments nos <e> <s> to <e>", "<cs> my lords i hear the last three words of the noble lords speech in the context of what it followed <e> <s> it is nice to say friendly and grateful things about the other place and also trusting things <e> <s> i am grateful to your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this house doth agree with the commons in their amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> this amendment was moved by the government in another place i hesitate for a moment is this the amendment to which my noble friend has an amendment and will she be speaking after <e> <s> i have misunderstood the procedures <e> <s> that curtails what i shall say now <e> <s> if your lordships find that i explain anything at too much length or detail i shall be happy in the later stages to curtail it but i think that we should have on the record the basis in this house of what was done in the other place <e>", "<cs> my lords at the end of the last piece of business the noble lord lord mishcon said how difficult it was to find different words with which to thank my noble friend lady faithfull on different occasions <e> <s> i must say that my chief difficulty which i find myself reminded of on each occasion when she intervenes is the fact that she makes me feel there should be some sort of driving mirror attached to the dispatch box she addresses all her most difficult points to the nape of my neck <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the answer may be qualified and therefore will not come as readily to my lips as the noble lord or i would wish <e> <s> my noble friend gave specific examples of health data <e> <s> i understand that no such qualification is required but i want to be quite sure of that so i am going on with what i am saying now <e> <s> the noble lord seeks to draw into the record that which is visible but not audible but that is not the function of the record <e> <s> it is my privilege however to be able to convert the visible into the audible and i am happy to give the undertaking which the noble lord sought <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder therefore whether i should continue much further because i think this will assist my noble friend <e> <s> one of her concerns was where an adoption was being considered <e> <s> i think that i can put her mind at rest in that connection <e> <s> wherever health data are held in these circumstances the order <e>", "<cs> my lords i can reassure my noble friend that this is precisely what i mean <e> <s> perhaps your lordships recall the endless discussions on the definition of data the central feature of which was the very very small units into which they are broken down <e> <s> any units which are units specifically of medical information as defined are covered by the provisions of the bill which relate to that kind of data regardless of whether or not they are intermingled with other data <e> <s> my noble friend will rightly say that it may be an awful job to unscramble the data and decide what one can and cannot legitimately say but this is something which one does in ones own head with every piece of confidential information that one receives <e> <s> i am sure that on many occasions my noble friend who has discussed correspondence with me has not revealed to me the whole of it or the whole of any one paragraph <e> <s> i also have to learn to respect the confidentiality of separate pieces of information some of which are confidential and some of which are not which together comprise an item on the file <e> <s> the only way i can reassure my noble friend is to say that with a computer it is much easier to separate these bits out than it is to do it manually <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that i had already read that out <e> <s> my noble friends amendment relates to a function which is not covered by the commons amendment <e> <s> the procedures of parliament steadily narrow the area upon which we can have an influence <e> <s> if they did not do that the vanishing point would never be reached and we should still be discussing the criminal evidence bill <e> <s> because the area of my noble friends concern lies outside the amendment it is not possible for any amendment to this amendment to achieve what she wants <e> <s> that is why i have tried to take considerable care in giving what i hope will be at least in print a lucid explanation of the way in which what my noble friend wants is in fact achieved by the <e>", "<cs> my lords the difficulty is that we cannot have again all the debates which we had on this subject when the bill was orginally in this house <e> <s> i am tempted to refer my noble friend to the debates that we had at that stage and to remind her that the whole purpose of the data protection bill is to provide safeguards for the data subject <e> <s> that is what it is here for <e> <s> it is not exposing data subjects to greater risk of injury from misinformation or fright at true information <e> <s> it is intended to ensure that the evils which might spring from a misuse of the computer and computerised records shall be as far as is possible in law minimised avoided muffled or stopped <e> <s> at what point in that scale of effects the information which my noble friend wishes to introduce by means of this amendment strikes i could not precisely say but the fact is that all personal data is protected by the bill <e> <s> that is its function <e> <s> if my noble friend had wanted to change the function of the bill may i say with the greatest respect and courtesy and without wishing to give any offence whatsoever that she should have said so when the bill was in this house <e> <s> but that is no longer possible <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend does so may i point out that she inferred that the amendment failed because of a technicality <e> <s> i hope i made it clear that no amendment could achieve what she wants <e> <s> it is not a question of my noble friend having wrongly drafted the amendment <e> <s> it is simply that a vacancy does not exist for an amendment to do what she wants it to do <e> <s> that is the hard fact of the matter <e> <s> secondly we are deeply sensitive to the delicate and important nature of the relationships to which my noble friend has referred <e> <s> i should not wish anything i have said to obscure that fact <e> <s> my last point is that it really is the case that a social worker who wants to protect or keep confidential data will find it easier to do so effectively after the bill is on the statute book than was the case previously <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house doth agree with the commons in their amendment no <e> <s> which affects clause <e> <s> i think it will be for the convenience of the house if i speak also to amendments nos <e> <s> and which strike at schedule <e>", "<cs> my lords the

expressed at the prospect of little johnny having to register his data with the registrar <e> <s> while i took the view at the time that this was unlikely since johnny would be holding the data for

reassurance <e>", "<cs> my noble friend said that the noble lord himself was perhaps being a thought unreasonable <e> <s> i wonder whether i may just ask the noble lords lord gifford and lord molloy to take account of this further consideration <e> <s> the precise effect of the amendment may not be exactly what is intended <e> <s> subsection places restrictions on the use of the road traffic act power <e> <s> the effect of the amendment would be to remove them from unreasonable cases of its use <e> <s> if that is so perhaps the noble lord will spare us pursuing it further and consider between now and report stage whether he has got it right <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has been kind to me in interrupting <e> <s> the point is that the code of conduct is enforceable by the disciplinary code and so there is in fact a redress <e>", "<cs> i must detain your lordships committee for a moment longer to elaborate on what i have said <e> <s> the effect of clause is to de-limit those parts of the powers of the road traffic act which operate under this clause <e> <s> at the moment the power operates on all stops of all vehicles or vehicles selected on any criterion <e> <s> the noble lord would have it operate only on those which were selected by any reasonable criterion and not by any other <e> <s> so the amendment is defective <e> <s> however i cannot dissuade the noble lord <e>", "<cs> that is not a solution that is on the marshalled list and it is one that i would be prepared to consider <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord has moved this amendment in view of the large powers embraced within clause <e> <s> i have already explained to your lordships that they are not new powers and that clause embraces only those where the search is for people and i shall not tread that ground again <e> <s> it is also necessary to remember that there are two circumstances in which a road check may be needed <e> <s> one of them is the circumstance of urgency as my noble friend lord inglewood has mentioned <e> <s> in those circumstances the decision must be taken immediately as near the spot as possible and a road check set up as soon as notice of a murder a child abduction or whatever with the suspect proceeding in a particular direction reaches the officer in charge at the moment <e> <s> therefore i do not think that amendment no <e> <s> in the name of the noble and learned lord will work because one cannot tie an instant decision to a particular and senior rank by saying not below the rank of inspector in subsection <e> <s> for practical reasons i think your lordships will agree that that will not work <e>", "<cs> i only want to intervene on a point of theology <e> <s> i regret that i never have advice from heaven and i am told very often that where i get advice from is closer to purgatory as the night goes on <e> <s> the noble and learned lord asks us to take a course which was rejected twice in the other place <e> <s> it is not a new departure <e> <s> the reasons against it seem to me to be cogent and persuasive and to come from all round the committee <e> <s> therefore i leave the noble and learned lord with no comfort as to my view <e>", "<cs> i rise only to be helpful if i may to ask the noble lord whether he is also speaking to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i think that that is his intention <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to my noble friend and to the noble lord lord plant for putting the practicalities before us <e> <s> we are not dealing with a draconian power or a new power therefore i think the sensitivity as to its duration is perhaps not entirely necessary <e> <s> the noble lord lord plant is correct that it would mean the renewal of an approach to a senior <e>", "<cs> may i remind your lordships first that we are looking at the power to check and not to search <e> <s> if the police constable were to wish to look inside the vehicle and search then under clause the requirements that the noble lord seeks will already bite <e> <s> we are only talking about a road check <e> <s> even if what the noble lord wanted done only took seconds that is an extra quarter of an hour delay for the traffic with every stops if my arithmetic is right <e> <s> therefore i have to ask myself whether this is a sensible thing to do or a necessary thing to do <e> <s> establishing the officers name would only be useful if the person stopped wanted to pursue a complaint that he had exceeded his powers <e> <s> but the stopping of a car at a road check does not require or imply any reasonable suspicion of that car <e>", "<cs> we deliberately framed the drivers entitlements in terms of a written statement and not necessarily of a copy of the superintendents authorisation which must set out the grounds <e> <s> this is because in the case of serious crime such as terrorist crime it may be desirable not to let out too many clues as to what the police expect and where <e>", "<cs> subsection of clause makes it clear that its provisions are without prejudice to the ability of the police to stop vehicles for purposes other than the arrest of wanted persons or the tracing of witnesses to crime <e> <s> there is a wide range of circumstances in which the police may wish to obstruct roads and therefore to stop vehicles for which the restrictions set out in clause are not appropriate <e> <s> these circumstances range from the obstruction of a road that has been flooded to preventing vehicles from completing their journeys in order to prevent a breach of the peace <e>", "<cs> the purpose of publishing information is to make the broad application of the powers subject to independent scrutiny <e> <s> the relevant information here is the number of arrests and the clause already provides for that <e> <s> what charges if any are brought following an arrest is in a sense an incidental question <e> <s> after an arrest is made various things can happen <e> <s> it may be decided that a prosecution shall not after all be brought but that the person shall be dealt with by way of a caution or that the person is to be summonsed rather than charged and the summons may be issued in the calendar year following the arrest so that the prosecution could not be picked up in the relevant annual report or that the person is to be charged but charged with an offence not related to the search itself <e>", "<cs> i think it would be best if i were to write to the noble lord in answer to that question <e>", "<cs> i was wondering whether the noble lord has an answer <e> <s> but while he is considering <e>", "<cs> i always try at committee stage to look at principles as well as practices <e> <s> the noble lord wants something more precise about the use of this power but since the purpose of his inclusion of it in the bill is to exercise some supervision of the police it seems to me a little questionable although this is not on the marshalled list what he has suggested is in our minds to give the duty of making an approximation of the use of the power to the person exercising the power <e> <s> this does rather reduce the value of the control itself <e>", "<cs> i sympathise with the noble lords concern which he has made clearer to us but i wonder how often he has been held up in one of these immense queues because i cannot recall having been held up in one <e> <s> it is not a matter of general complaint it does not surface annually in the complaints made to the police complaints board or so far as i know to the individual police authorities <e> <s> it seems to me that the noble lord is perhaps trying to provide a check upon something which does not need checking in the terms that he has stated <e> <s> i do not think that the automobile association is always complaining about the length of queues produced by police road checks <e> <s> i have not heard that <e>", "<cs> of course a chief constable can say only what he knows and if the result has been something which he does not know such as the prevention of a crime which he was not to know was in preparation <e>", "<cs> it is simply a question that clause contains a specific power where an offence is suspected and clause contains a random power which is not given to constables generally but is given to constables in this particular circumstance <e> <s> the random power applies to the designated exit because the constable can then stop a vehicle leaving on a random basis <e> <s> if the vehicle is leaving from a no exit exit then he does not need that power because he already has ample grounds for suspecting an offence <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord whether it is therefore his intention not to speak either to amendment no <e> <s> or to clause stand part just so that i do not get lost <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to both my noble friends for giving both perspectives on this issue <e> <s> i do not hold it against either of them that they have intervened <e>", "<cs> i am sure your lordships will agree that the application should not be made lightly <e> <s> your lordships have already made that clear <e> <s> the power to enter and search the premises of someone who may himself be innocent of any involvement in crime is a necessary but also coercive one <e> <s> i do not disagree that only experienced officers should decide that an application for such a warrant be made <e> <s> however i am not sure that my noble friend is right in the way that he seeks to bring it about <e> <s> the fundamental safeguard is that of the scrutiny of the application by a magistrate <e> <s> if a premature or unnecessary application is made then the magistrate may and should dismiss it <e> <s> but the question of which officer makes an application can properly be dealt with as an essentially operational matter in the code of practice for the searching of premises which the home secretary will be required to issue under clause <e>", "<cs> in two minutes i want to clarify one point because the noble lord lord elystan-morgan courteously but effectively swept aside everything that i had said <e> <s> the noble lord remarked that i was concerned with clever technicalities that what mattered was the major issue and that the major issue was something new and terrifying <e> <s> i listened with the greatest respect to the noble and learned lord lord denning <e> <s> it seems to me however that the new issue is that we are about to take away from magistrates a power that they have had for years in cases where there are serious arrestable offences <e> <s> if that is really what the noble lord asks us to do i am sure that i shall have little difficulty in persuading your lordships to disagree <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is entirely right about the desirability of somebody being able to accompany the constable on certain occasions <e> <s> his amendment woud make that possible under clause <e> <s> but clause already contains this provision and applies to any warrant including clause warrants <e> <s> so the provision he wants is there as he put it elsewhere in the bill and the constable can be so accompanied <e> <s> i hope he will find that that is a reassurance <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will bear with me i think that the reassurance i may give him in this case may be qualified by terms which i cannot exactly detect at the moment <e> <s> the authority is given not by the police but by the warrant <e> <s> it will enable anybody to go with the police provided he is authorised by the warrant <e>", "<cs> i am sure we shall be in stereo before we have finished but i think the noble lord lord hooson wants to speak <e>", "<cs> can the noble lord tell me whether magistrates do not now consider whether it is likely that there is material which ought to qualify for a search warrant <e> <s> if that is the case why is it suddenly so much more difficult <e>", "<cs> when noble lords and noble and learned lords of the eminence of those to whom we have just been listening say that something is incomprehensible to them or to magistrates then of course i feel slightly impertinent if i pretend to understand the matter myself <e> <s> i hope that i do not sound blas dismissive or bland if i make that clear <e> <s> and if i sound conceited it is unintentional <e>", "<cs> this clause has grown up over a period <e> <s> the noble lord lord hooson quoted a passage from the acpo memorandum i shall not weary your lordships by repeating it <e> <s> he will i am sure remember that it was actually the middle of last year when that was drafted that the bill has since changed and that the association of chief police officers has said that it can operate this part of the bill and it thinks that it is useful <e>", "<cs> it has always been the case as i understand it that if a policeman is given the power to search for one incriminating object and finds another he should not turn a blind eye to it <e> <s> what the law prohibits is the policeman getting a warrant to look for a generality of things <e> <s> we started with wilkes where everything was general on the warrant <e> <s> there was practically just a blank sheet of paper on which names could be filled in as well as offences and articles <e> <s> we have now narrowed this down so that the policeman has to apply in very precise terms <e> <s> half of your lordships anxiety is that the terms are so very precise in clause is it not <e> <s> the policeman has to say exactly what he wants why he wants it the likelihood of it being there the fact that it is not legally privileged excluded or special material and so on <e> <s> he must then go on to convince the magistrate that nothing else will do and that he cannot get the person to produce the evidence by any other means <e> <s> that seems to me to be a strength and a reassurance and not something to alarm your lordships <e>", "<cs> i will take advice on that <e> <s> if on the other hand the police officer was looking for incriminating documents and found a dead body i think the noble lord will agree that he ought to do something about it <e> <s> it is a question of degree <e>", "<cs> my noble friend makes the agreeable and comforting supposition that the clause will be there when we get to it <e> <s> we are debating clause stand part and if we lose clause much that follows will have nothing to stand on <e> <s> i am sure that my noble friend will be able to address himself to as wide a consideration as he wishes in the context of that debate <e> <s> i am not trying to exclude him from it in any way <e> <s> what i think that most of your lordships would wish to do is to debate as we have the generality of part ii once rather than eight or nine times <e>", "<cs> my noble friend and saying that is an honest slip <e> <s> the noble lord <e> <s> lord mishcon has <e>", "<cs> the noble baronesss swift journeys first created for me an ambiguity and then resolved it <e> <s> i understand that the noble lord lord mishcon and i are in fact talking about the same thing <e> <s> i understand that an affidavit is to the higher ranks of the judiciary what an information in writing is to a magistrate <e> <s> i am assured that that is right <e> <s> therefore i am happy to say that what the noble lord has said will satisfy him is already in clause <e>", "<cs> i am afraid the noble lord will have to explain further <e> <s> if he does not want it to be supported by an affidavit what is it that he wants the affidavit to do <e>", "<cs> the noble lords suggestions usually commend themselves to me as sensible and i am grateful for his attempt to help <e> <s> i think we have perhaps gone on long enough <e> <s> of course i shall consider carefully what has been said <e> <s> however it seems to me that we have the information in writing containing in general terms a good deal of what the noble lord wants <e> <s> if the magistrate finds his case difficult he will know what questions to ask orally <e> <s> i suppose he could ask for them to be answered in writing if that was of assistance <e> <s> i think we have reached as far as we can with this <e> <s> i have tried to reassure the committee <e> <s> however this part of the bill is complex <e> <s> the complexity is unavoidable <e> <s> it arises from requests that have been made by those most closely affected by the provisions of the bill <e>", "<cs> i am not at all sure that i do see fit to reply to it because although the noble lord warned me that this was not part of the group i had in fact assumed wrongly that it was and therefore the noble lord must bear with me while i find my copy of the bill <e>", "<cs> there seems to be a certain consensus in the chamber this evening <e> <s> i do not know whether or not your lordships have noticed it <e> <s> it did catch my eye and i wondered how many lions there were in the den when daniel went there <e>", "<cs> the loyal but critical member revealed to us that it was riven by disagreement <e> <s> but it appears that what the disagreement has yielded is the preponderance of a view which favours the bill and not the amendment <e> <s> the guild wrote to us on th february to say and i quote from these letters only the relevant passages <e>", "<cs> i shall be very brief because it is getting late <e> <s> the noble lord referred to a case which i well recall <e> <s> the case turned on the interpretation of the prison rules <e> <s> however <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord give way because he has just made what i regard as an interesting admission <e> <s> he wants to be specially treated <e> <s> he wants to be treated like a doctor or a priest <e>", "<cs> the position would be the same for writers dustmen acrobats priests prostitutes anyone <e> <s> it does not matter what they do <e> <s> what matters is w hat they produce <e> <s> if a dustman writes something for journalistic purposes it is caught <e> <s> if he writes it for other purposes it is not <e> <s> so the noble lord who may have an interest in this something which had not occurred to me as i sprang nimbly to my feet need not feel that this would put authors into a special category <e>", "<cs> i am tempted to my feet because i feel that the noble lord might like to know that i wrote the speech myself <e> <s> since it is plainly judged by the strength of feeling against me going to fail i should not like it to be laid at the door of anyone else <e>", "<cs> i really wonder whether there is anybody else here to say anything more <e> <s> we have discussed this matter since the bill was first introduced in a previous parliament <e> <s> your lordships have done your best and i have done mine <e> <s> i am quite resigned to defeat if it is necessary but would it not be useful to get the matter out of the way now <e>", "<cs> i am sorry but i could not quite hear the beginning of what my noble friend said <e> <s> i thought that he was moving the amendment <e>", "<cs> my noble friend places me in a difficult position <e> <s> i cannot see that there is room to give on this matter <e> <s> we have spent minutes on it this evening <e> <s> if i undertake to ask my right honourable friend to read this debate with great care tomorrow i can do it in the wake of either a division or an undertaking that <e>", "<cs> i do not want to delay the proceedings further <e> <s> i do not want your lordships to think that your concern is not a matter of importance to my right honourable friend <e> <s> if your lordships read the second reading debate you will find that the list of outside supporters and every other point that has been made was then raised in some form or another <e> <s> many more points have been raised outside this chamber <e> <s> with the greatest respect if your lordships wish to tell the government that they are wrong this is the time to do it <e> <s> if your lordships wish to say that the government are right this is a very good time to do it <e>", "<cs> i really do not think that i have anything more to say <e>", "<cs> if i may answer the noble lords specific question both barristers and solicitors are included because they are legally qualified people <e> <s> i understand that solicitors clerks are included also for this purpose because they give advice on behalf of the solicitor and therefore come under his professional responsibility <e>", "<cs> i must have missed the noble lords question because i thought that i had just answered it <e> <s> will he please repeat it <e>", "<cs> in that case it will depend on whether or not the clerk is himself a registered solicitor <e>", "<cs> the solicitors clerk is giving advice on behalf of a solicitor who has a professional responsibility to discharge and which is discharged on his behalf by the solicitors clerk <e> <s> the noble lord is now asking whether somebody who gives advice on a body which consists in part of solicitors and in part of others is covered in the same way <e> <s> the answer i think is logically no and i believe that is also the right answer to his question <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has expressed more lucidly and with more conviction and certainly with the benefit of his experience that which i was trying to say <e> <s> this matter depends on the contractual relationship between the solicitor and the client <e> <s> when it comes to a law centre such a centre is staffed as i understand it by legally qualified people on whose behalf the adviser will speak to the client <e> <s> since the noble lord will be withdrawing his amendment the only other observation i wish to make is that it is important that this point should be generally known <e> <s> it is not necessary to have it spelt out in detail on the face of the bill so that petty offenders can understand it because they will not be reading the bill anyway <e> <s> what we want to do is to establish that this point is clearly understood <e>", "<cs> the noble lord asked a direct question to which i can give a direct answer <e> <s> as the amendment is drafted the bill would be worse <e> <s> if the noble lord has thoughts about other matters he can either write to me or table an amendment at a later stage <e> <s> but for the reason which he may now have forgotten but which i adduced at the beginning of this debate the amendment as it stands would weaken the bill and that point was quite clearly made by the noble and learned lord lord denning <e>", "<cs> i will indeed do my best to reassure the noble lord and i think i can do it perhaps by what i will try to make a brief explanation of how the system works <e> <s> your lordships will know that the purpose of excluding certain kinds of personal records the kinds already set out in clause from the scope of the new powers conferred by the bill was to protect the ability of the caring professions and their counterparts to do their job <e> <s> ministers carefully explained on many occasions that it was very unlikely that their records would ever fall within the scope of these powers in the first place since they would not constitute evidence of crime admissible in proceedings whatever their value or interest as an investigative aid <e> <s> it is now history that these reassurances failed to allay the anxieties expressed both within and outside parliament and accordingly certain categories of excluded material were established <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is right and he will find in subsection of clause <e>", "<cs> i will try not to exceed the noble lords six minutes in his admirably brief introduction <e> <s> the clause as drafted will ensure that the police may not seize items subject to legal privilege found in the course of a lawful search which is also evidence of an offence <e> <s> this amendment seeks to extend this protection to excluded materials <e> <s> but the same considerations of the confidentiality of an accuseds defence do not arise in this sort of case and i remind your lordships that it is only legally privileged material which for this reason has a special status under the rules of evidence <e> <s> excluded material may now he seized by the police in the course of the search of an arrested persons premises and may now be admitted in evidence in criminal proceedings <e> <s> it will continue to be admissible after the bill is enacted <e> <s> it may indeed constitute crucial evidence at a trial <e> <s> so the amendment would curtail existing and useful powers <e> <s> it has to be remembered that the fact that material may be excluded does not mean that it is or should be absolutely protected from coming into the hands of the police <e> <s> i remind the committee that excluded material may be obtained by the police under the second set of access conditions in schedule if there is already provision for its seizure <e>", "<cs> the principle which i am addressing is this <e> <s> the bill sets out very clearly and very strictly the grounds on which the police may have access to search for something <e> <s> it also sets out very clearly and very <e>", "<cs> if i may remind the noble lord what i said earlier is that the warrant in that case would be for drugs <e> <s> if they therefore found something else then if it was admissible and relevant evidence it would be perfectly proper for them to be able to take it <e> <s> the noble lord took my example the wrong way round <e> <s> he thought that my example was of a policeman who was looking for papers and had picked up drugs <e> <s> i have specified a case where the policeman was looking for drugs and found papers which were evidence of a serious crime committed by one of the clients of the persons whose premises he was at that time searching <e> <s> the noble lord is suggesting that although they are admissible evidence they should not be capable of being seized <e>", "<cs> as i understand it my noble friend moved amendment no and that has been put to your lordships for debate <e> <s> the noble lord lord hooson is perfectly in order to speak to his own amendment no <e> <s> a <e> <s> if my noble friend has moved amendment no <e> <s> the chair has not put amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> if the chair now puts amendment no <e> <s> the noble lord will be perfectly in order in speaking to both amendments nos <e> <s> and a and we shall all be back on the track <e>", "<cs> in view of our exchanges on the last piece of business i just wonder whether the noble lord lord hutchinson of lullington is interested in speaking to his two amendments to clause which i think are amendments a and d which strike in the same ground <e>", "<cs> then i hope what i say is not unduly extended by the undue anticipation that the noble lord was going to move his amendments <e>", "<cs> i hope i can satisfy the noble lord <e> <s> if we can take the case of a suspected offender he does not have to give a conventional permanent address <e> <s> the address can be that of a hostel where the person is staying for example or even a hotel if the person is staying there for any substantial period <e> <s> the constable will ask him how long he is going to be there <e> <s> the thames valley police have even suggested that <e>", "<cs> your lordships are making very heavy weather of what i regard as a fairly simple point <e> <s> the person can perfectly well give his home address if he wants to do so <e> <s> if there are forwarding arrangements as long as the constable is satisfied that the person will get the summons that is all this is for <e> <s> it will enable the constable not to arrest somebody for giving an unsatisfactory address simply because it happens not to be his home address <e>", "<cs> i understand not but i imagine equally that one would have to exercise discretion as to how far one pursues a trivial offence in order to bring to book a foreign visitor who is about to return to a foreign country <e>", "<cs> my noble friend has put the point very succinctly which i was going to make myself at greater length <e>", "<cs> no i am much obliged to my noble friend for speeding up the business of the committee and bringing us to a consensus <e> <s> the noble lord lord gifford referred to the offence of obstructing the highway <e> <s> i presume he is aware that it is now an arrestable offence and that a foreigner can now be arrested for it <e> <s> the other point i should have made to the noble lord and which he may be aware of is that one cannot serve a summons abroad anywhere <e> <s> therefore my noble friend is right <e> <s> either the foreigner who gives a foreign address has to remain in this country to receive the summons and thus be brought to justice or he must be let go <e> <s> the noble lords amendment would mean that he would always have to be let go <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is always anxious to help and i am grateful to him for it but with the greatest respect <e> <s> i think that the boot is on the other foot <e> <s> the noble lord lord gifford has put forward an amendment which would have the effect of protecting the wealthy foreigner or tourist and imperilling the homeless and the vagrants <e> <s> this seems to be so out of tune with his own position in politics and with what the bill seeks to achieve that it is for him to reconsider rather than the government <e>", "<cs> if the poor man stuttered i should hope the constable would treat him and his affliction with the respect that they deserved <e> <s> the point is that paragraph <e>", "<cs> i shall of course look at this before the next stage if something like reasonably readily is what is in the noble lords mind <e> <s> i never wish to encourage your lordships to too much optimism when i take something away but it would be unreasonable of me not to look at this again <e>", "<cs> clause as drafted permits the arrest of an offender if <e>", "<cs> had the noble lord asked me to come to a decision now i would have firmly said no <e> <s> i may well say the same at report stage but i will look at it between now and then <e>", "<cs> although paragraph i refers to a person <e>", "<cs> the amendment which has been put forward by the noble lord is addressed to the criterion of preventing

at subsection he will see that the first requirement is that the <e>", "<cs> yes <e> <s> in other words it is not in anticipation of a first attempt <e> <s> i see the man wrestling with cold fingers with his zip <e> <s> that seems to me to be what the noble lord calls up before us <e> <s> there has to be some precursor to his expectation that an offence is going to be committed <e>", "<cs> the power to arrest with which we are dealing here is the power to arrest where there are reasonable grounds for believing that arrest is necessary to prevent an unlawful obstruction of the highway <e>

lord elystan-morgan may not have the understanding of mathematics of a caveman but it is quite clear that the noble lord lord mishcon understands averages to some extent <e> <s> we accept that there is a point of substance identified in amendment no <e> <s> c which requires the constable to explain to the person concerned the fact that the address of some other person may be adequate for the service of a summons even when he has no suitable address of his own <e> <s> it could perhaps happen that the arrested person did not realise that an alternative address would do <e> <s> though i have no doubt that in practice police officers would draw attention to the acceptability of an alternative i accept that there is nothing to require them to do so in the bill as drafted <e> <s> i am not quite sure how we should meet that point <e> <s> the noble lord will recognise that we have had little time to consider that and we shall need to be careful of inhibiting police action in the sort of situation where the suspect makes off or makes ready to do so and there is no time to engage in any sort of explanation <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord just allow me to reassure my noble frend to save a future debate <e> <s> the requirement rests in clause <e>", "<cs> i think that i would be wise given the experience of those who drafted and the experience of he who criticises to take leave to consider that point between now and report <e>", "<cs> i can see the attraction of what my noble friend and the noble and learned lord says <e> <s> there are two approaches are there not <e> <s> one would be to do what we have done in the bill which is to say that everything of this nature shall be struck out except that which is reserved in schedule <e> <s> schedule is a relatively short

spoken to which is what we are at present expecting <e>", "<cs> it will not be possible for me to answer the speeches as briefly as i might have wished because noble lords attach great importance to them and they have spoken to them in some detail <e> <s> as it is now drafted clause makes it clear that anybody voluntarily attending a police station is free to leave at any time unless he is placed under arrest <e> <s> to this extent it is simply declaratory of the present law but the clause goes further than that by requiring the police to inform the person that he is under arrest not just if

station <e> <s> to be greeted with the reassurance that they have not yet been arrested so they will not be kept there is not the best way to treat them <e>", "<cs> as to the noble lords first supplementary question it seems to us that the act of parliament should state the law and that it should be explained and its implementation should be regulated by the code of conduct which i suspect may be more freely available and much easier to understand for people interested than the act of parliament itself <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> the noble lord asks a shrewd question <e> <s> it is clearly right that a person detained in a police station should be aware of his rights <e> <s> the noble lord will be aware as he has been prompted by noble friends or noble allies of the extent to which the police are required both to protect those rights and to inform the person in the police station of those rights <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord give way <e> <s> the difference between the code of practice and the bill and he has brought it to the forefront of the argument is surely this if it is in the bill that somebody must be told then willy-nilly they must be told <e> <s> but if it is in the code of practice that they have these rights then it is up to the perceptive police constable or the station sergeant to decide whether the old lady who has just been mugged ought to be told upon reception that she has a right to leave the police station if she has not been arrested <e> <s> it is a matter of discretion <e> <s> the amendment on the marshalled list does not give that discretion and i think it is mistaken <e>", "<cs> i must start by thanking the noble baroness for putting her finger on a gap that has crept unintentionally into the protection which the bill and its associated codes of practice provide <e> <s> when my right honourable friend the minister of state replied to a similar amendment in committee in another place he was able to draw attention to the codes of practice on the detention treatment and questioning of suspects by the police <e> <s> he pointed to provisions ensuring that the questioning of juveniles should not take place in the absence of an adult except in an emergency whether or not the youngster is suspected of a crime <e>", "<cs> my lords noble lords opposite obviously share the proper sense of outrage that we have over this extraordinary affair <e> <s> if i can try to recall all the questions that i have been asked and answer them in turn i am grateful to the noble lord lord mishcon for his words of congratulation to our security forces and i think that the whole house would wish to endorse that <e> <s> might i add that the anti-terrorist squad which he particularly singled out for praise was operating in this instance in conjunction with her majestys customs and the essex police who share the credit <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable and learned friend the foreign and commonwealth secretary is i am sure making urgent representations but as i say the situation is developing <e> <s> i cannot bring noble lords further up to date beyond saying that some of the passengers on this aircraft are british <e> <s> whether they are inside the aircraft or elsewhere i cannot at the moment say <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that there were two chauffeurs and one attach but i could not be certain that the information is complete <e>", "<cs> my lords my view goes further <e> <s> i think it is more than unfortunate <e> <s> i think it is disastrous that this should have happened at any time and particularly unfortunate that it should have happened now <e> <s> i believe that conduct of this sort brings diplomacy into ill repute <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no information as to what the people on the scheme may have said when confronted with the situation at stansted airport <e> <s> as i said people are in custody all of them in the care of the metropolitan police who at present are entitled to keep them even beyond hours <e>", "<cs> my lords if as i understand the aircraft was in nigerian airspace it was under the orders of nigerian air traffic control and i understand the recall was exercised by nigerian air traffic control in what terms or under what penalties i could not say <e> <s> but i do not doubt that there are civil emergencies which could justify such a recall with no sinister reason <e> <s> i do not know more than that <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that that probably requires an answer that ought to be given by a lawyer <e> <s> i know what my laymans answer is but i would not like to commit the government to sharing it <e>", "<cs> my lords if an application for extradition were to be made it would not be made by us because the people who are under arrest are already here <e>", "<cs> my lords it was a cargo aircraft <e> <s> to that extent i believe that it was not a scheduled aircraft unless there is a scheduled cargo flight which i do not know <e> <s> i referred earlier to a second british caledonian aircraft and said that i had no news that there was one <e> <s> what may have been in noble lords minds was that the british caledonian company for obvious reasons prudently recalled one of their own aircraft which was on the way to lagos <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe so but my basis for belief is no more than that of my noble friends who have read the newspapers <e> <s> i ought to emphasise that this is a rapidly developing and recent event and i am anxious not to be drawn into making statements which are based on supposition <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe protocol dictates that i should advise the noble lord to ask the usual and noble channels about how to handle this <e>", "<cs> my lords i can confirm that the object of having this period of review is indeed to ensure that the public can have a justified confidence in the machinery being tested <e> <s> as i have said already it is too early to say what the results of this period of monitoring will be but i can assure the noble lord that the period will not be curtailed unless there is very clear evidence that it is not necessary to extend it <e>", "<cs> my lords the intoximeter is designed solely to test for alcohol in the blood <e> <s> the requirements for testing for drugs remain unaltered <e>", "<cs> i believe that i can save the noble lord the embarrassment of irritation by sharing and sympathising with him over his difficulty regarding the groupings <e> <s> we have a difficulty with the volume of amendments <e> <s> i do see the relevance of what the noble lord was saying <e> <s> he was not addressing himself to this specific rubric of amendment no <e> <s> b but to the principle of when the detention clock starts <e> <s> i can certainly say that we want to have a specific time for the detention clock to start and for that time to be clearly marked <e>", "<cs> as i understand it the clock begins to tick upon arrival at the non-designated police station <e> <s> the only provision i recall in the bill for the pushing back of the hands of the clock as it were is where people are arrested a long way from home and have to he transferred from one police force to another and are not questioned under the first <e>", "<cs> the amendments to which i spoke were amendment no <e> <s> which is the substantive amendment amendments nos <e> <s> and clause stand part and amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i think that i can help the noble lord by saying that his amendments nos <e> <s> and strike at the amendments that i have put on the marshalled list and therefore this would be a very suitable time for him to say why he prefers his scheme to mine <e>", "<cs> perhaps i can help the noble lord lord plant further by pointing out that his amendments no <e> <s> and appear to be directed to achieve the same ends as his amendments nos <e> <s> and to the amendment on the order paper so we can expedite matters by taking all these issues on board at once <e> <s> they are in fact the same issues <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord will allow me to say to expedite matters that the question of a probationer constable seems to be slightly different <e> <s> i will undertake to look at that although of course <e> <s> i cannot say what i shall come back with <e> <s> the noble lord wanted to exclude probationers as opposed to constables as a complete rank <e> <s> that is a different matter which i shall look at <e>", "<cs> i have to say two things <e> <s> first the home office is always interested in good practice and it is clear that it is our intention that the role of the custody officer should be exercised by someone of independent mind and intelligence <e> <s> secondly on the face of the bill the requirements made on the custody officer make it very difficult for him to be overborne <e> <s> if at any stage someone senior to him takes a decision which he feels needs to be called into question or which is contrary to what in his judgment he believes appropriate he is required to take that concern to a person who is senior in rank to that senior person so we are very much aware of the noble lords concern <e>", "<cs> this amendment seeks to require a constable who searches a person under this clause to make a detailed record as soon as is practicable <e> <s> i entirely sympathise with the principle underlying the amendment but i believe that its requirements are already effectively covered in the bill and the draft codes of practice <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend and i would add a couple of points <e> <s> the first is that we want to beware of the danger of assuming that there are different orders of importance or enforceability in regard to matters which are in the bill and in the code of practice because as soon as your lordships start to elevate pieces of the code of practice from the code into the bill you draw attention not only to their importance but also in your lordships apparent opinion to the lesser importance of things that remain in the code of practice <e> <s> the inference from that is that the code of practice does not matter so much <e> <s> that is something we should be on our guard against <e>", "<cs> i am quite content for my noble friend to discuss this with my other noble friend for a moment if he wishes to do so for obvious reasons <e> <s> but the first reflection that occurs to me is that the theft by the constable which is what it would be would be a theft whatever the state of the law in relation to the keeping of records <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord sometimes comes to my aid and sometimes to my embarrassment <e> <s> it is usually best to find out which before i speak <e>", "<cs> even if i did have a different view after that your lordships would not believe me <e>", "<cs> i beg to move amendment no <e> <s> a to which i spoke with amendment no <e> <s> a <e>", "<cs> i beg to move amendment no <e> <s> b to which i also spoke with amendment no <e> <s> a <e>", "<cs> clause deals with searches of a person and the premises or vehicle he was in at the time of his arrest <e> <s> under subsection <e>", "<cs> if i can join in this it is quite true that the part of the bill the noble lord referred to only permits the search of premises for evidence of an arrestable offence or arrestable offences connected with or similar to that offence <e> <s> but that part of the clause deals with entry to premises whereas what we are talking about is the search of a person <e> <s> other innocent persons may be inside the premises and as the noble and learned lord lord denning has already reminded us in committee on this bill the englishmans home is his castle and therefore rights of entry without permission should be very carefully circumscribed <e> <s> that is why there is a distinction between the two requirements <e> <s> if the noble lord were to push the logic of our position to the extreme i suppose the proper response to what i think is an agreed view that it should be right for a policeman to be able to search somebody he has arrested for evidence of a different offence if he then has reason to suspect that he may have committed one or been associated with it would require that we should extend that power to the englishmans home as well <e> <s> that i would regret and so i hope that your lordships will be content to leave the bill as it is <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say in the interests of brevity that my noble friend clearly does not recall the difference between hats and jackets which we established i think on the second day of committee <e> <s> i will not bore him with that now but i will just say that in principle we are agreed on this amendment which is a corollary to clause <e> <s> i am sorry that i cannot elicit the enthusiasm for my noble friend that i always have to have for my pronouncements at this box <e> <s> we are obliged to the noble lord even in his absence and will come forward with something at the next stage <e>", "<cs> would the noble and learned lord be so kind as to allow me to come forward with something very similar but not exactly the same at the next stage <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord will forgive me for intervening but i am getting a little confused <e> <s> if he is speaking to amendments nos <e> <s> and i think that no <e> <s> was called then we dealt with this issue in a government amendment which has been agreed to <e> <s> if he is speaking to no <e> <s> we passed it on the marshalled list <e> <s> so i am not quite sure what the noble lord is about <e>", "<cs> i thought that the noble lord supported us in amending the bill in this sense with a government amendment a moment ago <e>", "<cs> i am so sorry but will the noble lord tell us whether he is speaking to amendments nos <e> <s> and because i spoke to them and he agreed to them <e> <s> they appear misleadingly perhaps under his name <e>", "<cs> may i save the noble lord some work because this is what we want to achieve <e> <s> it appears under the noble lords name but i have spoken to it previously <e> <s> we have agreed to the first leg of these amendments and having spoken to them i can merely say that i beg to move amendment no <e> <s> and then say that i beg to move amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> we shall have it in the bill and the noble lord will be happy <e>", "<cs> this amendment has been prompted by the concern that we may have overlooked the need for the police to be able to retain for a forensic examination articles taken from a person on his arrest who is then released on police bail <e> <s> this concern may not be fully founded because subsection is concerned only with articles seized under subsections and <e>", "<cs> this amendment is meant to ensure that the custody officer is entirely independent of the processes of investigation <e> <s> i have some sympathy with the suggestion <e> <s> it has been pointed out that the royal commission recommended in paragraph that the custody officer should be independent of the investigations but they also recognised that in some stations this will not be possible for practical reasons <e> <s> in the smaller stations there will simply not be sufficient manpower available to ensure that in every case the custody officer is and always has been independent of the investigation of the offence <e>", "<cs> i would ask your lordships not to accept that motion because of the alternative clauses which your lordships have agreed to put into the bill <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord has been most helpful and brought us to a fairly wide passage in the bill <e> <s> i hope your lordships will think that it is proper to deal with the amendments so far spoken to the first three of the group spontaneously suggested earlier this afternoon <e> <s> i respond to the noble and learned lord by saying first that we recognise that the idea that it is lawful or proper for the police to detain a person whom they have arrested for an offence in order to question him before he is brought before a court on a charge is a relatively recent development in criminal procedure <e> <s> until well into this century questioning was simply not part of the duties of the police at all <e> <s> the courts repeatedly held that the police should not do the questioning <e> <s> they held that that was a matter for themselves and nobody else <e>", "<cs> i hate to interrupt the noble lords oratory <e> <s> when he is moved by the content of what he is saying he has a style and he has a very good and impressive flow now <e> <s> but i think i ought to remind your lordships of this <e> <s> the code of practice will be subject to parliamentary procedure and is tied into the bill by disciplinary proceedings <e> <s> that means that if the custody officer or anybody else breaches the code he will be subject to punishment <e> <s> in section the code provides that an arrested person must be cautioned at the very latest at the point of arrest that is to say before he even comes to the custody officer as is suggested in the amendment <e> <s> that is earlier than the amendment proposes <e> <s> in addition he must be cautioned in full before being questioned or inteviewed on any occasion <e> <s> he must be reminded that he is under caution if there is a break in the questioning and if there is a substantial break the caution must be repeated in full <e> <s> the time and place at which cautions are given must be recorded in the custody record and so on <e> <s> i think that the safeguard which the noble lord wants in this respect is stronger in the bill than in the amendment <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether it would be better to speak to amendment later <e> <s> we have quite a lot on board already <e> <s> the noble lord lord mishcon has returned to an issue to which we spoke briefly on a previous amendment but which was not fully raised hitherto and that is the relative importance of the code of practice and the bill <e> <s> the noble lord will correct me if i am wrong but i understood him to be saying that here is a right so important that it should not be left in the code of practice it ought to be put on the face of the bill <e>", "<cs> i acknowledge the force with which the noble lord has spoken but not so much the force of what he has said <e> <s> the way in which constables sergeants and the ranks above behave is determined by the orders under which they work and the regulations by which they are bound to abide <e> <s> we are looking at a code of conduct enforced by the chief officer of police through all the subordinate ranks down to the custody officer and the police constable <e> <s> the effect of that code of conduct is to require the suspect to be given the caution at an earlier stage than is suggested <e> <s> there is not much more that i can say on that matter <e>", "<cs> we must not go on on this for too long <e> <s> on that i would merely say that the noble lord will remember that the code of conduct will have the authority of parliament because it will be published under parliamentary authority and subject to parliamentary reversal <e> <s> it is not called an act but it is the will of parliament <e>", "<cs> i cannot leave so many points unanswered hut i will try to be brief <e> <s> the noble lord quotes from the royal commission <e> <s> i quote from them also <e>", "<cs> with respect i always regret it when i choose a word that gives the wrong impression <e> <s> i said bickering because what we are talking about is the relatively unimportant aspect of how what we all want to achieve should be achieved <e> <s> we would be arguing furiously if the rights of the individual were in doubt <e>", "<cs> i should like to make it clear that i do not intend to make a whole series of further speeches <e> <s> the noble lord lord foot has given an able and persuasive speech about amendment no <e> <s> which was not moved <e> <s> your lordships will therefore forgive me if i do not reply to that <e> <s> everything that i have already said has been relevant <e>", "<cs> with great presumption may i put into the noble and learned lords mind the provisions of clause which states <e>", "<cs> the supreme irony of the position is that it is because of the confait case that we are all standing here debating this question <e> <s> the code of conduct was designed to meet these conditions <e> <s> the provisions of the bill meet them specifically <e> <s> i feel that probably we have heard enough on this to be able to come to a conclusion <e>", "<cs> i should like to put on the record the options that we have about this amendment <e> <s> the introduction into clause of the words seek to does appear to be unnecessary and possibly to reflect a misunderstanding of the syntax of the provision which is already teleological in form <e> <s> the purpose of detaining someone is to obtain evidence not simply to seek to obtain it in precisely the same way as the purpose of raising ones arm in class is to catch the teachers eye not to seek to do so <e> <s> the teacher can of course decline to interrupt the lesson but it would be syntactically very odd to say that it is necessary to raise ones arm in order to seek to catch his eye <e> <s> indeed the enterprise would be pointless if one knew that failure was certain <e> <s> the subsection as drafted has the virtue of carrying the clear implication that the legal justification for continuing detention and this is where i come to a matter of interest for the purposes of questioning is related to the probability that he will co-operate to the extent of answering <e>", "<cs> i am happy to undertake to do that <e>", "<cs> i congratulate the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge on the briefest complete speech we have had during this committee stage <e> <s> i cannot i am afraid equal his record <e> <s> may i begin by accepting what the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones has suggested we should do take the amendment to mean what we take the context to make it mean rather than what it does mean because one of the odder things that it means as drafted is that whether or not you want a solicitor to be present you have to wait until the solicitor is present before you can answer an questions <e> <s> i shall not address myself to the unintended results i shall assume that what is intended is that an arrested person may be detained for the purposes of obtaining evidence by questioning him only if the questioning takes place in the presence of a solicitor if he wants it <e>", "<cs> i think so <e> <s> there is access to a solicitor <e> <s> i shall not read it out again <e> <s> the noble and learned lord read it right <e>", "<cs> the noble lords amendment strikes out clause i <e> <s> the purpose of clause is to require the custody officer to make a note on the custody record when a person who has not been charged is by him authorised to be kept in detention <e> <s> i said at the outset that i think the noble lord is seeking to achieve what he wants to achieve from the wrong direction because what he wants to achieve for the person detained is a written notice of his rights and what he is seeking to do is to convert the custody record into such a written record for the prisoner to have to hand all the time <e> <s> the noble lord will forgive me if i address myself not to the substance but to the intention of this amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i can help <e> <s> not being a usual channel i may get it wrong but in practical terms it might be helpful <e> <s> if the noble baroness adduces the general principles now when she comes to the particular amendments she can speak to them briefly <e> <s> i propose to answer only to the two amendments nos <e> <s> ze and zc which were agreed <e> <s> i think the noble baroness will find that i have different answers to her different amendments so she will be well advised to keep them apart <e>", "<cs> the sympathies of the noble baroness with the young are shared on both sides of the committee <e> <s> i sympathise with the purpose underlying her amendments which i take to be to ensure that parents guardians or other persons with specific responsibilities for the welfare of an arrested juvenile are told at the earliest practical moment not only of the facts of and grounds for detention as is required by clause but preferably at the same time as the juvenile himself is told <e> <s> but when we come to practicalities i do not find it so easy to follow her plan <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness says that that is not the case but it is what she has in her amendment <e> <s> if she means something else it would be interesting to know what <e>", "<cs> sadly a number of people do from time to time die in police custody <e> <s> i was not aware that any of them had died because the police had thought they were drunk when in fact they were ill may i quote because the noble lord referred to it and i shall refer to it and i think it would be best that the committee should know what i am referring to from the code of practice paragraph <e>", "<cs> i think the noble baroness would be advised to move amendment no <e> <s> e <e>", "<cs> such a contribution from the noble baroness is so rare i would not want to miss one <e>", "<cs> if the noble and learned lord looks a gifthorse in the mouth for too long it will say nay <e> <s> as the noble baroness explained at an earlier stage subsection refers to decisions under section of the children and young persons act which has not been brought into force <e> <s> clause already requires the parents of an arrested juvenile or in certain cases other persons to be informed of his detention the reason for it and the place of detention <e> <s> i agree that it would be reasonable for them to be provided with the additional information required by the amendment if section were to be brought into force <e> <s> the government are therefore able to accept this amendment in principle but the drafting requires a little further thought <e> <s> i hate to add that little codicil but i hope the noble baroness will be content with the intention behind my words <e>", "<cs> if the committee would permit me i think i ought to speak because i think the rule book says if the committee say no we have to vote <e> <s> as i understand it we would then put a faintly defective amendment into the bill and we would have to amend it at the next stage <e> <s> what i am offering to do is to provide a government amendment with the same effect as the noble baroness intends <e> <s> i can only do that if she withdraws her amendment <e>", "<cs> subsection <e>", "<cs> these arrangements cannot be made instantaneously <e> <s> it is often necessary for the police to detain a person in custody until he has somewhere else for him to go <e>", "<cs> i knew that it would happen <e> <s> are we talking to amendments nos <e> <s> zc and zb together <e> <s> that is what i am about to do <e> <s> your lordships can ignore any bits that you do not think apposite <e> <s> i think however that this is right <e> <s> the amendments would require the custody officer to give detained persons a written copy of the grounds for detention before and after charge <e> <s> clauses and require that this information be given to the detained person orally <e> <s> i should remind the committee that paragraph of the draft code of practice on the treatment and questioning of suspects entitles a detained person or his legal representative to obtain a copy of his custody record on his release or within months thereafter <e> <s> the grounds for detention will be recorded there under paragraph <e>", "<cs> i think this is the survivor of the original group and that i have already spoken to it <e> <s> i will not weary your lordships by giving again our reasons for not accepting it <e>", "<cs> by way of preface let me say that if the noble baroness is woken tomorrow morning at the hours of one two or three oclock regrettably it will be likely to be by the division bell and not her telephone <e> <s> the government fully accept the objective which my noble friend seeks to achieve by her amendment <e> <s> it is extraordinary how probing amendments seem to succeed in this place <e> <s> we are prepared to accept the amendment <e> <s> it is clearly far better for arrested juveniles so far as is practicable to be transferred into the care of a local authority instead of being held in a police station <e>", "<cs> i think i should say that this is a useful time for an exchange to be put on the record but i cannot commend the amendment as such to your lordships <e> <s> again we entirely share the concern which has been expressed <e> <s> resort to secure accommodation to restrict the liberty of young persons who are in the charge of local authorities should clearly be confined to those cases where it is necessary <e> <s> the general restrictions on the use of secure accommodation are now to be found in section a of the child care act and the secure accommodation no <e> <s> regulations <e> <s> however when the regulations were drawn up it was thought best to exclude certain categories of cases and one such category was that of arrested juveniles <e>", "<cs> i understand the concern that has been expressed about the absence of any specific reference in this bill to the conditions that are to apply when an arrested juvenile is in the charge of a local authority pending his first appearance in court <e> <s> if it happens that an arrested juvenile cannot be transferred to a local authority but continues to be held in a police station his detention there would be subject to the terms of this legislation under a code prepared thereunder but a local authority would not be bound to observe a code <e>", "<cs> the clause before your lordships clause requires an officer of at least inspector rank to review the detention of an uncharged person within six hours and thereafter at nine-hourly intervals <e> <s> the first of these amendments would permit an officer below the rank of inspector to perform this duty if no other officer was available <e> <s> as a corollary to that weakening of the safeguards the second amendment would delete the provision in subsection <e>", "<cs> looking at the bill i am not certain that i can give that assurance because we have in subsection <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness has not repeated what she said <e> <s> i do not think there is much point in my repeating what i said since i have nothing new to say <e>", "<cs> i think we have to think very carefully about this issue because the purpose of the limits on detention before charge is to ensure that the police have adequate time to investigate offences while protecting the detained person <e> <s> regrettably many crimes are now committed by persons under <e> <s> many of these will be serious without constituting serious arrestable offences <e> <s> the fact that it is a young person who is suspected will not make the investigation simpler <e> <s> precisely the same amount of time may be needed to complete the investigation as if it had been committed by an adult <e> <s> in fact i cannot see that the age of the offender makes any difference to the complexity of the case <e> <s> the fact that all kinds of additional safeguards for juveniles are required by the draft codes of practice is likely to mean that the investigation will take more time rather than less compared with an adult <e> <s> if the police cannot other than in wholly exceptional circumstances begin interviewing an arrested juvenile before his parents or some other responsible adult have come to the police station it is not difficult to see how a couple of hours could slip away before the investigation could even get off the ground and that would leave very little time if the noble baronesss amendments were accepted <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to both of my noble friends for raising this point and i absolutely endorse what my latter noble friend said about time limits <e> <s> but i would direct the former of my noble friends lady faithfull to clause which we have just discussed <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is of course quite right to point out that a person who is placed under arrest loses his liberty from that moment and not from the time when he is taken into a police station <e> <s> nevertheless i hope that i can explain to the committee why the government concluded that it was necessary for the detention clock to be started at the later point even in the generality of straightforward cases to which the noble lord referred <e>", "<cs> we were dealing with the generalities of cases and the noble lord has brought in a particular case <e> <s> for the first part i should say that it is not the custom of the police to keep people penned up in vehicles for great lengths of time until it is convenient for them to move them <e> <s> they certainly do have to wait until they have a sufficient number of people to move <e> <s> that is why i said that there could be confusion if a batch of arrested people arrived at the police station all in connection with the same offence and had different individual custody clocks running each one differing by a few minutes <e>", "<cs> may i reinforce the words of the noble lord <e> <s> it is not merely the object of the exercise it is a requirement under clause <e> <s> it is a legal requirement <e> <s> it is not a question of when it is handy convenient or fits in with the policemans tour of duty <e> <s> it is his duty to take him as soon as practicable <e>", "<cs> i have only one thought to add to your lordships minds at this stage because i think i have made our position clear that is the faint irony of the position that the noble lord has so often said that the code of practice does not give sufficient guarantee and that there should be a provision on the face of the bill but now that we have it on the face of the bill in clause he is not satisfied by that either <e> <s> i hope your lordships will support me and not him in the division which i think he is about to call <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord has experience of police constables having arrested someone and handing him over to a person who is not a police constable to take him to the police station i shall be very interested to hear of it <e> <s> the duty is quite clear that the person has to be taken with all practical speed to the police station and he has to be taken by a policeman <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has referred to an amendment which i think has been taken off the marshalled list but we are nonetheless grateful to him for drawing attention in this amendment to an oversight on our part <e> <s> it may indeed happen from time to time not i hope more than very occasionally that a person who is detained at a police station and is then taken out of the station for some reason falls ill or may be injured in an accident <e> <s> if he has to be taken to hospital it is i think clearly desirable that any time he spends there does not count towards the total limits on detention in the same way as time spent in hospital does not count under subsection as drafted if he is taken

northern ireland <e> <s> through forgetfulness rather than discourtesy i did not reply <e> <s> the answer is no it applies to england and wales <e>", "<cs> very good i stand corrected <e>", "<cs> this clause has been replaced by a previous amendment and therefore i hope that your lordships will not allow it to stand part of the bill <e>", "<cs> if i have managed to follow the noble lords argument i think that i have the answer if i have not he will tell me <e> <s> the effect of these amendments would be to require that where the subject matter of a complaint is also the subject of criminal proceedings and where the question of guilt in those proceedings has not yet been settled or where a person has been convicted then any material in the report of the investigation into the complaint

recognition of the genuine concern felt by many police officers that they should not be at risk of losing either job or rank without having had the opportunity of a lawyer to present their cases for them <e> <s> it was certainly not because police officers facing disciplinary charges were in any sense disadvantaged compared with the majority of the working population <e> <s> legal representation at an internal disciplinary hearing before an employer is still the exception rather than the rule and the effect of these amendments would be to turn a perfectly justifiable position into one of privilege for members of the police service <e>", "<cs> i cannot understand my noble friend but perhaps we can between us understand each others position <e> <s> a police constable in court on a criminal charge is not what we are discussing <e> <s> we are talking about disciplinary charges internal to his service <e> <s> i do not know of any other service which provides the privilege which

noble friend <e> <s> i am not sure that the army is a good comparison <e>", "<cs> so are the fire brigade and the prison service <e> <s> there are many others <e> <s> it seems to us that these amendments would put the police in a position different from members of almost any other service <e>", "<cs> i cannot say that i see tremendous compulsion or force in the argument that a police

talking about is not paying for embarrassment <e> <s> we are talking about costs <e> <s> the expenses of legal representation which have been granted to the police for their own election at their own request seem to me to be no different in kind or quantity from the costs of firemen prisoner officers or members of any other disciplined and uniformed service or indeed many other services which are not uniformed <e>", "<cs> as we want to move this on will the noble lord be kind enough to tell me why the fact that a member of the public may not co-operate with the police should render a policeman liable to disciplinary proceedings <e>", "<cs> is my noble friend prepared to speak to his other amendment or are we covering the ground sufficiently closely to take it <e>", "<cs> we must obviously draw this discussion to a conclusion <e> <s> i want to put my cards on the table and start by saying that i should not want it thought that i believed the police any less splendid and admirable people

extensive powers and responsibilities <e> <s> the area is the police area and is defined by section of and schedule to the police act to mean the area for which a police force is maintained <e> <s> it is the whole area <e> <s> as the essence of consultation consists of local consultation and people getting to know the local police and with respect to the noble lord lord gifford not necessarily the chief constable or the commissioner because he cannot spend his time going round to village meetings it depends on the size of the area <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord pitt is fairly familiar with an area of london i know fairly well brixton and lambeth <e> <s> does he not think that the consultative arrangements there without any rigid direction or statutory base at all have led to the most

clause which he has suggested will have the practical benefits for the special constabulary which he would hope <e> <s> the object of subsections and are to make sure that every chief officer appoints special constables and does so in substantial numbers <e> <s> all chief constables already make use of special constables <e> <s> many have a set force establishment figure which would meet the requirement which the noble lord wishes to impose on them but establishments do not necessarily impose recruits <e>", "<cs> that is precisely what makes the duty my noble friend would lay on my right honourable friend impossible to perform because there is no national body for him to consult <e> <s> it may be that the remedy lies in the hands of the special constabulary <e>", "<cs> my noble friend

stolen document held in good faith on behalf of a client by a wholly respectable firm of solicitors or accountants <e> <s> in either case the law provides only for the issue of a warrant to enter search and seize <e> <s> however having invented the new machinery in schedule to which i shall come in a moment under which an order to produce may be issued in place of a search warrant in the case

supports him in this gives rise to consequential complications then of course we would be proposing consequential simplification <e>", "<cs> my lords clause of the bill gives to the police specific powers to search for evidence of an arrestable offence <e> <s> the subsequent clauses provide that some classes of evidence shall never be available for this kind of search and that others shall be

third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords in committee we did indeed accept an amendment moved not by the government but by the noble lord lord elystan-morgan to leave out subsection of clause which said exactly what subsection of clause now says <e> <s> the chief effect of these subsections was to preserve intact the power of the police under common law to arrest in order to prevent or deal with a breach of the peace but we concluded that it was not necessary to have two identical subsections in different clauses to do the same thing <e> <s> accordingly subsection of clause disappeared as proposed by the noble lord lord elystan-morgan leaving subsection of clause to do the work on its own <e> <s> it also makes it clear that clause does not apply to arrestable offences or schedule

station will inadvertently get out <e> <s> the first thing is that it may already be too late when the solicitor gets to the police station <e> <s> the fact that a solicitor has been asked to come and attend to a particular client will be known to his staff and if it is known to other people as a result of a purely chance conversation that a particular criminal is in the police station and is being

detention without charge of hours <e> <s> in certain circumstances where a person is arrested in one part of the country and has to be transferred to another the total time in police custody may

undesirability of treating a circuit judge as the suitable level of sanction on occasions when he is readily available my noble friend has made it quite clear <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord denning pointed out that we are dealing with cases of urgency <e> <s> it is important that we should have procedures which policemen can operate urgently and they would have to try to discover whether or not a circuit judge was readily available <e> <s> that would be another thing to do in an emergency <e> <s> so i hope that i have said enough to persuade your lordships to accept what we offer and

considering amendments nos <e> <s> and together <e> <s> they are linked by a common factor which is that they both seek to incorporate into the text of the bill requirements which already appear in

division on an amendment moved by the noble lord lord hutchinson of lullington <e> <s> the proposal in that amendment was that a custody officer at a police station should be required to give various pieces of information to anyone attending it voluntarily <e> <s> the information was more detailed but the broad principle is the same and i hope that your lordships will be content if i only remind you briefly of why we decided not to allow it <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully accept that throughout the country there are men and women who remain constables throughout their police career in many cases from their own choice who would be able to carry out a custody officers responsibilities by reason of their experience and personal qualities <e> <s> nevertheless the requirement in the bill that the custody officer be of sergeant rank is an important safeguard and i do not think that we should do anything to weaken it <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i do not have the figure of

was not intending to press her amendment because she was accepting the one that followed <e> <s> i am not sure that she expressed that in the record and that is why the noble lord the deputy speaker is putting the question that he is <e> <s> if the noble baroness wanted to withdraw it i have tried to keep my foot in the door long enough for her to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment would omit paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall try to do two things in that respect <e> <s> the first is simply to remind your lordships that the child or young person will be held not in a police station but in local authority care which clearly divorces this from any suspicion of oppressive police use <e> <s> the second is that it merely repeats provisions that we already have which do not at present give rise to this alarm <e> <s> i have tried to make clear that we are merely re-incorporating existing statute <e> <s> however the noble and learned lord has wisely referred to the codes of practice <e> <s> if on reflection we find that there is still some alarm on this matter and if we find that it is appropriate so to do i can give no commitment we would make an amendment in the next draft <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has put his finger on the centre of what i was trying to say <e> <s> the provisions which the noble baronesss amendment calls down in defence of the young people are provisions designed for all local authorities responsible for young people for considerable periods of their life <e> <s> for instance if they are remanded in custody it may be that the case goes on for a year or more <e> <s> these people are the people we were discussing a moment ago who are going to be dealt with very soon <e> <s> there are two considerations here <e> <s> one is that the authority should not be under a duty which is appropriate to the long care guardianship as it were of the child and the other is that in the brief time available it may be very difficult for them to do precisely the things that are set out in the statute both because the time is not long enough and because they are not appropriate <e> <s> so i hope the noble baroness will feel that we have put sufficient protection here and will not forgo the opportunity to put it into the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords if your lordships will permit the unusual thing of a minister speaking three times at third reading on one amendment which is not to be encouraged may i say that my noble friend has in part answered the noble lord lord davies of leek because unless the child happens to have the misfortune to be arrested on a monday and have an level exam on the tuesday morning with the court not sitting until the tuesday afternoon we are very unlikely to get into this position <e>", "<cs> my lords i am so glad to find one member of your lordships house who finds the rest of this bill simple and straightforward <e> <s> the object of the code of practice is always to make clear to the police any matters which may be in doubt <e> <s> if this is obscure then not only will it be in the code of practice <e> <s> but it will be taken into account in the training of the policemen who have to work it <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to interrupt the noble lord when he is getting into the flow of his remarks but i wonder whether he has intentionally left out amendments nos <e> <s> and which i think belong to this group of amendments <e> <s> if he is going to take them separately it will take a little thought <e>", "<cs> my lords neither your lordships nor this amendment are concerned with when detention begins but with when the detention clock begins <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord lord donaldson will accept that distinction <e> <s> the bill does not in fact say that the clock begins to run hours after arrest it does say that the clock does not begin to run until the person has arrived at the right police station up to a maximum of hours in the case of a person arrested outside the area where he is wanted or indeed abroad <e> <s> these amendments are similar to amendments that were negatived in the commons and others which were withdrawn in your lordships own committee on th july <e> <s> i say similar and not the same because the third reading version goes further than that which we saw in committee <e>", "<cs> my lords with your lordships leave may i

the civilian population of this country to suicide <e> <s> as to the second part of the noble lords question i have already said that there is of course a duty to take defensive measures against conventional attack and those are things with which the public and the government are familiar <e>", "<cs> my lords the purpose of the report as my noble friend rightly said is to evaluate the likely

the attention of those concerned to what the noble baroness has said <e>", "<cs> my lords it is superficially attractive but from the inquiries made earlier today i understand that the expense of

committee of another place and therefore i cannot comment on that <e> <s> i am aware that what he referred to as the evidence produced by the cnd has so far emerged in the press as amounting to a pattern of allegations <e> <s> i can also say that i am aware that a cheque for has been given and i understand that it is normal practice for the post office to make a payment as a goodwill gesture where they feel that their clients have not been properly served or may have grounds for complaint <e> <s> but the basis of payment as i understand it was not that the mail had been opened but that it had been damaged <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i readily accept that and i did not wish to imply otherwise <e> <s> what i wished to imply was that the payment did not confirm a deliberate opening of the mail as i said <e> <s> what was thought to be going wrong was damage to the mail <e>", "<cs> my lords we do not think that it would be appropriate so to do until civil defence preparations are more advanced than they now are <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friends suggestion will be borne in mind but i should say that as regards the strictly civil defence element we think that it is necessary to be further advanced in planning <e> <s> answers to the civil defence questionnaire which was recently sent to local authorities have come in and a preliminary analysis shows that considerable and extensive effort is being made on the part of most county councils the vast majority of which provide at least some form of contingency planning <e> <s> we hope to make the results of the analysis available before christmas <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord thinks that i am a pessimist but i am an optimist <e> <s> i believe that the local authorities have here an overriding duty to the public

acknowledged that they were inappropriately contained <e> <s> the noble earl will want me to go further and say whether what we do for people who are in prison is in itself appropriate <e> <s> that is

could spend some time debating the others <e> <s> as convention does not allow me to speak much longer and i have much more to say i think it would be most useful if i proceeded with this material and

discussed <e> <s> it may be that with experience those in the newer rsus will come to recognise the cases and some transfers will be made as a matter of course but that is an aspiration and not a

the present programme contains some schemes in the planning construction and adaptation stages <e> <s> we actively encourage the use of neighbourhood watch schemes in order to support the police in the maintenance of law and order in all districts <e>", "<cs> my lords while i acknowledge that crime levels in the current year are higher than those in the year before it is worth noting that the year before saw the first decrease in recorded crime for very many years and it would therefore be unwise to exaggerate the importance of those statistics <e> <s> as to prison overcrowding i think the noble lord knows of our building programme which is designed to bring overcrowding to an end by the end of this decade which is not very far off <e> <s> if you cannot empty prisons either with the increased programme of non-custodial offences which we have provided or by accelerating the availability of justice in the courts the only other way is to stop people committing crimes and that is what neighbourhood watch and other methods of crime prevention are aimed at <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord i am sure will be the first to assist the government in the prosecution of offences bill in introducing a statutory limit on the time that may be taken to bring a case to court <e>", "<cs> my lords i should be very foolish to answer that question in any definitive manner <e>", "<cs> my lords we are always anxious to increase the use of non-custodial sentences where they are appropriate and have indeed legislated to make this necessary to the courts for young offenders <e> <s> the noble lord has a distinguished and long interest in this field of voluntary work which i am happy to endorse <e>", "<cs> my lords it is generally agreed that there was public anxiety about the increase in violent crimes and in drug trafficking and that my right honourable friends response to that in terms of the operation of his discretion to release offenders on parole licence or life licence was properly used and that was subsequently tested in the courts <e> <s> as to the incidence of racial attacks i am afraid that i do not have the statistics to hand but i shall write to the noble lord and a copy will be placed in the library <e>", "<cs> my lords the requirement for identification in the form of a warrant card or other identification is on the face of the police and criminal evidence act which i think the noble lord helped to put on the statute book and so is a requirement for codes of conduct which specifically require the proper handling of all aspects of the questioning and detention of suspects in police stations <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that my noble friend has asked me to use my crystal ball beyond its capacity <e> <s> i can give no accurate estimate about from which countries the largest number of votes are likely to be cast <e> <s> but according to the time of year the united kingdom is likely to be high on the list <e>", "<cs> my lords

will be an extension of the period of a general election but i would advise your lordships to reserve questions of detail on the bill until the bill arrives in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a question to which we shall return when the noble lord takes part in the proceedings on the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i would care to do so but i shall not <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend knows

office material alone two of them in fulfilment of manifesto commitments <e>", "<cs> my lords i am indeed aware of the considerable and very effective work being done by the emergency services under the law as it now stands <e> <s> i accept that this is nonetheless an important matter and i would remind my noble friend that both the juries disqualification bill which he will remember and in which he played an important part and the video recordings bill were enacted in the first session of this parliament in fulfilment of party manifesto undertakings and that there are a number of sessions ahead of us yet <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure what are both the objects that my noble friend suggests <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i cannot reply to that without notice <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i shall pass on my noble friends observation to my right honourable friend but the description that he gives of the measure makes it very suitable for a private members bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the proliferation of nuclear-free zones would have a great deal of effect on the attempts of any hostile power to attack us but in so far as my noble friend has drawn attention to another aspect of things i shall pass on his views <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord wishes to widen the substance of this debate he should put down another question <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware that there is a weight of opinion that favours such a step <e> <s> i am also aware that there is a weight of opinion against it <e> <s> the home secretary having taken the views is now considering where the balance lies <e> <s> i do not think i can say more than that at this stage nor do i think i can commit the government to a legislative move before we have decided in what direction it should be made <e>", "<cs> my lords i am so sorry i missed the beginning of the noble and learned lords question <e>", "<cs> my lords in a number of cases no doubt it has but we are looking at a particular class of case and my right honourable friend is at present considering the opinions on that class of case which have been put before him <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not seen all the opinions although i think there are over of them at present under review <e> <s> they are all being considered by my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the view which the noble lord has so succinctly put before the house and it is one which is before the home secretary at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords the principle that young people should be kept out of custody wherever possible is one which we have enshrined in statute in the first section of the criminal justice act recently passed by this house <e> <s> but the question i have before me relates to whether or not we should implement a suggestion relating to the suspension of sentences of youth custody <e> <s> i think my noble friend has strayed a little beyond that <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the delicate business of my right honourable friend to weigh those considerations against the considerations put foward by the noble lord lord hutchinson of lullington and many others <e>", "<cs> i would have thought not my lords at this point of time because this is meant to be a parliamentary question and not a debate on the subject <e> <s> my right honourable friend is considering views put before him by different bodies who have given their own reasoning <e> <s> i do not think that i can adduce the reasoning behind particular points of view in advance of the conclusion of my right honourable friends considerations <e>", "<cs> my lords this has already been done i think more ably than i could by the noble lords noble friend lord hutchinson of lullington <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with interest and respect to this debate <e> <s> it has long been very clear that greyhound racing has fallen upon hard times <e> <s> there was a time when it was a great national spectator sport <e>

speaks with considerable and apt authority as chairman of the british greyhound racing board though not as the noble lord lord mishcon would hasten to assure us on their behalf <e>", "<cs> yes and i was under the impression that this had as usual and as a matter of courtesy been done <e> <s> but if the noble and learned lord is not a party to that information i will arrange for a copy of the groupings to be sent to him forthwith <e>", "<cs> i repeat that in this instance i am speaking to government amendments nos <e> <s> and and that i would expect the noble and learned lord who has tabled amendment no <e> <s> to find himself very quickly involved in these exchanges with that amendment <e> <s> having said that and made those arrangements i should like to say that these amendments in the governments name have been tabled in answer to the real concern expressed by many of your lordships at second reading <e> <s> the concern was about more than drafting it was about the whole question of whether a national service has to be an over-centralised service and if so whether that was what your lordships wanted <e>", "<cs> will the noble and learned lord advise me how he would like me to deal with this <e> <s> i can give him an answer to that point straightaway but perhaps he would prefer me not to keep bobbing up and down but to deal with everything at once at the end <e>

lordships broadly favour or whether she is speaking also in favour of her own amendments <e> <s> i need to know this in order to know whether in my reply i should rely on the material which i have against her amendments which i regard as pretty damaging or simply on responding in a constructive way to the things she said about mine <e>", "<cs> if my noble friend will permit me to help her in

service whose primary functions are to take over and conduct cases in which criminal proceedings have been instituted by the police <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord advises whether he is going to force the amendment to a division may i take the opportunity to reply to a query from the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale which i passed over <e> <s> there is no right of private

sympathetic as she would like me to be <e> <s> the amendment would have the effect of applying to the crown prosecutor restrictions which were included in the children and young persons act which i take it is from where she has taken her text but which no government of either party since then have thought right to bring into force <e> <s> i hope that noble lords on the front bench opposite will give due weight to that <e>", "<cs> the purpose of this amendment seems to be to ensure that the new service will consider whether it is appropriate to discontinue proceedings instituted by the police

is an alternative when you are dealing with a case <e> <s> that disposes of the first question <e> <s> the second question which the noble baroness asked is very much larger <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale has tabled an amendment aimed at the heart of the question of private prosecution <e> <s> i think that perhaps rather than discuss it under clause stand part i ought to wait until the appropriate time <e>", "<cs> i am extremely sorry that i have been rather discourteous to the noble lord in that i was myself actually distracted as he was commending to me a course which i am sure is absolutely reasonable but to which i ought not to agree at this box before i know what it is <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord for his patient understanding and i am very happy to undertake to consider it further and to write to him if necessary <e>", "<cs> i think that one often does in practice but it is not to be commended <e> <s> may i take it that noble lords opposite are not speaking to two amendments but only to one and that we shall consider the amendment before us as though it were embeded in the bill which otherwise remains as it stands and that the caution that they are speaking of is the caution that now exists <e>", "<cs> if it is useful the advice i have is that the clause impairs the right of private prosecution because it requires leave from the court for any further prosecution regardless of how it has been brought about public or private on the same charge <e> <s> i am most grateful to noble lords who have put down this amendment for raising a question on which it is most helpful to the government to know your lordships views since we have not found it an entirely easy question and there are weighty considerations on both sides of the question <e>", "<cs> i should like the opportunity not to interrupt the noble lord but to pay him the compliment that he has remembered everything <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for giving us a chance to look at an important facet of the policy area covered by this bill <e> <s> cautioning policy is relevant to prosecution policy because cautioning is a means an important and much-used means although a varyingly-used means of diverting offenders from the prosecuting process and the courts <e> <s> if the new clause looks faintly familiar to your lordships as it did to me it is because those of us with a close interest in the police and criminal evidence bill in the last session are seeing it for the second time <e> <s> it was tabled in committee on that bill in another place by one of the noble lords friends whom my right honourable friend congratulated on his perseverance and gallantry in attempting to provide a framework for cautioning <e> <s> the committee i may add negatived the motion to include the new clause in that bill but that in no way makes it less suitable as a pretext for a debate in this house <e> <s> it does give a clue as to what the governments reaction is likely to be <e>", "<cs> i too am indebted to the noble lord lord irving of dartford for explaining that this is a probing amendment <e> <s> i shall give him all the information that i have because i think that that is what he wants <e> <s> i do not think however that i shall entirely satisfy the noble lord lord graham of edmonton <e> <s> if i recall the order paper correctly we have amendments down that touch on matters of conditions of employment and so on <e> <s> i would not really want to find myself on monday repeating what i have said to a rather thinner committee this evening <e> <s> it seems not necessary to say it twice although i take the point that the whole of the bill meshes together <e>", "<cs> i should think subject to correction that a barrister would say there was no distinction <e>", "<cs> this amendment would require that whenever a prosecution was brought by the public authorities or by private citizens the clerk to the justices would be obliged to notify the new service of the particulars of the case <e> <s> i take it from what the noble lord lord mishcon said in introducing the amendment that its purpose is to ensure that the service does not overlook any case the sensitivity or importance of which requires its attention and to place on the service some duty to ensure that cases brought by other prosecutors conform to the policies and standards of evidence which the service itself applies in deciding whether to continue with a prosecution <e>", "<cs> it is an agreeable change for me to be asked by the noble lord to consider what i have said and not what the noble lord has himself said <e> <s> i think that i may ask him to consider what i have said as well because i think that there was a good deal of sense in it <e> <s> but of course i shall read the debate before the next stage <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale has raised a fascinating subject on which he has been kind enough to be in touch with me and upon which i can immediately say that i cannot hope to pretend to the authority or experience which he commands <e> <s> however i recognise as did my noble friend lord renton at second reading and as the noble and learned lord himself has recognised that the right of private prosecution is an essential bulwark of our criminal justice system <e> <s> therefore although i welcome the direction of what the noble lord lord hutchinson of lullington has said i cannot perhaps follow him all the way <e> <s> it represents in important measure a safeguard for the individual against official inaction <e> <s> this point remains valid even as we recognise that it is not used very often <e>", "<cs> i am ably promptly and aptly prompted to remind the noble and learned lord that we are dealing here this is a lesson to me never to trespass north of the border not with a private prosecution but with something called assizement <e> <s> i say that with some dread because i can take the argument no further without assistance <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may water and tend my noble friends doubt until it grows a little <e> <s> the noble lords amendment seeks to oblige the director in his annual report to the attorney-general to reproduce all policy guidelines of a general nature that he has promulgated to crown prosecutors and all general advice given by the service to the police under the terms of clause <e>", "<cs> we are for once on the familiar ground of may or shall <e> <s> the statute as it exists requires the director to make the report and he is perfectly at liberty to put in it what he wishes <e> <s> the general purposes of the report are on the face of the bill and my noble friend has correctly described them <e> <s> the amendment of the noble lord lord mishcon goes further and says that the report not only may include a copy of any advice or guidelines and so on but that it shall do so <e> <s> that removes from the director the ability to withhold from his report advice which may be of a general nature and which may point out to those who advise the criminal fraternity on their defence a very useful weakness in the law <e> <s> either in those circumstances the director will be unable to mention them in the report or else he will be forced to <e>", "<cs> we are getting into detailed definitional language as to what is meant by general <e> <s> it may be generally applicable to the prosecution service that it has come to the notice of the legal advisers in a government department that there is a defect in a statute which if it is exploited will enable people to do things which were hitherto thought to be illegal <e> <s> that is something which one would not wish to advertise but of which one would wish the prosecution service to be aware <e>", "<cs> can the noble lord then explain what is the purpose of this amendment as he has just said that the attorney-general will be in a position in the report to make the statements that he is now urging him to make <e>", "<cs> i thought that the noble lord was going to invite your lordships to come to a decision on this and i did have something further to say before he did so <e> <s> but he has not said what he was going to invite me to do so i had better wait to hear what that is <e>", "<cs> i can tell the noble lord that the spirit of his amendment is perfectly acceptable <e> <s> that is that we wish the affairs of the director and the prosecution service to be exposed to the public view by means of reports which will be scrutinised by parliament <e> <s> what i am not happy with is the way the noble lord sets about it <e> <s> he asked me not to be blandished by my noble friend and then he proceeds to try to blandish me a <e>", "<cs> there is a danger that we shall become involved in an intensely interesting and rather long debate on the principles upon which all statutes ought to be drafted and of course that is something which we should always have under consideration <e> <s> but in the context of this particular amendment i shall try to be fairly brief <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for again directing our attention to the interests of staff who will transfer to the new service <e> <s> i think that there is little if anything between the noble lord and the government in the matter of objectives but there are some differences of judgment over the best means by which to achieve them <e>", "<cs> the principal issue before your lordships is whether in the event of a member of a prosecuting solicitors department being made redundant his redundancy payments would be calculated by reference to the whole of his relevant service in local government and not just to the period of his employment with the last employing authority <e> <s> to put the issue into context it is important to remember that staff in prosecuting solicitors departments from time to time move about from one authority to another <e> <s> it has been a normal part of their career pattern that they would apply for a more senior job in another authority as a way of gaining promotion <e> <s> staff would be understandably and properly anxious if by virtue of making such moves their entitlement to redundancy payment was set back and in effect they had to start again <e> <s> i think that is the concern of the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i noticed the singular mark of deference and respect which one noble and learned lord paid to the other and seeing that it had the approval of both of them i treat it with the greater care myself <e> <s> that is why i do not wish to spring to an unguarded answer <e> <s> i shall write to both noble and learned lords when i have the answer and i suggest that for the time being the best course would be for me to consider further how the aim which we and the noble lord lord irving of dartford and others share may best be achieved <e> <s> if an amendment proves to be necessary i shall try to bring it forward at the report stage in this house <e>", "<cs> i shall happily consider what the noble and learned lord has asked me <e> <s> i shall add his comments at this stage to his comments at an earlier stage on the general principle of whether it is necessary <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord for putting on the record in an ingenious manner the letter which i wrote to him <e> <s> it is an odd experience not unlike listening to yesterday in parliament to hear somebody elses voice repeating ones words <e> <s> i am most grateful to him <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord lord irving of dartford for raising the important question of consultation with representatives of staff affected by the transfer provisions prior to the establishment of the staff commission <e> <s> that is a narrower area of consultation than the one to which we addressed ourselves earlier <e> <s> the commission is being established primarily as a means of providing my right honourable friend the attorney-general with a source of independent and impartial advice on the effect of the transfer provisions of the bill on staff affected by them <e> <s> it is important therefore that it should be seen to be as well that it should be independent and accessible to the staff affected <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lady macleod wishes to be assured that the premises occupied by the service will not be seen locally as part of the local authority premises or of the police premises <e> <s> the general intention is that ultimately the crown prosecution service should he housed separately from the police service as a means of underlying the appearance as well as the reality of the independence of the two services <e> <s> i fear it had not occurred to us earlier that some might wish to see the service accommodated entirely distinctly from the local authority as well but i will certainly consider the points adduced by my noble friend in support of what she said and i will come back to her <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the intervention of my noble friend <e> <s> i am entirely seized of the importance of the very clear distinction which she wishes us to achieve not only in legislation but also in bricks and mortar between the directors service on the one hand and the police service on the other <e>", "<cs> i think that if the noble lord will be kind enough to look at <e>", "<cs> i am reminded if the noble lord the deputy chairman of committees will permit me that clause places an upper limit of years on the use of police or local authority premises for the purposes of the service <e> <s> i am most obliged to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> it is something which i should have recalled off my own bat <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord will be kind enough to give way <e> <s> i intend no discourtesy but on a careful reading of clause i cannot see that it actually deals with legal aid which appears to be the point that the noble lord is principally pressing <e> <s> if he <e>", "<cs> much that has been put on the record will be for the consideration of my honourable and right honourable friends but i have a number of responses which i make to your lordships this afternoon even though my brief has not been marked for me in the sense in which a layman uses the term <e>", "<cs> i am much obliged to the committee <e> <s> if i have satisfied all your lordships perhaps the clause may now be made to stand part of the bill <e>", "<cs> i shall shortly be proposing an amendment if this amendment is only a probing amendment which will clarify that for the purposes of the pensions increase act the effect of clause is simply to ensure that responsibility for meeting the costs of pensions increase of existing pensioners continues to rest with the last employing local authority or police authority as the case may be <e> <s> as drafted the subsection achieves this result <e> <s> but i am aware that fears have been expressed that the clause goes wider than this and in some way lays open to modification the arrangements for index-linking of pensions of staff transferring to the new service <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord lord irving of dartford for making that anxiety explicit <e> <s> but it does not have that effect nor is it intended to do so <e> <s> it is to make that plain beyond a shadow of doubt that i propose to tighten up the reference to the act <e> <s> should that amendment be acceptable to the committee as i hope it will be the noble lords in whose names this amendment stands may wish to consider whether it is necessary <e>", "<cs> i suspect that there may be more than one view on that issue but i respect my noble friends view and take account of it <e>", "<cs> my lords the declaration of a nuclear-free zone no more absolves one from the need for protection against nuclear attack than the declaration of a rain-free zone absolves one from carrying an umbrella <e> <s> the government therefore believe that these authorities must discharge their function <e> <s> but we also believe that at present the best course is to proceed <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the boy scouts have the right motto be prepared <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lords intervention is slightly out of perspective <e> <s> it is true that there is argument about what will follow from a nuclear attack not least because nobody knows from what direction it may come or how many missiles may arrive in this country <e> <s> but i am sure that neither the noble lord nor the medical profession would wish the survivors of such an attack of which undoubtedly there would be many to try to continue to live in this country without the assistance which civil defence can provide <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the first leg of the noble lords proposition <e> <s> as to the second i would say that of course civil defence embraces preparation for conventional attack as well as for other disasters and this is equally useful and important <e>", "<cs> my lords i would agree that on the whole i go to my doctor for matters of health and to soldiers for matters of defence and not the other way round <e>", "<cs> my lords local authorities must of course take into consideration anything they think relevant but they must also take into account and not leave out of it the statutory requirements which are matters of law <e> <s> they are required to carry out planning for a nuclear attack and it is the failure of their discharge of this duty which my noble friend fears may take place with which we are concerned <e> <s> as to the rest of the noble lords supplementary question it was so macabre that i think i will leave it to stand on its own <e>", "<cs> my lords as i think i have made clear my honourable friend has set a deadline at the end of this year for the completion of local authority wartime plans as required by the regulations <e> <s> the circular letter requiring them so to do was issued yesterday <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord asked me three supplementary questions and i shall try to answer them all <e> <s> i shall first tell him that there is indeed a useful service which local authorities can perform for their electorates in the event of war and that is by preparing for it and secondly if there has been propaganda it has been on the side of those who have tried to dissuade local authorities from carrying out this statutory duty <e> <s> as to the civil defence adviser <e>", "<cs> my lords the emergency services were prominently in evidence <e> <s> as to whether any element of civil defence planning went into their co-operation i very much doubt it but i shall write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware that civil defence volunteers were engaged in that work in that capacity though they may have been in others <e>", "<cs> my lords i bow to the seniority and experience of the noble lord <e> <s> as to the question whether we have talked about this matter enough this afternoon i would probably agree with him <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand from the commissioner of police of the metropolis that in the early hours of sunday th january seven separate attacks were made on the homes and property of staff and former members of staff of the wellcome foundation two of which involved the use of petrol bombs <e> <s> these are criminal acts which caused some damage and real danger <e> <s> the police are pursuing vigorously the possibility of a link between the incidents and the identification of those responsible <e> <s> i am sure the house will join me in condemning crimes which will not and should not dissuade the government from carrying forward their proposals for new legislation to replace the cruelty to animals act on the basis of their white paper <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is entirely right <e> <s> actions of this kind do nothing to address the reason and everything possible to render people hostile to the cause espoused by those committing them <e> <s> he is also right that great benefit has accrued to the animal <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat a statement about the conclusions of the inquiry into security arrangements for last years conservative party conference which is now being made in another place by my right honourable friend the home secretary <e> <s> the statement reads as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful both to the noble lord lord mishcon and to the noble lord lord wigoder for their reception of this report and of the important work which has gone into making it <e> <s> as to the question of the consideration of the full text of the report i have to say that the number of copies of the report that have been produced is exceedingly small <e> <s> access to it has been strictly limited on security grounds <e> <s> although it will be of use for the future it will be made available only on a strict need-to-know basis <e> <s> i think it is the experience of all people concerned with secure documents that it does not matter to whom the document may be addressed as the number of addressees increases so security goes down <e> <s> therefore my understanding is that the number of copies of the full report will not be increased beyond the number already made <e>", "<cs> my lords there were searches at times both of parts of the hotel and i understand i am subject to correction of individuals coming in and out <e> <s> but the number of people going in and out made it quite clear that a rigorous search of everybody would be pointless and unacceptable <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the purpose of the body set up by my right honourable friend to which i referred in the substantive reply that all police forces shall be equipped with all forms of equipment for this and any other technological purpose needed for security <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble lord for his comments on the irish press which i shall look at with interest <e> <s> i can confirm that the presence on the statute book of the prevention of terrorism legislation will remain necessary for as long as this sort <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord that this is a good report and a commendable effort <e> <s> i also agree that there are circumstances in which it is impossible to guarantee full security for all the people concerned <e> <s> i have already said so <e> <s> in that context this reflects well on the police force in question <e> <s> as to the dispersal of targets that is a military precept which is well understood <e> <s> i would only enter the caveat that we do not wish to run this country as if we were at war <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend for that intervention <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in my opening remarks the evidence so far obtained suggests that the explosion was caused by a device containing between pounds and pounds of explosive as the noble earl has rightly said placed behind a bath panel in room <e> <s> unless the plumbers had been called in i do not think that anybody would have seen it <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the principle of random search is fairly well understood in the security forces <e> <s> i am sure that the people who are about to consider arrangements for this years conferences will take note of what the noble lord has said <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has referred to the case i take it of mrs hough who found herself in a most difficult and distressing situation with which we sympathise <e> <s> but we do not believe that the general law should be framed in a way which might allow less scrupulous people to act for financial gain from malice or from other base motives against those rendered vulnerable by age or illness <e> <s> i have reminded my noble friend of two full reviews of the law in this respect <e> <s> i would remind him also that they revealed substantial difficulties and disadvantages in the way of the reform that he advocates and that bills with a similar purpose were refused a second reading by your lordships house in and again in by votes to on the latter occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble and learned lord is seeking to shorten my interrogation i agree with him <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the right reverend prelates recognition of the support of her majestys government for the hospice movement <e> <s> there are some hospices in this country at the moment of which about per cent <e>

time to review the law <e>", "<cs> my lords if i can infer a question from what the noble lord has said i would answer it by saying that the people who the noble lord seeks to help are by definition weak and defenceless <e> <s> if he opens those of them who wish to die to the hands of the merciful he also exposes those who are afraid to die to the hands of the merciless <e>", "<cs> my lords the shorter and more pithy the house makes its exchanges the longer its expectation of life will be i am sure <e>", "<cs> my lords i repeat that it is the view of her majestys government that life is sacred <e> <s> the choice that the government have is how best to protect those who wish to continue to live from those who wish that they should not <e>", "<cs> if your lordships will permit me i will just say this and i put in parenthesis at this point that it is committee stage and i can stand up to speak i regret to tell your lordships as often as i like <e> <s> the noble and learned lord has argued the case for his solution to the problem which we agree exists but his proposal is also to remove the solution which the government already have in the bill <e> <s> i did not hear him adduce reasons why that was not a good solution <e> <s> should i wait for one of his comrades in arms to do that or should i after the noble and learned lord lord denning has spoken expect him to

answer <e> <s> if it was a rhetorical question i apologise for responding to it <e> <s> we are a service industry <e> <s> we are given duties by the courts <e> <s> i should not wag a finger at the

that he suspends his judgment as to whether to take the opinion of the committee until he has heard me speak further i should like to say that i have not a great deal more that i can say of comfort to him <e> <s> i have offered to consider the concept of an appeal from a time limit and to embody that in what we propose <e> <s> whether consideration will lead to that resort is of course something which i cannot tell your lordships before report <e>", "<cs> i hope that particular phrase will not escape the <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord is gradually accumulating for me quite a weighty

i should thank my noble and learned friend for his intervention <e> <s> i do not doubt that he has fought over the ground in the past and that he deserves the satisfaction that he now gets <e>", "<cs> my lords the schemes exist in a wide variety of environments <e> <s> i believe that my noble friend is right to infer that they reduce the calls on the police force in ordinary policing as an evaluation of the kingsdown scheme in bristol showed a drop in overall crime of per cent <e> <s> however i cannot give the detailed figures for which my noble friend asks <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate what the noble lord is saying <e> <s> however i am not sure that i can entirely accept it because these are operational matters for the chief officers of the police forces concerned <e> <s> i can say that in london where the home secretary is the police authority there are over schemes in existence <e> <s> but to be more precise than the round figure i have given for the rest of the country would i think be misleading at the present stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that i can oblige the noble lord and put a more accurate figure in the library <e>", "<cs> my lords we are not discussing patrolling which is done by the police except on private premises to which my noble friend refers <e> <s> we are talking about arrangements whereby local residents in a particular area keep an eye open for anything unusual or amiss and if necessary arrange swiftly to inform the police and also very often mark their property with the local post code <e>", "<cs> my lords the figure that

within the overall pattern of custodial sentences for young offenders there has been a shift from detention centre sentences to youth custody sentences <e> <s> the reasons for this change are probably quite complex <e> <s> however i believe that if the noble lord examines the breakdown of the numbers of young offenders in adult prisons he will find that the vast majority of them are there for a very short time and are kept strictly out of contact with adult prisoners <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for however fleetingly calling me a learned lord <e> <s> as i said in answer to a question which my noble friend asked on th january we have sought the views of interested bodies on this issue <e> <s> we are now considering the matter in the light of the comments that

people out of custodial sentences <e> <s> that is why we have committed million to support it <e>", "<cs> my lords at present about three-quarters of the number of young persons under who are on remand are held in remand centres and about one-quarter in local prisons <e> <s> all remand prisoners need to be held as close as possible to their families and friends and also to their legal advisers and the courts where they are due to appear <e> <s> but there are not enough remand centres to accommodate the existing population and to cover all the major urban court centres <e> <s> the

of these young people <e> <s> i asked them unloaded questions <e> <s> i was very much struck by the fact that with very few exceptions indeed they preferred to be kept in a local prison where they were accessible to their families and lawyers than as little as miles away in perfect conditions <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord returns to an issue <e> <s> the latest figure i can give does not relate to children of a specific age but simply to juveniles in the juvenile bracket <e> <s> on the latest available figures of these are in adult prisons <e> <s> thirty of them are on remand and i

home office <e>", "<cs> my lords i absolutely agree that if there was a nuclear war the choice of targets in this country would not rest with us <e>", "<cs> my lords with the knowledge of the earlier observations by the noble lord lord jenkins of putney i would say that there are more reasonable assumptions and that one should look at the experience of hiroshima which showed conclusively that people can survive nuclear attack that survival is eased by medical and other precautions and would be very much enhanced by warning <e>", "<cs> my lords i may have misheard the noble lord <e> <s> i thought he was asking whether information gathered by russian satellites was available to her majestys government <e> <s> i am not aware of any such information being available <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will forgive me for having tempted the noble lord rather further from the order paper than i can possibly follow him <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a theory that nuclear weapons would result in a lot of dust which would make the surface of the world colder which is what i take it the noble lord was referring to <e> <s> the international council of scientific unions is studying the subject and is expected to publish its findings later this year <e> <s> the government will follow closely that and other developments <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not certain if i heard the noble lord correctly <e> <s> but my answer on the general subject of dispersal remains as it was in the substantive answer that it is by no means clear that any part of the united kingdom would be safe in such an attack <e>", "<cs> my lords it is only dangerous to argue from the small to the larger if one ignores the difference of scale <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps they will soothe the noble lord lord jenkins of putney as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i dare say they did not regard the noble lord as a threat <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the home secretary is aware that the bbcs current application for an increase in the television licence fee has focused interest on alternative ways of raising the finance but he has reached no firm decision on whether or how the matter should be studied further <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend has made it clear that he does not envisage any radical change in the licence fee system in the forthcoming settlement <e> <s> but he has also made it clear that the governments mind is not closed to changes in the longer term <e> <s> the debate on alternative ways of financing the bbc will continue and i shall certainly draw my noble friends suggestion to the attention of my right honourable friend as one way in which to conduct it <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that we can altogether indulge in a complete act of uniform complacency on the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords on the contrary once the government have produced the money then under the charter it is the corporations business to decide how to spend it <e>", "<cs> my lords the sooner this house becomes accustomed to television and ignores it in the chamber the better <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall add that gloss to the suggestion of my noble friend which i shall take to my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords the later of the two independent reviews to which the noble lord referred will be reporting shortly and my right honourable friend expects to receive a copy of the report <e> <s> i shall make sure that he is aware of the noble lords views which are founded upon wide and relevant experience <e>", "<cs> my lords if it is in order for the noble lord to have two answers to one set of questions my answer to the rest of his question is that the facts are as stated by my noble friend and myself <e> <s> he will not find a conflict between them <e> <s> as to the individual case he refers to i shall have to look it up and write to him <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will read my substantive answer which admittedly was rather long and complex he will find that his questions have been answered already <e>", "<cs> my lords to assist the house on the record may i say that there is already a copy in the library <e> <s> i refer the noble and learned lord to it <e>", "<cs> my lords visiting forces in this country are no more exempt from the rule of law and the doctrine of minimum force than are our forces in for instance germany who are deployed under the same international agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords the people who control the fire brigades will be democratically-elected representatives of the people <e> <s> however the noble lord is referring to the organisation by which this will be done <e> <s> that falls so wide of the order paper that i ask him not to stray in that direction but to restrict his attack to the governments civil defence policy <e>", "<cs> my lords the aim of these amendments as the noble and learned lord has confirmed is to enhance and safeguard the position of crown prosecutors by associating the attorney-general with their appointment and should it occur their dismissal <e> <s> we entirely agree with the sponsors of the amendment about the importance of the crown prosecutors to the new service <e> <s> under our proposals for maximum delegation they will carry heavy responsibilities <e> <s> in particular they will be responsible to the director for supervising the operation of the service in their areas and they will in fact be the linchpins of the new service <e> <s> their calibre will be vital to its success <e>", "<cs> my lords with your lordships leave i will be brief <e> <s> i am grateful to noble friends who have supported me and i recognise the valiant efforts of those who have been less supportive <e> <s> my answer in fact is to the noble lord lord mishcon who suggested that i had missed the point of the amendment <e> <s> the substantive point he made abundantly clear <e> <s> i addressed virtually the whole of my answer to it <e> <s> when i came to the end of what i had to say about it it appeared to me that i had demolished it <e> <s> i therefore said that at that point i turned to other motivations to see whether perhaps what the noble lord wanted was something else <e> <s> i tried to supply that as well <e> <s> i evidently failed <e> <s> i apologise for that <e> <s> but the fact remains as i stated it that we believe that the director general must be answerable for the service and if he is answerable for the service then he must have control of it and that means hiring and firing <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale was most persuasive at the committee stage and my noble friend lord renton has explained in part why this should be accepted by saying that in this respect he apparently is a gamekeeper turned poacher <e> <s> i was indeed more than half inclined to agree with him then that references to the treasury should be excised from the bill <e> <s> he has been quoted at sufficient length for me not to repeat the arguments he put forward <e> <s> if i still believed that the formulae which are under siege by the noble and learned lord and now by my noble friend lord renton were in fact redundant i should be the first to support their removal <e> <s> like them i hate seeing unnecessary words on the face of a statute <e>", "<cs> my lords in recognising that the noble and learned lords epithets are entirely suitable for st valentines day i cannot entirely follow him in his enthusiasm for the amendments <e> <s> they are if i may say so entirely presentational and i am sure that the noble and learned lord would accept that view because we are concerned with the presentation of the service to the public <e>", "<cs> my lords with your lordships leave what i sought to say was that i did not wish to suggest that prosecuting officer was perfect <e> <s> i was saying that whatever its level crown advocate seemed to be misleading and we should not be content with that <e> <s> i do not find the term prosecuting officer objectionable but of course i shall consider whether there are adequate reasons for thinking that something else might be better <e> <s> i do not think that such an idea will spring into my mind of its own volition so if the noble lord or anyone else has ideas to canvas i should be interested to hear them <e> <s> in advance of that i cannot undertake to bring forward an amendment at the third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for explaining the intentions behind her amendment and for prompting this short but interesting debate <e> <s> we went into the question of the new services arrangements for handling cases involving juveniles in some detail in committee but the subject is intrinsically extremely important and i do not regret returning to it at this stage of progress on the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords my brief says guidance but my advice is that they will be expressed in guidelines <e> <s> if that is sufficient i need say no more <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for giving us an opportunity to discuss the important subject of the use of the welsh language in court proceedings in wales <e> <s> the government are well aware of the importance of the welsh language in sustaining the culture of that country <e> <s> one has only to read the distinguished and very appropriate names attached to this amendment to realise that the noble and learned lord and the noble lords supporting it have the well-being of the principality very close to their hearts <e> <s> they want the best for their people and they want it expressed in a way which respects and even supports this unique fascinating culture <e> <s> as to its antiquity i shall not enter the lists <e> <s> they are welsh and rightly and properly they want the best for wales and that is something in which we entirely support them <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mishcon very adroitly returns our attention to an important issue which he brought before the house at an earlier stage <e> <s> i am grateful to him for enabling us to consider this matter again and to bring forward an amendment which has been improved by a reduction of its specificity a word which i find very difficult to pronounce <e> <s> the amendment which was pressed to a division in committee was rejected by a margin which in these days is perhaps more significant than the noble lord gave it credit for <e> <s> but the improvements are real and they help although they have still left us in some difficulty <e>", "<cs> my lords i said that we recognise and always have the desirability of making public any general criteria that may be laid down by the director of public prosecutions upon which once the crown prosecution service is established the discretion of prosecutors should be exercised <e> <s> we should therefore like time to consider the provisions by which this may best be achieved <e> <s> it may be that incorporation in a report under subsection of the clause will be appropriate <e> <s> with that assurance the noble lord may think it best to allow us time to see whether we can introduce a provision that we may all agree upon <e>", "<cs> my lords with your lordships leave the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale has correctly interpreted my anxieties and my undertaking but not the timing which i had in mind <e> <s> the difficulty is and he has already expressed it clearly as i hope i have too that there must in the general provision be some kind of provision for not declaring things which it would be damaging to the criminal justice system to reveal <e> <s> i think we are on common ground there <e>", "<cs> my lords will your lordships permit me unusually and improperly to speak a third time on report <e> <s> i must be very careful in committing the time of parliamentary draftsmen because they are not concerned with only one bill at one time <e> <s> i can undertake that if it is feasible without prejudicing other vital work which is also necessary to the timetable of the business of both houses we will bring something forward at third reading <e> <s> i cannot promise otherwise because i do not know the load under which the parliamentary draftsmen are labouring at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i think that it is only by saying those words that i can be permitted to speak again i ask him to reflect on the offer i have made to come forward at third reading if it is possible so to do with an acceptable draft for this purpose <e> <s> it will still be open to him to put down his amendment if he wishes the house to decide upon it at third reading if he does not see an amendment which he finds acceptable then <e> <s> i think that is the right way to go ahead <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords lord irving of dartford and lord graham have shown that they share our concern to ensure that staff transferring into the new service should not be disadvantaged <e> <s> i had supposed in the light of our earlier correspondence that the chief concern which they would deploy would be about redundancy but i understand that i was misled in that respect and i leap nimbly on to paragraphs or of my brief to their relief and mine <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may start by thanking the noble lord lord mishcon for his recognition of our attempts to satisfy him and of course i am happy to give him time to consider whether we have succeeded in doing that <e> <s> i would say to the noble lord lord airedale that in the case to which he has drawn our attention it would be for the accused to ask the magistrates to dismiss the case and the magistrates would agree to its being dismissed <e> <s> that is how i understand it would be handled <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are committed to maintaining the real value of pensions and related long-term benefits for retired and disabled people and we believe in giving benefits in cash rather than in kind <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in my earlier reply we are committed to maintaining the value of the help which we give <e> <s> we believe that we should do so not by giving specific help for individual purposes but by allowing people in receipt of help to decide how to use it themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not at all sure that that suggestion would be welcome to doctors who would have to apply criteria which it would be extremely difficult to devise <e>", "<cs> my lords if it were possible to identify single pensioners living alone then i understand that it would cost about million a year in lost revenue to give them a complete concession <e>", "<cs> my lords it is generally understood that it is important that the bbc should be independent of government interference and direction <e> <s> to make the bbc dependent upon direct funding from taxes would breach that principle <e> <s> in any case that is not at present in view <e>", "<cs> my lords that supplementary is so much further from the question even than i have already been tempted that i cannot answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords it is worth pointing out to my noble friend that presumably the blind person does not need colour television and would therefore be content with a black and white set at a licence cost of <e> <s> i believe there is abatement of of that fee <e>", "<cs> my lords the benefit of computerised production is cheapness <e> <s> the benefit of a common format in the community is easier movement throughout the community <e> <s> the benefit of machine readability is swifter processing in the case of entry to or exit from countries which use a machine reader <e>", "<cs> indeed my lords the words <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord be good enough to give way <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord has finished with what he is pleased to term banishment there is no point in this intervention <e> <s> if he proposes to go on i should like to point out that banishment is being sent away from your home and that is prevented from happening under the act <e>", "<cs> my lords i probably should not keep intervening <e> <s> however if the noble lord reads the act he will find that it applies to different parts of the united kingdom and cannot be applied to the part in which a person lives <e>", "<cs> my lords that is wrong yes <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think the rules of procedure allow me to conduct a sort of committee stage exchange with the noble lord <e> <s> the facts are as i have given them <e> <s> if i have anything to add i will add it in my reply to this debate <e>", "<cs> my lords the importance of the subject with which we are dealing and the deep emotional chord of personal experience which the noble lord lord fitt has just struck would make this a suitable occasion for the measured oratory of a prepared speech in reply <e> <s> however my duty is to reply as best i can to the questions and if i may say so to the charges which have been raised during the course of this debate and i shall stitch them together out of the material which i have for that purpose <e>", "<cs> i have not <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may rise from my noble friends lap as it were i would welcome first the helpful intervention of the noble lord lord mishcon on what is a very serious matter <e> <s> i will secondly say to the noble lord lord monkswell that if i did not by that speech convince him of the governments determination to get these powers i do not know how i ever shall <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords amendment makes what is at first sight a reasonable requirement in what are at first sight reasonable terms <e> <s> all that the noble lord wants is to ensure that there are enough welsh-speaking staff to conduct the business of the service in welsh <e> <s> he does not i am sure mean that the business of the service shall be conducted only in welsh which could be inferred from the drafting of the amendment <e> <s> but the noble lord knows as well as any of us that the majority of welsh men and women even do not have welsh as their second language <e> <s> much of the business of the service therefore of necessity will have to be conducted in english even in wales <e> <s> nonetheless the noble lord and his supporters are anxious that where it is appropriate for the welsh language to be used the service shall be able to use it <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not different but as the noble lord is addressing himself to the points made by <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise with the leave of your lordships because there is an expectant silence from <e>", "<cs> my lords we are not here for that we are here to take a decision by your lordships on a point of legislation <e> <s> the noble lord has said that in a particular case there was a prosecuting solicitor who could not speak welsh in a court in north wales <e> <s> it does not follow from that that if this bill were on the statute book with the noble lords amendment there would be a different prosecuting solicitor acting in the case <e> <s> it may well be that the best man was appointed and that the best man in this case did not happen to speak welsh <e> <s> there are i understand four out of welsh-speaking prosecuting solicitors and not three out of as has been claimed in north wales <e> <s> every effort is made to appoint welsh-speaking officers consistent with the felt need to ensure that the best man gets the job <e>", "<cs> my lords with your lordships leave the noble lord is most kind <e> <s> to be fair i think some collective credit is always due to governments when they get things right but in this case the noble lord should direct all his gratitude at my noble and learned friend and not at myself <e> <s> i shall see that his next red box is packed with laurels <e>", "<cs> my lords we are rather removing a cloud from the stream of goodwill because clouds tend to swell streams <e> <s> as i understand it the course that the stream was to run was clearly marked out at an earlier stage and the amendment enlarged upon the intention <e> <s> the effect of the amendments now on the marshalled list is to restore the stream of goodwill to its predicted course <e> <s> i could with difficulty and coaching give the noble and learned lord the detail of this rather complicated consideration but i am assured that the effect is merely to restore the <e>", "<cs> my lords the effect of this amendment would be to strike out subsection in clause of the bill and with it the unfettered right of the prosecutor to institute fresh proceedings in a case in which he has earlier discontinued proceedings <e> <s> in place of that subsection the noble lord proposes two provisions <e> <s> first there would be a requirement that such proceedings shall in future be initiated only with the leave of the magistrates court <e> <s> secondly they may be initiated only with the knowledge of the defendant who must be able to resist the application in that court for leave to proceed <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> as i was saying perhaps the noble lord lord mishcon intends that the defendant should be able to argue about the appropriateness of the bringing of proceedings <e> <s> but apart from questions of jurisdiction and whether the information discloses an offence known to law i understand that considerations of appropriateness play no part in the decision whether to grant process on the information <e> <s> i do not suppose noble lords are suggesting that the courts should be able to withhold access to the courts simply because for instance they disagree with the overall prosecution policy of the new service <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords this bill started its life in your lordships house although the noble lord lord mishcon properly pointed out its more distant parentage and the great credit which that reflects on the philips commission <e> <s> it also has some time to spend in parliament yet and i do not think therefore that it is a proper occasion for me to give a complete review of its intended virtues and of its fortunes so far <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend and i are saying the same thing <e> <s> the decision is for the attorney-general who will conduct himself entirely properly <e>", "<cs> my lords there is nothing remiss in somebody who manages not only to attend the christening of a junior member of the family but also to have his gratitude expressed indirectly and in person as well <e> <s> i am most grateful <e>", "<cs> my lords the interviewing procedures before appointment are very careful <e> <s> i have inquired and can find no record of any instances of homosexual practice or behaviour by chaplains within the past years <e>", "<cs> my lords it has been looked at well and it is taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate only to see whether i can find any way of bringing that question within the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to acknowledge the considerable value both of the work of the church authorities in finding and screening appointees and also of the work of the chaplains themselves in the prison service which is of enormous value <e>", "<cs> my lords rastafarianism is not recognised as a religion within the prison service and therefore the question does not arise at present to which i should add that prison chaplains nonetheless have the care and welfare of all inmates of the prisons within their care and attend to rastafarians as well as to others <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened to your lordships speeches on this bill with close attention and with great respect <e> <s> as far as the contribution of my noble friend lord blake is concerned this is hardly to be wondered at <e> <s> he occupies a position in relation to <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that if in the attempt to save words and therefore time at this late hour i did not make myself clear but that is precisely what i meant <e> <s> the noble lord is an experienced local councillor however he is proposing to introduce a system but he says he does not understand the workings of it <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no wish to make too much of this point <e> <s> i withdraw if the noble lord did not say that <e> <s> i shall look at the record <e> <s> i apologise to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be that other noble lords wish to interrupt <e> <s> i wonder whether with the clock in mind i should ration it to the different benches <e> <s> the noble lord is sitting alongside the last interrupter <e> <s> i am sure that he will forgive me if i try to exercise a certain proportionality in this also <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord attracts obvious sympathy for what he says from the benches which the noble lord lord henderson of brompton said should be discounted because of their interest in the case it is true he discounted as well my views and those of the opposition front bench which left the cross-benches and the right reverend prelates in a very strong position <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact is that there is a choice between having visible programmes and electing people to horse-trade about what the programmes should be <e> <s> what you then get is not necessarily a blend <e> <s> my noble friend describes it as a middle-of-the-road policy <e> <s> it is the best deal that can be got cobbled together from the agreement to abstain or vote preferentially in the council chamber or indeed in the caucus room on a whole series of options which can produce something quite unrecognisable from any partys programme and any individual programme <e> <s> therefore i feel that what the noble lord is asking us to adopt is something uncertain in its results and unclear in its operations <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has placed me in the difficulty that he has not actually asked a question <e> <s> however i should say that i entirely sympathise and cannot express the depth of my sympathy for those who are relatives of the unfortunate victim of this terrible crime <e> <s> i sought to explain to your lordships that we had taken very great care over the granting of the parole and i should tell your lordships that in the five years to people were paroled who had committed rape and none of them has committed a crime of this nature <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that because of one event however disastrous we should consider making every crime of that sort non-parolable because they are so very different in respect of their facts <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is right to be reassuring in this sense <e> <s> i would only add that whenever there is a case of this sort we look very carefully at the procedures to make sure that if there is any way in which they can be improved they will be <e>", "<cs> my lords the question relates to the procedure for granting parole to prisoners <e> <s> i believe that it is inevitable that there will be what we call failures on parole <e> <s> the function of the parole board is to make that risk to the public the minimal that is achievable <e> <s> when there is a breakdown of this sort it is right that noble lords should be very anxious and that ministers should be required to look carefully at the procedure <e>", "<cs> my lords i would simply add to those remarks that if in every case prisoners were kept until the very end of their prison sentences there would be no opportunity to keep them under supervision at any stage after they had been released into the community <e> <s> that would reduce a protection which the community now enjoys <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has made a serious allegation and i shall have to inquire into it <e> <s> i cannot of course answer him immediately and off the cuff <e> <s> it is not i might say in the character of my honourable friend to break undertakings but i accept that the noble lord is sincere in what he puts forward and i sill attempt to give him a factual reply <e>", "<cs> my lords i can reassure both noble and learned lords that this is a relatively painless way of recovering mistakes which we do not often make <e> <s> while thanking the second noble and learned lord for his kind remarks may i assure him that they will remain in <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords we have long experience of cases in which threats of this kind have been uttered and in none of them have they been carried out <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is right in saying that this piece of information was not before the parole board <e> <s> that is one of the matters at which my right honourable friend and i have looked most closely <e> <s> we are now in correspondence with the association of chief police officers to consider how we can ensure that the information which the police give is in the most helpful form it can be <e> <s> i should in fairness to all add that in the past we have very often had such threats uttered and they have not resulted in a crime of this kind and i should say also that the other information before the board might still have led to this release taking place <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for the first part of his supplementary question <e> <s> on the second part i would deny any atmosphere of complacency whatsoever <e> <s> i would say that the parole scheme has been running for years since and in every year but three for which we have figures fewer and sometimes substantially fewer than per cent <e> <s> of licensees have committed offences of any type while on licence <e> <s> that leads me to suppose that the parole board system works to the benefit of society as a whole as well as to the benefit of offenders but it does not lead me to think that ministers or officials can for one moment relax their vigilance over how it works and i undertake to continue that vigilance <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is right my lords that the only time we have the statutory power to supervise an offender is while he is on parole <e> <s> if parole was discontinued that power of supervision would be discontinued also and in our view that would substantially increase the risk to the public which we seek to minimise <e>", "<cs> my lords if i can recall the questions which the noble lord asked he has correctly quoted from the record our exchanges on the last occasion when we discussed this matter when i said that the parole authorities had considered all the information available to them <e> <s> the noble lord lord mishcon drew the attention of your lordships to a fact which has not been concealed but which is known to many that that information did not include the fact that a threat was uttered by pollard to his victim before he was arrested to the effect that if she identified him he would kill her <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend looks at one case which we all agree was a tragedy <e> <s> i have looked at the record of supervision and i believe that it was conscientiously carried out <e> <s> i do not think that blame attaches to those who supervised <e> <s> i draw your lordships attention to the fact that in the years to there were paroled people who had committed rape <e> <s> i can recall only one other case which in any way resembled the case now being discussed <e> <s> that was in and the parole licence had expired and so parole was not a factor in that case <e>", "<cs> my lords in each year from to about prisoners were eligible for parole <e> <s> about only were granted parole and of those there were recalled some of whom only about had committed a further offence <e> <s> that perhaps puts the matter in perspective <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for his supplementary question to which the answer clearly is no <e>", "<cs> my lords i am in a little difficulty <e> <s> my noble friend on the woolsack has not put the question <e> <s> this is a second reading debate to which i shall be replying and i can therefore give the answer that the noble lord wants if he asks his question in the gap <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a major bill on the representation of the people in spite of what the noble lord lord tordoff has said to reduce your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords if we are to get into historical comparisons of detail we should reserve that for a later stage <e> <s> nonetheless it is the position which we now occupy and which we are persuaded to occupy because it appears to represent the overwhelming balance of opinion in the political field in the elected house <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> my noble friend will not have been as aware as the rest of your lordships that whatever the answer is it is based on five years <e> <s> i think that there are certain skills exercised at cheltenham this afternoon that have extended themselves into the house <e>", "<cs> indeed my lords <e> <s> the new provisions ensure that british citizens who go to work abroad may vote in at least one parliamentary general election and one european parliamentary general election after they leave provided of course that they have not already left as my noble friend was at pains to point out <e> <s> but the real significance of these provisions is that they establish the principle that british citizens should not be disenfranchised because they are not resident here on the qualifying date <e> <s> in establishing the principle it is right that we should move cautiously but it will always be open to a future parliament to extend the five-year period once the new provisions have been seen to be working <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for revealing to us some of the basis of her optimism in this matter which i cannot as yet do much to encourage <e>", "<cs> my lords neither assiduity nor athleticism can always suffice to overcome difficulties of communication <e> <s> i shall either have to return to this matter at another stage or write to my noble friend or more than likely both <e>", "<cs> my lords it is important that we should have the report <e> <s> however it is also important that the report should be right and that the guidance should be accurate and capable of being implemented <e> <s> in view of the extent of the work needed and the variety of sources to be consulted i am not able to give a date for the report <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no question of our using defensive research for offensive purposes <e>", "<cs> my lords without wishing to claim expertise in the matter i think i am right in saying that the chemical weapon is generally more likely to be used in battlefield conditions <e> <s> of course if there was a battlefield in the united kingdom then the civilian population would in any case be exposed <e>", "<cs> my lords the civil defence committee of nato is developing guidelines on a wide range of civil defence matters among them methods for the protection of the civil population against the effects of modern weapons <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not certain what the process of assembly will be but i can assure my noble friend that what is recommended will be congruent with that advice <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not familiar with the entire programme of the recent exercises but i can assure my noble friend that we are not unaware of the extent of the threat of chemical weaponry of which as my noble friend lord mottistone has reminded us the soviet union retains a considerable quantity and also the capability of delivery <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to say that the devon emergency volunteers are a very fine organisation one of the best <e> <s> they are of course a useful model <e> <s> we would not wish to impose either that model or the good one in cambridge on other local authorities which should have discretion to form their forces as suits their

defence against conventional as well as nuclear attack is something which even the noble lord should support <e>", "<cs> my lords since our purpose is to arrive at the proper solution to our problems i shall limit myself to saying that i believe that the civil defence organisation of this country properly conducted is the right one <e>", "<cs> my lords the possibility of nuclear war is a terrible possibility and that is why the country as a whole supports her majestys government in preparing itself for its eventuality and also to deter its arrival <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord forgive me for using a little of his precious ration of time to say just this <e> <s> he has the ear of the house and possibly the ear of the media <e> <s> he is using it to make serious allegations

between local authorities and central government <e> <s> at present the authorities pay only a very small proportion of the cost of that partnership <e> <s> to reduce it to nothing would make the partnership very unequal and we shall have to consider very carefully before deciding whether we should do so <e>", "<cs> my lords on the contrary i think that it arises from an improvidence on the part of some local authorities who do not see as clearly as we do their duty to provide against risks which may in future fall upon their populations <e>", "<cs> my lords i doubt very much whether what the noble lord suggests would have the result which lie implies it might have and i think that the noble lord shares that view <e>", "<cs> my lords we expect to issue the consolidated circular

see how i can cast an answer within the terms of the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords recent experience suggests almost for ever <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord puts me in a difficulty because the question is about the publication of a consolidated circular and not about the organisation of the whole civil defence system <e>", "<cs> my lords the civil defence adviser will

though perhaps with less facility than the noises made by his friends and supporters would suggest <e>", "<cs> whatever else the noble baroness has said it has not been tedious particularly the last remark she made <e> <s> the noble baroness speaking for the official labour party has invited your lordships to amend this bill so that the secretary of state shall appoint a committee of inquiry to report to him before the bill becomes law <e> <s> the committee would be required to consider almost exactly the same matters that the other place considered in committee on the bill and those matters are almost exactly the ones that your lordships will be considering for a great many <e>", "<cs> i was simply going on the speech with which his noble friend introduced the amendment because that it is clearly her hope <e> <s> i should not wish to disappoint her at this early stage of the argument <e> <s> we have here a bill that rests upon mature reflection of grounds so thoroughly covered by inquiries that even the oppositions official spokesman on the environment said that no further inquiry was needed before his party did almost exactly what we now propose to do <e> <s> the proposal was published in our manifesto <e> <s> even with a timetable motion and i come now to a point which the noble baroness treated with some care this bill was discussed in a longer committee stage than they have had in another place for at least the past years <e> <s> the committee should know that it was debated for twice as long as the london government bill which brought in the glc in <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will permit me i am anxious to clear my mind on his argument <e> <s> it seems to me that the bill is constructed clearly on the basis of having one-tier government which is a principle that we have accepted <e> <s> the noble lord is arguing in favour of an inquiry <e> <s> the argument that he is now adducing appears to be that the inquiry should recommend a two-tier system <e> <s> if i have misunderstood i apologise and i should like to be put right because clearly that is something that could not be accomplished in eight weeks after enactment <e>", "<cs> it is not going to delay the bill <e> <s> if the findings of the committee are going to be so trivial that they can be done in four fortnights before implementation it scarcely is worth having the inquiry <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord kindly tell us which opinion poll is running at per cent <e> <s> the latest one i saw showed a considerably lower figure <e>", "<cs> i think that it is per cent <e>", "<cs> i intervene because the figure that the noble lord quoted was not but which i have never seen advanced anywhere and i am told that it is wildly out of date <e>", "<cs> the amendment in the name of the noble lord lord broadbridge which he ably <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has given as much pleasure to me as he has withdrawn comfort from those who support this amendment <e> <s> i wonder whether it is necessary for me to adduce much more argument against it because your lordships are getting hungry <e> <s> i will merely remind your lordships again that the bill carries out an undertaking that was in the manifesto on which this government were elected <e> <s> the electors are not being disenfranchised they have already cast their votes <e>", "<cs> i think your lordships have indicated that whatever the merits of the speech of the noble lord lord bruce of donington we have consumed a lot of time and your lordships would not want to consume much more <e> <s> i certainly intend to be very brief <e> <s> i was impressed by the command that the noble lord lord bruce had over his copious sources though perhaps if he had been less free in his use of them that would have helped us along <e>", "<cs> if he did i merely endorse that that is what they were doing <e> <s> the results which they had were fairly closely compatible with those of the government themselves <e>", "<cs> if none of your lordships has any views on this i shall volunteer my own <e> <s> the noble baroness has put it to noble lords in a charming and friendly manner and i reciprocate i consider myself admonished with the rest of your lordships by her elegant forefinger that the bill is imperfect because it contains such a very large number of powers which can be exercised by the secretary of state <e> <s> certainly in the bill there is a substantial number of such powers <e> <s> i cannot make them reach quite her total but i get to around which is a substantial number of powers which are conferred on the secretary of state or other ministers <e>", "<cs> l should <e> <s> the noble baroness is right to tell me that i should have told your lordships committee that the government do not propose to accept the amendment because we do not think it is necessary <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness is entitled to her sufficient answer <e> <s> if she wishes me to dilate i would say this about the idea that a secretary of state who is given a range of subordinate powers such as this should be required to specify for every single one of them the criteria by which he should use them <e> <s> that would mean describing the parameters on either side of the discretion that he will not transgress and examining in detail each case <e> <s> that idea and the proposal that he should report to parliament on this is an entire departure from parliamentary procedure <e> <s> it would generate an enormous amount of civil service work and it would not amount to open government <e> <s> it would amount to the proliferation of publications which your lordships do not wish to see <e> <s> i should like to dispose of this now not at report <e>", "<cs> i think that it might be for the convenience of the committee having heard the proposals of both the noble lord lord hayter and my noble friend lord molson so lucidly put forward if i were to give the first intimation of the governments position on this before we spread into a much wider debate to which my noble friend lord gowrie will reply <e> <s> the noble lord lord hayter said that he felt like daniel come to the lions den <e> <s> i had already reflected that i had wished i had spent ratter more time pulling thorns out of the lordly paws of my noble friends and others in preparation for this afternoon but i must rely upon the argument which i do with some confidence <e>", "<cs> i hate to interrupt the noble baroness but it is better to do it now than when she is really in her stride <e> <s> she will agree will she not that what we voted on was a reasoned amendment and the reasoned amendment addressed itself to precisely what we are discussing now which is strategic authorities <e> <s> therefore i think it was a fair reference that i made <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the right reverend prelate will allow me to say two things <e> <s> one is the obvious thing that this house has very important work to do <e> <s> i should have thought that he would accept that the work that he is engaged on now is work of some importance <e> <s> the other thing is that he is assuming that there are three areas in anything one considers too much too little and just right <e> <s> but the fact is that here we have an area where either there is no point in having a body sufficient to justify its presence or if it is justified it is open to all the pressures that i outlined in my speech at the opening and therefore it is too much <e>", "<cs> i shall be guided by the committee <e> <s> i have spoken once <e> <s> this is not second reading and of course i am allowed to speak umpteen times if i wish <e> <s> however i think we want to get on <e> <s> on the other hand there is a limit to the number of issues which my noble friend can pick up in the wind up <e> <s> as the noble lord lord hunt has specifically asked me this question it might just be helpful if i say to the committee if the committee will allow me that i have already explained that the secretary of state is already in the strategic authority position that he sees as being necessary <e> <s> the noble lords concern is not for that it is whether the germinative function can properly be discharged by somebody who is not as it were endemic to the area affected by being elected or however <e>", "<cs> the usual channels are slightly out of reach but so i think is dinner <e>", "<cs> one of my happiest memories as a member of her majestys opposition some years ago was seeing the noble baroness lady stedman take her place opposite me and in authority and listening to her lucid grasp of detail with which she deployed her arguments from the governments front bench as a member of the labour party <e> <s> i only preface my remarks by saying that now that she is a member of the opposition and a member of the social democratic party she has lost none of her grasp of detail or indeed her perception of the strategic issues <e>", "<cs> good <e> <s> that is i think the proper way to proceed <e> <s> although therefore i cannot give the undertaking that my noble friend lord broxbourne wants me to give that we regard parts of the noble baronesss proposal with favour because i regret to say we do not i hope that however disappointed he feels now he will be a little reasured when we come to amendments after dinner <e> <s> in the meantime i regret that i cannot advise your lordships to accept these amendments <e>", "<cs> i should like to start by saying to the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran that i share his admiration for holland park <e> <s> for a long time i lived quite close to it <e> <s> i was a frequent visitor to its charming facilities <e> <s> it does not in any way resemble hampstead heath <e> <s> holland park exists within the confines of one london borough <e> <s> hampstead heath is within the <e>", "<cs> and one or two others i think <e> <s> but that is not the point <e> <s> the point is that the noble lord is concerned for the future of holland park which he believes is now very admirably served and protected by for instance the planning authority within the area which it is to be found <e> <s> that planning authority is already the royal borough of kensington and chelsea and it is within the care of that planning authority that the bill will leave holland park <e> <s> there will therefore be absolutely no change in what he proposes <e>", "<cs> in answer to the two specific points raised by the noble lord lord banks and also in answer to the noble lord lord graham of edmonton i am obviously anxious to reassure everybody who is needlessly alarmed <e> <s> i am involved in a series of discussions on a whole range of what to others may seem minor issues but which i regard as important for that purpose <e> <s> on this issue i can say that allowance will be made in the grant-related expenditure assessment or grea for the borough which will mean that the resources should be available <e> <s> of course i am not myself the royal borough and i cannot undertake the way in which they will look after the park <e> <s> but i have seen enough of their work to feel that the noble lord need not be disquieted <e> <s> if he is disquieted i suggest that he talks to the leader of the council or to some other person at the centre of things who will be able to tell him what they propose <e>", "<cs> i thought i had done so in terms there will be provision in the gre for this function <e>", "<cs> the gre is a quantity of money and that obviously does not represent expertise <e> <s> what i was trying to say was that it will be for the borough to decide how it looks after the park and who it entrusts with the care of the park <e> <s> that will be the expertise will it not <e> <s> they can also have recourse to advice from other sources <e> <s> but unless the noble lord is more precise i do not think that i can be more precise and if he is more precise i suspect that the further questions he will ask me will be questions which he could properly ask from his distinguished position of the people who will inherit the responsibility and the care of the park which i am assured they are happy and able to do <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to seem discourteous to the noble lord but i really have gone to the limits of reassurance that any minister could give without <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble baroness is trying to lead me unwilling suspicious and with flared nostrils into the subject of rate capping and suchlike <e> <s> i do not think that that applies to the royal borough of kensington <e> <s> that is the first point <e> <s> i am sorry the noble baroness asked about targets <e> <s> i do not think that the sort of intersection between the two sets of figures which the noble baroness fears would apply in this case but i really think that after dinner is not the time to embark upon the complexities of the target system <e>", "<cs> that was not me <e> <s> it was the noble lord opposite <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble friend first of all for the extremely kind remarks with which he opened his speech on this amendment slightly kinder i think than i deserve and secondly for the word of warning which he gave me <e> <s> i can assure him that it was something approaching the superfluous i have no intention of ever discussing local government finance when the circumstances do not dictate that i must <e>", "<cs> that is right <e> <s> my noble friends amendment relates to london but he concluded his remarks by some observations about arrangements outside london which i shall read with very great care and attention <e> <s> i would only seek to echo what he said about non-co-operation because he strikes a chord which has been resounding in my breast ever since i picked up my responsibilities and discovered that there are people who are convinced that they can in some way forward some useful interest even after both houses of parliament have committed the legislature of this country to abolish the metropolitan and the greater london county councils by making no preparation for the arrangements that will follow abolition and allowing none of their staff to discuss them <e> <s> i do not want to become tedious on the subject i merely repeat that that is flatly contrary to the interests of the employees of those authorities <e> <s> you cannot plan careers when you do not know if there is going to be employment and you cannot tell if there is going to be employment until you discuss arrangements <e> <s> it seems to me a cynical way to treat the careers and futures of people who very often have given their lives to their employers <e> <s> what a way to treat employees <e> <s> but we are concerned at this juncture not so much with the employees as with the electorate and with the people who have to live in the areas in question <e> <s> that brings me back to the main theme of my noble friend <e>", "<cs> i was about to give a nicely rounded period to which my noble friend could respond but i see another response is required so i shall simply sit down <e>", "<cs> my noble friend is most gracious <e> <s> may i just use the opportunity to reply to a specific point which i was asked <e> <s> i was asked to say something about specialist teams which one noble baroness or the other suggested that i should have done <e> <s> i could at an earlier stage have said that we look to district and borough councils to make such arrangements for local co-operation as they see necessary where reclamation concerns more than one authority <e> <s> there are already cases where that happens <e> <s> for example in the black country co-operation is already taking place <e> <s> the government have made it clear that they will use their good offices to assist in the establishment of such arrangements <e>", "<cs> of course i shall always listen with the closest interest and i shall read again with the closest interest what the noble baroness has said <e> <s> however the amendment to which i responded and on which i was briefed related only to london so i do not think the noble lord will expect me to go further <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say this rather timorous word <e> <s> that does not give us much time to get any fruition from the first round of consultations <e> <s> it may take us until report to come to a conclusion <e> <s> i only say that in case my noble friend expects me to come up with a complete answer by clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand what the noble baroness seeks to achieve by these amendments <e> <s> i am sure she feels that she is making a constructive attempt <e> <s> the bill as drafted permits the new system of unitary plans to be introduced in different areas on different days <e> <s> that is really what worries the noble baroness who i see is trying to rally support perhaps with indifferent success but that remains to be seen <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that it seemed to be such a saddening reply that she received <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> the structure plan will remain in force until there is a commencement order <e>", "<cs> i would not disagree with the noble baroness lady fisher of rednal about the preference for in-filling over the use of the green belt <e> <s> i hardly feel however that it is germane to this question <e> <s> the noble baroness said that we were returning to the conditions that we sought to cure in <e> <s> on the first half of that proposition i rely entirely on what was stated by my noble friend lord bellwin at the conclusion of the debate on tuesday on the general principle <e> <s> on top of what we had in we have two differences <e> <s> we have the unitary plan in two parts <e> <s> there is the part designed to secure the objectives of the old strategic development plan <e> <s> above that which is unitary and in the hands of the local authority we have the strategic guidance produced by the secretary of state <e> <s> we have talked about this a good deal <e> <s> i have tried to show your lordships that it will be simple and flexible <e> <s> it will be founded upon a great deal of advice much of it generated at local level <e>", "<cs> if the local authorities do not wish to protect either their interests or those of their electorates it is open to them to cut off their noses to spite their faces <e> <s> i hardly think that they will do that <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord give way <e>", "<cs> i trespass on the noble lords intervention with greater hesitation than i would on almost anybody else <e> <s> he has been longer in parliament and in this world than i have been or am ever likely to be <e> <s> but in this matter and in this committee i think the noble lord may have things just a little out of focus <e>", "<cs> we have strayed so far from amendment no <e> <s> that i hope your lordships will forgive me if i take seconds to reply to an earlier point that the noble baroness has put to me <e> <s> of course she is aware that the west yorkshire structure plan is at present under consideration by my right honourable friend for the use of his powers under the paving act <e> <s> that is not an unreasonable consideration given that the original structure plans took several years to develop <e> <s> the greater london development plan took seven years to develop being based on earlier work <e> <s> to come to a conclusion between the putting forward of the proposals there and the abolition date is a fairly tall order <e> <s> i cannot yet tell her of course what my right honourable friend will conclude <e> <s> i suggest that we now return to amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i think the picture is clearing <e> <s> my noble friend lord colville of culross drew your lordships attention to a point which we discussed at some length rather later on tuesday on an amendment by my noble friend lord sandford which was about how one gets a proper corpus of opinion in an area so that it can be brought to bear upon all the planning decisions within it <e> <s> i have already undertaken that we will consider that <e> <s> ifi were to suggest to the noble baroness that in our consideration we might come up with something like the statutory requirement of rather narrow confines which she put in her amendment i should be misleading your lordships and the committee <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for that opportunity <e> <s> i shall leave the conduct of the main argument in my noble friends capable hands but i think that this information is perhaps proper to introduce at this time so that your lordships can discuss it properly <e> <s> strategic guidance is listed in paragraph of schedule as one of the matters to which a local planning authority must have regard in formulating the general policies in part i of its unitary development plan <e> <s> i fear that there may have been some misunderstanding arising from misconceptions about the nature of this guidance <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness is giving us more and more cause for gratitude <e> <s> if i may just put this on the record i will read the remarks of my noble friend lord colville with very great care <e> <s> it may be that he said something which made it look as though the strategic guidance did not precede the preparation of the udp <e> <s> i did not actually catch that but it is clear that we are at one in our understanding that this comes first <e> <s> i beg your lordships pardon <e> <s> i am increasingly grateful embarrassingly so to the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> i wish to be helpful and if my noble friend does not wish me to intervene i shall instantly yield <e> <s> it is simply on this question of the plans all being required at once <e> <s> the provisions in the bill

iis <e> <s> that at least i hope is now clear <e> <s> i am much obliged to my noble friend lord colville for addressing the point and to my noble friend lord campbell of alloway for making jolly certain that i answered it <e>", "<cs> if the committee find that i am taking a little longer or that i am slightly more confused than usual in my reply to this debate i am sure they will be patient

proposing if it presupposes later action to change the nature of the body to which she is giving these functions <e> <s> it is a perfectly relevant question to ask <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble baroness <e> <s> it is quite clear that she says that this is a strategic function and that there is no point in giving a strategic function to a temporary body and therefore it is the proposal to change the nature of the residuary body until it becomes a reflection of what has been abolished by this bill <e>", "<cs> all that i would say to the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran is that i have not yet made my case on these amendments <e> <s> but i thought that your lordships should know what it was that the noble baroness was proposing <e> <s> she was kind enough to illuminate

more difficult for me to resist at the moment <e> <s> but if he is doing that because he believes that i am in a state of confusion all i can say is that i am not aware of it <e>", "<cs> i compliment the noble baroness on the elegance of her reply <e> <s> but what she said on the air was if you find that you need to have a larger authority for an accumulation of special services and if your lordships look down the marshalled list you will find that this is not by any means the only service which is to receive this treatment if you find yourself in that position the logic of that is surely that sooner or later you are going to have to have an elected body <e>", "<cs> it was not if it does not work <e> <s> she said that if there was an authority for an accumulation of special services the logic is that it becomes elective <e> <s> i do not want to make much of this <e>", "<cs> i shall make as much of this as your lordships wish <e>", "<cs> the subject we are debating is the body that is to discharge the various functions that have to be discharged after abolition has taken place <e> <s> one of these functions is the collection and more particularly for our purposes the

not so i do not know whether it is true <e> <s> while the bill will not indicate any evidence of damage to health from the disposal of hazardous waste it will indicate i think the noble lord expects

to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> i am not sure whether the noble lord the deputy chairman should put the question and we should negative it or whether he should of his own motion take cognisance of the fact that having no clause to depend upon the schedule presumably crashes to the ground <e>", "<cs> if the debate continues much longer i shall begin to become confused and so i hope that your lordships will allow me to reply now <e> <s> perhaps i may start by clearing up a small point simply because it is on the top of my pile of papers <e> <s> my noble friend asked about the

houses are transferred <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> i am sorry <e> <s> i should perhaps have gone into more detail in my reply <e> <s> i did say that i thought that the royal borough of kensington and chelsea would be a perfectly proper owner <e> <s> what i did not say is that the house is in fact leased by the victorian society and that it will be simply a change of owner of the head lease <e> <s> the noble lord has nothing at all to fear for the future <e>", "<cs> this amendment seeks to ensure that the secretary of state shall provide to the historic monuments and buildings commission sums equivalent to those which the glc has chosen to provide and that sufficient sums are available for capital projects and necessary repair works <e> <s> the amendment also seeks to earmark those sums exclusively for the historic house museums <e> <s> i believe that this is yet another case where the anxieties expressed by noble lords are not well founded <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness has moved away from the amendment because it requires that there should be an amount of revenue expenditure in each year not just for the interim or for the changeover but for ever <e> <s> now we are talking of the wider principle <e> <s> the noble baroness has been in government no she has not <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness is familiar with the way in which we have to plot our expenditure ahead <e> <s> we have a programme in government when we review a budget which extends beyond the budget year and the same is true with the historic monuments and building commission <e> <s> i hope that i did not appear to be discourteous to the noble baroness <e> <s> i did not intend that <e> <s> it was a slip <e>", "<cs> the result of my gaffe is that my question has been answered for me most ably by the noble lord <e> <s> what i was about to talk about was the three-year rolling programme <e> <s> the point of that is anticipating events like this so that one can build the resources necessary into the programme <e> <s> that is indeed the process in which we are engaged <e> <s> i hope that this has reassured the noble baroness that my mathematics are better than my history <e>", "<cs> clause deals specifically with only one aspect of funding for voluntary bodies that is the power to establish collective schemes under which boroughs and districts acting jointly can fund voluntary organisations serving more than one borough <e> <s> the amendments to which noble lords have spoken do however range rather widely <e> <s> therefore i hope it will be helpful to your lordships if at the beginning of this debate i speak generally about the whole issue of voluntary bodies and abolition and respond to the more detailed aspects of the amendments at the end of it <e>", "<cs> i understood the noble lord to ask me whether the money was earmarked for this purpose <e> <s> the money was precepted for this purpose by the glc <e> <s> it will in future be paid by the boroughs under <e>", "<cs> well i think that is no bad thing <e> <s> i ask the committee to hear me out <e> <s> it will be for them to decide both on exactly how much money to give and indeed to which organisations to give it <e> <s> this uncertainty is not as your lordships might think from the knowing noises opposite anything new <e> <s> it has not been introduced by this bill <e> <s> the level of support has always gone up and down <e> <s> it has varied under the glc and may vary in exactly the same way under the boroughs <e> <s> the reason why i cannot now give and never under any past arrangements could have given a guarantee is that the decision is not for ministers it is for councillors <e> <s> councillors elected by the greater london council have been having their say and now it will be the turn of councillors elected to london borough councils <e> <s> i would remind the committee that they have a good record and already give some million of support to the voluntary groups in london <e> <s> the source of the money that the voluntary sector now gets from the glc will be just as it now is the borough councils who collect it from their own ratepayers <e>", "<cs> i intend no discourtesy to the noble lord although he said that i might be misleading the committee which is a wounding thing to say <e> <s> i intend no discourtesy to the noble lord and other members of the committee if i say it would be a good thing to hear me out before trying to unstitch what i am saying because your lordships do not know what is yet to come <e> <s> as the noble lord lord pitt of hampstead has rightly said the difference in future will be that the glc will not be there to collect it from the boroughs by precept and hand it out <e> <s> i accept that that is an alarming prospect for treasurers of voluntary bodies <e> <s> things were difficult enough when they had only one door to knock on without being suddenly told as they believe to knock on in pursuit of exactly the same cash result <e> <s> we recognise that difficulty and that is why we have provided in clause of the bill for the boroughs to come together voluntarily themselves and provide a single door to knock on <e>", "<cs> it is safeguarded by the undertaking which i as a minister of state at the department of the environment gave on behalf of my right honourable friend a moment ago and which is written into the record <e>", "<cs> the noble lord can return to the detail as we all will during the debate <e> <s> the fact is that however one does the calculations there is greater support coming from the private sector to the voluntary sector in the united states than there is here to an order of magnitude of a considerable size <e>", "<cs> i really ought to finish because your lordships will look at the clock and think that i have taken even longer than i have and that is long enough <e> <s> we propose that the new trust shall be administered by a widely-respected and established charitable organisation that will take it and keep it right out of politics altogether as the noble lord lord perth would wish <e> <s> the trust would not replace existing sources of grant giving nor would it replace anything provided for in clause <e> <s> on the contrary it will be additional to both <e> <s> the other arrangements we have already announced will continue to go forward <e> <s> it will necessarily take some time for the endowment of the new trust to become available but i believe your lordships will see in it an important and constructive investment in the long term <e>", "<cs> no it would be much better if i sat down altogether rather than having the noble baroness leaping up before i sit down so that i then have to rise again <e>", "<cs> i have done many jigsaws and i have always found the piece in the end <e> <s> it is an important piece but it is less important than the london piece <e> <s> i shall not recapitulate the whole of my speech but the ratio between the district councils and the mccs is entirely different from that of london and the whole of the piece is therefore smaller <e> <s> we recognise its importance and we are open to suggestions for trusts there too as i have said <e>", "<cs> i spoke for too long and necessarily left out detail <e> <s> your lordships have seen lists of what the glc is funding <e> <s> i said that a lot of it most of it a great deal of it was very worthy <e> <s> i did not say that all of it was <e> <s> i am in no way counselling the boroughs to spend exactly the same amount of money on exactly the same causes <e>", "<cs> the noble lord asked me a question <e> <s> he asked how could we be certain that the money would be forthcoming <e> <s> i would remind him first that there is no certainty that the money would be <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord allow me <e>", "<cs> it is interesting that when the government resist the opposition we are intransigent and when we answer pressure in parliament we are in some way caitiff <e>", "<cs> the noble lord asked me to put him right i do <e> <s> it does not come from that source <e> <s> it comes from the whole of the glc assets any part of which is surplus to the requirements of the successor bodies <e> <s> it is a very much larger fund and is far more than one building <e>", "<cs> it may be helpful if i interject at this stage to make a point i intended to mention when winding up this debate <e> <s> the effects of the clause scheme will be in conjunction with the london rate equalisation schemes such that the burden of supporting these schemes will be distributed in roughly the same proportion as it is now <e> <s> your lordships committee can dismiss from its mind any anxiety about the penalising of the poorer boroughs <e>", "<cs> the noble lord paused as though he had disposed of something that i had said <e> <s> i never claimed that the united states government did not provide a very large amount of money to charities <e> <s> what i said was that american private corporations provide a vastly greater proportion of their pre-tax profits than do ours <e> <s> i shall come back to the arithmetic of that later but that is what i said <e> <s> i never made the position that i thought i heard the noble lord with satisfaction demolishing <e>", "<cs> my noble friend has raised the point that i was about to raise <e> <s> we have been discussing all this time how the money is to be spent <e> <s> i can see nothing in the amendment which says from where the money is to come <e> <s> i presume that it is to come from the rates <e> <s> i presume therefore that there is some system of charging or that there is to be a precept <e> <s> noble lords opposite nod their heads sagely and eagerly but <e>", "<cs> is the right reverend prelate able to tell me who sets the level of the precept <e> <s> i thought that it would be the body referred to here <e> <s> however if it is not a precepting body but only a distributing body then we must know who will set the level of the precept <e> <s> is that going to be the clause system <e> <s> shall we have the two going in tandem or what <e>", "<cs> i am much obliged <e>", "<cs> i rise merely to provide an opportunity for the noble baroness lady darcy de knayth to speak <e> <s> she has been trying to do so for ages and cannot without my help <e>", "<cs> your lordships have conducted a fascinating debate <e> <s> for me the most bitter-sweet moment was when your lordships committees eldest member flattered me by saying how well i debated and illustrated perfectly the truth of what i have long suspected that the more persuasive i think i am being the more vigorously he disagrees with me <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the noble earl and i shall in a moment come back to the question of the depoliticisation of voluntary grant giving <e>", "<cs> to save time i am happy to confirm that now <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble baroness means millions <e>", "<cs> if the noble viscount will give way perhaps i may ask him whether the balham family centre is directed to benefit the residents of wandsworth or the residents of a wider area <e> <s> i ask that question because if it is directed to benefit the residents of wandsworth they will still be funded as they now are by wandsworth borough council <e> <s> if it is for a wider area it of course falls into the new arrangements <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord kilmarnock is right in his arithmetic the amount of money available in the first year will be million as the governments proportion of the total of million <e> <s> in the second year it will be million as it will in the third year and it will be million in the final year <e> <s> the noble lord asked me what was the exact detail of the undertaking i gave on the limit which the secretary of state would impose <e> <s> i can give an assurance today that he will set the limits for in the light of authorities budget plans for the collective schemes and that we will not seek to constrain these budgets below the level of the equivalent expenditure by the abolition authorities this year <e> <s> those are the exact terms <e> <s> i cannot of course look beyond the year after next nor indeed could anybody else <e>", "<cs> i got two different messages from that <e> <s> the first said that there were two areas which were trans-borough <e> <s> the other was that there were two areas where there were no ethnic minorities <e> <s> if i am right on both counts the two which go across the borders of neighbouring boroughs will fall to the clause arrangement <e> <s> i think that is what the noble baroness asked <e>", "<cs> i speak subject to advice and correction <e> <s> as i understand it there is a distinct difference between penalty and rate cap <e> <s> grant penalty relates to the amount of expenditure acceptable under the existing system and the claw-back begins when you are into penalty <e> <s> i think that that is the jargon <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord forgive me <e> <s> i now have a little more to say <e> <s> i am told in the most <e>", "<cs> the fact that you are virtuous about this sort of grant and profligate about others does not protect you from any penalty for misbehaviour for other reasons <e> <s> the gres and targets and i now understand the rate capping assessment will be adjusted so that the expenditure which i have encouraged local authorities to make with the backing of government money will not bring them into that sort of penalty <e> <s> it obviously does not protect them from being brought into penalty for other sorts of over expenditure <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord hunt and it is a pleasure to engage in exchanges with him again after the brief interval that we have had after so recently talking about parole and kindred subjects voiced a general anxiety which i hope he will find has been somewhat allayed when he reads as i hope he will later this week what i said in a rather extensive speech early in the debate before the division and before dinner <e> <s> i do not think that i ought to delay proceedings by repeating the assurances that i then gave but they are relevant to his concern <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the noble lord and i can tell your lordships that the government have thought this scheme through that it will work and that the doubts which the noble lord lord ennals has sought to cast upon it will run off it as water will off a well-oiled ducks back i hope <e>", "<cs> i do not think that the noble lord is entirely wrong in his interpretation but i was wrong in my imagination of what he was saying <e> <s> the fact is that i really cannot believe that there is one metropolitan county which has a majority of its districts which will not get together <e> <s> i doubt very much whether they will be resisted in fact by a minority <e> <s> so i can reassure the noble lord and as to my noble friend lady carnegy the rate capping and all the arithmetic applies to all the members once the majority have determined that it is uniform <e> <s> so that disposes of that <e> <s> i think that the noble lord will find himself happier when he returns to this matter on report than he is now <e>", "<cs> i would make only two responses to that <e> <s> the first is that the equalisation system of the block grant system will continue to apply <e> <s> the other is that the apportionment of the cost of the scheme will be on a population basis so although the votes may not be equal the expenditure will be <e>", "<cs> i think i can give the noble lord the assurance he wants <e> <s> indeed i rather think i have done so already in describing how the richmond scheme is working <e> <s> basically the amendment appears to address itself to the fear that the councillors having set up the scheme will not wish to run it <e> <s> but as it will be their ratepayers money that is being spent i think that the fear is not likely to manifest itself and that the bill as drafted makes it quite clear that it will in fact be a committee of exactly the people the noble lord wants who will be running the scheme under clause as in fact is now happening under the richmond scheme <e>", "<cs> before giving his advice the noble lord should wait to hear what the minister has to say <e>", "<cs> i think it is probably time that i tried to put in my forecast <e> <s> the noble baroness the leader of the liberal party came in briefly to say that the tone and content of everything that i said had changed since dinner and the noble lord lord ennals has endorsed that <e> <s> for the benefit of any noble lords who are in doubt i should say that i have been forewarned the bottle since last november and so there is no influence of dinner on this <e>", "<cs> i am extremely interested to hear that <e> <s> i did not know it <e> <s> the noble lord has homed in on the problem that appears to have escaped the notice of the official opposition front bench <e> <s> it is that we see a great danger in setting up a voluntary scheme in which per cent <e> <s> of the people can find that they are a majority and that they are being told to do something that they do not want to do <e> <s> it seems to me that this is the first reason for having more than a straight majority for this purpose <e>", "<cs> i am in a slight difficulty because i have deployed already arguments against both my noble friends amendment and that of noble lords opposite <e> <s> my noble friend is using the opportunity having spoken to it to move it formally which i can tell noble lords opposite is perfectly all right <e> <s> i take this opportunity to say that of course i shall read her speech in the earlier debate with very close attention hut i must not give her the impression that i am in some way suggesting that her amendment would be acceptable at a later stage for the reasons which i have already adduced <e> <s> i will not repeat them now <e> <s> i mean no discourtesy to my noble friend but she can read them at leisure tomorrow <e> <s> i will of course take careful note as i always do of what she has said <e>", "<cs> i have just recalled that i did not in the last debate answer one question that i was asked <e> <s> it will soon be out of order to do so but we are on the same subject still <e> <s> the bill if one reads it carefully refers in clause to a majority of the councils <e> <s> it is not a majority of those present <e> <s> it is a majority of the votes available <e>", "<cs> your lordships will recall because i have said it too often already that clause deals only with voluntary organisations which serve an area of more than one borough or district <e> <s> the purely local groups will be able to look to their individual councils for support <e> <s> clause sets up arrangements which will replace the strategic role of the glc or the mccs in looking at voluntary services operating over a large number of borough or district councils <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may reply because we have discussed this amendment already at an earlier stage and i do not think we ought to stand too long on it <e> <s> the noble earl lord perth is concerned about the transitional stages of the scheme <e> <s> he has proposed a system that is in itself transitional and it is to supervise the distribution of transitional grant <e> <s> transitional grant will be given under the act on social needs the urban programme power to projects currently getting their grant from the glc and the mccs <e> <s> there will be a bidding round the doe will make allocations based on the local authority bids and the point at which the noble earl would like his amendment to bite is the point when the allocation is made between the different areas <e>", "<cs> i am always for deciding cases on their merits and the merits of this one must surely be indebted as i am to any who voted in the government lobby on the last division whether or not what we propose carries out the function which noble lords wish it to do <e> <s> and what noble lords want is that the step if it is a step down between the glcmcc funding and the new funding if there is a step <e>", "<cs> may i just ask the noble lord whether in moving it he will confirm that it is word for word the same as amendment no <e> <s> ze <e> <s> if it is not i wonder whether we may have a little time to read it because i have not yet seen the alternative <e>", "<cs> it seems that we all want all the best things that are done now to go on being done in the future <e> <s> therefore i do not need to respond to all the credits which the noble lord and the noble baroness have passed out to their particular favourite body <e> <s> what i need to tell the committee is that it will be possible for this work to go on <e>", "<cs> i can tell the noble lord that i have a great deal of work to do at the moment most of it arising from his colleagues on the benches opposite <e> <s> it is normal to decide what one is going to do on the marshalled list several days ahead particularly when the change that the noble lord adduced as his reason for tabling a manuscript amendment had been made perfectly clear last week <e>", "<cs> your lordships have tried me <e> <s> the answer to one of the questions which has been raised i think it was the last one is yes <e> <s> the answer to the point raised by the noble baroness lady lockwood is yes <e> <s> the metropolitan districts have a p rate to spend <e>", "<cs> i shall be glad to do so and i am glad of the opportunity of the respite to consider it because i have not replied to that aspect but i shall do so <e> <s> following the conventions of the house a copy will be put in the library <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness has advanced this as a probing amendment and she wishes to establish i think the light in which equal opportunities matters are seen and will proceed <e> <s> i should start by putting the governments credentials on the table and reminding your lordships that we have continued to support the equal opportunities commission and to build where necessary on the legislative framework of the sex discrimination act and the equal pay act <e> <s> we supported the code of practice on employment produced by the eoc which came into force on th april <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state for employment has designated training bodies under section of the sex discrimination act to run special courses for women wishing to return to work or to enter non-traditional occupations <e> <s> there are now over designated bodies and we have supported the <e>", "<cs> it does not need a great deployment of debating skill or experience of social relations to convince the government that the ethnic minorities are an important part of our communities and that the work of the commission is of great importance <e>", "<cs> the noble lord does not put the other half of the equation <e> <s> there is the amount of money which the glc puts into these things and which will now become available in the absence of a precept through the local authorities <e>", "<cs> the danger of sitting and sometimes standing behind this box from half-past two in the afternoon until half-past eleven at night is that one sometimes forgets who has heard what one has said <e> <s> i do not wish to weary your lordships by repeating too much of what i have said before but i think that the noble baroness recognises that i must say something to the noble lord lord pitt <e>", "<cs> i have been asked to come clean in order to avoid hiccups and to prevent our staying in committee until doomsday which are desirable aims in themselves and i shall do my best <e> <s> i regret with the rest of your lordships because of his special interest and expertise in this committee that my noble friend lord cranbrook cannot be with us today <e> <s> but i must say that we have not suffered too much from his absence because of the admirable expositions of those <e>", "<cs> i saw a reference to the baron stedman on the marshalled list at a point that we have not reached <e> <s> i had not realised that i was so subliminally open as to transfer that <e> <s> i meant to say the noble lord lord tordoff who also referred to amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i rather hope that some others of your lordships will have questions to ask <e>", "<cs> we must remind ourselves that this is committee stage <e> <s> we get into an awful sort of second reading stance on this bill for some reason <e> <s> it is however committee stage and we can get up and down <e> <s> in answer to the noble baroness lady stedman the order would make provision for the money to be raised and it could be raised in the form of a precept <e>", "<cs> i am obliged <e> <s> i have clearly not been as lucid as i would have wished <e> <s> there are two amendments in question <e> <s> one already on the marshalled list is amendment no <e> <s> a <e> <s> that is the amendment which elicited the letter which i would have thought would have allayed almost all the fears subsequently expressed by the noble lord lord tordoff <e> <s> he will tell me in a minute why it has not done so <e>", "<cs> i am not sure of the date but i think that the amendment that they wrote about appeared on the marshalled list at the most about a fortnight ago or rather less <e>

amendment no <e> <s> a at some stage <e> <s> i do not ask him to read it now because it will take some time <e> <s> it is fairly detailed <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has a much better recollection of a-level chemistry than i do <e> <s> he has warned me and i undertake to stay out of the <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord defends himself may i remind him that the gentleman in question is now called sir godfrey taylor <e>", "<cs> at least i will answer it <e> <s> i attribute no malice to the noble lord at all in asking this question <e>", "<cs> i am left in some doubt by the noble baroness who had led me earlier to suppose that this was a probing amendment <e> <s> she addressed it as a probing amendment to start with but as she became wound up towards the end it became clearer and clearer that she really thought that it was a great improvement on the bill <e>", "<cs> oh the noble baroness does <e> <s> i should just like to know that is all <e> <s> i do not agree with the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness took elegant advantage of the opportunity i gave her but i understand what she means <e>", "<cs> it is not often that a minister at the dispatch box has the agreeable feeling that thanks to the support of members of his party behind him his presence is really superfluous <e> <s> i shall therefore not detain your lordships very long though i am slightly wounded by the pleasure with which that statement is received <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness will be relieved to learn that what i am holding is not the document that she has in mind <e> <s> what i have is a blank pad on which i send urgent messages asking for answers to the difficult questions that she puts to me <e> <s> i am sorry that she felt at the beginning of this evening that she was still in the dark because i think that we covered most of this ground carefully at an earlier committee sitting <e> <s> however i am grateful to the noble baroness for being in the dark because she spurred my noble friend lord colville to elucidate much more clearly than i could and in almost every respect absolutely accurately what is contained in the bill <e>", "<cs> i will not join issue with the noble lord on the merits of his admirable work on the workings of the treasury nor on the page references that my noble friend quoted <e> <s> the quotation was correct the page was wrong <e> <s> i will address myself simply to the amendments on the marshalled list <e>", "<cs> if i referred to it inadvisedly from time to time it is because i see it as a problem within a problem rather than as a problem beside a problem if i make myself clear <e> <s> that would exempt the authority from automatic precept control for the three-year transitional period <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is traducing

noble lord says <e> <s> but as to the length of the proceedings i only want to put it on record that when the noble lord says as he has said several times already that i must accept something or it is the case that your lordships must not take the silence which i display in order to expedite matters this evening as being in any way assent to anything he says <e>", "<cs> the purpose of the subsections which this amendment would delete is to enable the government to take account of the actual distribution of the cost of transferred functions in setting expenditure guidance or targets for successor authorities and expenditure levels for those successor authorities selected for rate limitation <e> <s> clause concerns targets and clause concerns expenditure levels <e> <s> both provisions are transitional and apply to the first year after abolition only <e>", "<cs> to save time may i ask the noble lord whether his real concern is with clarification of the undertakings or does he wish me also to address the amendments themselves <e>", "<cs> i think then that i should be able to dispel the fears that have been voiced <e> <s> in recent years the great majority of glc spending has been financed from the rates through the glcs precept on the boroughs <e> <s> on abolition the glcs precept will of course cease <e> <s> in its place the successor boroughs and districts will start to levy their own rates and successor joint authorities to levy their own precepts to finance the services that they take on <e> <s> the fire board will levy a precept but by far the greater volume will be raised by the boroughs for their own use <e> <s> there is absolutely no question about the boroughs access to the major source of glc resources because it is their own ratepayers <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is showing all the sparkling form that my right honourable and honourable friends in another place endowed him with in the long training that they gave him in staying up until four in the morning about which he spoke earlier <e> <s> i congratulate him on the incisiveness of his appraisal of this part of the bill though i cannot say that i entirely share his analysis <e>", "<cs> i must say that even at this late hour i am very disappointed in the noble baronesss reaction to this amendment because it is entirely negative and entirely pessimistic <e> <s> the noble baroness should bear with me for a moment and look at this matter in the light of recent events <e> <s> this is a scheme which can be made mandatory by the voluntary agreement of a majority of the boroughs and the majority of the boroughs have already written to us to say that they want to set up the scheme <e> <s> so why the noble baroness thinks it will not happen i do not know <e> <s> the only other disappointment she can have is in believing that the people concerned are incapable of running the scheme when they have it <e> <s> that seems to me to ignore the scale of operation of the london boroughs as we know them and the availability of the expertise which we discussed at some length earlier this afternoon to be put into this sort of organisation <e>", "<cs> clause has now been replaced with however little benefit of the approval of the noble baroness opposite by the amendment that we have just accepted <e> <s> so i ask your lordships that this clause should not stand part of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i can certainly assure my noble friend that the government continue to attach great importance to green belts <e> <s> as he has reminded us as recently as last summer the secretary of state reaffirmed green belt policy and in particular the presumption against inappropriate development within them <e> <s> as he is the final appeal authority i cannot say anything about individual cases <e> <s> but i can tell my noble friend that we are satisfied that the procedures laid down in circular / are appropriate for securing sufficient land for new housing although we shall clearly keep those under review <e>", "<cs> indeed my lords <e> <s> i have the statement in my hand with exactly the same words underlined <e> <s> i thought that i had reflected them and i thought also that i might have difficulty with the word inalienable <e>", "<cs> my lords that is an interesting question <e> <s> i think that the answer is that every thing i have said and this has been borne out by the noble baroness opposite has been to repeat ready published policy <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord harmar-nicholls has made it plain that it would be improper for me to pronounce on this particular application <e> <s> all i can do is to repeat the governments commitment to their stated policy <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend bears all relevant

lords i am perfectly happy to oblige the noble baroness <e> <s> on reading <e>", "<cs> my lords i really think that that goes beyond the scope of the question but i shall bear it in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i should like to start by saying something which i think must be obvious to your lordships but which is not always taken for granted that is that concern over the housing of people in london is of equal intensity on both sides of the chamber and at both dispatch boxes <e> <s> but what we have to consider is how that concern can best operate and so this is not an auction between the two sides to say i care more than you do and no i care more than you <e> <s> it is a discussion about the

lawyer with an acute mind he will know that the difference between an excuse and a reason is whether you approve of what is being done <e> <s> my noble friend agrees with what is being done and gave reasons <e> <s> the noble lord disagrees with what is being done and calls them excuses <e> <s> it seems to me that my first job is to produce what i call the reasons and what the noble lord calls the excuses <e> <s> whatever they are it is necessary to explain why we <e>", "<cs> i instantly accept that <e> <s> what interests me is not the nature of the bill but the date on which it became law <e>

baroness says a rather general statement such as one might hear from one of the right reverend prelates eloquently enunciating from the pulpit <e> <s> it is saying simply you should be good <e> <s>

think that if we could be legislated upon to be good they would be the first at the table to put down the amendment <e>", "<cs> would the noble baroness like to finish or may i reply to that point now

mccs are large and complex organisations <e> <s> they hold as the noble lord has reminded the committee much property and have obtained many rights and incurred many liabilities either as heirs of earlier abolished authorities or in the course of the discharge of their statutory functions <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> e was originally part of a group from which the first two dropped off <e>

occasions that county hall is to be transferred at abolition to the london residuary body <e> <s> if the noble baroness thinks that there are no other assets of the glc which will be available for the funding of the trust for london that i spoke of earlier she is entirely mistaken <e> <s> that commitment does not depend upon disposing of county hall <e> <s> so i should like to lay that to rest <e>", "<cs> on the first point raised by the noble baroness i will repeat yet again that all the assets realised on abolition within a metropolitan county council area or the glc area will be used for the benefit of the people who live there so there is no question of londoners losing the benefit in whatever form of county hall <e> <s> it will not be whisked away to pay for the national debt or

learned lord lord wilson of langside and the noble lord lord hooson both have two advantages over me they have both had legal training and they have both had their lunch <e> <s> i have had neither and any shortcomings in my delivery may be attributed to both causes <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will forgive me we are discussing a much later clause <e> <s> he is talking about ilea <e> <s> the power for that order is in a separate clause of the bill which your lordships have already dealt with <e>", "<cs> perhaps i have not made myself clear <e> <s> the substance of what the clause order does is

great deal of advice <e> <s> however noble lords who are after all members of a voluntary organistion when in opposition do the work themselves <e> <s> it is true that they do it with the assistance of certain interested parties who provide material for your lordships from time to time of not all of which i approve <e> <s> however your lordships labours are mighty <e> <s> i acknowledge that and i in no way rebuke the noble baroness when i suggest that in this matter it may just be possible for her to be fractionally better informed at third reading <e> <s> that should not take much because she

of the noble baroness lady birk has other connotations and we shall doubtless be discussing the amendment later <e> <s> what i am saying is that in the light of your lordships views on the fairly clear statement at least i hope it is a clear statement of the desire of the lba which represents the majority of the london boroughs and of my noble friend who is chairman of serplan and one of the members of your lordships house with the most powerful credentials as an authority on planning i hope to bring forward amendments at third reading to answer those concerns <e> <s> if you lordships read the record i think you will find that that is precisely what i have said <e> <s> it is certainly precisely what i mean <e> <s> however i wish to hear the debate and obviously your lordships reaction before i finally commit myself <e>", "<cs> my lords what i have put before your lordships is this <e> <s> i have engaged as in committee i undertook to do in discussions with both my noble friend and the representatives of such london boroughs as wished to enter into consultation and that was most of them represented by the lba <e> <s> the lba came to a conclusion no that is wrong <e>

they will commend it to their association <e> <s> we shall have their answer on that commendation before third reading <e>", "<cs> the proposals suggest that there should be a body representative of each of the london boroughs which could first provide concerted borough input and views to the secretary of state on all matters related to the strategic planning for greater london secondly provide by means of representatives serving on serplan a greater london input to serplan on matters related to strategic planning for the regions and thirdly allow the london authorities to discuss among themselves any london-wide planning issues or other planning matters of common concern <e> <s> such a body would have modest administrative and professional support provided on a lead borough basis and funded the lba proposes by all the boroughs following agreement by an appropriate majority of the boroughs <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to use up my right of reply but i think i ought to draw the attention of the noble viscount lord esher to the fact that what we are proposing is putting something in the bill which is a statutory and not a voluntary arrangement <e>", "<cs> my lords if nobody else has anything to say then i have <e> <s> by your lordships leave therefore i should like to say first that i recognise as do the government the concerns which have resulted in amendments to replace the secretary of state with his strategic guidance with a mechanism which appears to be further from the national centre of administrative and political power <e>", "<cs> there is no n at the end of it my lords <e> <s> their planning remit is too dam big and too dam small to make them proper custodians of either regional or national interests <e> <s> that is why we have set our hand to doing away with them as the planning authorities not replacing them but doing away with them <e>", "<cs> indeed my lords the secretary of state is directly elected <e> <s> when one is dealing with a national planning issue as my right honourable friend has shown recently with conspicuous skill and sense on a number of occasions it is very important that one should be an elected member <e> <s> this is about protecting the interests of people <e> <s> that is best done at local level by the truly local people and at national level by the truly national people both of them elected <e>", "<cs> my lords i should i think on a matter of order explain to the noble baroness that my undertaking to look at a possible amendment at third reading to look after the metropolitan counties would be overtaken if she were as i hope she will not be successful in the next few minutes <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not propose to make another speech <e> <s> i merely wish to remind your lordships that the substantial material that i deployed in the last debate related to this amendment and not to the one before <e> <s> i should hope your lordships would rather widen the majority that your lordships granted us last time <e>", "<cs> my lords again i think that your lordships have heard enough of me for one afternoon <e> <s> i have certainly <e> <s> the noble baroness is not going to remind you of her arguments <e> <s> i shall not remind you of my arguments except to tell your lordships that i think they are rather better <e>", "<cs> my lords one would not expect the noble baroness to come forward with an amendment which i could commend to the house without the consultations to which my noble friend referred with the london boroughs association <e> <s> i recognise that she is pursuing something which is less disagreeable than what she was pursuing earlier this evening <e> <s> the london planning commission provisions of schedule of the bill are contained in three paragraphs of which the noble baronesss amendment leaves only one intact <e> <s> that is the one which says <e>", "<cs> my lords by your lordships leave if nobody else wishes to speak i thought that i had given a firm undertaking and that your lordships had voted on that basis on at least one of the three occasions on which we have just gone through the lobby <e> <s> i shall be as brief as i can and recapitulate what i said <e> <s> first i went over the ground of the development of the discussion in committee to which the noble baroness referred <e> <s> i then said that in committee i gave an undertaking to consult the london boroughs as to their view on the sort of statutory arrangements my noble friend suggested because i would not wish as the noble baroness suggested that the house should now do to commit your lordships to a statutory arrangement of this sort without discussing it with the london boroughs <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> for the second time i am happy to repeat that <e>", "<cs> my lords with your lordships gracious leave i should say that i am always in favour of early tabling of amendments and i hope that in future the noble baroness will follow her own advice particulary on thursdays and fridays <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord will forgive me for intervening but i understood that he would be dealing with amendments nos <e> <s> b and c at the same time <e> <s> i merely wish to get the record straight <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord wishes to treat the amendments in that way i am sure that my noble friend will be able to cope with it <e> <s> i merely wanted to get the record straight so that we know what is being spoken about and my noble friend can reply accordingly <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure whether my speaking is in breach of the conventions of your lordships house and your lordships must ask me to sit down if your wish <e> <s> i am not certain whether the noble lord lord kilmarnock noticed that the chair reminded him that he cannot have both amendments nos <e> <s> and a <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> a seeks to remove part of the bill which amendment no <e> <s> will have already removed <e>

<s> i just wanted to help the noble lord by pointing out that if in his first amendment he leaves out two-and-a-half lines he cannot also leave out the same half line at the end of that in his next amendment <e> <s> he has made the choice <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment which the noble lord lord graham of edmonton has moved would make the joint authorities for waste regulation and disposal for which the bill currently provides responsible under part ii of the mines and quarries tips act for ensuring that disused mines and quarry tips do not become unstable and constitute a danger to the public <e> <s> i had expected to say that i was grateful to the noble lord lord ezra for moving this amendment since it was tabled in his name <e> <s> i am sure i detect his expert hand and experience in it because of course the spoils of mining were something with which he was closely concerned at a critical time <e> <s> i am grateful to him and to the noble lord lord graham of edmonton for drawing to our attention an important oversight in this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords question referred to successor authorities <e> <s> the body to which the noble lord has referred is i believe the london residuary body which in the terminology of the bill is not a successor authority although it is a successor <e>", "<cs> my lords most of the people referred to in the question have nothing to do with london but with the metropolitan counties <e>", "<cs> my lords most of the mud misses and the rest of it finds targets other than the government <e>", "<cs> my lords the only question i heard the noble lord ask was whether the person in question will hold two jobs <e> <s> the answer is no <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord rightly points out every aspect of political allegiance is reflected in the areas in question <e> <s> the noble lord asks that an appointee should combine every political allegiance in his own person <e> <s> we do not make these appointments on the basis of political allegiance <e>", "<cs> my lords i am interested that the noble lord who asked this question should join with such amusement in that cheer having just said that his question was not intended to throw mud but was meant to be in the public interest <e> <s> i repeat that appointments are not made on that basis and nor was this appointment <e> <s> sir tag taylor was appointed because he was involved in london local government for nearly years <e> <s> he chaired both the london boroughs association and the association of metropolitan authorities <e> <s> he ceased active involvement in local government in <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not detect a question there except that the noble lord asked whether i am aware of the point he makes <e> <s> yes i am <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble baroness or her friends have any names in view then i shall be interested to know them <e>", "<cs> my lords we want to appoint the best person for the job and we have started on that course rather well <e>", "<cs> my lords we are thinking of figures similar to those given to the chairmen of such bodies as new town development corporations and in the local government field appointments such as members of the local government boundary commission <e>", "<cs> my lords the question which i was asked to answer related to the remuneration of these people <e> <s> if the noble lord wishes to pursue the matters he has raised i should think that the bill which creates the posts would be an appropriate vehicle for him to consider <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> the bodies to which i referred give remuneration to their chairmen on the basis of notional full-time salaries which of course reduce to the extent that the chairman does not work full-time <e>", "<cs> my lords i never mind questions being asked so long as i am not required to answer them in inappropriate circumstances which these would be <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will look at the record of the answer that i gave his noble friend yesterday he will find that that is already on the record <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that it entirely relates to our reputation as a democratic country but as an efficient country i think it does <e> <s> the noble lord will find that when the work of these people is done local government will be a good deal cheaper than it now is and there will be a net and continuing saving <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not answerable for what was said by the leader of another government of a different persuasion from my own <e>", "<cs> my lords i have misattributed the quotation <e> <s> i am nonetheless not answerable for general political philosophy in a question concerning the salary of an individual appointee <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not agree with that analysis but this is not the occasion to debate it <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not expect the arrangements to be beyond precedent <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now further considered on report <e>", "<cs> my lords after that admirably clear introduction i should perhaps say a word of further explanation by drawing attention to the fact that the second amendment to which my noble friend lord mottistone spoke amendment no <e> <s> b is as it happens not only consequential on his amendment no <e> <s> a it is also a paving amendment for the government amendment amendment no <e> <s> aa to which i shall be referring again in a moment <e>", "<cs> my lords what my noble friend will get emphatically from his noble friend on the front bench is the statement that this is not committee stage and that he should not indulge in returning to the matter yet again <e> <s> i shall be speaking later but with the greatest respect i do not think that i would encourage my noble friend to enter into that ping-pong match at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords on a rough calculation the noble lord lord sainsbury spoke for about a minute and a half and i have eight-fifths of that length of time which gives me about two minutes to speak if we use his formula of weight for age <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall return to the legislative aspect of that in a moment <e> <s> at this stage i shall only remind the noble baroness of what i said <e> <s> she has in fact planted an interesting question in my mind <e> <s> i can tell your lordships this exactly <e> <s> she is not saying the boroughs do not do it she is saying they do not do it in concert i take it <e> <s> she is not saying that any particular london borough does not conduct a trading standards service <e>", "<cs> my lords no they do not work together because the consortia are not statutory bodies as the amendments would have them <e> <s> they are therefore not discharging a statutory function <e> <s> the statutory function rests with the boroughs in this case <e> <s> but i shall get elucidation on that to be entirely happy in my own mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i followed my noble friends first question but i am not sure whether i understand the second one <e> <s> if i may reply to the first i gave a somewhat condensed account of amendment no <e> <s> c because i did not think your lordships would want me to speak to yet another amendment <e> <s> however if i can allude to it briefly now its effect is to require the residuary body to approach the relevant successor authorities which in effect means all the district councils with which my noble friend is concerned and ask whether they are likely to wish to enter into an agreement with it to take on that service temporarily because they think that they will need the service to be discharged later but have not yet got their act together so to speak <e> <s> it is an interim arrangement and a back-up to the joint committee <e> <s> my noble friend i think wanted to ask another question and i am not sure whether i understood it correctly <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to your lordships i think i must trespass on your patience by speaking yet again although this is report stage <e> <s> the effect of paragraph is that there is a duty on the districts to form a joint committee <e> <s> it is then for the joint committee to decide how to discharge the statutory function which they will be discharging on behalf of the constituent councils <e> <s> if there is a difficulty about keeping the teams together this brings us back to amendment no <e> <s> c and the debate which we shall no doubt have on what i have come to think of as the cranbrook group of issues <e>", "<cs> my lords in reply to my noble friend lord drumalbyn i could refer him simply to the speech i made on the last amendment <e> <s> but i can say that we recognise the importance of the teams in the services <e> <s> what we cannot do is to instruct from central government that every member of every team shall remain in employment by the successor bodies <e> <s> that is obviously not the role of central government and there would be great cries of totalitarianism and so on from the other side of the house if that were to be done <e> <s> but all the machinery is there to retain them so long as their service is wanted or it is thought that they may be wanted after the st april next year if the arrangements are not made before <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a matter for the house but the more my friends behind me say that they are thinking of supporting the amendment of the noble baroness lady lockwood unless the noble baroness lady birk speaks to her amendment at the same time the more i feel i should encourage her to speak to her amendment at the same time <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to add to my noble friends frustration but it occurred to me that he and other noble lords may wish to pick holes in what i say <e> <s> there would be no opportunity for them to do that if i spoke after they did this being the report stage <e> <s> if i expose myself to this treatment now it means that i have an opportunity to reply

may be a little surprised and i hope a good deal relieved to know that the actual archives will stay exactly where they are <e> <s> the glro will physically be where it is now <e> <s> therefore access

amendments have passed and therefore how many speeches my noble friend has used up in proportion to his ration <e> <s> but as my noble friend referred to the way in which we propose to handle this bill between the two houses i can only tell him as he well knows that i cannot commit in this house the government to doing anything in another place <e> <s> what he has said will be carefully noted

right part of the bill or whether it should be a free-standing entry in the bill <e> <s> i shall certainly take advice on that <e> <s> my own view is that one divides the clauses and the subsections

dealt with in separate parts of the bill i shall certainly look at that <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord will kindly give way <e> <s> i think he may be speaking to a manuscript amendment

part of my noble friends question is that this is an organisational way of spending existing funds better <e> <s> as to the areas on the ground that my noble friend asked about i do not think i can give him an accurate answer in the time available at the box <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a certain tendency on the front bench opposite to think that any problem is best solved by throwing more money at it <e> <s> on this side we think it is best to use the money we have more effectively <e>", "<cs> my lords it will take time but the effects will begin to be seen quite early <e>", "<cs> my lords the question which my noble friend asked was about help which we had given to the inner-city areas and to that there is a numerical answer <e> <s> the noble lord asked whether we will publish further details of progress <e> <s> i am not aware of what plans there are but i am sure that if they are not published without his instance he will put down another question <e>", "<cs> my lords the function of the teams is to look at what is called in jargon the interface between <e>", "<cs> my lords the teams are made up from representatives of the departments which i listed to start with <e> <s> the london team has met formally three times and has held meetings with private and voluntary sector interests including business in the community and the ncvo <e> <s> the noble lord asked whether we did not have a tendency on this bench to provide more organisation which i think he thought was reciprocal to the tendency which i identified on his front bench to provide more money <e> <s> i think that that is fair <e> <s> we believe that if one is to spend vast amounts of public money it should be done in an organised and effective way and we should make sure that the left hand knows what the right hand is doing <e> <s> it has not done for many many years <e>", "<cs> my lords this is not the insertion of an additional level of anything <e> <s> it is a way to see that the existing levels work better together <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that it would have been the ncvo the national council for voluntary organisations <e>", "<cs> my lords may i remind my noble friend that the answer to his question is as follows <e> <s> a total of units have now been completed on these sites <e> <s> of those are for owner-occupation forty-two per cent <e> <s> of the new occupiers previously lived within the three dockland boroughs <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for my noble friends question <e> <s> when the corporation was established in july the level of owner-occupation among the total population of its area was per cent <e> <s> the present level is per cent <e> <s> the corporations target is to bring it up to at least per cent <e> <s> which is i may add the average for inner london <e>", "<cs> my lords some units have so far been provided for rent on both the ldcc and privately owned land units through housing associations and through council schemes <e>", "<cs> my lords of course there are a number of well-known schemes for developing warehouses for residential purposes <e> <s> however i shall bring the noble lords remarks to notice in the proper quarter <e>", "<cs> my lords i see that the noble and learned lord would like to answer for himself <e> <s> i am not in a position to complain about the order of business at all but if i can anticipate him the corporation intends there to be a proportion of dwellings on each site to be sold at or below <e> <s> the proportion varies according to the land value of the site <e> <s> where the land value is very high it is the corporations policy to arrange equity-sharing schemes wherever possible <e> <s> this makes a lot of housing affordable <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble and learned lords assumptions are open to question <e> <s> there is a proportion of affordable rented accommodation available <e> <s> as always i shall draw his remarks to the attention of my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords not without notice <e> <s> however it is a perfectly proper question and i shall put the answer in the library <e>", "<cs> my lords the corporation was formed in july <e> <s> between then and th november permanent new jobs had been created in the docklands areas <e> <s> of these were located within the enterprise zone <e> <s> in addition an average of people were employed on construction work at any one time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am always happy to answer any question to which the answer can only be yes <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe a very great deal of what my noble friend wishes is achieved by the annual report and accounts which are generally available <e> <s> i shall make further copies available if they are needed <e>", "<cs> my lords the jobs which i referred to as new jobs are new jobs <e> <s> i am not aware that there is any evidence to show that there is a kind of vacuum being filled in the zone represented by vacancies around it <e>", "<cs> my lords i remember from my days in opposition that one never had much joy from giving credit to the government of the day <e>", "<cs> my lords i acknowledge at once the noble lords special experience and authority in the matter of new towns <e> <s> however it is not for me to answer for the policy of previous governments <e> <s> i accept that this is a very major development in existing urban renewal <e> <s> i do not doubt that we shall continue to profit from the lessons therein <e> <s> i hope opportunities will arrive for us to do so on a wider scale <e>", "<cs> my lords i look forward with great pleasure to the enthusiasm which the noble lord promises us in support of our efforts <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill now be further considered on report <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord help us further <e> <s> i ticked off what he said <e> <s> i understand that he is not proposing to speak to amendments nos <e> <s> ac or af <e> <s> the understanding i was given after midday today was that the grouping would run from amendment no <e> <s> aa to amendment no <e> <s> ah and that only amendments nos <e> <s> aj and ak in the name of the noble baroness lady birk were to be taken on their own <e> <s> having been given that information very late in the day it is slightly disturbing to have it altered at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i am anxious to find the right speech on this occasion <e> <s> clause to which these amendments are addressed provides for the reorganisation of the functions for the joint authorities to be set up under part iv <e> <s> i shall from time to time refer to transport issues because they are embedded in the workings of the clause <e> <s> i want to start by ensuring that your lordships are familiar with the way the clause works as now drafted because it is to changing that that the noble lord lord mishcon with the assistance of my noble friend lord inglewood has addressed himself and it is proper so to do <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i ought to take your lordships a little into my confidence about the background to this <e> <s> i was not surprised when at the close of business on friday which was about seven or eight oclock at night it was not possible to get any indication of the groupings which noble lords opposite wished for these amendments <e> <s> i was not altogether surprised when i telephoned the usual channels on saturday to get the same response <e> <s> i was a little surprised when at nine oclock ten oclock eleven oclock half past eleven and at twelve oclock today i could still get no groupings from the usual channels <e> <s> when i thankfully received the groupings they were as i stated at the beginning of this debate that all the amendments down to amendment no <e> <s> ah were to be taken together and amendments nos <e> <s> aj and ak were to be taken separately <e> <s> i was content with that and it was on that basis that i put my remarks together <e>", "<cs> my lords i always regret an opportunity missed to speak to the noble lord lord mishcon particularly outside the chamber where we more frequently agree than we do inside it <e> <s> the amendments to which i refer carried also the names of my noble friend the noble lord lord mishcon and the noble lord lord carmichael of kelvingrove and until we discovered that they were not a part of this there were amendments in the name of the noble baroness lady birk <e> <s> it is the function of the usual channels on the noble lords side of the house to make the communications which the noble lord says were not made and not for the usual channels or indeed the unusual channels on this side of the house to volunteer and as i always do when i interfere in other peoples business get things in a muddle <e> <s> we seem to have done it without my assistance on this occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords i rather think that the noble lord will find that we are at cross-purposes when he reads <e>", "<cs> my lords i can confirm that with the close personal experience of the way in which community policing was developing when i was at the home office and is continuing to develop <e> <s> i would endorse absolutely my noble friends thesis which underlies what he has said in his question that policing is something which ought to come from the community and not be imposed upon it <e> <s> once you have community policing you have an orderly public <e> <s> but i am not quite certain how that knits into the matters that we are discussing now because plainly that will remain the case whatever the size of the police authority <e> <s> indeed i suppose that there are those who would suggest that a smaller authority would be closer to the public and that there might be something to be said for reducing the size of the authorities which the noble lord asks us to leave intact unless we have primary legislation to enable us to change them <e>", "<cs> my lords i had intended to wait until the end of the sentence but i was going to ask the noble lord whether he is aware that the powers already exist in the police act and the fire services act for my right honourable friend the home secretary to amalgamate or combine police and fire authorities <e> <s> they do not seem to have been acting as a sword of damocles since <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mishcon has very kindly said that he would yield <e> <s> he has managed to deprive me of my winding-up speech and so i think i should exploit that courtesy <e> <s> to start with perhaps i may reply to the question he asked me which may have been an oratorical one by saying that the account i gave of the conversations speeches and writings of my right honourable friend the home secretary was accurate and that he has never used the word never <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall now endeavour to salvage those elements of my last speech which applied only to transport and which were snatched from my lips by the untimely decision of the noble lord lord mishcon to speak only on the police and marginally on the fire and civil defence services aspects <e> <s> i am well served and i think that i have something coherent to say <e>", "<cs> my lords in that case if it was agreed that a district council should take over responsibility for the support of its own bus services in the way i have just described the government believe that it would also be right for it to take over responsibility for its own decisions on concessionary fares <e> <s> we can see no grounds for denying a metropolitan district which has those responsibilities the same powers to take its own decisions and exercise its own judgment and priorities as would be enjoyed by any other local authority <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may put the noble lord right on one matter <e> <s> i think that he should have said that green belt land will not be available except when the minister says it will <e>", "<cs> my lords i start by congratulating the noble lord lord john-mackie on the impressive way in which he sprang into the fairly large breach left by the absence of the noble lord lord kilmarnock not only from the place where he now sits but from his usual place as well <e> <s> the bill before the house is a bill to abolish the glc and the metropolitan county councils and to transfer as many of their functions as possible to the borough councils in london and the district councils in the metropolitan counties <e> <s> these purposes already have your lordships declared approval as well as that of another place <e> <s> i am sure the noble lord lord john-mackie will be able to read this tomorrow <e> <s> one complete set of the functions in question is that of owning and managing public open spaces <e> <s> the bill as drafted provides for those functions to be transferred in line with the principal purpose directly from the upper-to the lower-tier authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble lord and i shall take further advice but at least as to the half that is not going to the boroughs he may be reassured <e> <s> statutory smallholdings will also pass to the county councils and this will not have the effect of dispersing smallholding ownership therefore but of concentrating it in different hands <e>", "<cs> my lords with your lordships leave i do not think there will be time for me to get an exact form of words <e> <s> i was quite careful in what i said in reply to the noble lord after he intervened for the first time in my speech <e> <s> if he would read that i conceded that the acreage was greater to the boroughs than to the counties but i also said that we were looking at this and would consider his views which are on the record as to any further alterations in the boundaries <e> <s> the noble lord was kind enough not to interrupt my peroration <e> <s> i hope your lordships have not forgotten it <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble viscount could enlighten me because i do not want to listen to the rest of his speech under a misapprehension <e> <s> he started the passage on which he is now engaged with a reference to the palumbo development and then went on to the green giant <e> <s> he then said that if it had not been for this committee and then i lost him <e> <s> is he telling the house that it was this committee which decided that the palumbo development should not take place because i am sure he cannot be doing that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend for bringing us back from planning to conservation <e> <s> i thought for a moment i had misunderstood the noble viscount lord falkland <e> <s> indeed i interrupted him at one moment to make sure i had him right <e> <s> he was referring to a chain of developments which could not be laid at the door of conservation but which were the outcome of planning procedures <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to protract this discussion but i should like the noble lord to take on board the point that preservation is part of planning <e> <s> it is the function of the secretary of state when important decisions are taken to him to have in mind the conservation considerations and to balance these against what the noble viscount calls planning although i think he means development <e> <s> planning consists of balancing conservation against development <e> <s> that is where the protection which the noble viscount seeks should be <e> <s> that is why our debate on th june was and our amendments for third reading will be so important to him <e> <s> that is why he is wrong to pursue the line which he is pursuing at the moment on only one aspect of planning <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord cottesloe and to the noble lords lord strabolgi and lord melchett for bringing this perhaps rather domestic but nonetheless important london concern to your lordships attention <e> <s> it is a subject of close concern to a number of your lordships not least to me and i am glad of the opportunity to reassure your lordships on one or two issues <e>", "<cs> my lords it was by way of a telephone conversation at a distance and i could not say what the noble lord defined as the park <e> <s> but i put the matter on the record to show simply this <e> <s> your lordships may not want to dwell on the details for long but what i have said shows that i have received many submissions on this matter and there are clearly contradictory views on what is best <e> <s> i spoke on it at length only to make it clear that even on our undertaking to transfer the heath as an entity there is room to differ about the precise location of its boundary and that the solution inferred by the drafting of the amendment would be a respectable one if that is what should finally emerge <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment ably introduced by the noble baroness lady birk is an amendment which she tabled at committee but which she did not move advancing instead another related <e>", "<cs> my lords i just want to confirm that the amendments are already on the marshalled list <e> <s> unfortunately a good deal of explanation is needed and i do not think i can provide it in an intervention in the speech of the noble baroness <e> <s> she will remember that we have previously had debates about professional and technical services <e> <s> if she looks around clause she will find what we are looking for <e> <s> i would rather not try to get into that debate now <e> <s> however we are proposing that where there are available in the field valuable professional and technical

me to say that i did not give credence to what his noble friend had said and that is why i answered in the terms i did to his question <e> <s> i was not aware of such a scheme and i shall certainly

concerned with how many people should not want to join a scheme before the scheme becomes a non-runner <e> <s> in this discussion i am concerned to point out that with the arithmetic that the noble lord suggests it would taking merseyside as the illustration mean that all the conservative authorities could be against a scheme and none the less would be obliged under the bill as drafted with that amendment to fork out the money for the authorities of a different political persuasion to spend on something of which they did not approve <e> <s> that is not very far-fetched because that kind of thing has been happening all round us at the moment <e> <s> it is on those grounds that i ask the noble lord to abide by what i think was the general consensus after our debate because though we did not discuss this piece of arithmetic we looked at the bracket between per cent <e> <s> on the one hand and per cent <e> <s> on the other <e>", "<cs> my lords the point is that they would be having it forced upon them by a bipartisan decision because the decision to do it would be a decision of two conservative districts and one labour district <e> <s> that is what i am trying to preserve in

certain reservations in some instances disposed to welcome this amendment my noble friend lady faithfull asked about the metropolitan districts and whether i am worried about them <e> <s> as i explained in introducing the amendment we have provided for similar arrangements in the metropolitan areas should the resources become available <e> <s> so we are not preventing ourselves from taking the opportunity should it later arise <e> <s> but as i said the resources available from this source are very much more limited in the metropolitan counties than they are in greater london <e>", "<cs>

of the abolished bodies <e> <s> the difference between the metropolitan county councils and the greater london council is that the latter has been in existence for very much longer than the former and indeed has inherited a well-established inheritance <e> <s> so the resources in london are very considerable <e> <s> i could not endorse the exact figure that the noble earl lord perth gave but it is very considerable <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most obliged to the noble earl for reminding me of that omission and i apologise for the unintended discourtesy <e> <s> the decision is under the bill given

the process of consultation can therefore start very early <e> <s> i recall your lordships being a little restive when i said that we had started thinking about who should be chairmen and members of the residuary bodies <e> <s> i hope that the noble baroness will at least support the government in their belief that we ought to go ahead with this as soon as possible so that they can motor out into the field the minute it is legal to do so and not wait until st april as she fears they otherwise would <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with great interest to your lordships remarks about the <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened with close interest to the arguments put forward by my noble friend in support of his amendment <e> <s> he played on a sympathetic chord <e> <s> clause rounds off the

anxious and my noble friend lord harmar-nicholls put his finger on it and in fact i thought that my noble friend lord cranbrook almost accidentally put the point to your lordships because he said what

baroness what discretion would then remain <e>", "<cs> my lords that i must say is a most useful interruption <e> <s> i thought i had been terribly thorough and clever and i shall doubtless have a

is a limit to the number of times i can sit down and stand up without making more than one speech and i am not sure that i have not reached it <e> <s> i want to leave it clear that if what my noble friend wants is to leave no discretion and that is i regret the effect of what he now proposes then i do not think that is right <e> <s> i would say that and i would stand on it <e>", "<cs> my lords

suggest that it would be made impossible to implement it without providing some guard against that happening and some penalty for those who openly sought to break the law <e>", "<cs> my lords in the course of the committee stage of this bill we had a number of discussions about the nature of residuary bodies and it must be clear to your lordships that they are in fact a managerial team with a large number of responsibilities most of them administrative and i shall not describe them further <e> <s> i should say that they are not to have powers to initiate policies and they are not to be permanent parts of the local government scene <e> <s> we accept that they need to be accountable and it is accountability that the noble lord is after particularly on financial matters <e> <s> the bill therefore imposes on them an audit regime which gives public access to their accounts <e> <s> it requires them to produce an annual report which my right honourable friend must lay before parliament including your lordships house and the conduct of the bodies is within the purview of the parliamentary commissioner or ombudsman <e> <s> that seems to represent an appropriate regime of accountability for bodies of this kind <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord forgive a belated interruption for clarification <e> <s> i heard him addressing himself to clause <e> <s> it may be that i have got in a muddle but i thought his amendment was to leave out clause <e> <s> i am so sorry we are on amendment no <e> <s> cb <e> <s> i do apologise <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment would

and persuasive speech i had a certain sense of <e>", "<cs> my lords as your lordships will i believe know i had noticed that the noble lord was neither reverend nor a right reverend gentleman although charming and elegant nonetheless my noble friend lady carnegy of lour is at present taking through the house the local government access to information bill as it were on a parallel track <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to start by drawing your lordships attention to something that your lordships may have noticed already <e> <s> it is that not for the first time in our proceedings on this bill we are involved in a debate on a major matter of substance on the basis of an amendment that your lordships have not been able to see in print until the morning of the debate <e> <s> i fear that those of your lordships who came from afar and did not reach the house until midday or after will have been somewhat taken aback <e> <s> i think i ought to start therefore by explaining why the bill contains the proposals that are in clause what the effects of those proposals would be and how the amendment of the noble baroness would alter those effects <e>", "<cs> my lords inconsistent or contradictory i always try to modify what the noble baroness says against me in case it might be a little more wounding than she intended <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble baroness and i withdraw any suggestion that she has ever been wounding either deliberately or accidentally and i shall try to use the word accurately <e> <s> if she says that we were contradicting each other that is what she thinks we were doing and that is the charge to which i must reply <e> <s> in doing so i would ask her to start by considering the two bedrocks of principle on which the use of clause will rest <e> <s> the first is that central government manpower control which already exists in relation to for example the establishment of police forces is needed over the activities of the joint authorities as a whole to ensure that they are established in a fully satisfactory way <e> <s> that means a way that meets the needs of the service but does not involve the kind of expansion of bureaucracy which we saw and criticised after the reorganisation <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble baroness a question for clarification <e> <s> i understand she is now saying that the secretary of state would still have the power to require the authority to make a scheme that the authority would then make a scheme but that having made a scheme the authority would be free to discharge its functions in some different way while having regard to that scheme <e> <s> that seems to be a rather remarkable proposal for your lordships to accept <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness complete that sentence <e>", "<cs> my lords one has to admit that your lordships house is the most fascinating place <e> <s> one really never knows what is going to happen on a simple probing amendment which i understand this to be <e> <s> i am sure that no one is in the least interested in my views on the question that we have just been discussing <e> <s> in any case they are already on the record <e> <s> i shall therefore leave the matter in the safe hands of my elders and betters <e>", "<cs> my lords when what is now clause and was then clause was added to the bill in committee on st may the noble baroness lady birk gave notice of her dissatisfaction with it and said that she would be back <e> <s> i welcome her back on that notice <e> <s> the concerns which she raised then and again today have of course received fairly close attention during committee and report <e> <s> the noble baroness was concerned first to say that in london in particular but elsewhere by analogy the research and information functions of the metropolitan authority are extremely valuable <e> <s> the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey endorsed that <e> <s> i accept that a great deal of valuable work has been done and much useful information supplied to people who as the noble baroness pointed out are not necessarily always local authorities or indeed authorities in any other sense in the metropolitan or greater london areas <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged to the noble baroness <e> <s> i hope that i can dispose of what i think is a misconception <e> <s> i am not making the thesis that there is minuscule demand for this or that the demand is either less than or more than what is provided <e> <s> i am saying that the provision ought to be of a sort which matches that demand which may be greater or may be less and will not necessarily remain the same <e> <s> that is what we provide for in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness do me the reciprocal courtesy of yielding <e> <s> perhaps i have not made myself clear <e> <s> what i am saying is that there is no evidence to suggest that the level of information either in london or anywhere else is exactly right now and still less evidence to suggest that it will always remain the same <e> <s> we think it should be answerable to the pressures and that is what our arrangements provide for <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down as i detect he is about to do can he clear up what may be a misconception or a mishearing on my <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think it is necessary to go to issues of great principle as to the manner in which your lordships conduct yourselves to demonstrate that the noble lord lord graham of edmonton has very ably courteously clearly and with much restraint introduced a very bad amendment <e> <s> we have had amendments about a general precepting authority i think my noble friends are right on this on almost every other day at every stage of this bill and at each stage your lordships have decided against them <e> <s> the noble lord lord graham of edmonton has come in as a fresh bowler and has chosen fresh words and a fresh approach <e> <s> i do not have that advantage and therefore some of the things i may say may not sound so unfamiliar and so elegant as some of the things that the noble lord lord graham has said <e> <s> but that does not mean that they lack force <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord invites me to intervene <e> <s> there is permanent consultation in the bodies themselves because the bodies are made up of elected members of the constituent councils <e> <s> co-ordination is constant and precepting will be open because it will be a requirement on every precepting authority every rating authority to state the amount of every precept <e> <s> the electorate will know what their individual elected representative has let them in for <e>", "<cs> my lords not only i but my honourable and right honourable friends study very closely what your lordships say on every issue in these debates and i certainly undertake that that will be the case on this occasion <e> <s> there was a marvellous moment when my noble friend lady faithfull said from behind me i should like to support my noble friend and i was halfway through preparing a smile of incredulity and delight when she said lord hayter <e> <s> i am still rather put down by that unfortunate disappointment which i am sure all your lordships who have been long in this chamber on these debates will readily understand <e>", "<cs> my lords that is what encouraged me to expect a friendlier continuation of the speech so <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not replied to my noble friends questions on clause because they seem to fall very wide of the amendment we are debating and also because i have answered in full the point that she made when we were debating that clause <e> <s> the clauses to which i referred provide for the seetting up of schemes <e> <s> the committee under this clause is to assist by bringing people together to discuss matters which as in london they may well have long ago started discussing <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i rise simply to acknowledge his support and to tell the noble baroness that i agree with him and not with her to acknowledge belatedly the assistance that i have had from my noble friend lord molson in proceeding on what noble lords all think is the right path though some think that it is longer than others and finally to say that when i said that the in my speech should probably be a reference to i was wrong <e> <s> if your lordships see a different number appearing in the text that will be so that it makes sense <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i suggest to your lordships that those satisfied would not be so much a fine body of public servants but the trade unions which claim to represent them and which have resolutely resisted on many occasions and on many subjects any idea that they should co-operate in the dismantling of the present system and the replacement of it by something else <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord melchett for his clear explanation of his anxiety which is much as i believed it might be and for the small but welcome notice he gave me of his interest <e>", "<cs> my lords i may be quite wrong about this for i rely entirely on personal memory but i remember the footpath legislation being brought in and the purple lines we had to draw on the parish map <e> <s> my clear recollection is that then it was the district councils which were responsible for co-ordinating this <e> <s> i may be wrong for they may have done it subordinate to the county council but i do not see a great difficulty <e>", "<cs> i am terribly sorry my lords <e> <s> i ought to have asked this before the noble baroness lady stedman sat down <e> <s> she said that she was speaking also to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> i think that that was probably a slip <e> <s> i am quite happy to take it that she was not speaking to those as long as we are clear <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness lady stedman supported by the noble baroness lady birk has brought forward the first of two groups of amendments designed to achieve two changes to what the government now propose in amendment no <e> <s> to put into the bill <e> <s> the government proposals are in amendment no <e> <s> which your lordships accepted which strikes out of the bill the london planning commission and amendment no <e> <s> which is consequential upon it and in amendment no <e> <s> we propose a replacement in the form of a joint planning committee for greater london <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend for his courteous welcome <e> <s> there is no coyness in my reply to him when i say that i am very happy to accept the amendments which he now proposes <e> <s> i believe that they will be an improvement to the bill and i am most grateful to him for spotting a possible defect in the drafting which had escaped our notice <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most obliged to my noble friend lord sandford for really sufficient exposition of why i myself am opposed to this amendment and i am grateful to my noble friend lord campbell of alloway for his support of this <e> <s> perhaps i ought nonetheless to parade my credentials in resisting the amendment or both amendments nos <e> <s> and which embody the proposals of the noble baronesses concerning strategic guidance <e>", "<cs> my lords i am so glad to meet the phrase for the avoidance of doubt even peripherally in a statute <e> <s> i am reminded of a correspondence which i am told took place in <e>", "<cs> my lords whether or not this amendment comes fully exactly and convincingly within the reference in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not finished the sentence <e> <s> since i did not quite hear what the noble lord said it has left me somewhat surprised <e> <s> but the point i am making is that the volume at which we are looking as a volume of a percentage a proportion of the total local authority spend at both levels is very small <e> <s> i must remind your lordships that it is to the upper-tier spend only to which the noble lord refers and therefore a small proportion of the total local authority spend <e> <s> that overlooks the fact that over per cent <e> <s> of spending on local services in the metropolitan counties is in the hands of the districts and under per cent <e> <s> of spending on local services in london will fall to joint authorities <e> <s> that is the magnitude in local authority spending terms of the problem which the noble lord is examining <e>", "<cs> my lords our understanding of the english language obviously differs <e> <s> when a statute says that something shall be done for each financial year starting <e>", "<cs> my lords in broad terms section allows a local authority to spend a sum of money equal to what it can raise from its ratepayers by a p rate for any purpose for which it has no specific authorisation but which is legal and which the authority considers would be for the benefit of its area and the people living in it <e> <s> the exact calculation for any authority depends on its rateable value and its eligibility for block grant but i do not need to trouble your lordships with the precise details <e> <s> at present both the boroughs and the glc have this power in london and both the districts and the metropolitan county councils have this power in the metropolitan counties <e> <s> under this section the upper tier authority whether it is the glc or a metropolitan county council such as merseyside can spend on its own behalf an amount of money more or less equal to the total p rate product for all its constituent borough or district councils <e> <s> in that amounts to million for the glc and for example million for merseyside and million for greater manchester <e> <s> we are speaking may i remind your lordships not of the amount of <e>", "<cs> my lords i am never surprised by anything that the whips do i have been in the house too long <e> <s> as to the merits of that particular decision i am afraid that i am not possessed of the background <e> <s> but i am glad that the noble lord shares my view of the abuse <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps by your lordships leave i may reply <e> <s> any formal agreement that exists at abolition will either pass to a successor by order or fall to the residuary body because under the bill contracts are treated as property <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be a fast ball but it seems to have been rather a slow over judging by the expectations borne in on me about the rate of proceedings at the beginning of this debate <e> <s> perhaps i may begin by extracting from what i planned to say the undertakings i was asked to give and the repetitions i was asked to make <e> <s> i am glad to repeat as i have been asked to do by two noble lords and by the society of archivists the undertaking that if there is not a voluntary scheme at abolition day the intention is that the archives shall be transferred to the residuary body but that the staff shall for the time being also be with the residuary body and that the residuary body shall have a duty to find a permanent home for the archives and the staff before the expiry of five years <e> <s> that is what i was asked to do and i am glad to do it in terms <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness has been kind enough to give way <e> <s> if no scheme is arranged on abolition day and no other step is taken and no order made then automatically because they are property the archives go to the residuary body <e> <s> the residuary body then has a duty not only to look after them but also to see if anybody wishes an archive service <e> <s> they will go to every constituent successor authority and ask <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down and by leave of the house perhaps i may say that she made one assertion which if i did not reply to it now i think i would encourage your lordships to believe it to be true <e> <s> i have no hesitation in telling the noble baroness that she can glean no truth whatsoever from the article that she quoted from the <e>", "<cs> it rather depends on which end of the fork one may be my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords many of your lordships have made very kind remarks about my conduct of this bill and have given me a sympathy which in part at least i think i deserve for the way in which i came upon it in the first place <e> <s> i am most grateful to your lordships for that but i honestly must say that it would not have been possible to do so had your lordships not equally been good tempered and patient and enabled me to do it <e> <s> i am grateful to your lordships for never setting about me with the sort of provocative political attacks which one is so tempted to make on occasions when ones political sympathies are aroused <e>", "<cs> my lords that was a very proper intervention and i am glad to embed it as it were in my speech like a currant in a bun <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord was kind enough to protract his intervention for long enough for me to get hold of the exchanges he has referred to <e> <s> he has referred to his interjection an interjection in the exchanges which i was quoting from and he said i should go on to quote him <e> <s> he has now quoted himself and it is right for me to quote the reply of my noble friend lord denham who said at col <e>", "<cs> all bishops my lords are right reverend but on some occasions one chooses the wrong reverend to illustrate ones point <e> <s> that then is the background <e>", "<cs> my lords i note with interest the contacts which the noble lord has had with people in the sport <e> <s> as i say we believe it is a matter for the sport itself to consider <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only repeat that we think that the question of how the sport should be conducted is primarily a matter for the people who organise that sport to decide <e> <s> if the law is broken then of course it is a matter for the government to pronounce on how the law should be enforced <e>", "<cs> my lords misbehaviour of the sort that we have seen on a number of occasions by football supporters abroad brings no prestige to any club whose fans support it in that way <e> <s> there is a pronouncement by the international body which runs the whole of this sport which has banned english club teams from playing abroad as a result of the misbehaviour of some of those fans <e> <s> in my view it is for the sport itself and those in this country who support it to prove to that body by their actions and conduct that it is time to remove the ban <e> <s> it is not for the government to urge that body to do so against its judgment <e>", "<cs> my lords the international governing bodies of the sport have no doubt taken the steps that they consider to be most appropriate and effective <e> <s> the government for their part recognise the importance of particularly sensitive matches <e> <s> we believe that it is not for us to protect the interests of clubs which now add their distinction to the fourth division such as those of the noble lord as an individual class but to leave those matters to the sport itself to regulate <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships will know that there is a inquiry into the causes of football violence in this country and also into the particular incidents which gave rise to the ban <e> <s> the latter is being conducted by the authorities in the country concerned and your lordships would not expect me to anticipate it <e> <s> when we know what the facts are of course we shall be able to make a judgment on them <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i ought not to be drawn into an analysis of causes when i have just said that we should await the outcome of the report <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i have said that four or possibly five times so far <e>", "<cs> my lords as to my noble friends first two supplementary questions i think that her observations were correct and her conduct prudent <e> <s> as to the last i am told that the monument has been defaced but that this has been done with white paint which will soon grow out with the grass <e>", "<cs> my lords while i take note of what the noble lord says and shall consider it with care it goes a good deal wider than the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friends will no doubt properly consider the fact that the monuments are being preserved for public enjoyment <e> <s> they will also recognise that they have to be physically preserved and that the stonehenge monument in particular is surrounded with lesser archaeological monuments many of which were severely and irreversibly damaged during the course of the festival last year <e>", "<cs> my lords the public body surcharge sits behind me on these benches <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend for thus illuminating the fact that he is proceeding cautiously in the direction in which the noble lords would wish him to proceed <e>", "<cs> my lords this is something on which i do not think we can have an opinion poll <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his question because in fact i can discover no trace of such a letter having been received in the department <e>", "<cs> my lords if the two associations in question wish to see the secretary of state about matters arising from the abolition of the glc and the metropolitan county councils as a matter of urgency my right honourable friend would welcome that letter even more than the one that has been described <e>", "<cs> my lords the matter in question i take it is the matter of rate support grant penalties in particular <e> <s> the issue was fully discussed at the last cclgf meeting on th april and also in separate correspondence between my right honourable friend and the leaders

can raise it on rd july if they wish or at a separate meeting <e>", "<cs> my lords not having seen the letter i think the best i can do is to promise an early answer to any copy that may be sent <e>",

friend most helpfully reminds the house that for every of public expenditure is generated by local authorities <e> <s> he also pointed out and i did not remind your lordships of this that where there is profligate expenditure by local authorities even where there are social difficulties and high unemployment that expenditure which may be thought of as being aimed at ameliorating those conditions

lordships we hope to publish a consultation document by the end of the year <e> <s> that is another reason for not prejudging the answer to my noble friends question <e>", "<cs> my lords if the

was submitted in and an appeal against a refusal in <e> <s> there was then a public inquiry in for the purpose of determining that appeal <e> <s> in the course of that appeal the inspector decided to recommend a limit of tonnes extraction per year which if adopted would make the workings acceptable <e> <s> however the applicants objected to that condition and there was therefore the necessity for a further appeal because they said that this condition had not been considered by the first appeal <e> <s> that all sounds very involved but in fact we are trying to protect the interests of all the

are not talking about money as such but about spending power which is what i tried to make clear in my original answer <e>", "<cs> no my lords money and spending power are not the same <e> <s> spending power is what one gets by borrowing money and by having permission to spend money is cash <e> <s> to take an example which is fresh in the noble lords mind if a local authority sells a

housing needs of this country and we will bear the noble lords remarks in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to widen the terms of the debate other than to say that we recognise the need for mobility of labour in this country and the noble lord will recognise the fact that there are a large number of properties vacant at present <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to my noble friend for his comment but i think that it goes a little wide of the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> in my perhaps rather telescoped example i was thinking of the local authority itself

genius and i am neither i hope <e> <s> however the proposal will vastly reduce the area of negotiation and therefore of difference <e> <s> i hope that noble lords will recognise that this is the conservative government genuinely trying to disengage themselves from directing local authorities on how to conduct their affairs and transferring that responsibility to the electors of those authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords as to the noble lords first and fundamental question we are well aware of the difficulty of assessing needs simply <e> <s> the present calculations are elaborate <e>

discussions and i was taking part in them myself last week <e> <s> nothing is lost <e>", "<cs> i was merely saying that as the noble lord rested a great deal of his case on the three judgments i should have thought that whether or not they are about the matter would be very relevant <e>", "<cs> as my noble friend is indulging in emphatic statements of that kind my advice and i do not rely upon my reading of the cases either is that in the case of <e>", "<cs> i can reassure my noble friend that they do because the amendments to which i shall speak cover the same ground <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to both my noble friends for their support <e> <s> i simply say that when an order is laid before the house the convention is that if it is an affirmative procedure then the motion is to approve it and that motion can be voted against <e> <s> if it is known in advance that it will be voted against then the government can take what steps they think appropriate either through the whips or by amending the order <e>", "<cs> as a matter merely of fact i have made clear that there will be no code of practice in april <e> <s> that is when we start talking about it <e> <s> it will take quite a long time to get it ready <e> <s> i doubt very much that it will be ready by may or whenever it is that the great decisions are taken <e>", "<cs> it is not an amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may save a little time by reminding the noble lord that he is only talking about the bigger authorities <e> <s> does he really think that a scottish regional authority should be subject to the same guidance as a parish council <e>", "<cs> let me begin by endorsing what the noble lord lord henderson of brompton said in different terms by saying that i imagined in my innocence that when members of the committee voted amendments to the clause which they voted for on the grounds that they were an improvement to the clause they did not do so in the spirit of somebody giving a respray to his car before he put it on the scrap heap <e> <s> it seems to me that noble lords have spoken eloquently about the virtues of amending the clause in the sense which my noble friend lord campbell of alloway in a somewhat peripatetic manner has persuaded them to do <e> <s> i understood that what they were doing was improving the clause for the purpose of putting it in the bill <e> <s> i was glad that the noble lord lord henderson of brompton suggested that that was the appropriate course for those who had voted for the amendments and i was surprised that some members of the committee should think otherwise <e>", "<cs> i am not sure how keen i am to make things easier for the noble lord lord underhill i get more pleasure from making them more difficult <e> <s> the point of having this range of choices open is to avoid being boxed in by some absurd and unforeseen position when it arises <e> <s> i thought that the noble lord was only concerned about different authorities having different provisions and i pointed out that whereas it might be quite reasonable to have shires and districts and metropolitan districts and london boroughs under the same constraints it may well be and comments made in committee earlier have suggested that this is likely to be the case that parish councils ought to have some different criteria applied to them because they are different animals doing basically speaking a different job <e> <s> i keep using the word different too because it is relevant on every occasion <e>", "<cs> my noble friend has brought before your lordships an amendment of which i agree the effects seem to be fairly clear and not to lay an additional burden on local authorities <e> <s> it would require public bodies and voluntary organisations who received money from local authorities for publicity to make certain information available to the public <e> <s> i must say that the kind of information which it might produce if it is like that my noble friend produced and i am much indebted to him for the fascinating expose he gave us of the ramification of bodies funded by the glc would be interesting for the public to see <e> <s> but as i have described it this is a narrowly framed amendment <e> <s> however i think it <e>", "<cs> well i did i almost said that <e>", "<cs> as i understand the criteria of right-mindedness as set out so eloquently by my noble friend i think that her majestys government are right-minded <e> <s> at least i can say that my noble friend has struck a resonant chord because we share his anxiety that there should be effective rights of challenge to the decisions of local authorities <e>", "<cs> the concern of the noble baroness goes principally to the definition of publicity set out in clause the definition which applies throughout the bill <e> <s> it is a wide definition i agree <e> <s> it is defined as a <e>", "<cs> my lords it really is fascinating to notice the change in tone and the assessment which noble lords and baronesses opposite have of the value of the worth and of the excellence of the widdicombe report according to whether they are speaking to an amendment which is founded on the widdicombe reports recommendations or speaking to an amendment which is attacking the governments proposals <e> <s> i had hitherto supposed that the work of widdicombe and his committee had been something which filled the opposition with admiration and that they wished to repose a lot of their <e>", "<cs> as i understood the noble baroness she was attacking my right honourable friend the secretary of state and the government for the timing and was saying that widdicombe did not have remotely enough time to get out a sensible report <e> <s> i understood her to say that it had all been done in great haste and that the opinion polls proved that to be the case <e> <s> i truncate the noble baronesss argument somewhat <e> <s> however if she is saying that it is an excellent report then that whch my right honourable friend set by way of a timetable cannot have been such a bad thing because we got a good report out of it <e>", "<cs> let me start by saying that the government do take this issue seriously <e> <s> that is the direct question that i was asked by the noble lord lord kilmarnock <e> <s> secondly as he recognises the amendment goes far wide of the bill <e> <s> that is why he had to put down a second amendment to increase the scope of the bill so that it could embrace the principle that he wanted to amend the bill to embrace <e>", "<cs> i forgot one important matter <e> <s> i forgot to say and i am sure that your lordships will join me that i hope his noble friend and my noble friend both make a speedy recovery <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to do more than move the motion formally but i should like to take the opportunity to give notice which is normal of an amendment which the government may wish to table at report <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged to the noble baroness and the noble lord for their reception of this statement <e> <s> the noble baroness raised a number of points <e> <s> her first was the suitability of concrete as a material <e> <s> it is not necessary to go as far as the parthenon if that is what she looked at which i think is mostly held up by gravity and geometry <e> <s> hadrians wall gives good examples of concrete which has lasted for over a thousand years <e> <s> i believe it is also possible to add things to concrete which make it impermeable and more durable <e>", "<cs> my lords i am subject to advice but i would imagine that if nirex decided to abandon the project they would not make a secret of the fact <e> <s> and the fact might be rather obvious by the removal of their vehicles from the site <e> <s> i will write and confirm to the noble baroness what i believe to be the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for reminding me of those helpful figures <e> <s> i have others but i think that i will rest upon his <e> <s> as to the scottish question i undertand that clay is very much the best medium for the entombment of materials with these properties and that it is not abundant in scotland <e> <s> as i understand it there is no further search intended in scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it the exploratory work will in the main consist of test borings and the work of making good should not therefore be onerous <e> <s> but whether it is onerous or not i can assure the noble lord that it will be thoroughly done <e> <s> as to the area in which future search for deep facilities is intended i understand that none is intended in the national parks <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord layton for that intervention <e> <s> as i understand it the half-life of the materials that we are now considering is years <e> <s> your lordships will find that reassuring <e>", "<cs> my lords as to the noble earls last and only question i think i have already said that we have covered the isles and that no further search for the less deep facilities is intended at present <e> <s> i note that the skerries are made of granite and i understand that granite is naturally radioactive anyway which a lot of people do not realise and that relates to much else that the noble earl has said <e> <s> as to the rest of his contribution i think it deserves quotation rather than answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for reminding me of the lovingness i think of the lincolnshire clay which of course does make it a candidate <e> <s> i think my best short answer to his question about safety is that the target which we have set for safety is one milli-sievert per annum <e> <s> rather than try to explain what that means in mathematic or scientific terms i would say it is what you get on two round trips to new york by air <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the research by nirex for a deep facility to which my noble friend refers is at present at the desk stage <e> <s> i would be surprised if this idea had not occurred to them but i will certainly see that it is passed on <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend is referring to the low-level and short-lived intermediate-level waste to which the statement is principally addressed nirex have commissioned a feasibility study for disposing of long-lived waste in the seabed using boreholes <e> <s> that option has also been considered in the departments study of the best practical environmental options <e> <s> at present it appears to be over-elaborate and unnecessarily costly for the low-level and short-lived wastes for which i have announced possible sites this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords at the time when the commission were set up to take this function out of central government there was great anxiety that they should be given flexibility and the noble baroness made useful contributions in the debates on the national heritage bill to that effect <e> <s> nonetheless when they were set up they inherited the same delegation of authority to incur expenditure as previously applied to this function within the department <e> <s> the only modification of those control mechanisms was those minimum changes necessary to adapt them to a non-departmental public body <e> <s> what i would emphasise to your lordships is that we believe that this machinery has in fact exposed a weakness of proceedings about which i would not wish to comment until i have read the report which is being submitted <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has somewhat telescoped what would have been an interesting argument <e> <s> i do not accept the conclusions of his argument but not having heard it it is difficult to analyse at what point i would depart from his view <e> <s> but i can tell the noble lord that although i think the commission are doing a good job and they are getting more people involved in conservation and in the enjoyment of the monuments in their care the question relates to financial control <e> <s> i repeat that the mechanisms set up are similar to those for central government <e> <s> they have alerted us to what may be a weakness and that is being reported on <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that helpful intervention <e> <s> the commission are a relatively new body <e> <s> in less than two years they have attracted members and secured the first in business sponsorship <e> <s> i think your lordships should have a little more confidence in them than the tone of general questions has given rise to <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness is perhaps not aware that the chief officer of the commission is an accounting officer responsible on the same lines of answerability to the houses of parliament as is the permanent secretary of the department of the environment <e> <s> so the controls are the same as those which existed before the commission were made independent at the time for instance in when there was an inquiry into business at audley end which she will recall because she was standing at the dispatch box with my responsibilities at the time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for reminding me that common sense is something which it is essential to preserve on occasions at question time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baronesses lady david and lady stedman for their reception of the statement one of them cynical and the other cautious <e>", "<cs> my lords as to my noble friends first question i have to say that the shire counties will be beneficiaries under this scheme some of them substantially so <e> <s> where an authority has already arrived at its budget and cannot for one reason or another revise it the ratepayers will not lose but the money will go to balances and be available for effect against the following years rates <e> <s> so the benefit will be there <e> <s> as to the question of confusion i can do little beyond repeat what i said to the noble baroness lady stedman that we are aware of the imperfections of the system and that is why we have brought in the green paper which your lordships have already looked at with great interest <e> <s> as to the local authorities which have not yet fixed their rates i should say that there are very many of them in the urban areas which warmly welcome this and will be able to make immediate use of the information as well as many in the shires <e> <s> i believe that was the full tally of the questions that my noble friend asked me <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most reluctant to do anything to disturb the new found accord between the noble lord lord dean of beswick and my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> but i must tell the noble lord lord dean of beswick that we are not talking about a surplus and nor are we talking about an alteration to a recent statement <e> <s> we are talking about an exemplification of a recent statement <e> <s> the money in question is all money that was originally provided in aggregate exchequer grant and local authorities who <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i am saying nothing of the sort <e> <s> the previous statement described the system as i have just described it <e> <s> this statement says how it will work <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i am afraid that i cannot predict anything about next year <e> <s> i have already said that the only way this information can be obtained is from the local authorities themselves <e> <s> as soon as it is available the secretary of state has made the position clear to them with the greatest speed and efficiency <e> <s> if the alternative is not to tell them at all i think the noble lord would not like that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am mindful of the strictures of my noble friend the deputy chief whip on the last statement that we had that it should not turn into a debate <e> <s> i am not in the business of defending the present system <e> <s> we have not yet described the future system <e> <s> i know that i shall have all your lordships eager assistance in trying to make the future system better than the present so perhaps i had better leave it at that <e>", "<cs> my lords if a local authority has passed the point at which for technical reasons it is not possible to have another budget then as i understand it the money will go to balances <e> <s> it will then be very welcome indeed next year for this process and the local authority will have had months to think about the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that we might have a view from the official opposition on this matter <e> <s> perhaps it is reserved <e> <s> in the interests of expedition i will make my concluding speech now and it can stand unless the noble baroness makes it necessary to trespass in the accustomed manner on your lordships patience with a further speech <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord puts me in a slight difficulty as i do not know the intentions of everybody else <e> <s> i made a winding up speech and the noble lord has asked me to reply to him before i sit down <e> <s> in theory i am still standing although i am sure that i was in contact with the bench <e> <s> if this is the end of the matter then i shall give the noble lord an answer but if the noble baroness is to make a speech then i shall probably have to reply to it and i must not waste time speaking three times <e>", "<cs> my lords this can indeed be a brief intervention because i have set out before your lordships the reasons for keeping clause in the bill <e> <s> when your lordships read <e>", "<cs> my lords i missed what that was a percentage of and it is important to the noble lords argument <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble and learned lord lord denning for saying much that i had intended to say and for saying it quite typically in half the compass and with twice the clarity that i <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i have taken the point and i think i was right in what i said before i gave way <e> <s> the noble lord is concerned about the height of the ceiling <e> <s> he is saying that so much is being shoved in through the door that the ceiling ought to go up <e>", "<cs> my lords i must remind the house that we are now at report stage and that we must not indulge in exchanges as in the committee style <e> <s> therefore we think that we must be able to consider the committees recommendations before making changes in the basis of the ceiling <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i think that is very nearly what i am saying <e> <s> i am not sure that the noble baroness got the two sections the right way round <e> <s> what we are saying is that section expenditure is a function for the purposes of section <e> <s> as i understand it it properly forms part of the section expenditure total but that was unclear and in the light of widdicombe and also of the case which i quoted a moment ago we have now clarified it <e>", "<cs> my lords my capacity for amazement was exhausted very soon after i became a minister but even had it not been i would not have been amazed i think by anything i have heard from behind me this evening <e> <s> however the noble baroness has said enough to show that i must start by trying to explain where the logic of the bill lies as the noble lord lord hayter put it and why we consider there are sufficient other powers for the funding of voluntary organisations for legitimate publicity activities and why the effect of his attractively simple amendment would in fact he to allow authorities who wish to to give grants to a wide range of very questionable organisations for publicity activities which had nothing to do with local government <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble and learned lord lord denning for putting forward this amendment and for taking such care in setting out the reasons for this proposal <e> <s> this issues that he raises are i find difficult ones <e>", "<cs> my lords i have been waiting for this moment with ill-concealed impatience for the whole of today <e> <s> i am very happy to say that i agree with every word the noble lord has said and i advise your lordships to accept this amendment <e> <s> i should add that for consistency it will be necessary to reflect the change in one of our amendments to clause and i should tell your lordships that now because i shall have to do that at third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that your lordships will not feel there is any element of favouritism in my treatment of the noble lord lord airedale and that he will not feel that he has any prescriptive right to the support of government <e> <s> but again i have to say that he is engaged in work with which i sympathise and agree and i hope your lordships will accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i can accept that on behalf of the draftsman <e> <s> it seems to me that the noble lord lord airedale has done a service in clarifying and simplifying the english of the bill and that is always welcome <e> <s> but the drafting of a bill goes very much deeper than that and i can vouch for the assiduity the wisdom and indeed the hard work of the draftsman in those depths of language which we all find so difficult to follow <e> <s> but that in no way diminishes my gratitude or enthusiasm for the noble lords amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords by your lordships leave i have col in front of me as i speak <e> <s> i shall ensure that the suggestions the noble baroness makes in that column and in the contiguous columns are taken on board in the process of our consideration of how to draft the order <e>", "<cs> my lords i share the surprise of the noble baroness when she finds herself moving this <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord graham of edmonton asks whether local authorities can sell their order papers and minutes and the noble lord lord kilmarnock asks whether they can give them away <e> <s> the purpose of the amendment is exactly what it was stated to be when it was asked for <e> <s> it does what noble lords opposite asks that it should that is <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord asked a very specific question and i have already given a very specific answer as to the purpose of this amendment and what it does <e> <s> i have to stand on that answer because that is what the purpose of the amendment is and it is what the amendment does <e> <s> the noble lord now asks what the rest of the bill would do about a particular action by the council <e> <s> that would depend entirely on the case would it not <e> <s> if it fell within the <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of your lordships i cannot resist saying that in the small hours of this morning i reflected on the hour at which the noble baroness had tabled some of her amendments <e> <s> the drafting was perhaps a little less good than it should have been but we are all friends here and i shall not reproach her <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise that strong feelings have been aroused by abuse of the contractual process by a few local authorities who seek to discriminate against contractors on purely political grounds <e> <s> i dare say that if the political grounds were different from those which the noble lord opposite has said were so acceptable he would find them less acceptable than he does <e> <s> i am glad to say that the vast majority of authorities wish to have nothing to do with such provocative posturing <e>", "<cs> my lords i must try to reply briefly to the number of questions that the noble baroness has asked me <e> <s> i re-emphasise the importance which the government attach to environmental issues <e> <s> i advise the noble baroness to await the publication of our consultation paper when she will see what is proposed and will note the care with which we consult <e> <s> i can assure her that no responsibilities will be lost in any process of which i am aware towards the environment as a result of privatisation <e>", "<cs> my lords we are well aware of the work which has been commendably done by the outgoing authorities and we shall strive to recognise this by seeing that it is preserved <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble baroness that the consultation paper will be published very shortly by which i mean in a matter of weeks <e> <s> i would not wish to anticipate its contents <e>", "<cs> my lords i have said that we shall preserve all the safeguards that exist but the question on the order paper is directed specifically to environmental protection <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer is yes <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the noble lord knows very well what the usual channels are because i believe he constitutes a part of them <e> <s> therefore i would not presume to anticipate his part in that <e>", "<cs> my lords i start by commending my noble friend on his brevity <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord denning has proposed with his usual brevity and clarity an amendment that is intended to bring closer to the hand of the private citizen a remedy when the terms of part ii of the act are broken <e> <s> i see the attraction of giving to the ordinary ratepayer a recourse to the courts when he feels that those who collect his money to pay for local government use it for other purposes that may not be in his interest at all <e> <s> it is clear that there is some sympathy with that view all around the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i am in some difficulty <e> <s> i thought that the noble and learned lord was merely intervening <e> <s> he is right in detecting the almost immediate conclusion of my speech but he anticipated it by a fraction <e>", "<cs> one often has my lords but not on this occasion <e> <s> i was only going to add to my noble friend lord mottistone who wisely and in your lordships interest withdrew his own amendment and i am grateful to him for saving time thereby that first of all i undertake and repeat my undertaking that i shall draw to the attention of the widdicombe committee the proceedings of your lordships house on this bill and particularly on this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness has ignored the context of my speech as sometimes she is tempted to ignore the context of the bill <e> <s> i was inviting the noble lord lord kilmarnock to consider that his ambition of amending this part of the bill could not be satisfied if he assisted in removing it from the bill altogether <e> <s> i thought thereby that by cold logic and a warm human sympathetic approach combined i would persuade him to vote for the government in the lobbies but i failed <e> <s> however having failed to get his cake in one direction he is trying to eat it in another <e>", "<cs> my lords i can probably best reply by reading out that part of my brief which i thought i could do without <e> <s> the common council of the city of london is in many ways unique <e> <s> it is not simply a local authority <e> <s> it administers considerable private funds and the citys cash which is of ancient origin <e> <s> it is empowered to levy a general rate and to administer its rate fund under the london government act in its capacities as local authority police authority and port health authority <e> <s> we consider it appropriate that the bill should therefore apply to the city when it is acting in these latter capacities <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend for that introduction to my concluding speech on this bill in this house <e> <s> it is particularly gratifying when one has felt oneself for four or five weeks to be a toad under the harrow to discover that one still smells of roses and i am most grateful to my noble friend for that biological improbability <e>", "<cs> my lords nobody pretended to me when i took the torch of abolition from the sadly failing hand of my late friend lord avon that it would be an easy task <e> <s> it was not easy at the start and it will not be easy at the finish but i believe that it will be worth while <e> <s> like my noble friend lord glenarthur i am grateful to the noble lord lord bottomley for providing the occasion for this debate <e> <s> i am sure that that gratitude is shared by all noble lords who have taken part in it and i believe that most of them have <e>", "<cs> my lords i will come in part to that but in part i have already passed it because i have pointed out that the resources are there and the decision is for the districts <e> <s> the question i was not altogether rhetorically asking the house and the right reverend prelate was did the right reverend prelate and the house think that the government ought to tell the districts what to do with their money <e> <s> if so there is not much point in having the districts there <e> <s> then the question arises as to whether they have got the money which i have demonstrated <e> <s> another question will then follow are there other constraints which will prevent them from using the money in that way <e> <s> i shall return to that before i conclude <e>", "<cs> my lords it applies to everybody all residuary bodies <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for the intervention for two reasons <e> <s> one is because i can congratulate him on his courage in concentrating on the aspect in which he had least confidence it is something which is a good preparation for office <e> <s> the other is that he has said that it is impossible in a speech of these dimensions to produce the whole case <e> <s> your lordships will forgive me if i am in the same position also and will give the same answer if i am criticised at the end of my delivery <e>", "<cs> my lords we are of one accord all three of us the noble lord lord dean of beswick the noble lord lord winstanley and i we all agree on this <e> <s> what i am trying to say obviously in a more provocative manner than i intended since it produced three interruptions from the noble lord was that this method seemed to result in a very complicated system and complexity is something that we are trying to fight away from <e> <s> if we do not do that the only alternative would be to leave the inequalities in place and watch inner cities in gathering crisis as high-income families moved to low-price suburbs <e> <s> we are on common ground <e>", "<cs> my lords it was a complete review of local government finance which led to our decision to abolish the rates <e> <s> your lordships have already heard that the noble lords propose to use a different system of assessing the rates <e> <s> they would assess them on the basis of capital values <e> <s> but capital values change sometimes quite quickly and that means regular revaluations to keep pace with the continual changes in the capital values <e> <s> your lordships will already have heard of the disadvantages of revaluations from no less an authority than the noble lord lord underhill himself <e> <s> it is this that he proposes to rely upon <e>", "<cs> my lords the complete answer to the noble lords question must be awaited until the eventual clarification of what the policy will be but as i understand it it is related to the capital value of the house in which the rated person lives and that value goes up and down according to the market very sharply <e> <s> i have described the way in which it has done so in the recent historic past <e> <s> if in fact my mathematical deductions are wrong i will await with great interest the results of the labour party conference and the publication of their conclusions and the noble lord will be able to put me right if i have got it wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords i also think that the matter is probably <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a sensitive and very complex case <e> <s> i have to say to the noble lord that i do expect a decision to emerge i am tempted to use the words very soon but they are identical to the words i used in november and i wish to convey a greater sense of immediacy than that <e>", "<cs> my lords the quality of the limestone is certainly relevant to the case <e>", "<cs> my lords about half the united kingdom bathing waters meet the exacting standards set out in the ec bathing waters directive <e> <s> some million has been spent on relevant schemes in the last five years and the authorities plan to spend about million more in the next five years <e> <s> a survey is being made of more than of the most popular bathing waters in the united kingdom <e> <s> that will be published and will provide a basis for planning any necessary further actions <e>", "<cs> my lords as to the first of my noble friends supplementary questions the directive does not set out precise criteria for the indication of beaches <e> <s> it was considered appropriate to base selection on the use of bathing water rather than the use of the adjacent beach <e> <s> most bathing waters are relatively lightly used compared with the use made of beaches <e> <s> as to the other beaches i am advised that even where the waters do not meet the standards there is no health risk <e> <s> many schemes to bring about further improvements are nonetheless in progress <e>", "<cs> my lords as to the noble lords first supplementary question i was not aware until he told me that the beaches of west wales were in a disgraceful condition <e> <s> the european directive is concerned with the biological state of the water in which the swimmers swim and not with the aesthetic condition of the beaches above the bathing line if i may so phrase it <e> <s> the money is being expended through the agencies of the authorities responsible for the quality among other things of outfall waters <e>", "<cs> my lords i respectfully remind the noble lord that the question is about beaches used by holidaymakers at resorts in the united kingdom whereas the joint committee is a committee examining the quality of water and its effect on fish and shellfish which is a different matter <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are aware of and or course share the concern about the sellafield question <e> <s> my noble friend will be aware of the vigorous steps we have already taken on that matter <e>", "<cs> my lords the facts are as i stated <e> <s> the decision rests with the districts as i stated that it did and they have taken it in the sense in which i said that they had <e> <s> my understanding is and i have to say that i would need to take advice on the detail that the staff of the joint committee is likely to be reduced but that the work will not cease <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is perfectly right <e> <s> i should like to repeat the assurance i gave earlier that the quality of bathing water polluted by sewage does not become a health hazard until it becomes such aesthetically that one would not wish to take the risk anyway <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it will take a considerable time <e> <s> i cannot be more precise than that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for drawing attention to the valuable work of keep britain tidy <e> <s> i have to say that the clearance of litter from beaches is of course the responsibility of the local district councils <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord dean of beswick asked a number of questions <e> <s> he is right of course to say that the bringing of the case by birmingham was an important factor but this is a matter which is of concern to local authorities other than birmingham <e> <s> the statement does not cover any court case specifically and is not therefore <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said her majestys government are aware of an increasing tendency for some authorities to apply political tests and conditions in their commercial judgments in decision taking <e> <s> we regret that development and we look to the widdicombe report to give a clear exposition of the alternative options open to us <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not agree that the decline in the figures in the rented sector indicate a fall in the governments responsibility <e> <s> i believe that it reflects the success in part of our campaign to allow people to own their own homes as they wish to do <e>", "<cs> my lords we are encouraging the public sector to concentrate on those who cannot afford to own their own home including special groups such as the elderly and the disabled on low incomes to whom the noble lord has referred and to give particular attention to the needs of the homeless <e>", "<cs> my lords the government hope to introduce major legislation to encourage the supply of more homes for renting in the private sector but not during the lifetime of this parliament <e> <s> we believe that there is a very important role for the private rented sector to play in meeting housing need and that we must try to create the conditions in which landlords will be prepared to invest in accommodation for letting

give the proportion my noble friend asks for but my attitude to the acts has been made clear in my earlier answer to my noble friend lord nugent of guildford <e>", "<cs> my lords the figures in the answer i gave were aggregated in the way that the question was aggregated <e> <s> i cannot give separate figures for scotland but i shall write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot say that

where they want and to own their own property if they wish <e> <s> we believe in a free and fair society as noble lords opposite claim to do and i believe that we are delivering it <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has asked his question with a particular gloss from a particular stance <e> <s> we agree that the private sector has as the noble lord lord molloy pointed out a valuable role to play <e> <s> that must be an economic role and the tenant must have the security of legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are plainly responsible for the regulation of public housing by statute and by the regulations laid down by the treasury which i have sought to explain to your lordships <e> <s> the question i am asked is whether that is directed towards a fair distribution <e> <s> i believe that it is <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has asked a large number of questions <e> <s> the general answer to the noble lords inquiry is that the level of public expenditure has had to be restrained but nevertheless is broadly the same in cash terms as it was in <e>", "<cs> my lords the availability of accommodation is of course a factor in the mobility of labour <e> <s> the noble lord will be aware of the large number of vacancies that there are round the country which is something that we also wish to improve <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is right to suggest that those figures are large but they go rather wider than the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that my arithmetic is equal to judging what is at this stage ante-penultimacy or the comparative ratio of figures but i shall write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness apparently anticipates both the result of the consideration that we are giving and the level of the absolute figure that we would put into an order if we were to put in an order <e> <s> i repeat that we are considering whether or not there should be a limit for the reasons that the provision for the limit was put into the bill and which i explained when we put it there <e>", "<cs> my lords the figure of million is that arrived at by the london section scheme known as the richmond scheme in its budget and it was the obvious figure on which to consult <e> <s> the purpose of having the provision in the act was to provide against the contingency that a minority of boroughs after they have arrived at their budgets might have imposed upon them by a two-thirds majority as required under the act a figure that they would find unacceptable after the beginning of their financial year <e> <s> the purpose of consulting is to see whether it is necessary or appropriate so to do <e>", "<cs> my lords of course we shall look at the context in which the order if there is to be an order is laid <e> <s> we have not yet decided to lay an order <e> <s> i point out that the responsibility for funding the voluntary sector london-wide now rests with the section scheme known as the richmond scheme and i also point out the the total volume of money available to the voluntary sector in london is likely to be between million and million which compares closely does it

do not think i said at all but which has been as it were imputed to me <e> <s> the duration of the order is simply until the next order and a new order can be made and proposed at any stage not merely at the end of the financial year <e> <s> what cannot at present be changed during a financial year is the richmond budget itself and that is because of a decision by the richmond committee as to how

possible sites to see whether they would be suitable for the disposal of such material <e> <s> there will be ample time for further disussion of the detail of the method of disposal during the period of that survey <e> <s> given the need to dispose of that material and the relatively small difficulty of securing safety as compared with other radiological materials it would not be right to postpone the search and the survey until after we had agreed upon the detail <e>", "<cs> my lords here we are again looking at the higher radiation end of the spectrum <e> <s> certainly we have not abandoned consideration of sub-seabed disposal but we must be aware of international opinion on the subject <e>", "<cs> my lords regardless of new procedures we have always had careful assessments made of the environmental impact in this important matter <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the first supplementary question of the noble baroness i think that on reflection she will find the reply implicit in

to intervene <e>", "<cs> my lords the more impressive the evidence the committee receives the more impressed no doubt it will be <e> <s> however i have to say that this is a matter for the committee and not for the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that it provides advice and information on occupational and environmental health and safety and that the london boroughs grants committee

is applied to ministers by section <e> <s> i can confirm that we have not discriminated against women in the search for people to serve on these committees <e> <s> i can confirm that we considered names <e> <s> our search extended to the top ranks of public administration the legal surveying and planning professions and local business <e> <s> the fact is that there were not enough names forthcoming to satisfy the criteria which the noble baroness applies <e> <s> i think that as the tone of public life and commercial life changes it is a question of good women working their way

say to the noble lord that we also welcome the rise of good men to the top <e>", "<cs> my lords the approach to the elected members of local government was through the coordinating committees of the local authorities in each of the abolition areas <e> <s> each co-ordinating committee appointed one of its members to the residuary body <e> <s> the government had no control over the composition of

of these residuary bodies and none of them was a woman <e>", "<cs> the same my lords for these purposes as of a good man but rather more attractive <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be happy to pass on that sentiment but the fact is that the government are committed to encouraging the contribution of women to public life at a senior level and this is already done <e> <s> it reflects the history of the past but it takes time to achieve stature and experience in any profession <e> <s> the tendency for women to take part in public life in this way is more recent than allows all of them to get

the best combatant of fear <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to appear craven simply because there are no fewer than three opposition front bench spokesmen to one on this side <e> <s> i believe however that i should direct the noble baronesss attention to the question on the order paper and suggest that she puts down another <e>", "<cs> my lords the idea of a commonly understood comparator

royal parks to remove the debris at least once a week <e> <s> but i am afraid this will not get rid of the disagreeable smell because that is caused by the water becoming starved of oxygen <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble earl wishes to ask me why if we switch off the chlorinating plant people should not swim in the water which would remain untreated <e> <s> i am advised by the government chemist who carries out regular sampling of the water that swimming in contaminated water such as the unchlorinated water in the serpentine would be could put the swimmer at risk of contracting salmonellosis or shigellosis which causes stomach upsets or at worst typhoid amoebic dysentery poliomyelitis and infective hepatitis as well as minor complaints such as sore throats <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the opinion of the health and safety executive that the use of chlorination at the site by means of chlorine gas can never be safe or satisfactory <e> <s> i was advised that the storage of

lord does not wish to keep himself in anxious doubt for so long and indeed he may have a train waiting <e> <s> i think my answer is that the planning regulations in northern ireland are a good deal different from those in the rest of the united kingdom but really should like to give him the right technical answer which i can do only later <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble marquess will let me have the dates of his correspondence i shall ensure that he does get an answer swiftly <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble baroness is recalling something i said about simplified planning zones not about the urban renewal grant <e>", "<cs> my lords i was merely reflecting that the act of is alive and well and then recalling that the noble lord was not here at the beginning to hear me say so <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble lord lord dean promises an interesting time in committee i recall that in classical times the worst thing you could be wished was to be born into interesting times <e> <s> i hope he has a friendlier approach than that <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble baroness pays as much attention to the small print in committee as she does at second reading we shall indeed have a perfect bill when we finish <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords the members of my party sitting behind me have been acquainted of the situation by listening to my words <e> <s> the members of my party not sitting behind me who may be as numerous as those who are not sitting behind the noble baroness <e> <s> lady david will have the normal opportunity to read <e>", "<cs> my lords i am of course by convention grateful to the noble baronesses for their reply to my speech although i am not at all sure i am entirely happy with the content which they put into those <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i shall disport myself at length at the despatch box if that gives pleasure to the noble lord and to the rest of your lordships <e> <s> but i am not certain that on the eve of our departure for the holiday this will be welcome to all <e>", "<cs> my lords i am authorised to add to what i said that our offer to concede the case on the same grounds as those relating to birmingham and to meet nottinghamshires costs still stands <e> <s> so far the council has refused <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not intended to intervene in the proceedings on this bill at all <e> <s> my noble friend lord skelmersdale now has the responsibility and has already demonstrated his considerable ability in managing the bill <e> <s> i do not want to interfere in any way but having been referred to in this debate i wish to place before your lordships what i perceive is the pattern within which this argument is taking place <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought i made it clear that the listing process is a trigger for the latter processes <e> <s> but if my noble friends managing director or chairman of directors felt that the listing was unjust he had but to write to my noble friend to have his reasons considered <e> <s> in many cases the reasons prevail over the recommendation of the inspector and the building is struck off the list <e> <s> that is much quicker than going to the high court <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that whereas in-service training can make a good teacher better it cannot rescue a bad teacher and that consideration should be given to a way out of the profession for those who for many years have been trapped in it to their own frustration and that of the children <e>", "<cs> i do not have the breadth of experience of the noble lord lord glenamara but i have taught for years in the grammar school section in comprehensive schools and at teacher training college <e> <s> like him i have the interests of teachers at heart but i ask the committee to remember that in any debate on education it is neither the teachers nor the government who are the first concern it is the children <e> <s> we are here because the machinery which the noble lord lord glenamara in sweeping terms condemned the government for abandoning had failed for two whole years to produce the goods and during those two years the sufferers were the children <e> <s> hundreds of children have been denied portions of their education which can never be restored to them and which are lost for life <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend assure the house that efforts are being made to establish the common affiliation of the members of the who were arrested and who is co-ordinating their efforts <e> <s> will suitably strict measures be taken against them <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness replies can she also take on board the fact that it would be most helpful if she could tell the committee how it is expected to treat this amendment <e> <s> the noble lord lord mcintosh suggested that there may be occasion for him to march into the lobby in her not unfamiliar company should a division take place <e> <s> however it is evident from his speech that there is so much which is not said in the amendment that none of us would know what we were voting about <e>", "<cs> i was going to ask the noble lord again if i can have his attention whether if i were to set up an organisation to represent parents of my way of thinking i should then have the statutory right to be consulted <e> <s> if any noble friend was to do the same thing what is the criterion <e> <s> does it have to be a statutory body <e>", "<cs> can the noble lord enlighten me <e> <s> he is making so much of the reference to parliament and the authority it gives that it is important for us to understand <e> <s> as i understand it the secretary of state is already required to obtain the authority of parliament either tacitly if he is going with the committee or explicitly if he is going without it <e> <s> that is in the bill as it is drafted <e> <s> why is it such a staggering lack of sense and reasonableness on the part of my noble friend if she will not require him to do it twice <e>", "<cs> i can see no grouped amendment which deletes the second reference to parliament <e> <s> is the whole thing to be debated by both houses of parliament twice <e> <s> is that not an extraordinary waste of parliamentary time <e>", "<cs> i think we are at cross-purposes <e> <s> i am not talking about those two orders but rather the pair of orders referred to as being debated once <e> <s> i believe that has been done together <e> <s> we have in the bill as now drafted the requirement that the secretary of state shall go to parliament at the end of the process under clause <e> <s> the noble lord does not propose to delete that so presumably we have a pair of orders and then the individual order after that to be debated again <e> <s> that seems to me to be an excessive use of parliamentary time <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to detain the committee <e> <s> perhaps my noble friend can put me right <e> <s> i understood that clause referred to directions which the secretary of state could give on any individual case and that that is the beginning of each process <e> <s> when there is a reference to the committee the secretary of state will give directions as to what the committee can then consider <e> <s> the noble lord lord mcintosh is suggesting that there is one sort of direction as soon as the committee is set up and thereafter no matter how many references there may be to it there will be no new directions <e> <s> that is not as i understood it <e>", "<cs> from the back-benches may i say that a concession from the opposition front bench brings <e>", "<cs> does the noble lord intend to give the associations and organisations mentioned in his amendment a veto on the secretary of state <e> <s> that is what he appears to be doing <e> <s> the wording <e>", "<cs> indeed and therefore this amendment is actually fundamentally putting the secretary of state entirely at the behest of the committee the majority of the local authorities and the teachers <e> <s> this seems to put us back into the financial impasse in which we have already found ourselves <e>", "<cs> if i did not hear the noble lord it is possible he did not hear me <e> <s> i was thinking of forming an association for parents <e> <s> however my point is that if all noble lords formed separate organisations the task of consultation would become impossible <e>", "<cs> my lords if the minister is so sympathetic towards the homeless why can the government not release the money from the sale of the council houses in order to allow the housing authorities to continue building houses <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord glenamara referred to what has repeatedly been called in this debate the despair of the teachers and i think he intended to lay that despair at the door of the government <e> <s> the despair of the teachers springs to a large extent today from the fact that million of government money is available now this year and million of government money will be available next year <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord withdraws his amendment i take it that this is the last opportunity we will have to discuss amendment no <e> <s> if he proposes to move it <e> <s> if we are to return to that amendment i shall hold my peace but if the committee are to decide it without further discussion i think there are other matters to be mentioned <e> <s> i do not know whether my noble friend the minister would guide us on that <e>", "<cs> since the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey has addressed amendment no <e> <s> i should like the assurance of your lordships that we shall be discussing it again before the noble lord divides the committee on it <e> <s> it is important that we should not vote simply on the information now given <e>", "<cs> i have been persuaded that the committee is possessed of sufficient information to make its mind up as it is <e>", "<cs> surely the message that ought to go out from this chamber is that this bill is as temporary as those who will be affected by it wish it to be <e> <s> the purpose of the bill is to cure a malaise in the teaching profession and principally among those members of the profession who seek to guide it on its path to proper remuneration <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has given a clear exposition of his amendment and its intended effect <e> <s> i was in some doubt when i read it whether it could be that effect he was seeking <e> <s> i am well aware of the campaign that his party was recently waging against what it saw as the centralisation of the power of <e>", "<cs> i do not want to extend the debate on the theology of this matter but i should point out that the present situation is not so different from what is proposed in the bill as the noble lord thinks <e> <s> i may be wrong because i have not been involved in negotiations on teachers pay but i have seen the concordat from which i quoted yesterday and which makes clear that local authorities agree to be bound by the decision of the secretary of state on the total amount if that should be necessary <e> <s> therefore they are boxed in on that side <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend does not answer that may i say that i take the opposite view <e> <s> i have for years been looking for the interpretation clause in bills and i now know that you find it at the end <e> <s> if my noble friend has his way i will never find it <e>", "<cs> i am a little surprised that the noble lord was so unsuccessful in his search for precedents because they are liberally strewn around the statute book <e> <s> when i saw the amendment of the noble lord the words rang a bell i realised that i had seen them before <e> <s> if these words cause the noble lord anxiety and frighten people away from giving service the more controversial the legislation in which they are contained the more they are a cause for anxiety <e> <s> i am therefore surprised that the noble lord does not recall during the debate on the bill which became the local government act in which he and his front <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend accept that we regard him as absolutely right to welcome scrutiny of these cases <e> <s> will he also bear in mind that we are talking about offences committed on leave in preparation for final release and that final release can be an equal opportunity for the commission of such offences <e> <s> for the offence to be committed in an experimental period is a greater protection to the public than if the prisoner is finally at large <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the great and unexpected services the noble and learned lord lord scarman has done for me has been to give me a first taste of that heady freedom on the back-benches to tear up ones speech and say something else <e> <s> i should like to thank him for that as well as for the very important debate which he has stimulated <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness give way <e> <s> in making her calculations i hope that she will bear in mind that the metropolitan police force is responsible for the capital and has numerous national responsibilities including as we heard during question time today inquiries in other parts of the country <e> <s> it is not fair to compare its costs with those of other police forces <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl lord halsbury has spent the whole of his life outside <e>", "<cs> i can best save your lordships time by asking the noble lord to read in <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed it would <e> <s> it was not what i was proposing <e> <s> what i was proposing was set out clearly in the green paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not fully understood the noble lord <e> <s> however he interrupted his speech in order for me to give an explanation <e> <s> i am not sure that the noble lord is looking at the same system as i am which is the one which applies in england <e> <s> if he is there are three elements the central block grant which will get a new name and both the business and private contribution <e> <s> it is not simply a net difference between the two figures <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down perhaps he can add to the service he has done to the house <e> <s> he has quoted extensively from a manifesto <e> <s> i understand from my noble friend lady cox that it is subscribed to at least by mr wedgwood benn <e> <s> is there any means by which we can discover who else subscribes to it <e> <s> i think we ought to know <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord permit me to ask him to read the debate on monday when there was considerable concentration on the subject <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not certain whether the noble lord was asking me what i was asking the electors <e> <s> he understood that it was to vote in accordance with the dictates of their pockets and that one has to make the system work so that that is the case <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord say to which paragraph he is referring <e> <s> i have a paragraph on page which says <e>", "<cs> would my noble friend permit me to correct him <e> <s> he may describe me as <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that the most cost-effective and humane sentence is that which bears the least likelihood of causing the person to re-offend and to be recommited to prison <e> <s> in that context will he tell us what priority is given by his department to the treatment known as intermediate treatment which has the lowest re-offending record of any of the treatments of which i am aware <e> <s> will he give priority to it and in particular look at the work being done by mountbatten training at gyde house <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend tell me what will happen to applications for consent between the axe falling and the conclusion of the consulation period and how long is that likely to be <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness tell us whether she is also speaking to amendments nos <e> <s> to and various other large dollops which together seem to make up a fairly coherent whole <e>", "<cs> my lords i am terribly sorry but for the purposes of the record and subsequent debate we need to know the other amendments to which the noble baroness is speaking <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not want to say anything to dilute the trenchant lucidity of almost everything that the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby has said about the relevance and appositeness of the very large group of amendments which are before us <e> <s> at this report stage they constitute very nearly a new bill <e> <s> in my view they have so many provisions of detail in them that they should be discussed in committee and not by the whole house sitting on report <e> <s> but i am not suggesting this should be recommitted because i think the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby is right <e> <s> what we have here is an interim bill <e> <s> i was glad that my noble friend emphasised that on two separate occasions in the record when we were in committee and also amended the bill either twice or three times on the face to make clear that it was interim and he has a further amendment today <e> <s> there is no question that this is an interim bill <e> <s> there is a question as to how one decides when the interim period has expired <e> <s> we shall be addressing that later <e> <s> i have views on that <e> <s> i shall not delay your lordships now because the views are not relevant <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey attributed to me the view that this chamber should not be in the business of altering bills at committee stage or indeed at report stage <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> i believe that one of the rules of your lordships chamber is to make sure that ones procedures are always relevant and i am concentrating on this bill <e> <s> the amendments in question have a number of objections that can be raised against them <e> <s> i hope and expect that my noble friends will raise them all eloquently and that your lordships will decide accordingly <e>", "<cs> my lords i had seen that as a possible interpretation <e> <s> however the idea that the only control by central government over this large slice of public expenditure should wait until the whole rigmarole of arbitration and consultation proposed by the noble lord is concluded and put forward in a statutory instrument and then to tear it up and leave nothing in its place as a result of a parliamentary debate seemed so ludicrous that i did not think that it could be what the noble lord intended <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord propose rate capping as a method of controlling expenditure by a labour government <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord ritchie has said that the teachers want us to accept the amendment because they do not want this unpleasant condition to continue for more than three years <e> <s> i fear that experience suggests that the one way of ensuring that this unpleasant condition continues for at least three years is to insert the amendment in the bill <e> <s> we are looking at inter-union strife the politics of one union vying for position against another <e> <s> even during november last year we saw unions group themselves together and fall apart from groups <e> <s> that will continue for as long as they see any advantage for themselves and their particular groups of members in continuing the dispute <e> <s> and not all of them will be satisfied whatever is determined they will continue <e>", "<cs> my lords when my right honourable friend receives the powerful representations that he will from the conservation lobby to keep everything as it is will he please bear in mind not only that the landscape has been changing continually since the roman occupation as a result of its economic development but that if it is frozen at any point in its development it ceases to be an economic place for people to live <e> <s> will my noble friend look at the recent history of village and rural communities which have become increasingly unproductive places in which to live and thereby have lost their social structure and much of what is valuable to our society <e> <s> will he make it possible for development to take place in these communities so that people can work as well as live in them and so that they stop being mere commuter dormitories <e> <s> will he allow them to develop as he will the redundant farm buildings in a way that is not contrary to the beauty of the countryside <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord divides the house i should like to make a comment <e> <s> i know that there is a limited number of times anyone may intervene in a debate <e> <s> perhaps therefore i may put an idea into his mind before he sits down in theory if not in practice and suggest to him that subsection d does refer to special provisions but nowhere does the act provide for the secretary of state to act other than by order <e> <s> therefore any special provision would still be by order and there would be no escape hatch in the bill for the secretary of state if he were minded to take one two or a dozen schools or the whole system out of the effect of the bill <e> <s> my noble friend on the front bench will correct me or interject as she thinks fit but it does seem to me on a laymans interpretation that although there may be as it were on the wall a little finger pointing to emergency exit in fact there is no exit when you get there the secretary of state simply has to use another order to provide the special provisions for the schools in question <e> <s> i think therefore that the noble lords fears are groundless <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the noble baroness accept that all of this is subject to subsection which clearly says that whatever the order whatever the area however special the provisions <e>", "<cs> my lords i intervene merely to point out that with the exception of the noble baroness lady seear the difference between the two sides is that noble lords opposite have been telling us what are the intentions of this amendment and noble lords on this side have been saying what would be its effects <e> <s> they are not the same <e> <s> we all wish to reassure teachers of our goodwill towards them when they do the splendid job that they were appointed to do <e> <s> that commitment does not turn on your lordships answer to this amendment <e> <s> this amendment is not designed to attract the friendship of teachers or to repel it <e> <s> the bill at present gives the secretary of state a statutory position in the negotiations because he pays nearly half of the money <e> <s> it is your lordships money and mine and that of every other taxpayer <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey does less than justice to the powers of your lordships house <e> <s> clause provides that the bill when it is an act shall be extinguished in <e>", "<cs> my lords somebody who is not sitting on the front bench on this side of the house has to remind your lordships that the reason we have this bill is that the existing machinery for delivering salaries to teachers had broken down completely <e> <s> this occurred before a committee set up nearly six years ago to replace it with other machinery had produced an alternative <e> <s> a bill is essential if the teachers are to get any of the money now due to them in the way of increases at all <e> <s> there is no question of not passing this bill <e> <s> nor is it a question as was suggested by the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby that there was a firm or lasting agreement between the employers and the teachers <e> <s> my noble friend lord belstead shall correct me if i am wrong but i think it was fewer than <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that a fresh start is urgently needed for the sake of the prison officers and the inmates of prisons <e> <s> will he illustrate the situation by telling us what at present is the average take-home pay of a prison officer and how many hours overtime are worked to achieve that pay <e>", "<cs> my lords are we to take it that my noble friends right honourable friend has not yet assessed the extent to which the scheme benefits the patients <e> <s> if he has made an assessment does he see any linkage to his movement for care in the community as a means of assisting inmates of mental hospitals to become resident in the community with the assistance of their advocate <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend accept that in an organisation as large and complex as the national health service it will always be possible to select statistics that make it look inefficient as well as statistics showing that it works well <e> <s> will she further accept that for the opposition to select such statistics is legitimate and in some ways healthy because it keeps her on her toes <e> <s> finally will she accept that what most of us look at is the number of people treated rather than the number of beds in wards <e> <s> in that regard she is doing very well and should keep on at it <e>", "<cs> my lords it appears to be opportune to return to the banking bill <e> <s> it is a very short speaking list and that reflects the fact that the bill is not only necessary but broadly welcome though possibly less welcome on the benches opposite than on this side of the house <e> <s> that remains to be seen <e> <s> i am anxious to preserve amity at this stage at least and it was my intention in any case to make only the briefest of interventions <e> <s> since i formed that intention almost everything i intended to say has been said already concisely and rather better than i could have said it <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord reads a little too much into my cautious acceptance of his welcome of the bill <e> <s> i intended nothing more than to say that i did not wish to be disappointed <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps my noble friend will forgive me since he wishes to put this on the record now <e> <s> the issue to which i was addressing myself was this <e> <s> can it be a matter of dispute whether the bank should have known of the matter and did not <e> <s> is that covered by this clause <e> <s> i have not given notice to my noble friend and no doubt he will wish to write or deal with the matter at committee stage <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister confirm whether it is the case as i have heard rumoured that the value of the tax in respect of palm oil may exceed the value of the palm oil itself <e> <s> if that is so will he impress upon his colleagues the terrible effect that this tax is likely to have on third world suppliers particu-larly friends within the commonweath such as malaysia <e>", "<cs> there is one small point that presumably will be picked up by the printers namely that in the rubrics schedule is referred to as schedule and schedule is referred to as schedule <e> <s> i hope that will be put right in the next printing <e>", "<cs> will a copy of the correspondence be placed in the library of your lordships house <e> <s> this point is of some interest generally <e>", "<cs> i will of course read my noble friends words with care between now and report <e> <s> having listened to them they sound fairly convincing but on the understanding that i may not be convinced when i read them i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my noble friend is right as always <e> <s> we must ask whether it would be near enough certain to justify not putting a further defence such as i propose in the bill that is now before us <e>", "<cs> we are in committee <e> <s> we can therefore bob up and down as we like <e> <s> perhaps i may tell the noble lord that the way in which my amendment is drafted does not seem to me to involve us in reciprocity at all <e> <s> it goes straight to subsection <e> <s> the secretary of state has two tests either of which has to be satisfied before taking action <e> <s> one is under my amendment that the interests of the united kingdom or of any substantial part thereof would be damaged <e> <s> that is the new test <e> <s> that brings in its train everything that he can presently do under the domestic system <e> <s> the other is what is already in the clause and is subject to the inhibitions to which that part of the clause is subject <e>", "<cs> i do disagree <e> <s> as i see it the notice that is issued is a notice under this section <e> <s> the words that the noble lord has picked up are the words comprised in the test <e> <s> under the bill as drafted if the situation satisfies the test which appears in section of the financial services act then he can issue a notice under this act not under that act <e> <s> that is the point i am trying to make <e>", "<cs> may i try once more if the noble lord will bear with me <e> <s> the bill as drafted states <e>", "<cs> of course i take my noble friends points about the common market and the european community <e> <s> i am grateful to him for making them and we should not brush them aside <e> <s> however we must do two things <e> <s> first we must ensure that what we do is legal within the community my noble friend lord campbell of alloway has shown that it would fail if it was not but it would be to our embarrassment if it did <e> <s> secondly within what is legal we must strike a balance between getting the europe that we want and keeping the united kingdom that we want <e>", "<cs> will my noble friend elicit what is the public interest in the criteria in the act to which he is now referring <e> <s> am i right in thinking that it depends on the latest government statement of policy <e> <s> is it therefore known what that is now and more particularly is there any certainty as to what that will be in the future <e> <s> my noble friend has so far adduced only prudential grounds for control of the takeovers <e> <s> this is the first time that he has introduced new ground and i believe that we should know what it is <e>", "<cs> it is amendment no <e> <s> a <e>", "<cs> my noble friend has produced a number of arguments for the withdrawal of the amendment that i have put before the committee <e> <s> most of them relate to the ability of the authorities to resist a takeover on prudential grounds <e> <s> i have no quarrel with that and that is not the area at which this amendment is aimed <e> <s> it is aimed at a threat to the national interest residing principally but not only in a takeover bid by a foreign national for a british clearing bank or institution of similar size and importance <e>", "<cs> that seems both as general as one feared and as narrow as one could hope <e> <s> we must preserve ourselves in hope until the report stage <e>

to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am not an expert on rumps <e> <s> my noble friend is the first person i have come across to refer to the thin end of the rump <e> <s> we are discussing the special role of the banking service and my noble friend has argued principally that we should not treat banks as though they were different from other services <e> <s> as i <e>", "<cs> i am happy to concede that and also to concede as i normally do at this stage that the drafting could be improved upon <e> <s> i accept that such a step would warrant an appeal system in my present state of mind

will have to tear up the bill and start again <e> <s> we have used the criteria already in the bill and applied those to the problem <e> <s> i am sorry that the amendment is not better perhaps my noble friend can improve upon it <e>", "<cs> with respect not similar sanctions <e> <s> only one of the battery of sanctions <e> <s> that i made very clear <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to intervene <e> <s> my noble friend might like me to preserve my questions to the end but it is easier for us to remember what the questions are if we ask them when they arise <e>", "<cs> i think i understood my noble friend aright in saying that no powers are needed up to per cent <e> <s> because everybody knows that at the per cent <e> <s> point powers exist and that a person who has been identified as unsuitable to have a per cent <e> <s> shareholding will be labelled as such while he still has <e>", "<cs> i am a decontroller by nature or i would not be sitting immediately behind my noble friend <e> <s> therefore the last remark he made struck the loudest chord in my listening bosom if bosoms can indeed listen <e> <s> i am not sure <e>", "<cs> the right reverend prelate has raised a matter on which he could scarcely have remained silent on this occasion <e> <s> however i ask him to consider whether loans at low interest as advocated in either exodus or deuteronomy constitute banking and

of policy <e>", "<cs> while the noble lord is on this point i wonder whether he can clear my mind of a question that i did not intend to ask him but which now has become relevant <e> <s> as i read the amendent and the bill all the transactions referred to in the amendment would fall to be caught by clause b but he has added a new description to them to apply new criteria which the bank may use to control them <e> <s> if that is the case then it is not necessary for him to argue the necessity for protection which he is now arguing for the british banks <e> <s> that is why i and i think noble friends took it that the whole gravamen for his amendment was towards introducing a machinery to protect the developing countries from onerous <e>", "<cs> i hope the noble lord will allow me to

these exchanges <e> <s> is it not the function of government to intervene with their own funds and their own policy to protect or assist or in other ways co-operate with less developed countries and

well-deserved congratulations on this visit for symbolising in her visit to zagorsk the concern which all the christian denominations in this country feel for christians in the soviet union <e> <s> i think that that added a distinction to a very valuable visit <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that your lordships will be indulgent to my noble friend once more because it will save a good deal of time if i can ask him one specific question again before i embark on my reply <e> <s> i asked him previously whether the governments policy now extends to the referral of bids for british institutions from foreign-based bidders on the grounds of national interest when the circumstances justify it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am deeply obliged to my noble friend because he has saved me a long and sometimes

depends on the welfare of the underdeveloped world or the less developed world as it is now called is well taken <e> <s> secondly on the other hand history seems to show that using regulation of the private sector financially to act as an instrument of government policy is ineffective and actually destroys the effectiveness of the private sector <e> <s> as i said at committee stage and i shall not detain your lordships long by repeating it now it seems to me that support for the developing world is deserved from the developed world but it should be done government to government and the private sector should be left to function in the most efficient manner it can <e> <s> that usually is the best thing to do <e>", "<cs> my lords the provisions in the noble lords amendment filter down in a manner which we could dissect at leisure if we were in committee <e> <s> i addressed myself simply to the bold principle which i think is important <e> <s> it is report stage and i have not the right to speak further <e>", "<cs> my lords i should perhaps have expressed the reluctance with which i withdrew to this position at the end of the committee stage because your lordships will know that my concern was the same as that of the noble lord lord obrien <e> <s> it was that there was a logically indefensible inconsistency between saying that all the powers available to the bank should be deployed at per cent and none of them at per cent <e> <s> my noble friend then led me to suppose that the effects of the investigative powers applied by the bank would be such as to deter the approach of the unacceptable bidder to per cent <e> <s> i noticed with regret that there was no such reiteration in the speech that he has just made <e> <s> he may have the leave of the house if he wishes to elaborate on his remarks and i hope that perhaps he will <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend assures us that when the bank may exercise the powers conferred by subsections and above in relation to any person even though those powers relate to the serving on an authorised institution only in fact the meaning of the act is that they may be served on a person <e> <s> i am glad that we have that on the record <e> <s> i am modestly grateful for the other remarks he has made but not very <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend forgive me

generate a set of rules which will be put before parliament before they are enforced by the tsa <e> <s> is that the position <e>", "<cs> my lords i know this is not committee stage and i hope your lordships will forgive me <e> <s> the matters i referred to in my speech and of which i gave notice related to the draft memorandum of agreement between the bank of england and the tsa which is on paper and from which i have quoted <e> <s> i think it would be as well if my noble friend proceeded with his speech as he intended and we may get to the bit of it in which i am particularly interested later <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise the difficulties of my noble friend because he is speaking on behalf of another government department and that government department is not in charge of this area of policy anyway because it is delegated to a third government department <e> <s> therefore there must be some reluctance for him to make any commitment whatever on policy although it is perfectly respectable for him to say that all this will be for the regulators and they are not yet in position <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise only because my noble friend may have left it in your lordships minds that i tabled amendments earlier in our proceedings in order to keep specifically the japanese or any other financial institutions out of the city of london <e> <s> that was very far from the case as i hope my noble friend will realise when he re-reads <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise only to say that while i do not have a copy of the financial services act by me i trust implicitly in the drafting of my noble friends advisers <e> <s> i should like to thank my noble friend for reading my speech <e> <s> it is always nice when one discovers after one has made an intervention that it can actually have an effect upon those who appear to be impregnable at the time of listening <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i should say that in my view the undertaking given by the secretary of state on report unlike the statement on policy given by his right honourable friend earlier to which the noble lord referred left the expectation that the monopolies and mergers commission would be used to defend the national interest in the event of a foreign takeover bid for high street clearing banks and that move although not a dramatic one was a move in the right direction <e>", "<cs> my lords this stage of the proceedings of any instrument seems to me to partake partly of the nature of a funeral and partly of the nature of a baptism <e> <s> the government

think that the noble lord opposite has done exactly that <e>", "<cs> my lords i was technically outside the chamber when the noble baroness lady blackstone made her maiden speech but i heard it well and clear because i was standing behind the woolsack <e> <s> i should like to endorse what both my noble colleagues said before me that she performed in a most impressive manner managing not merely to be non-controversial but to utter one or two sentiments which were quite welcome on this side of the house as well <e> <s> i hope that we hear from her often though i do not suppose that she will be as uncontroversial in the weeks to come <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down i wonder whether she can very kindly clear up one point <e> <s> in her reference to the projections p and q i think she told us that the participation rate at the end of the century would be one in five <e> <s> i rather think she said that the base from which the advance would be made was also one in five

tell the rest of the house what sasines are <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that those who advise my noble friend and his right honourable friend on these matters will have a comparatively restful three weeks in the near future <e> <s> can they not look more closely at the merits of this case in answer to what must be admitted is one of the more clearly expressed questions to come from the other side <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that it is normal for those who wish to get things into a legislative vehicle such as an act of parliament when it is available to do so in the knowledge and with the agreement of the government that the measure will not be implemented until funds are available and that what is being pointed out is not an extraordinary matter <e>", "<cs>

taking place there is claimed to be justified by an increase in the number of inmates or by a reduction in the number of prison officers <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that those of us who have already looked at some of the royal parks and palace property are much impressed by the way the staffs have tackled the job and wish them every success in the formidable task facing them <e>", "<cs> does the noble lord recognise that the lord chief justice whom he has quoted as being so adamantly in favour of the shortest possible sentence would in fact be involved in the process of setting what should be the appropriate sentence in the cases to which he is referring <e> <s> does he not regard that as a reassurance <e>", "<cs> as we are in committee my noble friend would expect me to reply to the doubts after they are expressed rather than before <e> <s> i have moved the amendment to allow members of the committee to discuss the proposal <e> <s> the principal proposal is to relieve the system of no less than one-tenth of the burden <e> <s> it is far greater than anything in clauses and possibly twice as much as the two together <e> <s> that being so my noble friend may like to consider whether if the amendment were changed so that it embraced the first offence only he would find it more acceptable <e> <s> we are at the first stage only of the bill <e>", "<cs> the noble lord will concede that as this is a summary offence with no imprisonment as punishment the person will not be nine weeks in prison <e> <s> that is what i was talking about <e>", "<cs> i apologise for the frequent interruptions but i have obviously not made one thing clear <e> <s> the reason why so many people arc on remand for so long is the congestion of the courts <e> <s> it vol

the chance of replying to a number of points that have been made because i am so grateful that i do not wish to make a speech <e>", "<cs> i should like to add to what my noble friend has said <e> <s> the clause states <e>", "<cs> i apologise for interrupting my noble friend yet again but as he has prayed me in aid i should say to my noble friend lord campbell of alloway that of course i and i am

problem is recognised and i am sure my noble friend recognises it <e>", "<cs> if my noble friend will forgive me i do because in reply to what the noble lord has said about myself i should point out that i was addressing the point in his amendment <e> <s> it was an immediate enforcement of a standard which cannot be met and one which i think either would be wholly disastrous to the administration of the prison system or else could not be implemented for the foreseeable future <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord wyatt has usefully reminded members of the committee that this is a bill not only about racing although it was as a bill about racing that it came to my attention very belatedly in the last hours <e> <s> as it is a bill on racing it is also a bill about betting as the noble lord lord graham of edmonton has said <e>", "<cs> is my noble friend suggesting that the prison officers association is actually in favour of this bill <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord has manifestly not sat down perhaps i may ask him to address himself to one narrow point which i think would help the committee very much <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord manton pauses to recollect what he intends to say next <e>

of line <e> <s> as amendment no <e> <s> strikes at line it strikes at something that no longer exists <e>", "<cs> there is an understandable pause because the clause that we are asked to leave in the bill is a great deal better than the clause that was in the bill when we tabled the amendment <e> <s> i do not know exactly what my noble friends and other noble lords who have put their names to the motion feel nor have we had a chance to discuss it <e> <s> i should welcome guidance from the usual source <e> <s> although there is no clause stand part procedure i am not sure whether the usual

things up very much <e>", "<cs> in those circumstances i would not wish to move the motion <e> <s> we can take a proper view later <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord leaves that point perhaps i may ask him to take on board the fact that this amendment is directed to existing members of the industry <e> <s> the difference between a policeman and a person working now in the racing industry is that when the policeman joined he knew that he would have to work on sundays <e> <s> when the person joined the racing industry there was no proposal that there should be racing on sundays <e> <s> there is a genuine difference <e>", "<cs> therefore the day of rest needs to be established on one day a week and that is sunday <e> <s> that is aside from the strong convictions i have about sunday on

definition of track <e>", "<cs> it is late and no doubt we shall return to this point but i must just stress that i see danger in this amendment and the noble lord ought to be aware of it <e> <s> we

in embarrassment <e> <s> i quite accept that if he is briefed that this amendment is consequential on his first amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may first finish what i was saying <e> <s> i am merely saying that it would probably be open to the committee to accept on trust that the amendment is consequential but on the understanding that we shall return to it at a later stage if it makes the bill

lord lord wyatt <e>", "<cs> if it is there i stand or sit corrected <e>", "<cs> this is really for the noble lord lord graham but the last amendment which was carried had an effect and i am just wondering whether it is congruent with the last few words and in licensed betting offices proposed in the new long title <e> <s> i do not know what are the procedural requirements of the committee but i should have thought if it was proper before the bill was amended to have this long title the committee might be in order to accept it now and delete the last five words at a later stage <e> <s> the

which the right reverend prelate can give to the meaning of certain terms in the amendments <e> <s> it would be precocious of me to try to provide those in advance <e> <s> i believe that they are entirely satisfactory and that what is provided answers the failure of the act which arises from two principal causes <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that we need go into the detail of the next debate <e> <s> i have to speak because my name is on the amendment <e> <s> i believe passionately that it is right and later i shall give passionate reasons for thinking that other amendments are wrong <e> <s> i beg your lordships now to seize an historic opportunity to defend and promote the teaching of true religion in our schools in a way that does not subordinate but enrols the loyalty of

reverend prelate has generously offered to continue may possibly be helped if i try to take what he has said a stage further <e> <s> it still seems to me that in some peoples minds there is a gap

therefore i advise the noble lord lord prys-davies that it may be precipitious to divide the committee at this stage <e>", "<cs> i believe that the noble lord is referring to the sib consultation paper for which the consultation period ends on st may <e> <s> the secretary of state will correct me if i am wrong but i believe that the consultation period for his paper finishes on the st of this

contribute because so much of merit has been said that there is little new to say <e> <s> however i have a particular perspective and i think it worth spending a moment to focus on my principal interest in the debate which concerns young people <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that all secondary legislation passes through your lordships house where it can be stopped <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that it is worth reminding your lordships that we are not the planning authority in this matter <e> <s> the bill is called for because it takes an act of parliament to change an act of

much to be desired the membership of the independent organisation is very <e>", "<cs> my lords after hours and minutes a mere layman is apprehensive about joining in a debate of this sort apprehensive for a number of reasons <e> <s> the debate itself has made me apprehensive <e> <s> i feel as a layman that i can only be expected to seize a few salient points or address a broad issue <e> <s> the broad issue referred to on a number of occasions latterly by my noble friend lord alexander of weedon is the sense of apprehension tension and hostility that there has been between the executive and the judiciary from the moment of the publication of the green paper until a quarter past nine this evening <e> <s> as a layman i very much hope that this can be remedied and speedily because it does nothing but harm to all concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i also was concerned at the committee stage on this bill that we might be faced with a new restriction that ought to be resisted and i had supposed that this amendment was designed to resist a change <e> <s> i am persuaded however that the provisions of the bill alter nothing in respect of what my noble friend addresses in his amendment the particular concern that i had over what might become of a crown servant when he ceased to be a crown servant for which i could see no provision in the bill <e> <s> the bill provides for him in clause <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend agree that probably the proper time and place to discuss the merits of what is proposed in the bill would be in a discussion on the bill itself <e>", "<cs> my lords is not one of the important functions of governors to appoint suitable members of staff and sadly where members of staff are irremediably unsuitable to arrange for their redeployment or dismissal <e> <s> will part of the million which i am glad to hear that the government are spending on training governors in the current year be devoted to seeing that they are well equipped to carry out that and other functions relating to good order and discipline in schools <e>", "<cs> my lords given that the source of the substances and the means of transmission to this country are overseas

ago but that is no reason why he should be swept aside <e> <s> i intervene only to put right two misapprehensions as i see them <e> <s> first it was suggested that the amendments put forward by this house are never accepted by another place <e> <s> i have myself been at the dispatch box reporting the acceptance of an amendment from another place <e> <s> secondly many amendments come back to us in another form either as a compromise honourably worked between the two chambers and there is nothing wrong with that or made to fit better into a scheme which is already in the statute <e> <s> again there is nothing wrong in that procedure <e>", "<cs> very briefly i advise my noble friend the minister that if he is for a moment entertaining the idea of withdrawing the power to restrict the economic involvement of the local authorities in this way he should consider the history of the metropolitan authorities when approaching their conclusion <e> <s> they demonstrated dexterity and vigour in applying local authority funds to all kinds of sectors that went far beyond what could have been the intention of the legislation under which they did so <e> <s> therefore while it is a regrettable fact it is a necessary one that the secretary of state should have power to restrain this employment of money if it appears to be inappropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise merely to say that i am sure that the noble lord is absolutely right not to seek to overturn the decision of the committee which sat with enormous thoroughness for days <e> <s> i believe that we are right to repose

be tackling the judges as well as the magistrates but i am only just beginning my task and cannot vouch for what may happen later <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend the minister realise that her majestys governments efforts to ensure that the khmer rouge does not return to power in cambodia will have the support of all civilised people in view of the appalling atrocities that were carried out in that country when they were last in power <e> <s> i have met personally many victims <e> <s> is he aware that we shall back any efforts that the government make in this direction <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend sits down perhaps he will help the committee at least those of us less familiar with the existing framework than he is <e> <s> he has lent great weight to a statement by the iba as to what must be the attitude of the christian religion <e> <s> what is the status of that undertaking <e> <s> is it a legal undertaking <e> <s> is it subject to change without the authority of parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords in the promised consideration of the numbers of the volunteer reserve forces which my right honourable friend has proposed will my noble friend ask him to bear three points in mind <e> <s> the first is that the wind-down in regular forces will provide automatically a source of vehicles and equipment suitable for equipping and training the reserves <e> <s> secondly the wind-down in personnel in the regular teeth arms will provide a highly professional source of cadre and permanent staff for territorial and other reserve formations <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down if he is thinking of coming back to this issue at the next stage i hope that he will take a purview of all the other regulatory bodies with regard to which the director general of fair trading has a similar role to play <e> <s> then perhaps he will not feel it such an extraordinary thing to do <e>", "<cs> my lords after the weasels carbuncles and unnamed zealots mentioned in the fascinating speech of the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby i hope your lordships will permit me in less than three minutes to raise one point <e> <s> the speech which weighed with me more than any other as a criticism of the amendments to the commons amendment which i support was that of the noble and learned lord lord brightman <e> <s> he told us that amendment no <e> <s> a was superfluous as applied to subsection a of the commons amendment <e> <s> he also said that the lords amendment was unnecessary in relation to paragraphs b and c of the subsection <e> <s> i shall leave the question of superfluity on one side and consider necessity <e> <s> the judgment of the noble and learned lord appeared to rest on the assumption first that the pregnancy in each case referred to under paragraphs b and c was wanted by the mother and secondly that a doctor would presumably therefore strive to preserve the life of the fetus <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord robertson has put his finger on one important point if not three <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord brightman has a genius for attracting my antagonism which is quite at variance with his personality <e> <s> he said that the defect in the amendment is a lack of definition of life <e> <s> i take his point entirely <e> <s> it seems to me that the phrase incompatible with life should be refined <e> <s> if that is an unsatisfactory position to be left with what <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble and learned friend sits down does he regard the term serious handicap as defying definition as he does incompatible with life <e> <s> if so how many of your lordships does it embrace or where does the line lie <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble and learned friend will bear with me the point of my question was to emphasis that an amendment is needed to define serious handicap <e> <s> on the definition that he gave it does not seem that many healthy people could be safely expected to come to life under the existing legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friends original answer revealed that about one in five boxes will have a collection on sunday can he say whether the post boxes will be selected area by area or whether collections will be made from per cent <e> <s> of post boxes in a number of areas <e> <s> if it is to be the latter could there be a distinguishing mark on those post <e>", "<cs> my lords would it help my noble friend to form a view on the legality of the question to know that a recent high court decision by mr justice hoffmann has made it clear that the shops act provisions applying to sunday trading are entirely <e>", "<cs> my lords i am just but only just old enough to recognise for myself without having them pointed out to me the very close parallels that can be drawn between the present dictator of iraq in and the dictator of germany in just years before <e> <s> each sought to exterminate a minority population using poison gas each used the truth as a malleable substance to be manipulated to his own advantage and each seized neighbouring territory by force of arms and thus overthrew international law <e> <s> but there the parallels should end <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend add to her consideration of the point made by my noble friend lord beloff this further consideration <e> <s> in the sciences which arc cumulative and growing subjects the volume of knowledge to be acquired by those seeking degrees is constantly increasing <e> <s> scientists who return to university years after having left find not only that they could not answer but also that they could not have asked a number of the questions on the final examination papers <e> <s> therefore does the noble baroness agree that there is an impending problem of national proportions on the length of courses for science degrees anyway <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that no police force in the world can on its own prevent the commission of crime <e> <s> what is necessary for the production of a law abiding society is a society which believes in abiding by the law <e> <s> does he therefore believe that the programmes for involving the community developed by the metropolitan police are the most fruitful way forward <e> <s> does he also consider that generally there is a great deal more work to be done to persuade people of the rule of fair play in observing the law <e>"]
