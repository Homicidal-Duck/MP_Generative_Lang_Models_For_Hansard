["<cs> my lords as this is my maiden speech and as i am well aware that in your lordships house there are many who have long and distinguished records in the field of foreign affairs i ask for your lordships indulgence <e> <s> i am glad that this the first debate i am taking part in in your lordships house was opened by the noble baroness lady young who as i well know has played a very notable part in consolidating our relationship with canada <e>", "<cs> my lords the motion introduced by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter in his admirable speech this afternoon covered i am sure the public service as a whole and not merely the home civil service because when people talk about the efficiency and dedication or lack of it in the civil service i am sure that they are thinking of the public service as a whole <e> <s> so i make no apology for talking primarily but not exclusively about the problem as it affects the diplomatic service <e> <s> i said something about the relationship of the home civil service and the diplomatic service when i spoke last month in the debate on the gracious speech <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord the minister for that reply <e> <s> bearing in mind that there are now significant developments in the field of oil and natural gas offshore of atlantic canada and that it was described recently by the chairman of shell canada as a new and rapidly rising area of activity in which potential opportunities are abundant and also bearing in mind that the rate of exchange has now made opportunities for british exporters much better and that there are many firms in this country which have expertise and experience in relation to the north sea which are particularly relevant to these opportunities will the noble lord ask his right honourable and learned friend the foreign secretary to reconsider the decision to close the small and highly cost-effective consulate at halifax which was announced at the end of last year <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount and the noble marquess have spoken on this subject with a great authority which i cannot begin to match <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that this motion has been introduced by my old chief the noble lord lord home of the hirsel <e> <s> all of us who had the privilege of working for him when he was foreign secretary remember him as foreign secretary with affection and respect <e> <s> i am taking part in this debate tonight because i lived three years of my life in a communist country <e> <s> when i was ambassador in hungary i dealt almost every day with communist officials <e> <s> i was able to study the workings of a communist regime over a considerable period and i <e>", "<cs> my lords all my life i have been greatly interested in questions of wildlife and the countryside <e> <s> so when this bill came forward i studied with great care the report of the environment committee of another place and the debates on the bill in another place <e> <s> despite what that environment committee said i have some doubts about the voluntary approach which is enshrined in the act both on principle as it seems to be wrong to treat one section of the community differently from another and also because of the vast expense that may be entailed <e> <s> for instance the county of suffolk has reckoned that to carry out the provisions of compensation will cost between million and million a year in suffolk alone <e> <s> apart from that i was greatly impressed by the strength and unanimity of the view in another place among all shades of opinion including some farmers <e> <s> everyone seemed agreed as did responsible bodies outside parliament that the wildlife and countryside act should be built on and improved <e>", "<cs> my lords the point i was going to make is a little different <e>", "<cs> my lords when we come to the reasons for the catastrophe suffered the chief scientist of the governments advisory body the nature conservancy council has described them first as the reclaiming as it is called of semi-natural or natural habitats into cultivation secondly new high input/high output methods have left ever less room for other living things beyond crop plants and thirdly forestry is spreading ever-increasing swathes of conifer plantations across the hills <e> <s> incidentally these alien conifers have produced a new hazard <e> <s> the welsh water authority told your lordships select committee that through afforestation with conifers over relatively large areas of upland west and north wales is now implicated in serious water quality problems and the reduction in fish populations in the headwaters of several important rivers <e> <s> there are no more trout or dippers in the upper lrfon which once had many <e> <s> there still are trout and dippers in rivers which in mid-wales do not flow through conifer plantations <e>", "<cs> my lords i am indeed going to make some specific comments about the bill but it is absolutely essential to consider the background against which we are dealing with it and the fact that the government have taken out from the bill certain very important provisions which are very relevant to what i have been saying <e>", "<cs> i shall be exceedingly brief because i think the case for this amendment has been put most powerfully and persuasively by the noble lord lord buxton <e> <s> i agree with everything he says and can really add nothing to it <e> <s> however i think that rightly or wrongly this clause has become to some extent the litmus test of the governments attitude to conservation <e> <s> at second reading the noble lord lord skelmersdale said that conservation is government policy affecting all departments of state <e> <s> i was very happy to hear him say that <e>", "<cs> my lords many noble lords who have taken part in this debate have spoken with great authority and experience not least the noble lord lord home of the hirsel who as always has given us words of wisdom <e> <s> they include a former chief of the defence staff my noble and gallant friend lord carver <e> <s> having myself spent part of my war as an ordinary seaman and part as a sub-lieutenant rnvr i feel somewhat diffident at intervening in this debate <e> <s> i said to myself who am i to bandy words with a field marshal or indeed with an admiral of the fleet <e> <s> but i was concerned with defence questions on and off a good deal during my time in the diplomatic service and i think that ordinary people are very much concerned with these questions they after all pay the bill and that we should not leave it entirely to the experts or to those who look at the problem primarily through political spectacles <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the establishment of nasco in edinburgh <e> <s> i can claim to have played a small part in bringing this about by helping to persuade the canadian government to support its establishment in edinburgh <e> <s> their first thought had been to put it in of all places copenhagen <e> <s> i support the two motions we are discussing <e> <s> i am only sorry that the united kingdom is not separately represented in <e>", "<cs> my lords i warmly weleome this bill and i should like to pay tribute to her majestys governments wholehearted and unwavering support for spanish and portuguese accession to the community <e> <s> i propose to confine my remarks to portugal where i had the privilege of spending four-and-a-half years as her majestys ambassador <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord nugent of guildford and the noble baroness lady white speak with great knowledge and authority in these matters <e> <s> i cannot claim any similar expertise but as a member of the sub-committee i wish to pay particular tribute to our chairman the noble lord lord nathan <e> <s> again and again when some of us felt that we might sink below the surface in a sea of technicalities he kept our deliberations sequent and intelligible <e> <s> he guided our work with great skill and we are very much indebted to him <e>", "<cs> my lords the agreement before us marks yet another landmark in the long sad history of our dealings in ireland a problem which has baffled and exasperated us for so many years <e> <s> we are concerned today with how to defeat the terrorists <e> <s> it is not a new problem indeed it was much the same years ago when there were fenian outrages in ireland and here in parliament financed then as now by the irish-americans in the united states and denounced then by parnell as they are now by dr fitzgerald <e> <s> it is a problem that has been with us far too long <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to the noble lord it is true that we retain our full sovereignty but we are allowing a foreign government a role <e> <s> this is what the whole agreement is about <e>", "<cs> my lords in this case it is not merely a foreign country but one which has deliberately chosen to be foreign and which under articles and of its constitution lays claim to the territory of <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely accept that comment <e> <s> of course it is true <e> <s> i was talking about the line taken by the irish government rather than the whole of the irish people <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first thank the government for bringing forward a salmon bill and for addressing themselves to the problem of illegal fishing <e> <s> we should all be grateful to ministers and officials for the time and effort that they have devoted to the problems of salmon <e> <s> in particular i should like to thank the noble lord lord gray of contin for all that he has done and is doing <e>", "<cs> i apologise for interrupting the noble lord the minister but may i ask whether the officials who are conducting the drought review are under instructions to consider the fisheries aspect and particularly the aspect of the threat to salmon and sea trout when they are entering rivers in drought conditions <e>", "<cs> in the light of what the minister has said which i understand to be an assurance that the officials considering the drought review will take account of fisheries and specifically of salmon problems both in england and wales i am happy to beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> i heartily agree with everything that has been said by the noble baroness lady white <e> <s> i have tried to address one of the problems that she mentioned the question of the estuaries in amendment no <e> <s> which we shall be debating later <e>", "<cs> i notice that in the grouping of amendments which we have been given there is included amendment no <e> <s> which stands in my name and that of the noble baroness lady white <e> <s> that amendment is to the title of the bill and it proposes that in line we should leave out scotland and insert the words great britain <e> <s> that amendment reflects what i considered was the overwhelming view of noble lords at second reading namely that any arrangements which are brought in to deal with the sale and distribution of salmon should extend throughout great britain and that view has been reaffirmed from all quarters of the committee today <e> <s> therefore i hope very much that the government will be prepared to accept that amendment <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> i am in no sense suggesting that there should be an unnecessary delay <e> <s> i am simply reflecting what i believe to be the view of the water authorities in england and wales which is that they should have more time to consider what is really the best method of achieving what we all want <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may ask whether the government would be prepared at this stage to give their views on amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> it might be convenient to the committee if they would do so while we are discussing this question because they are very similar <e>", "<cs> i am in some difficulty about this because as i have said i know nothing about scottish law and i would not want to press the matter on the scottish amendments <e> <s> however i mind very much about the ones in england and wales <e> <s> it has always seemed to me as my noble and learned friend lord denning very eloquently pointed out that we ought to have the same provisions throughout great britain <e>", "<cs> in the light of that reply i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble lord lord belstead for his explanation <e> <s> i may say that i was very well aware of the consultation paper of <e> <s> indeed i referred to it explicitly in my speech at second reading <e> <s> what i said then was that there appeared to be a loophole in the present legislation in that the sea fishery committees appeared to find themselves unable under present legislation to deal with salmon and sea trout whereas the water authorities were unable to operate in the reverse direction <e>", "<cs> in the light of what the minister has said i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may comment on what the noble lord lord belstead has said <e> <s> i entirely accept and agree with him that clearly we must not have a clause that puts the onus of proof on housewives <e> <s> it was precisely for that reason that we inserted in our own amendment no <e> <s> the words <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> f simply seeks to define in the bill the notion of acting together <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble lord for that explanation <e> <s> in the light of what he has said i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> in the light of that explanation from the minister for which i am most grateful i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for his explanation <e> <s> i think that in one respect he has misunderstood the wording of my amendment <e> <s> it reads <e>", "<cs> so far as my own amendment is concerned i am very grateful to the noble lords who have supported me <e> <s> i find myself in complete agreement with all that the noble earl lord perth has said this evening <e> <s> i have listened with very great care to what the minister has said and i understand very well the drift of his argument <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the minister and i think that should clear it up <e> <s> in the light of what he has said i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> what the minister has said will cause some disappointment in england and wales but i have noted his assurance to the noble lord lord home that this can be inserted at the report stage <e> <s> in the light of that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords having spoken about this matter at second reading and at committee perhaps i may join in thanking the minister very much for this announcement and particularly for his statement that this scheme will be worked out in full consultation with the water authorities because i think that is very important <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to the minister for what he has said and i welcome his <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to the minister for the reply that he gave me <e> <s> i should like to study it in <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble marquess for giving way <e> <s> i was saying that i thought that fishermen in general in great britain had been hardly done by and it was against that background that i was considering their problem <e>", "<cs> my lords before i decide what to do may i ask the minister one or two questions <e> <s> first i think if i heard him aright he said that this amendment would lead to a phase-out of the north-east drift net fishery <e> <s> that is not my understanding unless the review and the scientific advice was to the effect that the level which was not injurious to salmon in scottish and english rivers was zero <e> <s> otherwise it would not and it is deliberately worded not to require anything as drastic as that <e>", "<cs> my lords in the circumstances i think what i should ask is that the government should perhaps write to me and to the other sponsors of this amendment and answer the questions that i have put which are with respect fundamental to this question <e> <s> then subject to the replies i get i propose to move an amendment at third reading if i judge it necessary <e> <s> that said i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i too strongly support this amendment which seems to me to be moderate and sensible and to contain all the necessary safeguards <e> <s> in wales there is certainly a problem in drought conditions when salmon are concentrated in the estuaries and in pools <e> <s> i believe that in many parts of the country there is also a problem immediately after drought conditions when salmon are running up on the first flood after a drought <e> <s> all that can be looked into during the three years that are proposed for consideration in the amendment which i hope very much will command the support of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say a word about this as a layman from a strictly practical point of view <e> <s> i have listened with care to the speech by the noble and learned lord the lord advocate and i should like to thank him and the noble lord lord belstead for their patience and courtesy in listening to the doubts that we expressed and in explaining the thinking behind the wording they have chosen <e> <s> lord belsteads amendment no <e> <s> is i think a very slight improvement on the original wording but not much more than that <e> <s> when at our meeting the lord advocate told us of this proposed change i at once asked him if the words for him could be left out which would have made the proposal acceptable to me <e> <s> but for reasons which he has explained in his speech earlier this evening he could not agree and that change is now in lord dennings amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my words of welcome for this clause and to thank the minister very much indeed for having responded to the views of the house so swiftly and introducing this clause <e> <s> if clause can be improved in another place together the clauses will do something effective to cope with the problem of illegal fishing i am most grateful <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say that i am somewhat concerned about this amendment <e> <s> the minister will know that the water authorities are not happy about it and have told the government that the proposed change has been met with considerable concern by the fisheries advisers of the water authorities <e> <s> they think that there have been no changes in circumstances which would justify the amendment proposed and that the day-to-day relationships between water authorities and fish farmers work reasonably well <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house may i ask the minister this <e> <s> i understand the point about disease but as most fish farms are connected with rivers is there not a danger that alien species introduced into fish farms might find their way into british rivers <e>", "<cs> my lords i have put down a more modest and limited amendment so i should like to speak only briefly on the amendment put down by the noble marquess <e> <s> i support what he says particularly about the need to formulate a national policy for salmon conservation as is stated in his amendment and all that he has said about nasco and our relationship with it which i think is absolutely right and very important <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that the minister is prepared to have a look at it and to consider the word that i have suggested adequate <e> <s> in view of that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i agree with everything the minister has said but i recognise that the wording of my amendment may well be defective <e> <s> what i would ask is that the government should consider very carefully whether it would be possible in another place to insert some wording which required the review to take account of the international considerations bearing in mind that they themselves have said that this is what the review will do <e> <s> it would be very helpful if that could appear in the terms of the bill itself <e> <s> subject to that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i follow what the minister says <e> <s> i hope that what he said does not mean that he is turning his back on the objectives all of which seem extremely important and very valid today <e> <s> but i recognise that in some respects they are not wholly relevant to the review and in the circumstances which he has explained i am content with what he has said <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the minister for repeating the statement <e> <s> i too should like unreservedly to condemn the violence and intimidation yesterday <e> <s> the yobbo element is sadly increasingly in evidence in our society and not just in northern ireland <e> <s> i should like to say a brief word about the underlying problem because there seems to me to be a rather frightening gulf between the general opinion in your lordships house and the opinion of the majority of people in northern ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords i am merely making a brief comment which i am allowed to do <e> <s> the government seem to take the line that they know best that they decide and the people concerned must lump it <e> <s> that seems to me with respect an odd way to run a democracy <e> <s> it is a style of government associated with charles i who claimed the sanction of divine right <e> <s> but it is not i believe a style suited to open government today <e> <s> i believe that the government ought to think very carefully about what they do now and in particular i have real doubts about the wisdom of devolution because that seems to me to open the door to the break-up of the united kingdom which i believe would be a profound mistake <e> <s> i ask them with great respect to think again <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for that reply <e> <s> does she not think it somewhat odd and illogical that having conducted a very spendid operation at a distance of miles in order to liberate the falkland islands and in order to meet the expressed wishes of the islanders that they should remain british we should subsequently do nothing effective to protect the principal resource of the falkland islands that is the fish stocks from the depredations of foreign fishermen despite the strongly expressed wishes of the islanders that we should take effective steps to establish a -mile fishery zone <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that reply <e> <s> do i understand that to mean that motor-cyclists who cross a single white line are committing no offence <e> <s> if one drives on any evening from this house to albert bridge one sees a large number of motor-cyclists crossing the white line <e> <s> is this not a very dangerous practice and does it not put them and other people at risk <e> <s> i am surprised if it is acceptable to the police and to the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted that it falls to me to be the first to congratulate the noble lord lord strathclyde on an admirable maiden speech and to welcome him as a member of your lordships house <e> <s> some of your lordships will i am sure remember his distinguished father and his grandfather <e> <s> he himself has i believe the advantage of having received a university education on both sides of the channel <e> <s> he is clearly a mid-channel man <e> <s> i hope we shall hear him frequently in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i was greatly impressed by the account given by the noble earl lord ferrers of the successes of food from britain <e> <s> i hope that his powerful appeal for support from the industry will be heeded <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that i greatly welcome the announcement in committee in another place yesterday that the government are to establish a standing advisory committee on salmon conservation under an independent chairman <e> <s> that goes a long way towards meeting the wishes of those of us who argued for a national salmon policy when the salmon bill was being considered by your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords have the government taken note of the fact that norway has recently announced conservation measures including the banning of monofilament nets from the ending of all drift netting for salmon from and the extension of the close season by two weeks <e> <s> will this not leave this country and the republic of ireland in the unenviable position of being the only countries which are represented in nasco that will not have announced radical measures to conserve atlantic salmon stocks <e>", "<cs> my lords as todays announcement seems to mark the failure of this particular experiment in devolution might it not be sensible despite the special problems of northern ireland to which the noble lord referred to consider in future treating northern ireland more like other parts of the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> may i ask the minister whether it is intended to publish this study by the university of wales when it is completed <e>", "<cs> let me refer first to the point about the european community which the minister mentioned on second reading and explained at greater length today <e> <s> as i understand it when the matter was discussed in another place the government admitted that they were largely instrumental in ensuring that forestry did not fall within the ec definition of agriculture <e> <s> i do not know whether that is right but it seems to have been the british government who brought that provision about <e> <s> as the noble lord lord melchett said that is not relevant to my amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to raise at this point a question of which i have given the minister notice <e> <s> it concerns conditions on tax relief for forestry <e> <s> reference has already been made to two recent cases in south-east scotland where private forestry companies have undertaken upland afforestation projects despite these projects being refused grant-aid by the forestry commission and as i understand it against the wishes of the department of agriculture <e>", "<cs> may i say with reference to what the noble lord the minister said that i should like to emphasise that i was not in any sense arguing against tax relief for forestry generally still less was i suggesting that it should be an offence to plant a tree because heaven knows i plant quite a number of trees myself <e> <s> i stressed in my remarks that the great majority of planting takes place with the approval of the forestry commission and i think that tax relief <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may just answer two questions which were put to me <e> <s> the first one was put to me by the minister on the question of felling licences <e> <s> i accept that this is a valid point but there are exceptions <e> <s> for example there is the case of coppiced woodland <e> <s> a farmer can quite legitimately cut coppice in the normal way and he is then left with the coppice stools which only stand about knee high and as the felling licence mechanism is only triggered at metres above ground the coppice stools can then quite legitimately be grubbed up with impunity <e> <s> i understand that there have been cases of this in east sussex and that is one loophole in the felling licence mechanism <e>", "<cs> i find that reply disappointing because i myself think that there is a problem and a growing problem and that sooner or later it will have to be addressed <e> <s> however it cannot be addressed tonight and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment <e> <s> i should like to ask the noble earl lord onslow one question <e> <s> he mentioned tree preservation orders <e> <s> there was a report in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened with care to what the minister said <e> <s> i understand the reasons for the governments decision <e> <s> the minister paid a generous tribute to the good work that was done by the assembly but at the end it clearly was not doing its job and the noble lord lord dunleath has told us with clarity and fairness why it failed <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government satisfy themselves that if this barrage is built migratory fish going up or down the rivers severn and wye will be able to pass through the barrage without excessive loss and that consequently there will not be severe losses to the stocks in those and other rivers <e>", "<cs> my lords for some nine years i was concerned in my working life with the problems of africa and i spent three years in south africa <e> <s> although that was years or so ago it gave me at first hand some idea of the difficulty and the complexity of <e>", "<cs> my lords i must first apologise for having had to miss some of the earlier part of the debate owing to an engagement elsewhere <e>", "<cs> perhaps in this context i may put to the minister a question which i put to her in the debate on second reading and to which she was good enough to give an answer which i think was only a partial answer <e> <s> the question was what is our longterm objective <e> <s> i pointed out that there seemed to me to be a fairly profound difference between the objective as stated by the preamble to the act to transform relations as a whole among the states into a european union and what the prime minister said last december about her opposition to a united states of europe <e> <s> i therefore asked the minister to clear up the uncertainty and tell us where in the governments view we are heading <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness sits down may i ask her a small question <e> <s> on page of the single european act there is a rather obscure sentence which says <e>", "<cs> my lords may i follow what the noble viscount has just said <e> <s> as we are discussing conservation matters i should like to say first of all that i warmly welcomed in this house the setting up of the advisory committee which the noble viscount has just mentioned <e> <s> equally i warmly welcome the appointment of professor george dunnet as its chairman <e> <s> i think this will be a great encouragement to everyone interested in salmon conservation because the appointment of such a distinguished chairman shows that the committee is going to be a serious one and that the government are going to take its work seriously <e> <s> that i warmly welcome <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down may i ask him one question <e> <s> i should first like to thank him very much for the information he has just given us <e> <s> however i wonder why the government have resisted pressure from many of us to write this new advisory committee into the bill so that it becomes permanent and statutory <e>", "<cs> my lords i wondered why the government had resisted pressure to make it so <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say that i think the essential objective of this amendment is to achieve integrated management of the resource and i hope we can do that <e> <s> i am bound to say that i was concerned about two rivers in wales the dee and the usk but since i last spoke on this matter in your lordships house i have discovered that the welsh water authority is also the sea fisheries committee for these rivers so i hope that there will be no conflict on that <e>", "<cs> my lords may i very briefly express my gratitude to the noble lord the minister for having arranged for this amendment to be introduced <e> <s> i welcome it very much and i hope that with goodwill on all sides it will work effectively and will prevent the illegal fishing in coastal waters that has gone on in the past <e> <s> i am very grateful to the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be brief because i had my say on this bill on second reading <e> <s> i have been to some extent in a dilemma on the bill because i am very strongly in favour of the completion of the internal market <e> <s> the more i study it the more important it seems to me to be for british interests <e> <s> at the moment it is to some extent a one-sided market in that our own market is freely open to manufactures of all sorts from europe whereas in those fields where we have particular skills such as banking and insurance and financial services we encounter difficulty <e>", "<cs> my lords i want if i may to make two main points the first of which follows from what the noble lord lord stewart of fulham has just been saying <e>", "<cs> my lords this is an exceptionally important debate <e> <s> we have already had two excellent <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very sorry indeed that lord brookeborough is no longer among us <e> <s> i was in northern ireland the other day and was travelling around fermanagh <e> <s> i found that a great many people with whom i spoke were deeply concerned that he was so seriously ill in hospital and it was clear to me that he was held in very high regard <e> <s> the noble lord will be greatly missed there and greatly missed in your lordships house <e> <s> our sympathy goes to his widow and to his family <e>", "<cs> my lords having reached a point where it was suggested on the bbc at lunch-time today that a distinguished judge was irresponsible in booking a passage across the irish sea in his own name is it not time that we took an entirely new look at security in northern ireland <e> <s> perhaps the security forces should stand less on the defensive and should take the initiative in trying to destroy and root out terrorism in the province <e> <s> to that end can the minister assure the house that anything the security forces need to secure that objective will be given to them including if necessary some amendment to the legal framework <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a pleasure to follow the noble lord lord dunleath in this debate <e> <s> he speaks with great authority on the affairs of northern ireland and we always listen to him with great attention <e> <s> i too should like to thank the noble lord lord lyell and his department for the briefing on this bill which they have given us <e> <s> that was very helpful <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a pleasure to follow my former colleague the noble lord lord henniker and my neighbour the noble lord lord gibson-watt in this debate <e> <s> i too would like to thank the noble baroness lady stedman for giving us this timely opportunity to debate the environment <e>", "<cs> my lords all of us must thank the noble lord lord carmichael of kelvingrove for providing this opportunity to discuss a problem which i have believed for some time is extremely serious and urgent <e> <s> i was delighted when i saw the sentence in the gracious speech which said <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the bill and the shift in objectives which it sets out <e> <s> i was encouraged by what the minister told us about it <e> <s> unlike the noble lords lord john-mackie and lord walston i found it helpful to have the details that the minister gave us <e> <s> i must declare a potential interest in that my wife has a very small hill farm in mid-wales <e>", "<cs> my lords while joining in sincere condolences to those who have suffered in this terrible crime may i ask the minister whether it is correct that enniskillen lies in a constituency in which people have been killed by terrorists since <e> <s> if that is correct does it not suggest that it is necessary for the government to take more determined action to protect innocent people in this part of the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords as a layman i intervene in this debate with considerable trepidation <e> <s> i listened carefully to the arguments in favour of the amendment put forward with great eloquence and ingenuity by the noble lords lord irvine lord hutchinson and lord mishcon <e> <s> but i must confess that i did not find them wholly persuasive <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that broadly reassuring reply <e> <s> is it correct that this organism related to that unsatisfactory creature the liver fluke has spread rapidly in norwegian rivers since and is now affecting at least rivers and that scientists are still not certain how it spreads <e> <s> is he aware that the norwegian authorities have found that the only way to control it effectively is the drastic measure of removing all the hosts that is poisoning all the fish in a river system with rotenone <e>", "<cs> my lords is it correct that this parasite can also live on rainbow trout <e> <s> if that is so is there a danger of it spreading through the movement of live trout in europe <e>", "<cs> my lords while acknowledging and paying tribute to the efforts that the severn tidal power group is making to deal with environmental problems including the problem of the passage of migratory fish through any barrage is the noble viscount aware of the scientific work undertaken in the united states which suggests that fish passing through kaplan turbines of the kind planned on the severn barrage have an instantaneous mortality rate of between per cent <e> <s> and per cent <e> <s> and that per cent <e> <s> of salmon smolts passing through such turbines lose to per cent <e> <s> of their scales moreover that per cent <e> <s> of those that survive have gross or microscopic lesions <e> <s> in the light of that knowledge will the noble viscount ask those responsible to consider very carefully alternatives to migratory fish passing downstream through the turbines such as the establishment of free gaps at each end of the barrage <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble baroness for her reply though naturally i am disappointed by it <e> <s> if she were to come to wales to see the oakwoods that the noble baroness lady white and i know and to see the crowds of sheep in them she would understand the thinking behind the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble baroness both for what she said at the end of her remarks and even more for what she said at the beginning <e> <s> if the government have no quarrel with my intention in seeking to apply section of the agriculture act to northern ireland then i am confident that the noble baroness and her colleagues will find a way of achieving that objective <e> <s> i am glad that the government share my wish to see that balancing provision extended to northern ireland <e> <s> in the light <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble baroness for what she has said and glad that the government emphasise the great importance of proper advice if this scheme is to work well <e> <s> i am sorry that the noble baroness cannot give us an estimate of the numbers who will be required for this scheme but i have noted her remark that the numbers will be adequate <e> <s> of course i accept that assurance <e> <s> i am also glad that she confirms that adas will be the first point of contact for farmers wanting to come into the scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to find that i am a minority of one in supporting the broadleaves against the conifer <e> <s> in listening to some of the remarks made by noble lords i feel that it is worth emphasising that we are talking about farm woodlands and not about great forests <e> <s> i am in favour of mixed planting as was mentioned by the noble lord lord john-mackie <e> <s> it is obviously good practice to plant a nurse crop of larch when planting in many parts of the country <e> <s> i think that that is a sensible practice which everyone will support <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that the noble baroness lady nicol has raised this important problem this afternoon <e> <s> few in this house do more than she does to promote the cause of enlightened and sensible conservation <e>", "<cs> my lords we must all be grateful to the noble earl lord cranbrook for initiating this debate <e> <s> he speaks with great authority on these matters <e> <s> i am one of those privileged to sit under his chairmanship on the environment sub-committee <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that one factor which has strained relations in recent days has been the efforts by mr haughey and his colleagues to bring political influence to bear on the judicial system in this country <e> <s> does he not agree that it is regrettable that so many of them should have made statements suggesting that they know better than the lord chief justice and his colleagues in the court of appeal about the culpability of convicted persons in the united kingdom <e> <s> on extradition can the minister tell us how many persons have been extradited from the republic on terrorist charges since the agreement was signed and whether now that mr haugheys government have raised new obstacles to extradition it will be impossible to extradite terrorists in future even if the papers are drawn up by the archangel gabriel <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with great interest and attention to the speech of the noble viscount lord brookeborough who comes to us from fermanagh and introduces into our debates a valuable sense of reality <e> <s> i think the facts and figures that he has given us are very useful indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords listening to this debate i do not think i am alone in feeling some slight bewilderment about what the governments policy on forestry now is <e> <s> i hope that the minister will with his customary lucidity make it all clear <e>", "<cs> my lords the bbc is such a vast organisation that the ordinary listener and viewer who is busy with other things can form no more than a snapshot impression of its outlook <e> <s> unquestionably there is a great deal in that output that is excellent <e> <s> the world service in my experience is mostly very good <e> <s> indeed perhaps i may ask the noble lord lord barnett whether he would consider making it available at reasonable hours for listeners in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that the subsidy that is being talked about for this project is simply that which is available to any shipyard in the united kingdom <e> <s> is it not also the case that it has been made available in many cases in the past and is not in any respect a special subsidy for this project <e> <s> that said does the minister not agree that if this turns out to be a viable project it will be very valuable for employment in belfast and for the economy of northern ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like briefly to make two points one a point of detail and one more general <e> <s> i start with the point of detail <e> <s> in his notable speech the noble viscount lord watkinson described the proposed arrangements as personal payment for personal services <e> <s> the noble lord lord pym called it a switch from a tax on property to a tax on people <e> <s> the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby for his part said that rates were done for <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the tagging of smolts has shown that salmon heading for welsh rivers as well as scottish <e>", "<cs> are endangered by the fishery <e> <s> does he recall that the irish report to which he referred pointed out that drift netting off ireland is putting at risk other nations stocks <e> <s> will he therefore take every opportunity to raise this matter with the irish government at ministerial level in dublin brussels and elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may first declare a very modest financial interest in that my wife has a small number of shares in rowntree and a family interest <e> <s> my wife is half a rowntree <e> <s> her father george harris was the man who picked up this company when it was almost on the rocks in the s built it up into a great british company and originated many of the brands such as black magic kit kat and aero which have made the company so attractive to foreign predators today <e>", "<cs> i should like first to say that i am very grateful to all members of the committee who have supported my amendments <e> <s> i am very much encouraged by the reply which the minister gave on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> all anglers in england and wales will be delighted to know that the government accept the substance of our proposals <e> <s> of course the government know better than i what the precise wording should be but i think that it will be very good <e>", "<cs> my lords i should just like to say a brief word about this amendment <e> <s> first perhaps i may thank her majestys government especially the noble earl lord caithness and his right honourable friend for bringing forward this amendment which meets the substance of the case which i raised on second reading and in committee <e> <s> from what i have heard from many fishermen and from many fishing organisations since the committee stage it is clear that there is an enormous welcome among anglers all over the country for the change which is being brought about <e> <s> we are all extremely grateful to the government for making it so <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to say a few brief words about two aspects of this matter first the way in which this legislation is being introduced for northern ireland and secondly the substance of the order <e> <s> on the first point two days ago there were widespread protests in another place from many parts of that house about the introduction of this change by order in council rather than by a bill <e> <s> i think those protests were justified despite the technical reasons which the minister mentioned in his speech <e> <s> i was very interested to hear what the noble lord lord colnbrook who speaks with great authority on these matters has just had to say on this <e>", "<cs> my lords there can i think be no doubt that in many areas the policies of the present government have been remarkably successful for example in increasing the general level of prosperity in reducing the previously excessive power of the big unions and above all perhaps in giving the people of this country a new sense of pride and confidence <e> <s> in one field however there has unhappily been less progress <e> <s> that is the area of law and order <e>", "<cs> my lords some six years ago when i was serving as high commissioner in canada i saw a report that the canadian broadcasting corporation which has a role in canada very much like that of the bbc in this country was planning to broadcast an interview with gerry adams <e> <s> i immediately telephoned a senior man in the cbc to say that i had been greatly surprised to see this report that i found it hard to believe that if it was true i thought that perhaps those responsible could <e>", "<cs> my lords what i said was that i regretted that it had not been found possible to extend it in that way <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble and learned lord for that answer <e> <s> did he see the letters published in <e>", "<cs> my lords i too hope that the noble baroness lady nicol will soon be back among us <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have already told the minister i must first apologise to him and to the house that owing to a dinner engagement i may possibly have to leave before the end of the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord brooks of tremorfa has given the house a clear and helpful explanation of what the promoters of this bill have in mind in bringing it forward <e> <s> i warmly welcome the development of cardiff docklands and harbour <e> <s> long ago i knew cardiff docks as a sailor but as we know in recent years the whole area has become derelict and it is very good news that it is being restored to life <e>", "<cs> my lords i propose to speak very briefly having put my name to this amendment because i believe that a declaration of this kind should be simple clear and unambiguous <e> <s> if our amendment is accepted as i hope it will be part b of the two forms will be absolutely clear <e> <s> i do not believe that there is anyone in these islands who can be in doubt about what acts of terrorism mean when connected with the affairs of northern ireland <e> <s> the declaration simply requires someone to say <e>", "<cs> my lords this bill is a vast improvement on the governments original proposals <e> <s> on that the present secretary of state for the environment and perhaps also the noble lord lord nugent should be congratulated <e> <s> the national rivers authority is an admirable concept <e> <s> i think that the government have got it per cent <e> <s> right <e> <s> the appointment of a former secretary of state as its chairman shows the importance that the government attach to it and we listened with great attention to the important and generally encouraging speech he made this afternoon <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment moved by my noble friend <e> <s> a scientific advisory council might for example play a valuable part in overseeing the work of fishery scientists employed by the nra <e> <s> fishery scientists at present employed by welsh water have done excellent work in wales <e> <s> it is important that after the nra is set up that work should be co-ordinated with the work of the scientists working for the ministry of agriculture fisheries and foods and with those in scotland employed by the department of agriculture and fisheries for scotland <e>", "<cs> i am naturally disappointed by what the minister has said i was reminded of a cartoon by the immortal pont which had the caption <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment <e> <s> a number of functions which the nra will have to take on may require substantial capital expenditure other than for flood defences <e> <s> for example an opportunity may arise to construct a regulating reservoir or the flow in a river may alter for some reason and require the construction of such a reservoir <e> <s> there may be a plan by the plcs to build a reservoir for water supply purposes which the nra may want to add to or amend in some degree so that the reservoir could also serve as part of its water resources policy <e>", "<cs> i wish to give my strong support to the general thrust of the amendment for the same reason as the noble earl lord radnor <e> <s> the problem of acidification is extremely serious <e> <s> a large area of upland mid-wales where i live has been affected by acidification it has had a damaging effect on the fisheries there <e> <s> a number of lakes and the upper reaches of many rivers are now biologically dead <e> <s> there are no fish in them no invertebrates and consequently birds like dippers have disappeared <e>", "<cs> my lords earlier this afternoon when the house was debating the report on private bill procedure the noble lord the chairman of committees said that the number of private bills which were coming before the house was already reaching and had perhaps passed saturation point <e> <s> i believe that one of the reasons for that is the fact that barrages are all the rage at the moment <e> <s> there are a great number projected all around the estuaries <e>", "<cs> i should like to say a word about amendment no <e> <s> a which stands in my name and which is grouped in this series of amendments <e> <s> before i do so i should like to say that i fully support amendment no <e> <s> moved by the noble earl lord cranbrook and amendment no <e> <s> za in the name <e>", "<cs> i support what the noble earl lord radnor has said particularly as regards the cutting of weeds <e> <s> i wish to mention one problem that seems to raise a general issue <e> <s> it has been represented to me concerning weed cutting in the deeper waters of the river frome in dorset <e> <s> i made inquiries because i was told that riparian owners found that wessex water would not cut the weeds so that they grew all over the river and effectively prevented people from fishing <e> <s> in addition the water authority would not allow riparian owners to cut the weeds <e> <s> i inquired about this through the water authorities association and after making inquiries with wessex water i was told by the association that in the deeper waters weed cutting takes place in the autumn which is reckoned to be the most cost-effective time <e> <s> that is the point i wish to ask about <e> <s> wessex water said <e>", "<cs> i give my strong support to these amendments <e> <s> at second reading i supported what the noble lord lord mason of barnsley said about sampling and the private rights of prosecution <e> <s> i believe that he was speaking then largely on behalf of the anglers co-operative association which has played a notable part over the years in supporting riparian owners to use their common law rights to have unpolluted water passing by <e> <s> long before most of the rest of us were really concerned with pollution the aca was fighting very successfully to prevent the pollution of a number of our rivers <e> <s> its firm view is that if the government are endorsing the principle of private prosecutions which i believe they are they must give the general public the opportunity to have available proper evidence on which to base such prosecutions <e> <s> that means that there must be formal samples on the public register <e> <s> without such samples prosecutions cannot be brought <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful for that assurance <e> <s> in the light of what the noble earl has said i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to study in <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl sits down perhaps i may ask him what the position is as regards licences of right issued before about which i am not entirely clear <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble earl <e> <s> i should also like to read the <e>", "<cs> i should like to express my support for this amendment <e> <s> i mentioned the problems concerning the river kennet on second reading and i think that they are quite serious <e> <s> in my view this amendment is a good deal better than the amendment tabled in my name amendment no <e> <s> a which has in fact been grouped with it <e> <s> i think that this amendment is to be preferred <e>", "<cs> i should just like to make one small but important point as regards amendment no <e> <s> tabled in the name of the noble lord lord norrie <e> <s> on second reading i said that all the angling organisations thought anglers ought to be given more say in such matters <e> <s> i agree very much with what the noble lord lord gibson-watt has just said in this respect <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness sits down may i ask her whether she could very kindly consider the point i made about the small regional <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the minister for her reply <e> <s> we both seem to be seeking streamlining of the procedure but seem to be at odds on the way that is to be achieved <e> <s> i should like to take further advice on the matter but at this stage i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for her reply although a little disappointed by it <e> <s> however in view of her assurance that the government are prepared to review the problem in the fullness of time i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for what the minister has said about the vat question and i look forward to hearing from her about that in due course <e> <s> i am sorry to hear that my amendment is defective <e> <s> it was designed to be helpful to the nra and to try to simplify procedures which i am told are cumbersome and vexatious <e> <s> i very much hope therefore that the government will consider this point between now and report stage and perhaps will be able to bring in their own amendment to cover this point and help the nra <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the minister for that very full reply <e> <s> i am afraid that we are rather talking about two separate matters <e> <s> i have been concerned as the noble lord lord mcintosh was about the problem of the t-nets and the feeling of a great many angling interests that they were wrong and that what the minister was trying to do was a mistake <e> <s> the procedure which exists at the moment was successfully invoked to stop that <e> <s> however the minister has been talking about the problem of fishery rates which is quite a separate matter <e> <s> on that i am entirely with her <e> <s> the last thing i want to do is to make any difficulties about it <e> <s> i wish to think about this further and to study her reply <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the minister for his reply <e> <s> i am delighted to hear that premises does cover land <e> <s> i should like to take further advice on the other point because i am not clear from his reply whether the problem of unmanned sites has been adequately covered <e> <s> subject to that reservation i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> in the light of what the minister has said i see that there is a dilemma <e> <s> i am content with what he suggests <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> with the committees permission perhaps i may add that it is not merely a problem with canoes on the wye <e> <s> there is a problem there but there is a problem on many other rivers <e> <s> i shall not bother the committee by giving their names but it is a general problem <e> <s> it is not confined to the wye <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the minister for his reply <e> <s> his prediction about my reaction is i am afraid correct because i think it means that the nra will be able to control boating on the wye below glazebury bridge but not above it which seems to me to be a somewhat absurd situation <e> <s> i shall have to consider this is due course and see where we go from here <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome very much the governments amendment no <e> <s> which is in line with what i ventured to suggest when i spoke at second reading <e> <s> i put my name to the group of amendments moved so capably by the noble baroness lady nicol primarily because i believe that sssis should be included with the other two categories that the government have designated national parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> on reading the relevant clause on page of the bill it seems to me that the case for it is overwhelming because the nra staff will be required when looking at land associated with inland and coastal waters to conserve and enhance their natural beauty and amenity and to promote their use for recreational purposes <e> <s> it seems to me extraordinary that subsection b should be restricted in a way in which subsections a and c are not <e> <s> to my mind it would be absurd that an nra conservation officer for example when dealing with land associated with inland and coastal waters should be required to conserve a kingfisher because it is dependent on an aquatic environment <e> <s> but not a pied flycatcher on that land because it is not <e> <s> i hope that the government will listen to what has been said from all quarters of the house and will accept this sensible amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i was one of the many noble lords who raised the question of land disposal on second reading <e> <s> i warmly welcomed the amendment put forward by the government to create protected areas <e> <s> i also supported the amendment proposed by the noble baroness lady nicol to include sssis <e> <s> i am glad that the government have agreed to make that change in the bill <e> <s> i believe that it is most important <e>", "<cs> my lords i am seriously disturbed by this amendment <e> <s> it seems to me that in an effort to protect the plcs from criminal actions based on the quality of sewage effluents before vesting the government are giving them under this amendment complete immunity over a period of at least months <e> <s> that seems to me to be wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords employment is a serious problem in all parts of ireland and has been for a long time <e> <s> my grandfather moved to yorkshire from ireland after he qualified as a doctor because he found that there were jobs for only per cent <e> <s> of those who qualified as doctors in ireland at that time <e>", "<cs> my lords all of us would wish to thank the committee very much for their work in considering this question <e> <s> i read through the whole of the transcript of its hearings and it is clear that the noble lord lord elibank and his colleagues went into all aspects of the problem over many days with great care and thoroughness <e> <s> we must all be very grateful to them <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that answer <e> <s> is he aware that between and miles of rivers in wales had to be downgraded from class to class because of the effects of acidification many lakes have also been affected and that the economic loss to fisheries in wales as a result of acidification has been estimated by the welsh water authority as between million and million with a potential loss of between million and million <e> <s> in may the noble earl lord arran told the house that conifer afforestation can contribute to acidification of rivers and lakes and increases its effects notably the concentration in streams of toxic aluminium which kills the fish and may also be a hazard to human health <e> <s> therefore does the minister agree that afforestation by conifers in the welsh uplands ought now to be curtailed and that in the light of the communique issued after the paris summit the welsh office should pay more attention to environmental factors than it has done hitherto <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the uncertainties mentioned by the minister would it not be prudent to err in the direction of caution <e> <s> will the minister tell the house whether it is possible to ensure that salmon farms in scotland use sterile fish triploids or whatever so that when fish escape there is no possibility of them mating with wild stocks <e>", "<cs> my lords i was very glad to take part as a member of the environmental sub-committee in this exceptionally interesting and important investigation in which we were very capably guided by our chairman the noble earl lord cranbrook and greatly helped by our specialist adviser mr robin grove-white and our clerk mr tom mohan <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has a point and the common agricultural policy has certainly contributed to the loss <e> <s> that loss is in fact accelerating at present <e> <s> we have our system of sites of special scientific interest but the noble baroness lady nicol has spoken about that and as the nature conservancy council has pointed out of them were recently damaged or destroyed in a single year <e> <s> there is continuing damage to habitats dramatically illustrated in the royal society for nature conservation review <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to speak briefly today about a quite different matter security policy in northern ireland <e> <s> although when talking about northern ireland the present secretary of state recently referred rather surprisingly to cyprus i believe that as northern ireland is part of the united kingdom it is appropriate to raise the subject in this part of our debate on the address dealing with home affairs <e> <s> what i wish to do is to ask the government for enlightenment on how they propose to achieve the objective set out in the gracious speech in the section on northern ireland which refers to the defeat of terrorism <e> <s> i have given the noble baroness notice of the essential question that i want to ask <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that in many parts of the united kingdom especially wales the wildlife interest of common land is damaged by the use of the open hill by motorcycles particularly motorcycle clubs and four-wheel drive vehicles <e> <s> will he ensure that when legislation is introduced it covers the use of vehicles and prevents vehicles being used except in special circumstances off the road on common land <e>", "<cs> my lords do the government propose to take advantage of the forthcoming visit of the new president of brazil to discuss this problem with him <e>", "<cs> my lords there can be no doubt that there is an urgent need for better and more effective environmental protection in this small overpopulated grossly contaminated country of ours but we are not holding the line <e> <s> on the contrary environmental damage much of it irreversible is being inflicted on our countryside our coasts estuaries uplands wetlands heaths and downs every week <e> <s> what has been happening has been spelt out in the paper published by the royal society for nature conservation <e>", "<cs> my lords this debate is taking place in the shadow of the severe losses of trees caused by recent gales <e> <s> immediately after those gales i walked around our tiny hill farm in wales and saw the sad sight of fine oaks which had been blown down <e> <s> others have suffered much more <e> <s> for example the famous selbourne hanger has been devastated <e> <s> we all have to set to and replant <e>", "<cs> my lords i propose to comment on only three aspects of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords is the welsh office yet in a position to respond to the conclusions of a seminar which was held in april by the environmental study group of the prince of wales committee under my chairmanship which studied coastal and estuarial development in wales <e> <s> is the noble viscount aware that the committee concluded that local planning mechanisms were not adequate to reconcile social economic and environmental questions and that it suggested that there should be strategic regional guidance from the welsh office <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the minister is aware that in the past three years there has been an almost complete failure of breeding by certain species of birds in the area <e> <s> that appears to be associated with the catastrophic decline in the number of sandeels <e> <s> while the research which the noble lord has just mentioned is taking place i warmly welcome that research would it not be wise to suspend commercial fishing from next year until the cause of the catastrophic decline is known <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for his reply i am especially grateful for the fact that he said he would consider the suggestion made by the noble lord lord crickhowell <e> <s> i too will study carefully in <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment <e> <s> the noble lord lord lucas of chilworth has put the case clearly and comprehensively there is not much for me to add <e>", "<cs> my lords is it the case that a report by the nature conservancy council and outside consultants has estimated that the re-organisation will require an extra permanent posts in order to deliver the same amount of nature conservation work as is available now <e> <s> is the minister further aware that if statutory obligations are to be fulfilled an extra posts will be needed <e> <s> will he consider placing this report if it exists in the library of the house <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord ross of newport said that this was a probing amendment as regards the general principle of part vii of the bill <e> <s> therefore i should like to ask the minister one question <e> <s> can he tell us at this early stage of the committee proceedings what the governments proposals will cost <e> <s> i believe that two days ago the noble baroness lady david asked a question in order to elicit that information <e> <s> however the answer seemed to tell us very little <e> <s> in my view when this chamber considers the governments proposals it is very important that we should know what they will cost <e> <s> it is an essential part of the matter <e> <s> at present we have reports and we have heard rumours but we have had no authoritative statement of what the proposals will cost <e> <s> i hope that the minister will cover that point in his reply <e>", "<cs> i was a member of the carver committee <e> <s> i should like briefly to support two of its recommendations which are reflected in this group of amendments <e> <s> the first is that the remit of the joint committee should extend to countryside and landscape conservation <e> <s> that seems to me to be common sense <e> <s> it would be absurd if the two representatives from the countryside council for wales who would be representing under the governments proposals an integrated organisation were to have to come to the joint committee divest themselves of their countryside functions and consider problems only from a nature conservation point of view <e> <s> it is important as the committee recommended that the remit should be extended <e>", "<cs> although i sympathise with the objectives of the noble lord lord graham of edmonton in moving this amendment i share the doubts expressed by the noble baroness lady white about the second of the two amendments <e>", "<cs> i too support the amendments and agree with what was said by the noble baroness lady david and the noble lord lord shackleton <e> <s> it is profoundly unsatisfactory that the governments scheme which was announced a long time ago should now be before the committee when we have no idea what it will cost because the government will not tell us <e> <s> with great restraint the carver committee said that it would be considerably more expensive <e> <s> however the committee was not in a position to judge how much more expensive it would be <e> <s> only the government can know that <e>", "<cs> i shall be very brief <e> <s> the noble earl lord swinton has put the case for the amendment very eloquently <e> <s> as someone who lives in wales i congratulate him <e> <s> he should now regard himself as an honorary welshman like myself <e> <s> something on these lines is a valuable addition to the bill <e> <s> i hope very much that the government will accept the amendment or something very much like it <e>", "<cs> i should like to give my strong support to the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey on this amendment <e> <s> it is extremely important that the countryside commission and the countryside council for wales should have those powers <e> <s> there is a good deal of unlawful building on commons certainly in my part of wales <e> <s> the open spaces society had identified two cases in powys and there may be many more <e> <s> it is very important that the point should be covered <e> <s> if there is a defect in the amendment as the noble earl lord peel has suggested i am sure that it can be corrected because if is obviously important that the wording is correct <e> <s> in general i support the amendment very strongly <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the minister for that reply <e> <s> can she confirm that the national farmers union has been pressing for over years for the manufacturers of compound feeds for livestock to be obliged to show the specific ingredients on the bag <e> <s> does she agree that it is unfortunate that we have taken no action during that period and that we now have to wait a further months for the community to take action before the directive is brought into force <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> does he consider it illogical and unsatisfactory that the british government having played a full part in negotiating the unesco agreement on illicit and illegal trade in antiquities in and having signed that agreement should still not have ratified it <e> <s> the agreement would surely help to prevent the illegal export of antiquities such as the romano-british hoard from icklingham in suffolk and help to get them back <e> <s> it would also demonstrate that the government are serious in tackling the problem of illegal exports and imports of
