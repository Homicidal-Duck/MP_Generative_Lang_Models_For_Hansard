lordships from the noble and learned lord who sits on the woolsack it would seem to me that i should be wasting your lordships time by expressing any further views certainly on the history which he has developed so ably or even on the facts of this particular case <e> <s> i had intended to say a few words to the noble lord lord de clifford to try to persuade him that the position was not as he had seen it that the failure to pass the bill of the noble baroness lady wootton did not deal with this matter of principle and therefore that the noble lord should not vote against the bill which i have the privilege of presenting to your lordships <e> <s> after the speech of the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor i hope that lord de clifford will allow this bill to go through without dividing the house on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i spoke on this matter at the committee stage when i was very much moved by the realistic problems which the noble lord lord lucas of chilworth pointed out in regard to domestic car owners and their insurance companies <e> <s> as i am strongly in favour and am strongly supporting the governments proposals about car-sharing it seems to me as i said at committee stage that it is an important social matter to have the position of the average domestic owner of a car who indulges in car-sharing clearly set out <e>", "<cs> my lords i raised this matter at second reading <e> <s> within my own experience i know of operators in the west of england and also in the area of the lake district who find this problem about longdistance operators coming into an area and doing local work in that area a very real one <e> <s> the noble lord lord teviot said that he was disappointed about the ministers reply <e> <s> i join with him in that but i should like to add a word or two which i hope the minister will not find offensive <e> <s> it seemed to me that the brief that he had to read about the possible operation of these operators was somewhat naive in the circumstances where people find themselves in tourist areas where people come from long distances and where the buses stay there for a week or so <e> <s> i am sorry that the minister is not supporting this improvement as i see it in the amendment put by the noble lord lord underhill <e> <s> if lord underhill takes a particular step i will support him <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships will not find it strange that i should be supporting these amendments because the suggestions came from my noble friend lord simon <e> <s> he has asked me to apologise that he is unable to be in his place today or tomorrow if the discussions continue tomorrow <e> <s> i too must apologise because i shall be unable to be present then because i have been committed for several months to an engagement at lunch-time in cardiff <e> <s> unfortunately i cannot cut it at this late stage <e>", "<cs> i am much obliged my lords <e> <s> that is another inefficiency of our organisation on these benches <e> <s> i did not have that copy <e> <s> i do not want to complain continually but i have been surprised that copies of <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged for the apology but i have not received a single letter in regard to any matter on the transport bill <e> <s> that seems to be an oversight on the part of the government and i am grateful for the apology <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of what the noble lord has said may i change my attitude and thank the noble lord for not sending me a copy of his letter <e> <s> i really feel that if the government are so obscure in their attitude towards these benches i was really dealing with many matters on that occasion and i ought to be grateful to him for not increasing my fan mail so much <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely support the views of the government on this matter because there seems to be something rather odd if one enters into a timeless licence <e> <s> this entering into commitments for perpetuity seems to me basically wrong <e> <s> i would not have intervened at this stage had i not wanted to remind the house that that was the view taken by the noble lord lord lucas at the committee stage and as he is not in his place at the moment i thought i would raise the point <e> <s> it does not seem to me to be a matter of being well balanced <e> <s> it seems to me a serious defect in this amendment that perpetuity in regard to the licence is introduced <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much sympathise with what the noble lord lord nugent of guildford has just said <e> <s> with his great experience in local authority matters his word must carry a great deal of weight <e> <s> but while we all support these trial areas as an experiment what i have not yet gathered in the course of the debate is what kind of investment is involved in this trial area experiment <e> <s> if in some areas the amount of investment is very small it is quite likely as the noble lord lord bellwin said at committee stage that the experiment may fall on its face or be a disaster <e> <s> therefore in considering the minimum period for this designation area what amount of investment is likely to be involved <e> <s> i understand that it is difficult to give a general answer to that and no doubt the minister has had discussions and has some informal views as to the quantity of the investment required <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say quite briefly that i endorse the words of the noble lord lord underhill <e> <s> in my view this is a constructive amendment and it seems to me to be common sense <e> <s> if an experiment is to be undertaken in a particular area there should be a limited period in which it should be capable of being carried out <e> <s> it seems to me therefore that to put a limit of five years on any order which can be made is eminently reasonable <e>", "<cs> my lords when we are considering this part of the bill we must always remember that we are dealing with a new experiment <e> <s> these are new ideas the object of which is to encourage private enterprise not only so that entrepreneurs may make money but in order to ensure that the community at large through the efforts of the entrepreneurs will be assisted in their local activities by being able to move around in their area and have the advantages of transport amenities <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may also say that i am very surprised that the noble lord lord teviot with his great experience in these matters and who knows so much about rowdy situations on buses should think that such a badge is so important <e> <s> if it is important in a particular area where there is trouble surely the operator can supply him with that badge <e> <s> i have found this very difficult to understand <e> <s> when this matter was raised on the question whether the clause shall stand part <e> <s> the noble lord lord bellwin indicated that he was quite surprised at some of the points made by the noble lord lord underhill <e> <s> of course i have to be very careful because the noble lord lord teviot has the right to reply on this matter and perhaps he has not got the experience of replying that the noble lord lord bellwin has in these matters <e> <s> but it seems to me that it is an interesting point <e> <s> it is delightful to hear the noble lord lord teviot but i should have thought that this was not a matter which required much attention in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down with the leave of the house may i ask him <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the noble lord lord underhill on this amendment and to endorse all the arguments that he has made in favour of it <e> <s> i have had the advantage with the help of a member of the railways board of tracing the whole history of the law in this matter <e> <s> as the noble lord lord underhill has indicated the law at the present time is that the railways board cannot carry passengers by road except where a railway service has been temporarily interrupted or discontinued <e> <s> that law goes right back about years ago <e> <s> i think it was an act of about that started all this off and it has been endorsed all through the history of the law up to the present time to prevent the railways board from showing any initiative in relation to adopting encouraging or helping their passengers to transfer themselves from place to place <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a third time <e>", "<cs> my lords i have noted what the noble lord lord mancroft has been good enough to say regarding the procedures and some difficulties he has experienced in regard to private members bills in another place <e> <s> as he will appreciate the present bill is not a private members bill but a private bill promoted by two persons from outside parliament <e> <s> the bills with which he has apparently had problems in the other place and of course i cannot comment in any way on procedures in another place have arisen on the initiative of members of parliament and therefore are dealt with by quite different procedures <e>", "<cs> my lords i sympathise strongly with the noble lord lord underhill when he emphasises the aspect of safety <e> <s> this matter was discussed before <e> <s> i believe that the noble lord lord bellwin indicated that lord underhill had moved his amendment with vigour and i understood therefore that there was going to be some communication between the noble lord lord bellwin and the noble lord lord underhill in this matter <e> <s> therefore for the position of clarification for myself as concerned with these benches may i ask whether there was any letter or explanation on this important matter of safety which was passed to the noble lord lord underhill by the department of which the minister is in charge <e> <s> if so i feel that a copy should have come to us <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble viscount says he has done everything he can do in south wales regarding these matters does he include in that giving men who want to work space where they can work at low rents <e> <s> in the area of south wales which i know so well the difficulty quite frequently arises that men who have been made redundant sometimes with large sums of money want to work but they cannot find the necessary space in which to carry on their constructive activities <e>", "<cs> my lords may i briefly but i hope cogently support the purposes and objectives of this amendment which has been moved so eloquently by the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> i emphasise as he has done that this is not a political amendment <e> <s> when this matter came up at the committee stage i had prepared a very good speech but the noble lord lord selsdon spoke so eloquently in relation to his amendment and told us about the interest of his family in relation to these pensioners and in the railway business that my speech was lost to posterity because i did not think it was worth while wasting your lordships time with it <e> <s> unfortunately on friday th june i was unable to be present here for which i have previously apologised to the house therefore i missed the speech of the noble lord lord morris <e>", "<cs> my lords i must first apologise that i was not present when the noble lord the minister introduced this order <e> <s> i do not think i should have intervened in this debate had i not attended this morning a memorial service for the late sir charles goodeve at which the noble lord lord sherfield made one of the most interesting and sympathetic addresses at the memorial service that i have heard <e> <s> he related his address to the innovations and inventions that sir charles goodeve had introduced to the admiralty how he had fought <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble earl lord mansfield for being a little late in coming in <e> <s> i therefore missed the initial part of his speech <e> <s> however any order which has the support of the noble lord lord wynne-jones has my support particularly in these matters <e> <s> i must <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to interrupt the noble earl <e> <s> is he saying that the forestry commission is not at all concerned with these orders <e>", "<cs> my lords i have sat here for an hour and a half and listened with fascination but in silence to this very interesting debate but in view of the fact that this is an amendment for which my noble friend lord mackie of benshie has great enthusiasm i really must say a few words <e> <s> in case your lordships feel that i am about to embark upon a long speech on this matter i must express my gratitude to the noble lord lord ross of marnock for the way he introduced this amendment <e> <s> he said that he agreed with and supported the enthusiasm of the noble lord lord mackie for this amendment and therefore in view of his great support and his emotional appeal that at last at the end of the day the government should accept an important amendment of this kind i <e>", "<cs> my lords may i on behalf of those who do sit on these three benches also associate myself with the tributes which have been paid to the staff <e> <s> i should like to say how well we are always served here by staff at all levels and particularly during these last few weeks when it has been most noticeable what great service we have had at all times <e>", "<cs> my lords i declare an interest in that i am a small shareholder in the vosper company <e> <s> will not the minister agree that it is a basic principle of conservatism that where a gross unfairness is recognised the government have a discretion to give relief in such a circumstance <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister assure us that the british consortium to which he referred will arrange for the manufcature of this equipment to be in the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join the noble lord lord todd in congratulating the noble lord lord gregson on leading his team which was selected from the select committee of your lordships house on science and technology and on producing this report <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord lord gregson and the noble lord lord todd will not mind my mentioning at this early stage what a great help in preparing this report they had from paul

stepparents and their stepchildren and for connected purposes <e> <s> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to require every

contributed to this interesting debate which the noble lord the minister has said is a very important matter <e> <s> i should like to thank the noble lord lord underhill for his support <e> <s> he is of all noble lords the most expert in these matters as the one-time national agent of the great party to which he belongs <e> <s> i think that he paid a great tribute to the bill for which i thank him

support very strongly what the noble lord lord swinfen has said <e> <s> he said that every encouragement should be given particularly to small producers who can use water power in this way <e> <s> i approach this matter somewhat in a spirit of nostalgia because i remember going as a boy to a small farm in wales where an uncle of mine was using the waters of a stream to produce electricity for his cowshed <e> <s> he was considered in that local area the depths of west wales to be something of a witch doctor in being able to produce light out of water with a little bit of iron in between <e> <s> therefore i too should like briefly to support the amendment moved by the noble lord lord strathcona and mount royal <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the noble earl <e> <s> when with the leave of the committee i spoke to amendment no <e> <s> i would have spoken to no <e> <s> as well but on the marshalled list i have the noble earl lord gowrie down to more that amendment <e> <s> i do not know whether the noble earl wishes to clarify the position on that now <e> <s> in any event having regard to what he said i beg leave to withdraw amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> unless there are views held by the government about which i have not thought i support the amendment <e> <s> it seems inappropriate to say the least that into a bill of this kind a levy should be introduced which is half that proposed by the united nations <e> <s> the attitudes on this particularly on the part of developing countries is quite understandable in the circumstances and i therefore support the amendment <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether it might be helpful to the government if i were to make a few observations on a matter which i believe is under consideration by the law commission at the present time in an area of law which is well known to some that is the law relating to confidential information <e> <s> there is quite a jurisdiction now in regard to the kinds of action which can be taken against people who disclose information which is confidential <e> <s> i have experience of that only in the cases where the information is of a technical nature that is of scientific and technological nature or where the confidential information constitutes know-how <e> <s> i wonder whether the government wish to be quite so severe in an act of this kind which cannot come into force for years as would appear from the somewhat stern terms of clause <e> <s> therefore i would support the general theme put forward by the noble lord lord kennet in his amendment <e>", "<cs> having regard to the observations of the minister on my amendments nos <e> <s> and he said that he would consider whether conditions should be set down by the secretary of state in granting exploration or exploitation licences to applicants he said also that he would look into the question of the definition of safety and also the definition of personal injury <e> <s> it may be helpful to the minister if i say that this is the clause which appears to give some difficulty because in subsection it defines personal injury to include any impairment of a persons physical or mental condition <e> <s> in subsection of the same clause it refers to the fatal accidents acts and also uses the words personal injury <e>", "<cs> i am very much obliged to the noble earl <e> <s> that is all i was commenting about <e>", "<cs> if i may speak again i am very much obliged to the noble lord lord campbell <e> <s> there is a misprint in the marshalled list as published today <e> <s> i put down an amendment in the terms of

fully about it <e> <s> there <e>", "<cs> i am a little surprised that while we are still as i understand it talking on whether clause shall stand part of the bill the minister should be kind enough to advise me in advance that he will resist amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> having regard to the undertakings and the assurances that he gave earlier i do not propose to press this matter at this stage but will wait until a later time in order to raise it <e>", "<cs> may i join the increasing number of noble lords who are agreeing with the noble baroness lady birk this evening and say that we on these benches support her <e> <s> i must apologise that <e>", "<cs> i have some sympathy with that part of amendment no <e> <s> moved by the noble lord lord mottistone which is notified in the marshalled list as a <e> <s> the clause as it now stands seems to indicate that the government without meaning to may be entering into the field which is objectionable to industry that use for agriculture and for forestry shall become subject to planning control <e>", "<cs> as a matter of personal explanation may i say that i was only concerning myself with one small point out of the many points submitted by the noble lord lord mottistone <e> <s> i was encouraged to make that observation in view of the remarks of the minister who said that of course the government had no intention of introducing planning into agricultural operations and i merely asked why that should not be made quite clear in this clause <e>", "<cs> i hesitate to intervene but on this one point relating to pipeline easements may i thank the noble lord very much <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl agree that it was tactless to say the least of it to announce the closure of so many pits in wales so as to cause further grave unemployment in that area at a time when the welsh coal industry has been slaughtered by the loss of coal to be used in the manufacture of steel <e> <s> what consultations took place with the welsh mining industry in relation to these grave problems in that area <e>", "<cs> my lords very briefly i share the anxieties of the noble lord lord ritchie-calder and agree with almost everything he

amendments that i introduced at the committee stage in regard to the safety of personnel <e> <s> at that stage i disclosed an interest that i am chairman of the institute of sports medicine <e> <s> i would not have raised these matters had i not in that capacity been closely concerned with postgraduate research in the prevention and treatment of soft tissue injuries arising <e>", "<cs> my lords since the noble earl the minister was good enough to mention my name i should like to say that i too am pleased with the amendment and shall support it <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are to be congratulated in bringing in this bill at this stage <e> <s> it will certainly show to the developing countries that this government like the american government are prepared to share the commercial results of this kind of deep sea mining <e> <s> the second count on which the government are to be congratulated is that they have accepted the general theme of the amendments that i proposed regarding the safety of personnel <e> <s> it brings to notice the great dangers to personnel arising from new industries which require individuals to go well below the sea level in their business activities <e> <s> i am very grateful to the government for accepting that amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i join the noble lord lord ponsonby in congratulating the minister on the comprehensive and lucid way in which he introduced this difficult bill <e> <s> i am looking forward to the maiden speech of the noble lord lord noel-buxton who has a family name which is extremely well-known in the history of politics and industry over the last century <e>", "<cs> at second reading i presumed to stress to your lordships how the government by introducing another bill on company law was further smudging and fudging the position as to company law in this country making it appallingly difficult for the average practitioner whether accountant solicitor or member of the bar to see his way through the jungle of present company law <e> <s> professional people have difficulty in dealing with company law let alone the employees of companies who are concerned with advising their boards of directors and shareholders as to the position <e> <s> i endorse many of the things the noble lord lord bruce has said <e> <s> there is in clause a radical departure on the presentation of accounts <e> <s> hitherto the way in which accounts have been presented was developed by professionals rather than by rules in a bill <e> <s> nevertheless the government have decided that this is the way in which they should proceed in the future <e> <s> may i suggest that their enthusiasm for harmonisation of british law with the so-called law of the european countries and the eec has rather carried them away

reference to a section from a previous act there is in parenthesis a very helpful phrase or sentence giving an indication as to what that section in the act refers to <e> <s> i wonder whether in this case it would be felt helpful for the government to insert in clauses and in parenthesis something that would give us a summary of what the old sections were dealing with in the way they have done with so many sections in this bill <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord the minister is writing to any member of this committee about matters on which i may not have intervened will he send a copy to me as well <e> <s> in order to expedite business on this bill i shall not intervene on many occasions therefore i should like to know what is going on <e>", "<cs> i am delighted to follow the noble baroness lady phillips on this theme <e> <s> i am also delighted to see that there is a division in the labour party on this important matter relating to small companies <e> <s> i am impressed by what the noble and learned lord lord mackay of clashfern says that this is an exemption of value to small companies <e> <s> on the other hand i have a little sympathy with the sub <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for that explanation but i am a little surprised that we are being so closely governed by directives of the eec on a matter of such consequence to the small companies of this country <e> <s> when i explained to the committee the position of a creditor and how the creditors position was safeguarded i should have added that i am advised that that is the position in switzerland <e> <s> i fully realise that switzerland is not a member of the eec <e> <s> in view of the statement made by the noble and learned lord i will endeavour to check whether that is the precise position and whether any amendment of the directive would be feasible if not now then later and in those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> as the noble and learned lord is assisting the noble lord lord bruce of donington to find things in the directive i wonder whether it would save time if at some stage convenient to the government they could let me know where is the objection in the directive to my amendment <e>", "<cs> with the leave of the committee i fully gathered that that was the position but i wondered whether it was possible to guide me to the exact passages in the directive on this matter <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord has emphasised that he has to have certain strict rules arising out of the exemptions which are set out in the directive <e> <s> the noble lord lord bruce indicated that even though it would appear that any amendment put to the committee could not be accepted by the government because of the terms of the directive there was some discretion in the matter by the government <e> <s> would it be convenient for the noble and learned lord to indicate the kind of discretion that the government can give in regard to certain exemptions such as the one i indicated about small companies recently <e>", "<cs> i expected somebody from the other side to point out to me that technicality <e> <s> i was coming to the point <e> <s> the real reason why i mentioned section <e>", "<cs> i am very much obliged for the helpful submission made by the noble lord lord mottistone <e> <s> i tried to explain that there was a technical difficulty in that the whole object of referring to section b was to refer to the previous amendment in order to define the scope <e> <s> i see the noble lord lord mottistone wishes to intervene <e> <s> i have given way to him on several occasions and so may i conclude <e> <s> the object of having this reference to clause b is merely to define the kind of small company which i have in mind <e>", "<cs> i apologise if i am taking up the time of the committee but i think i have made my point clear <e> <s> if the noble and learned lord the minister cares to take that technical point i shall be happy to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am very much obliged to the noble and learned lord <e> <s> i fully appreciated that he probably would not take a technical point of the order

i omitted to ask the leave of the committee to refer to no <e> <s> <e> <s> i have it in my notes but i forgot to mention it <e>", "<cs> i have listened with care great care to the brief which the noble lord lord lyell has read out and most of it seems on first hearing to be totally irrelevant to the matter with which i am concerned <e> <s> i am not concerned about unqualified auditors a

members and they are well-known internationally <e> <s> also i must again express surprise that no new institution has been allowed to enter this closed area of institutions which was set up in under the act and that is in itself surprising having regard to the competency of the members of the institution referred to by the noble lord lord energlyn <e>", "<cs> if i may i should like to support very briefly what the noble lord lord mottistone has had to say in moving this amendment <e>", "<cs> may i express my surprise at some of the observations made by the noble and learned lord in so far as i understood them <e> <s> the main objection he appears to have raised to this amendment is that the government find it very difficult to set up an administrative arrangement to decide whether one name is confusingly similar to another <e> <s> the government have such an administrative organisation the registrar of trademarks as part of his work is constantly considering with another procedure whether or not one word or trademark is confusingly similar to another <e> <s> i should have thought that in view of the serious attitude adopted by industry in relation to this matter the government could quite easily set up a simple procedure whereby by charging a fee they could arrange as they can do under the present law to have this matter referred to either the board of trade or the registrar of trademarks <e> <s> it merely involves some simple administrative arrangement <e>", "<cs> i am much obliged to have that support <e> <s> he indeed suggested that noble lords who were opposing the governments proposals were to use his words overlooking <e>", "<cs> this is a very important matter <e> <s> if your lordships applause means that you are unanimously in my support then i shall sit down immediately but i am not so sure that the applause was as great from the front benches of the government and it is to them and not to other members of the house that i am directing my attention <e>", "<cs> i do not propose to keep the committee much longer in view of the important business to follow particularly as when moving the amendment i addressed the committee at length <e> <s> the reply from the noble lord the minister once again emphasised that the government do not fully appreciate the value of the registrys function which i outlined <e> <s> we have talked about fees and administration <e> <s> the administration as was so ably pointed out by the noble baroness lady elliot of harwood can easily be done under modern technology which would save an awful lot of time trouble and staff <e> <s> i could not understand the ministers reference to certain figures but if i may detain the committee for a few moments more i understand that a number of new registrations in the registry of business names dealt with so ably by the registry in was of the order of <e> <s> that was an increment of about per cent <e> <s> over the previous year <e> <s> the number of changes

all i know is that they made in that year changes <e> <s> the registrar must have considered and indeed certainly did consider the large number of names that were on the register at that time he must have done in order to make those changes in relation to the new registrations <e> <s> again he issued copies of certificates there was an inspection of <e> <s> therefore the total activities in regard to copies of certificates and inspections were of the order of <e> <s> this is quite a large matter and therefore the operation of this business registry cannot be so difficult to administer as the noble lord has suggested <e> <s> i do not propose to delay your lordships any further and i beg to press the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am very much obliged to the noble and learned lord the lord advocate for agreeing to consider this amendment and in those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> i may be able to help because in the first marshalled list it was line and not line <e> <s> there is quite clearly a printing error of some kind <e>", "<cs> it does not seem that there is any support for my amendment <e> <s> in view of what the noble and learned lord has said may i reconsider the situation and look at it again at report stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am pleased to have the opportunity to follow the noble lord lord oram as my name is associated with this amendment <e> <s> your lordships are probably aware that the liberal party has been closely concerned with a number of job ownership schemes and indeed a former leader of the liberal party who is still a member of the other place mr jo grimmond is i believe chairman of certain job ownership schemes <e> <s> it seems to me that at the present time this kind of scheme if it can be called a scheme so lucidly and clearly explained by the noble lord lord seebohm is extremely appropriate today <e> <s> it provides a convenient vehicle similar to a partnership but with limited liability to deal with an increasing number of men and women in this country who have been made redundant in their thirties and who wish to combine together in order to work in this form <e> <s> there is a lot of redundancy money in areas such as south wales <e> <s> the first reaction of many of the men and women who are made redundant and receive a large amount of redundancy pay is to have a little leisure but they get tired of a trip to miami or wherever it is they go and they group together wanting to work and make things which they can market in the local area <e>", "<cs> may i attempt to clarify a few points by asking the noble and learned lord the lord advocate two questions <e> <s> i too was a little disappointed at his approach but i may have misunderstood him in this matter <e> <s> in the early part of his speech he referred to the fact that he was not going to deal with these amendments in detail <e> <s> he was talking about the whole scheme subject to certain details but he did not want to bore the house he said or words to that effect and did not give us the details which he had in mind in relation to these amendments <e> <s> as the noble and learned lord will appreciate one of the amendments associated with what the noble lord lord seebohm spoke about was the new clause for amendment of the companies act to enable a limited company to acquire its own fully paid shares <e>", "<cs> may i thank the noble and learned lord the lord advocate for his explanation of why he did not go into the matter in detail <e> <s> however another aspect of the speech which he has just made reminds me that he seemed to suggest that possibly these amendments are not suitable for a companies bill <e> <s> i thought he indicated to the committee with his great skill in these matters that these clauses should not be in a companies bill <e> <s> i feel however that these clauses ought to be contained in a companies bill subject to the discussions to which the noble and learned lord referred regarding certain improvements to their drafting <e>", "<cs> i should like to express my thanks to the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter for his helpful suggestion <e> <s> i heard the noble and learned lord the lord advocate refer to discussions and in my further speeches i tried to evaluate what those discussions would comprise <e> <s> as my name is associated with this amendment as well as that of the noble lord lord seebohm i would welcome such discussions if the noble lord lord seebohm agrees <e> <s> i would welcome such discussions with the government as soon as

deal with the matter more specifically <e> <s> although the basic theme is the same they are not identical <e> <s> opinions of course differ as to which is the best amendment <e> <s> i was telephoned

postcards <e> <s> i had one from ici if i may declare an interest only a few days ago and that was not prepaid <e> <s> if the answer by the company is that this is a costly method and increases the cost of the matter may i respectfully suggest that many of these companies could save a lot of money in the advertising they circulate with the annual reports <e> <s> these glossy reports they issue

companies could be curtailed in the function which they set out to perform <e> <s> i agree that a company must disclose what it is making but there are other ways of doing that <e> <s> the noble lord and i must differ in our views about these reports which are issued from time to time <e>", "<cs> i am very much obliged to the noble lord for the reply that he has given and in the circumstances and in view of his undertaking i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> may i briefly support what the noble lord lord ponsonby has said <e> <s> there has been and still is wide support throughout industry about the maintenance of the business names registry <e> <s> my telephone has been ringing constantly from firms and professional people saying that they are so pleased that this amendment that i put forward was accepted by your lordships <e> <s> i should have thought that the government would wish to be flexible in their attitude towards industry having regard to the great support that has been put forward in regard to the business names registry <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the helpful announcement which the noble lord has just made <e> <s> i would support any procedure by which the government would endeavour to raise this matter again in the other place rather than in this house <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the minister for that answer particularly his comments about the position on section of the companies act <e> <s> i confess that i could not understand his comments about sections and <e> <s> he introduced some figures and spoke about administrative inconvenience arising from the operation of the companies registry <e> <s> the procedure could readily be simplified without increasing the staff greatly <e> <s> it could be done by normal administrative arrangements for instance to reduce the number of names on the register registration could be for say five years unless people ask for renewal and i am of course talking now about the register of business names <e> <s> simple administrative factors could be introduced to make the register more workable and manageable <e> <s> i will consider what the minister said and on

problem <e> <s> with the noble lord lord seebohm i look forward to other meetings with the noble and learned lords staff who have been most helpful in the matter so as to make the public further aware of this important development <e> <s> at this time i can see no need for a statutory provision i agree with the minister about that and in those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment

better than the word realised <e> <s> it may be that i have misunderstood his argument but he cited that article <e> <s> it may be that he was citing it about a different point in which case i apologise to him for not having understood his argument <e> <s> but the reference to article c seemed to me to be irrelevant to the basic issue which the noble lord lord bruce of donington was submitting to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down would it be helpful if i were to ask the noble and learned lord where in article he sees the words that he has referred to as being there <e> <s> according to my copy article occupies quite an area of space <e> <s> there are hundreds of words here <e> <s> i am extremely sorry but i was trying to follow the noble and

which i had in submitting that there was a class of companies in this country the small firms which should have very special consideration <e> <s> i had looked at the green paper to which he referred and i thought that possibly with this amendment giving the secretary of state such powers it might have been opportune for the government to consider that my amendment perhaps with improved drafting would have been acceptable <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged to the noble and learned lord and in those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the concession

registration of the societies <e> <s> in those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord trefgarne for agreeing with me that the discussion on amendment is solely concerned with the principle of having a business names registry <e> <s> like the noble lord lord ponsonby but for other reasons i fail to understand why the government have brought in this amendment <e> <s> i should have thought that a discussion of a business names registry dealing with small firms would have best been left to the other place to the

my post indicates that countless representations have been made to the government in writing and orally on the matter <e> <s> let me say that the intended abolition of the registry of business names by the government has drawn howls of anguish from such users of the service as companies banks accountants credit organisations the institute of trade marks agents and the institute of patent agents and i pause here to say that often inadequate tribute is paid to those two institutes in regard to the efforts they make for industry and the creation of wealth <e> <s> they know what is the position in regard to business interests of the community <e> <s> then we have the protests of the institute of directors and the law societies and other institutions <e> <s> there was even a letter from the

preparing and dealing with the amendments put forward in this bill <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i have waited until this late hour in order to add briefly my support for this amendment so ably moved by the noble earl lord bessborough <e> <s> i also have the privilege of being a member of the house of lords select committee on science and technology to which the noble earl referred <e> <s> this amendment is well worth putting into the bill <e> <s> it would be of great advantage to the forestry commission that this kind of practice which in many areas the forestry commission are undertaking should be incorporated as one of their general duties <e>", "<cs> i have considerable sympathy with the general theme of the speech made by the noble lord lord ponsonby of shulbrede in support of this amendment <e> <s> particularly i have sympathy with his outline of the history of the matter and the present position in regard to trade unions in the regions <e> <s> but i have some difficulty about the precise wording of this amendment <e> <s> it does not seem to me that this is quite the amendment that one would have expected to be put forward at this stage

<e>", "<cs> i rise quite briefly to raise a matter under paragraph of schedule <e> <s> this paragraph which is on page of the bill imposes a duty upon the corporation in dealing with questions of

mentioned my name invoking my assistance on this matter <e> <s> i am very sorry that i cannot be of much assistance to him <e> <s> i wonder whether the words requisite advantageous or convenient appear in any other post office acts <e> <s> they seem to me to be a strange collection of words used together and in some ways although this is merely a drafting way i would have preferred perhaps to put the word expedient in this general sense <e> <s> perhaps there is a history in relation to many of these words and sometimes it is useful to maintain the words of past acts when passing over powers in this way <e>", "<cs> my purpose in intervening on the question that clause shall stand part of the bill is to ensure that certain powers of the post office-have not been lost in this massive transfer of powers which has to take place in order to give the corporation the powers that it now has under clause <e> <s> the powers that i have in mind are those which the post office has had and is stiil exercising to encourage innovation and invention among its staff and to reward members of the staff for the inventions and innovations which they have put forward and which have been of great help <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to noble lords who have supported me on this amendment and i am also grateful for the sympathy expressed by the minister with the general tenor of this amendment but i should like to ask a question <e> <s> the noble lord lord morris pointed out the contents of clause of which i was fully aware that impose criminal sanctions <e> <s> i was also fully aware though not in detail of all the acts previously to which made it an offence to do certain things with certain instruments relating to the telephone <e> <s> a new situation has now arisen <e> <s> the post office is having transferred from it powers in relation to telecommunications and the new corporation is being set up <e> <s> that is a totally different situation <e>", "<cs> in so far as i understood the noble lord lord trefgarne in his reply to the question i had asked he is going perhaps a little further than merely expressing sympathy for the general theme in the amendment <e> <s> so far as i understood him he said that this was a matter which would be discussed at a later stage even of this committee in general terms <e> <s> if my understanding is correct that this is a matter that can come up for discussion at a later stage regarding the duties of this new corporation in those circumstances i would beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> as my name is associated with this amendment it appears that the noble lord lord morris and i put down identical amendments <e> <s> we have had a wide-ranging debate <e> <s> may i indicate why i put down this amendment <e> <s> the logical boundary of the monopoly of the new corporation should be the point of entry into a subscribers premises <e> <s> i am very glad to hear so many noble lords agreeing with me <e> <s> therefore from that point onwards in the spirit of liberalisation which the government have so accentuated from time to time it should be free for all if i may use that expression to supply any apparatus which can be joined to that point <e> <s> i would therefore be surprised in this atmosphere of liberalisation which the government have introduced into this matter so properly if the arguments of the noble earl lord de la warr were to be accepted in this matter <e> <s> i am sure that certainly the government will not accept the arguments of the noble lord lord ponsonby when he emphasised how important it was to instal a telephone for the purposes of testing <e> <s> this is really not the present procedure <e>", "<cs> i should like briefly to support the proposition put forward so fluently and ably by the noble lord lord ponsonby <e> <s> i have read the speeches in another place <e> <s> i have read the opinion of the attorney general i have studied that opinion very carefully <e> <s> but in the other place it seems to me the government did not deal with the basic commonsense attitude which should apply to the facts of this case <e> <s> it is agreed that we have now a new corporation to be set up called british telecom <e> <s> it is agreed that in so far as post office workers are concerned before this act comes into force there is an anomaly in the sense that the postal workers are in a different situation from other workers in nationalised industries <e>", "<cs> i did not expect that at this late hour i should hear two old friends of mine being described so clearly and aptly as

be raised at a later stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> from these benches we support lord youngs amendment in these matters <e> <s> i should also like to say despite the

included in the monopoly and are not excluded by the exceptions raised in clause <e> <s> there is no real question of principle arising in this it is a matter of drafting <e> <s> it seemed to me that the few words that i had suggested in my amendment to go into clause were far better than the collection of words in clause <e>", "<cs> in view of the importance of this proposal by the noble lord lord mottistone in relation to the merchant shipping industry i wonder whether the noble lord lord trefgarne has considered the position that arises under clause which is the clause concerned with the granting of licences <e> <s> the noble lord lord mottistone very fairly raised the question of the difficulties that might arise when an application is made by merchant shipowners for a <e>", "<cs> it

twice in the th minute of his speech and twice in the th minute <e> <s> so i am pleased that he found it effective for that part of his speech anyway <e>", "<cs> yes but i always find it difficult to pronounce a word when it is in inverted commas <e> <s> but i understand that the amendment of the noble lord lord glenamara would leave subsection of clause in this way <e>", "<cs> although i agree partially with the noble lord lord mottistone that possibly this amendment is not absolutely necessary it would be helpful to include a subsection on these lines in clause as giving a guideline and emphasising a guideline under which the secretary of state should operate <e> <s> clause defining the general duties of the corporation is an important subsection and i would support an amendment on these lines <e>", "<cs> i am afraid i find it difficult to follow the noble lord lord lyell when he says that it is going to be the policy of the government to give general licences many of which would be irrevocable <e> <s> he is permitted to do that of course under the terms of clause because a licence can be given irrevocably <e> <s> but surely is it not a mistake from a practical point of view to grant licences which are <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord whether therefore the government will be proposing an amendment to clause i at line where it gives powers to the corporation or the secretary of state to give licences which are irrevocable <e> <s> i did not quite understand whether he is now saying that the government will not give a licence other than a licence which is capable of being revoked <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord of course as i said in my previous remarks that some inventions take a long time to develop but i am just taking the point so ably taken by the noble lord lord glenamara when he said that if a licence was being successful because the licensee was doing good work it was capable of renewal <e> <s> therefore i would cover the point about inventions taking a long time to develop <e> <s> i find it very difficult to understand his speech in the light of the word irrevocably in line of clause where the powers are quite clearly given to the secretary of state or the corporation to give such licences <e> <s> it may be that the government are proposing to remove that word at a later stage <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord send a copy of his letter to me <e>", "<cs> i am unhappy about the subsection <e> <s> i agree with noble lords opposite that it would be a good idea for the government to think about it again <e> <s> the noble lord lord trefgarne has told us that there are likely to be thousands of licences <e> <s> that was his main reason for not agreeing with lord glenamaras amendment that an affirmative resolution should be used and that these licences should be laid before the house <e> <s> if that is so it is quite likely with the best intention in the world that british telecommunications may make a mistake <e> <s> in fact it may be that some of their acts will be illegal <e> <s> i am not suggesting in any way that this would be deliberate but these things do happen <e> <s> therefore it seems to me that before these very wide powers are given under statute the government ought to consider the matter again <e>", "<cs> elegant <e>", "<cs> i entirely agree with the noble lords opposite who have supported that general theme <e> <s> so far as this amendment is concerned it is an attempt to clarify the position of the grant of licences under clause by setting out a few general guidelines <e> <s> there are a number of these guidelines which i have presumed to draft because here we are entering an area where people do not know what the secretary of state or telecom are likely to do <e> <s> therefore there are certain types of licences which could be rejected and the reasons could be found clearly set out in the statute if my amendment no <e> <s> were to be accepted <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the

debate should be <e> <s> it is accepted that in this field there should be a massive investment <e> <s> it is accepted that the private capital market in this country is a very good judge of where to invest its money <e> <s> it seems from the words of the noble earl lord de la warr that at the present time the market seems to be ready to risk its money in this field <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the noble lord lord young of dartington in this amendment <e> <s> as your lordships have no doubt heard from other sources industry in this country has been worried at the absence of data protection in the laws of the united kingdom <e> <s> indeed when the all-party group on information technology was set up over months ago one of the first matters brought to the notice of this all-party group was the absence of these laws and how it was affecting seriously the business of this country <e>", "<cs> i am encouraged by the realistic and practical approach of the noble lord lord

lord lord young started what was intended to be his final speech <e> <s> like the noble lord lord mottistone i am unhappy about the reply by the noble lord lord trefgarne in this matter particularly

in this field but i was advised that amendment no <e> <s> would be better drafted in the way that it now appears <e> <s> in all the circumstances i do not propose to press this amendment <e> <s> if the government desire to keep secret the names of the companies in which they own shares in this particular field then that is a matter of policy for the government <e>", "<cs> i support entirely what has been said by the noble lord lord strabolgi but also i cannot understand why the third company is not mentioned in the earlier part of the bill <e> <s> why not mention it by name <e> <s> if these are the only three companies concerned why is clause couched in such general terms <e> <s> it states <e>", "<cs> i would have accepted with a certain amount of reluctance what the noble lord the minister has just said if we were directing our attention at matters other than those concerned with atomic energy safety and control <e> <s> i quite agree that it is not a good thing always to be coming back to your lordships house for new powers in respect of additional companies but having regard to what the noble lord has said i ask leave to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> i cannot find the words which have just been quoted by the noble lord the minister in my amendment <e> <s> as i understand it we are dealing with amendment no <e> <s> and i cannot find in that amendment the words <e>", "<cs> here again i fail to understand how a simple straightforward amendment of this kind can muddy any bill <e> <s> in words somewhat similar to those that the noble lord introduced in his speech on amendment no <e> <s> this amendment states that none of the activities of the company is associated with the nuclear power programme <e> <s> if that is true why not make it clear so that everyone knows the position in regard to the companys atomic energy activities <e> <s> it would also make it quite clear that the company is not directly or indirectly concerned with the development or production of a weapon part of a weapon or an explosive nuclear assembly <e>", "<cs> i note what the noble lord the minister has to say on this matter but it seems to me that the government do not want to make quite clear that all the companies with which the bill is concerned are not connected with the nuclear power programme <e> <s> assurances are given here but the government are not prepared to make clear to the world at large what is the position <e> <s> i had hoped that the noble lord would be more sympathetic to the amendment <e> <s> however he has taken a very firm line no doubt under instructions as part of the policy of the government in this extraordinarily difficult area where environmentalists are proving very troublesome and foreign countries are proving difficult <e> <s> some of us are aware of what is happening in regard to the american situation and the situation in other countries which i need not name at this stage <e> <s> however it is the policy of the government not to make their position clear as to what is the range of the definition of atomic energy and of the activities of the companies a substantial part of which at any rate they propose to pass to the private sector <e> <s> again i say that the private sector cannot provide the safety and control so essential to the carrying on of activities of this kind in companies with which the bill is supposed to deal <e> <s> however in the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> it was very good of the noble lord to apologise for taking a hard line but there is no need for him ever to apologise to me for taking a hard line <e> <s> but the sting of his speech was very much in the tail as stings usually are where he asked me to be more enlightened than i am <e> <s> perhaps that rather tempts me to be a little lengthier in my explanations of my theme but looking at the members of the committee around me i do not propose to be tempted in that way <e> <s> i am very grateful to the noble lord for reading out the section of the act <e> <s> i am sorry that i came here ill-prepared not having myself studied the act <e> <s> i shall study what the noble lord has said and i reserve the right to deal with the question later <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i do not propose to argue this point any further <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the proliferation of the use of nuclear power in the context of this bill <e>", "<cs> i have listened very subjectively to what the noble lord says <e> <s> he says this amendment suggests that the government are likely to renege on agreements that they have entered into <e> <s> all this amendment is intended to do is to make it quite clear that this bill in view of its vague generalisations has no facet which will interfere with these international agreements or conventions relating to non-proliferation <e> <s> i am a little disappointed at the lack of sympathy with which the noble lord has been dealing with these matters and in these circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> may i very briefly support the statesmanlike and constructive approach which the noble lord lord strabolgi has made to this matter <e> <s> it would seem to me that when you are dealing with the subject of atomic energy defined so widely as it is in this bill so capable as that definition is of misunderstanding both in this country but particularly abroad i should have thought it would be helpful if the secretary of state would lay a report before parliament not necessarily defining the national interest as is said here but at any rate indicating the general parameters he has in mind <e> <s> i strongly support this amendment <e>", "<cs> in view of this exchange of words i must confess that i said that i thought the noble lord was not producing the kind of enthusiasm that one would expect from a noble lord presenting a bill of this kind <e>", "<cs> with great respect to the noble lord lord strabolgi i do not want to be too closely associated with that wonderful peroration that he voiced in moving this amendment <e> <s> but the main point in his speech is that if you sell all the shares of the amersham company and it gets into the hands of a foreign firm for instance or indeed any firm they can close it down and it could be detrimental it seems to me to the employees <e>", "<cs> if i may interpose what the noble lord is saying is that he is not only going to preserve the rights of the employees but is going to control in some way in the national interest the availability of products at present produced by the amersham company for export purposes and for medical purposes in this country <e> <s> if that is what he is going to do he should make it clear that that is what he is going to do because that would affect the sale of the shares very considerably <e> <s> as your lordships are aware on these benches we have always believed in liberalisation or privatisation of presently publicly-owned shares <e> <s> we have always advocated that policy as a general principle but in this case when dealing in the field of atomic energy if the government controlled the company by having per cent <e> <s> of the shares as in the case of bp that might enhance the value of the shares <e> <s> i do not want to give reasons for all this but it could do so for government purposes and therefore more money could be obtained by the government in relation to this proposed sale <e>", "<cs> in order to save time i may say that i support the amendment <e> <s> it is one of a series of amendments coming forward in relation of trying to help the position of employees in the event of a sale <e> <s> i would say briefly that any amendment moved by the noble lord lord strabolgi as regards the disposal of shares in relation to the activities of employees has my support <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord lord oram who has so much experience in this matter for his sympathetic support for the general theme of at least part of my amendment which deals with the collective ownership of the shares <e> <s> i am also encouraged by what the noble lord lord skelmersdale has said as i understand it namely that the government will be encouraging or at any rate bringing to the notice of employees various schemes of share ownership by the employees of this company <e>", "<cs> i am very much obliged to the noble lord for the assurance he has given <e> <s> however the assurances do not seem to go quite far enough <e> <s> what he has said may be the legal position but the noble lord knows quite well as i do that personnel in a company can have access to other institutions without it being embodied in any legal agreement <e> <s> perhaps therefore the noble lord would be willing to go a little further and say that quite apart from the question of licences or contracts employees in any of these companies will not have access to any premises where work is going on in relation to the production of any weapon or part of a weapon or explosive nuclear assembly <e> <s> in the case of a company like this where there has been disposal of the shares it sometimes happens that employees of the company go back to former institutions with which they were connected however loosely <e> <s> i assume that the noble lord agrees with me that that position would not be allowed to arise <e>", "<cs> if it is a long letter i would hesitate to ask the noble lord to read it out for my convenience <e> <s> if he could send me a copy of that letter and at the same time send a copy to the noble lord <e> <s> lord strabolgi i should be grateful <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i would accept that the procedure should be as indicated by the noble lord lord skelmersdale subject to one matter <e> <s> i hope that the third reading of the bill will not be brought in too quickly and that we shall have a reasonable interval of about two or three weeks before the third reading is taken <e>", "<cs> my lords at this late time of the evening i feel it is a little unhappy that the noble lord the chief whip for the government should use the word sharp in relation to anything that i have said <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> he has now withdrawn the word sharp and amicability is once more restored <e> <s> of course the last thing i ever do is anything that is sharp <e> <s> i have no knowledge as to when the date of the third reading is to be <e> <s> i do not ask for any undertaking but i only hope that the business of the house will allow an hour in say a fortnights time for consideration of what is a very important bill <e>", "<cs> my lords may i join the noble lord lord strabolgi at any rate in his first sentence in congratulating the noble lord lord skelmersdale on the skill which he has shown in piloting this bill through <e> <s> in the early stages of the discussions on this bill i referred to this bill as being dangerous a kind of wolf in sheeps clothing and i hold this view largely because of the broad definition of atomic energy in clause and because of the vague generalisations contained in the bill relating to the control of company activities in relation to atomic energy authorities <e> <s> it seemed to me also that the bill might have international repercussions in encouraging countries abroad to feel that the strong control political as well as technical as exercised by previous governments was being relaxed and that this could lead albeit unwittingly to proliferation of atomic energy activities in wider fields than those at present envisaged or desired by the government <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be appropriate at this stage if i add my welcome to this bill for what it is worth as a temporary measure making interim provisions pending international agreement <e> <s> i support the amendment no <e> <s> which has just been moved by the noble earl lord gowrie <e> <s> i should like to congratulate him if i may do so for having skilfully piloted this interesting bill through all its stages in this house and thank him for his courtesy to myself throughout the second reading and committee stage <e> <s> i am also grateful to him for the sympathy he adopted towards one of my amendments dealing with the safety of divers and the people concerned with the mining arrangements at sea and for bringing in on behalf of the government an amendment which covered the theme of the amendment i had put forward from these benches <e>", "<cs> my lords may i briefly but very warmly support the amendment which has been so ably and eloquently introduced to your lordships house by the noble baroness lady vickers <e> <s> in so doing i should also like to pay tribute to her personally for the vast knowledge she has and for the work she has done in commonwealth circles and particularly with regard to what is happening in the falkland islands <e> <s> for many years the noble baroness has been a member of the executive committee of the commonwealth parliamentary association and has done such wonderful work <e>", "<cs> my lords whatever may be the reasons why your lordships find yourselves in the uenviable position of having to deal with these complex amendments at such short notice amendments to a bill of very considerable commercial importance i am personally satisfied at least that the existing parliamentary procedures which have given rise to this situation are heartily to be deplored <e> <s> first of all from time to time these procedures have been shown in practice to be inconsistent with and inappropriate to a modern parliamentary democratic system for dealing with legislation of this nature which is merely technical and largely non-controversial from a political point of view <e> <s> secondly these procedures and i urge the government to endeavour to modify them in some way have today resulted in there coming before your lordships house to be <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord sits down may i say that on this occasion it was not i who conjured up the devil but his noble friend sitting alongside him <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the noble lord lord ponsonby in those remarks <e> <s> i welcome this and the other amendments which contain the words too like because they recognise the practical fears expressed by myself and others those who have experience of dealing with trade name matters <e> <s> as for the indications we have had of what the guidelines will be i was not too happy with what the minister said about those i assume they will not have statutory significance and that the secretary of state will have a further discretion to those set out in the guidelines <e>", "<cs> my lords in this area of international trade i welcome this series of amendments as an improvement in relation to the status of overseas companies in bringing them into line with domestic companies <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged to the noble and learned lord for explaining that <e> <s> this is one of the clauses that i found incomprehensible <e> <s> i was quite wrong <e> <s> now that the noble and learned lord has explained it it is quite clear it is due to the industrial action that occurred <e> <s> i am much obliged to the noble and learned lord <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first thank the noble and learned lord for the explanation he has given about the amendments to clause <e> <s> i must say i have considerable sympathy for the theme that has been developed so ably by the noble lord lord wedderburn <e> <s> the question is whether the amendment now under these amendments to clause is too wide <e> <s> my professional experience if i may refer to a personal matter is entirely in the field of intellectual property involving patents trademarks know-how and copyright <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord sits down may i ask him whether there is not one difficulty about dealing with clause dealing with the malefactor namely that you are dealing with a criminal prosecution and therefore the necessity for proof is so much higher than in a civil matter <e> <s> would not a proviso like that put forward in amendment no <e> <s> l help in relation to dealing with the malefactor by explaining the position a little further <e> <s> i fully realise that i am not a criminal lawyer and have not had much experience in criminal matters <e> <s> however it seems to me that there is a pretty wide exemption given by the government amendments to this clause and therefore if you are dealing with criminal proceedings you want in the course of the text of the act or the bill to be more explicit in providing provisos which make it more difficult for the malefactor to get away with it <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened carefully to what the noble lord lord bruce of donington has said and i wonder whether he is going to propose therefore or whether he is suggesting that all the rest of the amendments should be moved <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say with leave that i do not want to be misunderstood <e> <s> i do not want to say anything in the course of any of the other amendments and i shall certainly accept the suggestion of the noble lord lord bruce of donington that in the circumstances we can deal with all of the rest of the amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i draw attention to the fact that i have already spoken about amendment no <e> <s> when i earlier supported the amendment of the noble lord lord bruce of donington and i referred to that wonderful subsection with its odd words <e> <s> i was very disappointed when the noble lord lord renton left the house because i am sure that he would have supported me in making an appeal for simplification and clarification in acts of parliament of this kind <e> <s> here we have a clause dealing with restrictions for private companies indeed not only restrictions but relaxation of restrictions <e> <s> but to have a sentence with indeed two or three semi-colons of words is really not the way in which modern law should be written these days <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to add another voice from the liberal benches in congratulating the noble lord lord geddes on the amendment that he has had accepted <e> <s> as i come from a small nation i should like to support what the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones said in regard to this matter because i was in hong kong in the early summer when these matters were discussed and i was asked to address the reform club of hong kong with its members <e> <s> when they met on their annual general meeting and i was invited to that meeting i was surprised that there was a dinner party with over cantonese present <e> <s> i was asked to speak <e> <s> i followed a number of erudite people my task was merely to propose a vote of thanks to the chairman and i did not know in what language i should speak <e> <s> i spoke in welsh and encouraged a thousand cantonese to follow me in saying jechid dda good health in welsh to the chairman <e> <s> in relation to the association between this area of hong kong and our country the noble lord lord geddes has made a great contribution <e>", "<cs> my lords may i join in thanking the minister for so carefully and well describing the content of these many regulations <e> <s> i do not propose to enter into the technical matters in the way that was done so eloquently by the noble lord who has just sat down <e> <s> i should however like to refer to one theme which it seems to me formed the basis of the ministers account of these regulations <e> <s> he said that these regulations before the house were intended to help farmers to increase their income by planned investment <e> <s> he also said that these regulations will come as no surprise to farmers <e> <s> i am wondering about the farmers who come from the parts of wales with which i am familiar and whether these regulations are sufficiently understood and have been made clear by the department of which he is the minister to the small farmer whom it is intended to help <e>", "<cs> my lords may i join the noble lord who has just sat down in congratulating the noble and learned lord on the concise way in which he has introduced these regulations and also may i say immediately that for once i concur almost entirely with what the noble lord lord bruce of donington has already put forward in his speech of just over a quarter of an hour <e> <s> with that prologue it will therefore appear quite clear to your lordships that i shall not be detaining the house very long in a speech on these regulations <e> <s> the noble and learned lord was kind enough to refer to me in his speech

puts forward <e> <s> most noble lords who have spoken agree that the present procedures are unsatisfactory for hard cases and it is only the hard cases that come up to this house <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very much obliged to the noble lord for that very helpful statement in the course of my speech <e> <s> but what does he mean when he says that my bill makes the position of a judge impossible <e> <s> indeed he supported that by saying that one of the reasons why it would make it impossible is that i am turning the judge into a prophet <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord lord belstead and the noble lord lord mishcon realise that in many acts of parliament the words in the public interest appear and the judge has to decide whether the matters before him are in the public interest <e> <s> i

penultimate paragraph where it says that hugh small and norma small are in the relationship of stepfather and stepdaughter <e> <s> the relationship is stepson and stepmother <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord windlesham has explained the scope of this bill fairly and comprehensively with his accustomed care and clarity <e> <s> it is a bill dealing with a society of great financial distinction <e> <s> it is very difficult to compare this society with other bodies or institutions regulatory or otherwise <e> <s> what the noble lord lord windlesham has emphasised and i am sure noble lords will concur is that one of the main characteristics of the society which is the subject of this bill is its truly international nature in terms of its business and liabilities <e> <s> the purpose of the bill is a difficult one <e> <s> as the noble lord lord windlesham has described its main purpose is to bring up to date the scope of the societys laws and functions <e>", "<cs> my lords

member of the law society what attention am i to pay to this very strong note from the law society about part ii of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords may i reciprocate that gratitude to the noble lord for his courtesy <e>", "<cs> i thought the ministers speech to which i listened with attention supported the general theme of the amendment <e> <s> i do not propose to make a second reading speech but i must comment on that part of the noble earls remarks when he referred to the safety of the consumer being paramount <e> <s> i have some difficulty in understanding his objection to the amendment

the ordinary domestic consumer who was purchasing appliances <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for that explanation and i hesitate to ask him to look at clause in more detail but i would presume to draw his attention to the scope of that clause particularly the last words of subsection <e>", "<cs> i wonder if the noble earl the minister will agree with me that the word rights will include what is somewhat pompously known as intellectual property rights that is to say rights in relation to patents trademarks know-how copyright and designs <e> <s> the noble lord lord bishopston did make mention of patent rights and as i understand it no answer was given to that specific point by the noble earl <e> <s> i am not complaining because he probably included patent rights in his general statement <e> <s> but these intellectual property rights are of tremendous value to organisations which own them <e> <s> can the noble earl the minister give an assurance that there is adequate protection to the british gas corporation in the scope of this bill if the corporation themselves have acquired as a result intellectual property rights which they do not wish to dispose of <e> <s> these rights can be of great value internationally and can be exploited abroad <e> <s> therefore when they are considering the transfer of rights will the government fully consider safeguarding intellectual property rights <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble earl for his reply but it does not quite cover the scope of my anxiety about the ownership of intellectual property rights in

provisions of the treaty of rome <e> <s> there are problems in industry relating to the competition laws <e> <s> i have the privilege of having been made a member of a working party of the eec sub-committee which has been asked to consider the scope of obstacles to trade arising from articles and of the treaty of rome <e> <s> obviously i am not asking for an answer tonight hut so far the noble earl has made no reference to enactments which arise under rome treaty provisions i am sure he has that in mind and may be able to say to me that his comprehensive statement includes any enactment or any provision of law arising under the rome treaty <e>", "<cs> my lords if i might briefly address your lordships must confess at once that i am in something of a dilemma for three reasons <e> <s> first i spoke strongly in favour of inserting the words into the bill which the government now want to strike out <e> <s> secondly i agree almost completely with the content of the speeches made by the noble baroness lady fisher and by the noble lord lord underhill <e> <s> thirdly i have some correspondence from the national gas consumers council in fact i have a letter dated th june from the gas council <e> <s> i do not know whether it is the same letter as the letter of th june which the noble earl the minister has in his hands <e> <s> that letter refers to an earlier letter <e>", "<cs> my lords while joining in the thanks given to the noble lord the minister for his very helpful statement may i ask whether he agrees that to give statutory rights to service marks in the united kingdom at the present time would help to some small extent to remove one of the obstacles to trade between the united kingdom and the other eec countries <e> <s> while noting that the noble lord the minister considers that legislation on trade marks will be wanted in due course having regard to developments in the eec may i repeat the question that was put by the noble lord lord campbell of alloway <e> <s> in view of the help that statutory rights for service marks would give to industry would he not be sympathetic to a short bill to deal with this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord give any indication as to when the proposed new legislation will be put before the house <e>", "<cs> may i briefly support what the noble lord lord nathan has said in introducing this amendment <e> <s> he has mentioned that only this morning i approached him to see whether he would agree to the addition of the words or chartered patent agent being inserted after the word solicitor <e> <s> in my experience i have seen and been involved with chartered patent agents as advocates in the patent court <e> <s> i therefore consulted the clerk who is concerned with this bill and he suggested that the procedure which we have now adopted would be suitable rather than that a manuscript amendment should be circulated at this stage <e> <s> i have also notified the table on this matter <e> <s> but if there is some kind of procedural difficulty that was not disclosed to me earlier i shall of course withdraw this kind of amendment <e> <s> but i was assured that it was perfectly in order to proceed in this way <e> <s> may i add that part ii of this bill may substantially alter the existing law <e> <s> there is some ambiguity about this but it seems that this is not merely a codifying bill <e> <s> therefore i strongly support this amendment <e>", "<cs> like the noble lord lord spens i came here this morning with a whole sheaf of letters from various health and environmental authorities deploring the fact that the government were proposing to have any sympathy towards the amendments put forward by the noble lord lord mottistone <e> <s> the basic principle of law in relation to the sale of bad food i had come along this morning to argue should be quite simply that it is an absolute offence <e> <s> any person marketing bad food should be strictly liable for such an act <e> <s> food is totally different from other commodities <e> <s> mistakes should not be tolerated in the public interest as the consequences of one mistake can be disastrous and can cause considerable suffering <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> he has misunderstood the position <e> <s> it is not a question of suggesting that other firms are guilty in the same way as those dreadful cases in relation to meat distribution <e> <s> once you put into a statute that there is a defence of due diligence there are almost endless opportunities for lawyers to find sincerely and properly circumstances in which it would be of assistance <e> <s> it seems to me as a matter of principle a mistake that there can be a defence of due diligence against a prosecution for the sale of bad food <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am very grateful to the noble lord for his explanation of these amendments <e> <s> in his explanation the noble lord twice used the phrase distorting competition or distortion of competition <e> <s> the phrase is very common in the rome treaty in relation to competition law in particular in articles and <e> <s> may i ask the noble lord whether he was using that phrase in the eec context <e> <s> or can he give an assurance to the house that no problems relating to eec enactments will arise <e> <s> on a previous occasion i asked a question in general terms about the scope of some of these enactments and i was assured by the noble earl lord mansfield that there was no question of any eec matters arising <e> <s> however the phrases distorting competition and distortion of competition raise again my fears that perhaps this is a matter which the minister has not quite appreciated <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble viscount the minister not agree with me that his honourable friend in the other place the minister in charge of technology should be congratulated on the initiative he has taken and his enthusiasm in bringing to the notice of british industry the great importance of information technology <e> <s> in asking this question i should declare an interest in that i am a founder member of the all-party parliamentary group on information technology <e>", "<cs> my lords although the minister was good enough to say that the present position is unsatisfactory is it satisfactory for a company with a principal place of business in this country to be in a position to be allowed to conform with registration <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister be good enough not only to pay a tribute to the liberal party but also to answer my question whether a company with its principal place of business in this country is satisfactory for the purposes of registration under the present acts <e>", "<cs> may i say that of course agree with the noble lord lord mishcon when he says that it would be a waste of time to enter into any political debate on this matter <e> <s> i should like to pursue with him if i may the theme that he developed that control ought to go out of the hands of nbc <e> <s> he pursued that theme very fairly and frankly with his usual persuasiveness <e> <s> then he comes to the general theme <e> <s> the general proposition he puts to us is that his basic reason for this amendment and for his general attitude in supporting this amendment is that there is a possibility of shares going into wrong hands <e>", "<cs> on these benches i support the noble lord lord lucas in relation to this amendment <e>", "<cs> it is with some hesitation that i presume to enter into this argument <e> <s> i have always been fascinated by the depth of knowledge of the noble lord lord wedderburn in these matters <e> <s> i hope it is not impertinent of me to say so <e> <s> i was trying to follow his argument <e> <s> it ranged from the more modern general aviation cases to the s we heard about the doctrine of repudiation and the doctrine of repudiation of repudiation <e> <s> i do not wish to be impertinent but i thought his speech was something of the order of a speech which would be more suitable for the question that clause stand part rather than in relation to this particular amendment <e> <s> i find it very difficult indeed to understand the basic reasons for his having put forward this amendment <e> <s> it is entirely my fault but i do not understand in any way how this deletion of lines to on page assists <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may i should like to echo the opening comment of the noble lord lord stodart that he intervened in this debate with trepidation <e> <s> i do so with even more trepidation but i do so for a reason which is totally different from the noble lords reasons <e> <s> he referred to the district function in relation to the sale of food unfit for human consumption <e> <s> some noble lords may remember and certainly the noble lord lord mottistone will when i spoke rather strongly recently in support of a private members bill which was directed towards an aspect of consumer protection in that it increased the penalties for the sale of unfit food <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to introduce an acrid atmosphere of international competition in regard to the tourist trade <e> <s> but will the noble lord the minister bear in mind the interests of wales <e> <s> quite apart from the development areas there are very attractive areas in wales where the tourist trade need any assistance that they can get from the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the persuasive argument put forward by the noble and learned lord the minister particularly with regard to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> he took the noble lord lord wedderburn to task over the fact that the government were not ignoring to use his words the union rules <e> <s> but as for amendments nos <e> <s> and possibly and but certainly i wondered whether the noble and learned lord had directed his attention to the phrase in amendment no <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to interrupt the noble lord lord underhill but he has found it helpful for his case to deal specifically with various parts of england <e> <s> he will have remembered of course that in clause wales and a justices clerk are specifically mentioned <e> <s> can he now or later give me specific statistics of what has happened in the counties of wales <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord did mention wales but without that specific matter in relation to wales which will no doubt help his case <e>", "<cs> my lords i presumed to interrupt the noble lord lord underhill when he was speaking specifically on matters he considered to be of very considerable significance <e> <s> i feel sure now having listened very carefully to the noble lord lord mishcon that the noble lord lord underhill would like to withdraw this amendment because i think it is quite clear that the noble lord lord mishcon has indicated that really the substance of this amendment is about the same as that of the governments amendment no <e> <s> a <e> <s> the government amendment certainly has the great advantage that it is contained in two and a half lines whereas this amendment occupies seven and a half lines in order to achieve the same objective <e> <s> i am sure that if the noble lord lord renton were in his place he would accept that as a very good reason for preferring amendment no <e> <s> a <e>", "<cs> thank you <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful for the intervention of the noble lord lord mishcon because it just assists me <e> <s> as noble lords will realise in dealing with courts and matters which come before them lack of uniformity of decision is a curse <e> <s> there was even a very important gathering of judges in september called by the noble and learned lord who sits on the woolsack in order to try to deal with this question of uniformity <e> <s> with great respect to the noble lords lord mishcon and lord underhill this amendment does not help in relation to that matter <e> <s> at the moment i am not committing my party to what they will say eventually on a but it seems to me there are very great advantages in that <e>", "<cs> my lords while supporting this amendment i do not want to indulge at all in grammatical <e> <s> as i said that weighty contribution is the best i shall be able to proffer to your lordships this larly to the courts of this country is how best to collect the fines which the courts impose upon persons who appear before them and it seems to me that this is an amendment which assists in that direction <e>", "<cs> my lords i find myself in some difficulty as to which way to turn in relation to this amendment <e> <s> the noble earl lord fortescue said when moving this amendment that it had the support of the magistrates association <e> <s> in my submission that adds great weight to his speech <e> <s> he also said that his amendment had the support of the noble baroness lady phillips whom i see in her place but who so far has been silent <e> <s> the noble baroness has great experience in relation to matters concerning the consumer <e> <s> if i may add a personal note for years i was a county magistrate in the county of surrey <e> <s> i was put on the bench because i knew nothing about criminal law and i learnt about all aspects of crime by sitting on the bench in the county of surrey and sometimes at quarter sessions where i gave up acting as deputy chairman when they started to pay the people who presided over those august assemblies <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether as a spokesman for the labour opposition in this house he is as it seems to me denigrating the magistrates association comprising as it does <e>", "<cs> my lords let the noble lord himself answer <e> <s> in his opening speech he compared the magistrates association with many other associations <e> <s> the magistrates association is comprised primarily of magistrates who are doing service to the community for nothing and in my view they are therefore in a different situation from many other associations <e> <s> i am sure the noble lord did not mean to denigrate the magistrates association but i ask your lordships to attach far greater weight to the opinion of the magistrates association than that of any other association that i can recall at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the reference by the noble baroness the minister to the desirability that sensitive studies should be taught in a balanced way can she indicate whether any guidance is given as to the form of the syllabi which should be adopted in the senior schools referred to in the question <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged to the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the house for not being present when the noble lord the minister introduced this regulation <e> <s> i was occupied some distance away from the house on intellectual property matters somewhat associated with trade marks and not very different from business names and i am very sorry that i was late in arriving <e> <s> as the noble lord realises i spoke at considerable length in the course of the debates on the companies act and i endeavoured to do my best to persuade the government with little success that the business names registry should be kept on <e> <s> i do not think that at this time of the night it will be proper for me to job backwards into the history of the way in which as i still feel the government introduced something which is somewhat of a disaster for large numbers of business people who want to continue with that registry <e>", "<cs> may i support the amendment moved so ably by the noble lord lord strathcona and say how much i sympathise with the speech of the noble baroness lady birk <e> <s> what surprised me when i read this bill was to find a subparagraph of this nature in a schedule saying that this commission should not be exempt from tax <e> <s> as i have not intervened in this debate before perhaps i ought to say that i do so on a personal basis in that for the last years i have been concerned as the chairman of the brantwood trust on lake coniston in cumbria in maintaining and keeping open to the public the old home of john ruskin <e> <s> we have had a very considerable struggle in upholding the cultural heritage of the lake district as we say in an old house which has a large number of ruskin paintings ruskin drawings and ruskin manuscripts <e>", "<cs> may i briefly support the suggestion which has been made by the noble lord lord kennet as to the strategy which the noble lord lord strathcona and mount royal might consider for dealing with the matter <e> <s> in view of the frank indication by the minister that these tax matters have not been fully considered it seems to me that the cleanest thing to do would be to exempt the commission from all these taxes <e> <s> the government could later put in such taxes as they think are necessary <e> <s> to leave in this clause seems to me to be the wrong way to proceed and i believe that to accept the amendment moved by the noble lord lord strathcona and mount royal would be the cleanest way of dealing with the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords may i too thank the minister for repeating the statement <e> <s> it is a statement on the future strategy of the industry <e> <s> of course one understands that it must in some ways be cautious but i find it very depressing and in many places ambiguous <e> <s> i welcome of course the retention of the five steelmaking centres mentioned in the statement <e> <s> i also welcome the reference to a further injection of cash and i particularly welcome the proposed new project to be considered at port talbot <e> <s> however i am gravely suspicious of that part of the statement which indicates that mr ian macgregor is to advise on further selective cutbacks <e> <s> such cutbacks would appear to be contrary to other aspects of the statement referring to the governments hopes about future action by other countries in the eec to which the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos referred <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the reply which the minister gave to this amendment means that he intends to consider the position again <e> <s> i believe he said that he is going to do so <e> <s> however the minister referred also to the powers which the government already have <e> <s> at this stage i feel it is appropriate for me to air some of the anxieties of the president of the british academy the master of selwyn college and the professor of aerial photography in cambridge who has done a great amount of work on ascertaining where old field monuments which do not show above ground are to be found <e> <s> the anxiety is that the conservation areas to which this amendment refers and to which the noble earl the minister referred <e>", "<cs> i rise to support this amendment also <e> <s> but i wonder whether it goes far enough <e> <s> i wonder whether this proposed list would apply to those tens of thousands of field monuments to which i referred earlier which have been discovered in particular by the professor of aerial photographic studies in cambridge <e> <s> i understand that these field monuments are considered to be of great historical importance and form the basis of research <e> <s> this amendment refers to designed landscapes and i should like to see it go a little wider to cover those field monuments which have nothing to show above the ground but which are i am instructed by my professor friends at cambridge of such importance <e>", "<cs> my lords in warmly supporting the bill first may i congratulate the noble lord lord campbell of alloway upon his initiative in introducing it <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord lord cawley who i am so pleased to see in his place will join with me in saying how glad we are to welcome into this exotic field of trade mark law so many noble lords on this the last day before the christmas recess <e>", "<cs> my lords i also should like to congratulate the noble and learned lord on his speech and on having chaired sub- committee e with his usual charm competence and remarkable insight in dealing with basic problems on this occasion international problems associated with the development of community trade marks <e> <s> there is no doubt that his long and lucid speech this evening and his report will be read with great interest throughout the community and indeed throughout the industrial world as an important contribution to progress in the long history of trade mark discussions on the european trade marks which have already lasted over two decades <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to interrupt the noble baroness but she has mentioned my name and i wondered whether in the letter from the minister to which she referred the minister replied to those facts which i presented to the noble baroness from lloyds on this matter <e> <s> was that included in his letter <e>", "<cs> i cannot resist the temptation of having the pleasure of following the noble earl lord de la warr in his remarks but supplementing them to this extent <e> <s> the government in respect to the bill i shall not make a second reading speech have said that the main reason why they reject the bill is that the registrar for trade marks would not have the staff

fundamental matter <e> <s> the noble lord feels that the government are like an immovable rock <e> <s> that is a fairly fair paraphrase of what he said <e> <s> i am sorry that a distinguished member

amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords as one who intervened at committee stage in connection with this matter i warmly welcome the comments made by the noble earl and thank him for his long and helpful statement in respect of the tax position <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl and for the contribution of the noble lord lord renton in this matter <e> <s> i raised this question of field monuments in committee if your lordships remember because it was felt that it was a branch of archaeology which might be missed generally in the formulation of the bill <e> <s> i should have thanked the noble earl earlier for his letter to me explaining fully that the government have in mind and the bill envisages full coverage for these important field monuments that have been discovered during the last seven to years <e> <s> in view of what has been said i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl for his comments although i feel that at the beginning of his reply he was speaking to a different amendment and certainly not to the one currently before the house <e> <s> an amendment was put forward at an earlier stage or at any rate suggested in correspondence that there should be an advisory executive committee composed solely of people with academic qualifications and experience <e> <s> i think the noble lord in the first part of his reply was answering that type of amendment <e>", "<cs> had given notice of his intention to move amendment no <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord campbell of alloway has pointed out

noble lord lord mishcon has been presenting to the house and i also agree with the minister that there is no basic unit of information he referred to potatoes and apples and it is very difficult to assess it under units of that kind <e> <s> however unless i have misunderstood the minister i wonder whether he has directed his mind to one of the points raised by the noble lord lord mishcon whom i clearly understood <e> <s> throughout the bill it would appear there is a danger of the words data and information being used as synonyms whereas they are not <e> <s> i may have misunderstood the minister but he did not appear to have dealt with that one point <e> <s> that is my only reason for intervening at this stage <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment put by the noble and learned lord lord

had considerable experience of the working of a registrar in very difficult work that is the registrar of trade marks who does a great deal of good work in giving help to industry in his many activities <e> <s> it was found that in view of the new law arising because of the eec an advisory committee was helpful in that regard in helping the registrar and the patent office the registry of trade marks in some of these matters <e> <s> it is clear that for the purpose of this bill the registrar will have at least initially a very difficult job indeed <e> <s> i think that that is agreed by all <e> <s> it seems to me that the concept of having an advisory committee set up in the way suggested in amendment no <e> <s> would be of very great use for the workings of this registrar <e>", "<cs> my lords is it possible for the noble lord the minister either now or in writing to divide the figures up further and give the figures for wales alone <e>", "<cs> my lords may i express our gratitude to the noble lord lord elton for the fair way in which he introduced the order <e> <s> i join the noble lord and the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos in thanking the commission for the great amount of work they have done in carrying out this very difficult task <e> <s> like the noble lord lord elton i too must congratulate the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos on the fact that anglesey has been saved from being joined with the mainland <e> <s> it is however with the greatest humility that i follow the noble lord lord cledwyn <e> <s> i had the privilege of standing against him in a general election in anglesey and i remember that my election agent had the temerity to organise very large meetings outside his offices in holyhead <e> <s> nevertheless i console myself with the fact that although i did such an outrageous thing i did not lose my deposit in my campaign against the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos as he now is <e>", "<cs> i am much obliged to the noble lord for clarifying that situation but at the present time i would rather address myself to this one amendment first of all <e> <s> if they are muddled up i shall lose the impact that i wish to make

<s> perhaps i may ask the noble lord a couple of questions in order to try to clarify the position <e> <s> i am very grateful to him for the care he has taken in replying <e> <s> he did refer to a combined approach between the public sector and the private sector and he referred to what the minister in the other place said that they did not want to have competition between the public and

basis of the convention <e> <s> also i ought to apologise to the noble lord lord elton because i was not in my place when the debate started although i arrived at the palace of westminster at this morning and had no idea that things were moving with such speed <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i ask him whether the government will consider giving wide publicity to this bill <e> <s> as the convention points out offences relating to nuclear material are a matter of very grave concern <e> <s> in view of the width and care with which this bill has been prepared by the government it seems to me that in the public interest it may be a good thing from my insular way of looking at matters if good publicity were given to this bill so that the public understands the kind of extensive steps that the government are taking in dealing with this matter of such grave concern <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones has said there is a lacuna in the bill which has been discussed at earlier stages in this house <e> <s> the lacuna is that there has been a failure to clarify indeed to set out what are the duties of this registrar <e> <s> to use the happy phrase of the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones silence about these duties can only bring confusion and misunderstandings <e> <s> therefore these amendments have the full support of these benches <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the appeal that has been made to the government that in the context of this very controversial clause clarification as to who is to be satisfied should be introduced <e> <s> i strongly support the amendment on the grounds that lord mishcon has explained so clearly <e>", "<cs> the noble lord the minister if i may say so with the greatest respect and i am not being cynical about this has read his brief with the great charm that he always has in this house <e> <s> but he did not deal with the point which my noble friend lord simon indicated earlier <e> <s> the minister said that certain groups had been established that steering groups had been set up to study certain matters <e> <s> what he did not deal with and this is fundamental to this amendment was what my noble friend lord simon said that the government and british shipbuilders should in the present circumstances lead the way and set an example to encourage employee involvement <e> <s> so far as i understood the speech of the noble lord the minister and if i am wrong i will apologise there was no indication in his reply that there was a definite attempt by the government to encourage

woolsack for his presentation of this matter <e> <s> at this stage i should like to raise rather a technical point <e> <s> i apologise to the noble and learned lord that i have not given him advance

lords that it will be quite a brief speech thereafter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful again to the noble lord lord skelmersdale <e> <s> so what he is encouraging me to do is to withdraw amendment no <e> <s> at this stage <e> <s> i am only asking for clarification about this matter because this advice is totally contrary to what i received this afternoon from the ministers office <e> <s> he is inviting me to withdraw amendment no <e> <s> so that i can speak on amendment no <e> <s> after dinner <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i support the main theme of the amendment and in doing so i am pleased again to congratulate the noble lord lord skelmersdale on the clarity of his speech the flexibility in presenting his case and the sympathy he showed to the water industry qualities he displayed when dealing with amendments of mine at an earlier stage <e> <s> reference has been made to the wessex authority <e> <s> i had the privilege of visiting that water authority in connection with my membership of the house of lords select committee on science and technology <e> <s> it was clear to us that the wessex authority was very enlightened and there is no doubt that in the circumstances appertaining at that time their body known as the local water advisory committee was doing good work <e> <s> however the example of wessex has in my experience not been repeated often with other kinds of authority <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may continue the debate on the first amendment to the british shipbuilders bill first may i thank the noble lord lord trefgarne on behalf of my noble friend lord simon for his letter of th april which dealt with two points which had been raised by my noble friend lord simon when speaking to the question whether clause shall stand part of the bill <e> <s> at the committee stage <e> <s> it has been emphasised on this side of the house that this is essentially a bad bill <e> <s> it is irrelevant to the needs of the country it adds nothing to its productivity it gives no assistance at all towards increasing the wealth of the nation <e> <s> therefore i strongly support the main theme of the amendment moved so clearly a few minutes ago by the noble lord lord bruce of donington <e>", "<cs> my lords may i briefly follow the noble lord lord campbell of alloway in <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord for introducing this amendment <e> <s> the words from time to time which were originally put forward by the government were attacked by me at earlier stages of the bill as indicating that the government might be amending the guidance notices rather frequently <e> <s> but the noble lord lord skelmersdale has given the house an assurance that if any amendments of the guidance notices which have been recently agreed are necessary there will be full consultation with the water authorities with the departments and with the public and private sectors <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble lord the minister i first read this amendment with a great deal of sympathy for the general theme behind the three subsections <e> <s> i then reminded myself that my noble friend lord simon had spoken very strongly against this bill on second reading <e> <s> but i also reminded myself that it was the constitutional duty of this house as a revising chamber to try to be helpful <e> <s> therefore basically it seemed to me that it would be helpful to include a new clause headed <e>", "<cs> in rising to support this amendment i think that it would be appropriate for me to make a somewhat neutral introduction <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord ponsonby of shulbrede that this is a bad bill but we on these benches will endeavour to be constructive in the amendments we are proposing <e> <s> it is ironic that the governments overwhelming and almost passionate desires for the so-called liberalisation of the market for the provision of telecommunications equipment and the governments announcement that it is giving new <e>", "<cs> the noble lord the minister has emphasised the fact that one of the main reasons why he has to reject this amendment is that the range of organisations to be consulted is so large and he has mentioned many other organisations <e> <s> however there are two defects in his argument <e>", "<cs> i apologise for interrupting but i was not pressing that aspect of the amendments <e> <s> i was concentrating as i thought the noble lord was doing only on amendment no <e> <s> as to whether a council would be helpful for any purpose <e> <s> as my noble friend lord ezra indicated help would appear to be required and therefore we are considering only that aspect <e> <s> i entirely agree with the noble lord that there are difficulties about amendments nos <e> <s> and and possibly but i am not concerned with the details of the structure or scope of the council at the present time <e>", "<cs> we have had a very long and interesting debate on amendment no <e> <s> and i should like to thank those noble lords who have taken <e>", "<cs> my lords i must first apologise to the house because my name does not appear on the list of speakers which is entirely my fault due to a hitch in the usual channels <e> <s> nevertheless i shall be very brief <e> <s> i also welcome this bill and i should like to congratulate the government on bringing it forward so quickly having discovered the lacuna that exists dating right back to the companies act <e> <s> the noble and learned lord the lord advocate has explained the necessity for this bill <e> <s> as the noble lord lord bruce of donington said if a bill with retrospective provisions were brought to this house we certainly we on these benches would oppose it strongly <e> <s> nevertheless as this is such an exceptional case i feel sure that the passage of this bill will not he taken as a precedent for introducing bills with retrospective effect <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord the minister on two counts <e> <s> the first is for allowing me to intervene albeit very briefly although my name is not on the list in accordance with the usual practice <e> <s> secondly i should also like to join with the noble lord lord bruce of donington in thanking the minister for his concise and short speech in introducing this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make two short observations <e> <s> first to echo the words of my noble friend lord winstanley the implementation of many of the matters referred to in the statement will require a cautious approach <e> <s> my second observation is to declare an interest in that i had the privilege of being a member of the inquiry into the pharmaceutical industry <e> <s> chaired so ably by my <e>", "<cs> my lords may i join the noble lord lord bruce of donington in a short speech thanking the government for being so quick in their action on the consolidation of the companies acts <e> <s> the professions and industry will very much welcome the progress that has so far been made in consolidating these many acts <e> <s> as a member of the select committee on consolidation i look forward to seeing this matter reaching us as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> we have had a long and interesting debate on this important matter and i am grateful to all who have spoken if i may presume to say so <e> <s> i was very grateful to the noble lord the minister because he came a long way towards me at least in so far as my sentiments are concerned <e> <s> i felt that the theme as it were behind my amendment touched him and he was kind enough to say a few words about me personally <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down having regard to his great experience in these matters can i ask him this if the potential candidate gets so badly knocked about before a select committee of the house of commons and really <e>", "<cs> as a member of the liberalisation committee may i take the opportunity of congratulating the noble lord lord spens for the objective way in which he conducted the proceedings <e> <s> he said that the group was sponsoring all these amendments but this is one amendment which i was reluctant to sponsor for the very reason given by the noble lord lord campbell of alloway <e> <s> i was also worried about the words relevant functions <e> <s> they would be difficult to define <e> <s> as the noble lord lord spens indicated this is a probing amendment but if it were moved to a division i could not support it <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord the minister for his reply <e> <s> he brought himself into the arena and as the noble and learned lord sitting alongside him knows if even a person of the greatest authority pulls himself into the arena he is liable to be attacked <e> <s> on this occasion i shall not make any comment about the personal observations that he made about his longevity and his long period in office <e> <s> but the noble lord the minister is really not in tune with the facts of life in regard to this industry <e> <s> why should he with all his experience know anything very much about industry except on the fringe <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord stoddart has put the case far better than i could have done <e> <s> in view of that speech i am sure that the noble lord the minister will want to take this matter back and think about it again before report stage <e> <s> i am sure that that would be an easier and more gracious way to deal with it <e> <s> the example that i gave of a man being appointed at the age of was a bad one <e> <s> it is quite likely that a man may be appointed at the age of <e> <s> he may be very successful and go on until he is <e> <s> he is then eligible for reappointment and goes on until he is <e> <s> but by that time he will probably be completely out of date about activities in this field <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble lord the minister for what he has said <e> <s> i can cnly repeat if i may say so quite bluntly that he has no very clear idea of the circumstances under which this man would work and of what an advantage it would be somehow to limit the term of office of any man who is appointed along the lines that i suggest <e> <s> but it is no good my trying to press this amendment any further <e> <s> i shall think about what the minister has said and perhaps raise the matter at a later stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> earlier this evening the committee heard a very powerful submission from an ex-chairman of the conservative party lord thorneycroft <e> <s> he said how exceptional this post of director general of oftel is and that it is important to find an exceptional man for an exceptional post <e> <s> therefore i was interested in the ministers statement that the director general will be a crown servant <e> <s> he went on to say that there are comparable posts <e> <s> the post with which he compared that of the director general of oftel was the director general of fair trading <e> <s> he said also that the fixing of the salary of the director general of oftel would be on the same basis as that for the director general of fair trading <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may press the minister further because he has said that the post of the director general of oftel is comparable with that of the director of the office of fair trading <e>", "<cs> my lords so that the answer of the noble lord the minister can be complete is he able to tell the house now or at a later date the amount of loans specifically directed to companies in wales <e>", "<cs> i hope that noble lords will think that my brief intervention is both reasonable and practicable because had the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon intended to force this amendment to a division then i would have voted for him that these words should be eliminated <e> <s> they only add unnecessary confusion and should be deleted <e>", "<cs> it is with great temerity even greater than that of the noble lord lord elwyn-jones that i venture to differ from the noble and learned lord lord edmund-davies particularly as when he was elevated to the bench as a judge of first instance i took over his chambers and indeed the very room where he had performed with such distinction for many years <e> <s> but i agree entirely with the submission of the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones in this matter that this phrase merely adds confusion and should be deleted <e>", "<cs> may i presume to follow the really devastating criticisms of the last part of the ministers speech which came from the lips of the noble and learned lord lord edmund-davies and for a few moments try to analyse for the benefit of all of us who have anxiety in this matter what the noble lord the minister is really saying because basically he is coming towards us on this side on certain aspects <e> <s> he started by expressing genuine concern at this general anxiety an anxiety which most noble lords share <e> <s> what were his arguments to satisfy us that there was no real anxiety worth talking about <e> <s> his words were there are no unfounded fears and he followed that with three points in support <e> <s> one of them was that of course there is no incentive to increase costs because that will only reduce the number of people using the services <e> <s> the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe dealt with that adequately when he referred to the fact that in the future we shall be dealing with a public liability company out to get a certain amount of profit <e>", "<cs> in his charming and eloquent speech the noble lord the minister has agreed with me and other noble lords how terribly important are directory services <e> <s> he has recounted how important they are to the blind and the disabled and he has taken us through this terribly complex bill to explain that simple fact <e> <s> he has found it necessary to quote from the bill to justify that simple point on which we are all agreed but he has missed entirely the main point of my argument <e> <s> this is the whole thing <e> <s> he tells us that directory services are mentioned in the bill <e> <s> how does he do this <e> <s> he takes us very quickly to page but i am used to people taking things quickly <e>", "<cs> i wish that the ministers on the government bench would lift their visors just a little perhaps take off their helmets and sheath their swords which have been somewhat blunted this afternoon and adopt a more human practical view of some of the amendments <e> <s> i say to them that we are not trying to catch you out we are not trying to trip you up <e> <s> we are just asking on this occasion for a simple reference to directory services in the particularised list <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> it seems that my amendment has been agreed to by the government <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the noble lord the minister <e> <s> in the general excitement of the praise that he was giving to my speech i missed the fact that he was going to take the matter back <e> <s> i thought i heard him say that he was going to stand fast on something or other but perhaps he is not standing so fast as i thought he was <e> <s> i shall be very grateful to the noble lord the minister if he is going to take hack the matter <e> <s> clearly on the understanding that on this occasion i am right and that he will be taking back the matter i shall not press the amendment hut instead beg leave to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> i agree with the minister that the drafting is not perfect i said so in my speech <e> <s> but the main theme of the reply is simply that the government do not envisage any of the problems which i have presumed to put before your lordships today <e> <s> i agree with him also that it is a legal matter <e> <s> it involves legal matters with which i have been concerned professionally for years <e> <s> therefore it comes down to this the government lawyers do not think there are any problems but certain lawyers outside consider there may be problems and are trying to help by putting forward an amendment of this kind <e> <s> if the noble lord takes the view that there are no problems at any rate the matter has been aired <e> <s> when <e>", "<cs> i understand that the noble lord the minister says that as drafted parts iv and vi have nothing to do with the secretary of state <e> <s> i do not quite understand why the noble lord should take such a positive view that the secretary of state has nothing to do with parts iv and vi of the bill <e> <s> they are quite brief parts dealing with cable and wireless matters and i should have thought that they would come within the jurisdiction of the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> may i express my gratitude to the noble lord lord mottistone for pointing out the position as regards part iv <e> <s> i was surprised to hear the minister laying his argument on part iv when the noble lord lord mottistone says that part iv might be rejected altogether and eliminated from the bill <e> <s> i understand that that is right <e> <s> perhaps the minister would like to comment <e> <s> is the noble lord lord mottistone correct in saying that part iv in the future will be taken out of the bill <e> <s> therefore in so far as his argument rests on part iv it is resting on sand and is of no consequence <e>", "<cs> the noble lord the minster made no comment to me <e> <s> perhaps when he has consulted his notes he will be able to listen <e> <s> i am in no hurry although i thought that the government was <e> <s> i do not want to delay the committee <e> <s> i only want to ask one simple point <e> <s> that is to ask what he has to say about what lord mottistone stated that part iv is to be eliminated from the bill <e> <s> his initial argument he has had some help since then based on part iv is really totally irrelevant <e> <s> i have always been brought up on the understanding that when a clock strikes i get very suspicious of its mechanism <e> <s> when therefore the noble lord rests his case on part iv and that is not going to be in the bill i get a little suspicious that his argument in relation to part v and even part vi may not be so sound as it appeared <e>", "<cs> may i <e>", "<cs> paper has been flowing backwards and forwards from the government front bench to dark corners of your lordships house for some time <e> <s> i shall not delay the committee any longer or cause more confusion between the noble lord lord mottistone and the minister on this question <e> <s> i shall read what has been said today and see whether something can be sorted out for another occasion <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i hesitate to prolong this discussion but the noble lord the minister has frequently referred to the legal position <e> <s> he has developed the most convoluted argument to show that the term manufacturers must be understood by looking through about two pages of words to decide that manufacturers are in it <e> <s> as he has said that manufacturers are so important and everybody agrees about that i should have thought that he could have put the word manufacturers after the word consumers as suggested in the amendment and as supported by the noble lord lord weinstock <e> <s> it would save all this discussion in such a convoluted way <e>", "<cs> this statute will not always he directed to lawyers <e> <s> if we were discussing whether this was perfectly plain to lawyers then perhaps i might agree with him but this is a statute for the public for members of the industry <e> <s> we want to avoid them having to go to lawyers to decide whether manufacturers are here <e> <s> the government should <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble and learned lord i anticipated getting a reply of that kind indicating to me that it was implicit that the word innovation was there in its general spirit <e> <s> but i want something more than that <e> <s> i want to see the word innovation stressed wherever possible <e> <s> of course i anticipated and i am very grateful to the noble lord lord peyton for his speech that he would point out that he was so happy to see me supporting the prime minister <e> <s> my support of the prime minister is only limited but it is nevertheless very sincere in the views that she has about the encouragement of small businesses the encouragement of innovation and the desirability of protecting inventions by intellectual property as will be dealt with in the next amendment <e> <s> although the spirit of the answer from the government goes quite a long way in my view it is not adequate to rely on innovation being implicit in the words of a bill of this kind <e> <s> i shall test the feeling of the committee <e>", "<cs> i strongly recommend this amendment to the committee <e> <s> the creation of a consultative body of this kind would protect i <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord the minister allow me to intervene <e>", "<cs> the noble lord the minister has a complete misunderstanding of this situation as he has if i may say so of many others <e> <s> the amendment to which this is identical was the one <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a very complicated bill and i and members sitting on this <e>", "<cs> your lordships will know that the party to which i have the honour to belong has a long tradition in strongly supporting matters relating to privacy and the human rights of the individual <e> <s> many of your lordships will still remember the many interventions made by the late leader of my party whose sudden death we all so greatly mourn <e> <s> noble lords will no doubt remember the many interventions he made in your lordships house on this very matter of human rights and questions of privacy <e> <s> in view of the powerful speech of the noble lord lord mishcon with all of which i certainly agree echoing as he has done the powerful words of the noble and learned lord lord diplock i shall be very brief <e> <s> i merely want to say that if the noble lord decides to move to a division then we on these benches will certainly support him in that <e>", "<cs> may i briefly intervene on clause because if i remember rightly when amendment no <e> <s> dealing with the formation of a council was raised i believe that it was withdrawn on the understanding that there would be some modifications to clause by way of an amendment at the report stage <e> <s> i merely want to clarify whether the noble lord the minister has that in mind <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble lord the minister <e>", "<cs> i am certainly not going to follow the noble lord lord bruce in being perverse <e>", "<cs> in view of the fact that on many occasions during the committee stage i have been rather chasing the noble lord the minister if that is the correct expression about the difficulties there may be in relation to the export trade in all fairness i should now like to say that much of what the noble lord has just said in dealing with the main parts of the amendments may be a great help not only to british industry but to the government <e> <s> his statement followed the speech of the noble lord lord brookes who emphasised how essential it was to compete outside the united kingdom <e> <s> he said that a target of per cent in the american market would be something that should be sought <e> <s> i intervened merely to say that the noble lord lord cockfield has gone some some way to deal in general terms though perhaps not as specifically as i should like with the criticisms i made of the bill in relation to the export trade <e>", "<cs> i am glad to see the noble earl lord halsbury in his place and that he has recovered from his illness of yesterday because i have been asked by the noble lord lord spens to intervene since this is a simple amendment dealing with anti-competitive practices <e> <s> the noble earl has explained the purpose of what i understand to be a probing amendment so as to get the attitude of the government in this matter <e> <s> i would support the general theme of this amendment <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord the minister replies i should like to ask what are the notes which the noble lord lord bruce of donington is relying upon <e> <s> it would seem to me that there is far closer collaboration between the government front bench and the opposition front bench than there is with these benches because we have had no notes at all in regard to this matter <e> <s> i am sure that it is just one of those accidents of fortune or misfortune which befall some of us sometimes <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble lord lord bruce of donington is not suggesting that we are not interested in the financial parts of the bill <e> <s> we are as interested although we are perhaps not quite so eloquent about it as he is <e> <s> we would have liked to have the notes in order to consider this matter intelligently <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down as he has had the advantage of seeing the governments financial notes on this matter may i as another innocent if i may associate myself with the noble lord <e> <s> lord cockfield ask him about subsection of clause which refers to any dividend or other sums <e> <s> is there any information in the financial notes about the amount involved <e> <s> it would be very interesting to know what we are talking about in terms of finance <e>", "<cs> before the noble and learned lord answers that question i have a question which is to some extent supplementary to what the noble lord lord weinstock had in mind <e> <s> the noble and learned lord in his cogent and clear presentation of the substance of this amendment said that it was an exceptional method for exceptional needs <e> <s> he then went on to say that he was satisfied that it conformed with the relevant eec regulations in respect of certain aspects with which this amendment is concerned <e> <s> will he tell the committee either now or at a later stage what are the eec regulations that he has in mind <e> <s> i realise that this is a technical question but in some way it supplements what the noble lord lord weinstock has raised as a possible problem to deal with <e>", "<cs> can the noble lord give the reference number <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to those members of the house who have spoken in this debate <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble baroness lady macleod for her kind words about me <e> <s> i am sorry if i confused her by changing the name council to authority and back again <e> <s> perhaps it is some consolation to her that like shakespeare i say whats in a name <e> <s> it is the fundamental theme behind the name which is of such importance <e> <s> i am <e>", "<cs> my lords while rising to support this amendment i have been wondering whether it goes far enough <e> <s> i feel as the amendment proposes that the costs and expenses of the director of telecommunications should be paid for as referred to in clause but that subsection is limited largely to staff and associated expenses of the telecommunications directorate <e> <s> it does not say anything about the cost of advisory bodies <e> <s> in view of the fact that these advisory bodies will certainly have a great deal to advise about i think that they should have been included generally and that the costs of people advising should also be paid by this means <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for his succinct reply on this occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with what the noble lord lord bruce of donington has said that the wording of amendment no <e> <s> to which the noble lord the minister has referred does not protect the consumer or the persons in the rural areas in the way in which he is suggesting <e> <s> i understand that the minister is saying that there is something defective in relation to the amendment that was passed by your lordships at the committee stage and that he is seeking to put that right <e> <s> but with respect the wording of amendment no <e> <s> at any rate alone does not do anything except add words to an already very large bill <e> <s> it is a cosmetic amendment and adds nothing of value to protect consumers or the persons in rural areas <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be churlish not to thank the noble lord the minister for his cogent explanation and for putting forward this amendment <e> <s> i produced an amendment at the committee stage to the effect that directory services should be particularised in clause b together with things like emergency services public call-box services and so on for which all reasonable demands should be satisfied <e>", "<cs> my lords i too support the amendment <e> <s> throughout the bill i have found it difficult to understand the full meaning of the phrase effective competition between <e> <s> it arises i suppose from a kind of professional blindness as most of my life is concerned with competition matters in the european community context the research and development activities of various firms and anti-trust matters <e> <s> it seems to me that the words a free and fair competitive opportunity are an improvement <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble and learned lord for that explanation <e> <s> what i understand is that the government have decided that new techniques includes new products <e> <s> that is certainly a great advance in new technology which i have never heard about before <e> <s> however in view of the very positive way in which i understand that the noble lord lord bruce of donington wants to speak <e> <s> i was winding up but perhaps the noble lord wishes to intervene <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for including new products within the meaning of techniques <e> <s> in these circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure whether the question put by the noble lord lord mottistone was an answer to the one that i was about to put <e> <s> however i put my question to the minister before he sits down to use the normal formula <e> <s> i understood that the noble lord lord orr-ewing was saying that amendment no <e> <s> with its reference to section of the act was in no way an answer to his amendment to ensure that the available civil radio spectrum would be sufficiently used <e> <s> he was in effect saying as i understood him that the act is irrelevant now to this matter <e> <s> i should like the minister to say either yes or no to that position <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand from what the noble lord the minister is saying that he accepts this amendment because i have not so far heard any amendment moved perhaps it has been spoken to to protect the interests of people living in rural areas on the lines that i have done <e> <s> it may be that the noble lord has made some speeches about this on many occasions but this is the first amendment that has been moved in this house in relation to the protection of persons in rural areas for the charges which i have set out in my amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i have not yet heard any argument put by the government in relation to this specific amendment <e> <s> as the noble lord said rural areas are not mentioned in my amendment but they are mentioned in another amendment to which he referred namely amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i am talking about geographical areas <e> <s> i apologise if i have misunderstood the noble lord but so far he has put forward no specific points as to why my amendment cannot be accepted <e> <s> i agree that he has spoken at length in relation to amendment no <e> <s> and i listened to him very carefully when he mentioned aspects of amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> but the amendment now before the house is a totally different one <e> <s> it deals with charges associated with condition of the licence and i am on record i hope as saying once again that so far i have heard no criticism of the amendment of any substance at all <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord the minister for his explanation and particularly for the assurance he gave in almost the last sentences when he said that his amendment no <e> <s> will achieve more effectively the objective that i have in mind in my amendment <e> <s> at this late hour i do not wish to become involved in a procedural wrangle with noble lords on the government front bench <e> <s> i shall read in <e>", "<cs> my lords i suppose it is my fault really in trying to save time that i led the noble lord the minister into something of a trap so that he therefore felt that he should abbreviate his reply much more extensively than he otherwise would have done <e> <s> at this late hour i do not want to bring the noble lord the minister to his feet again <e> <s> i will consider what little he has so far told the house in reply to this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i also find these amendments complicated <e> <s> i do not want to delay the house any longer but i should like to a ask the noble and learned lord a question in regard to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it is a simple question <e> <s> the amendment proposes to give power to the director to give assistance in relation to certain proceedings <e> <s> can the noble and learned lord say whether the ordinary terms of the legal aid acts will apply in regard to the proceedings contemplated in the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble and learned lord <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord sits down in order to clarify my mind on what can be a very important subject for industrialists at any rate when the noble and learned lord says that he intends what does he have in mind <e> <s> is he proposing to put terms in the licences <e> <s> is that what he means by intending to do something <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very much obliged to the noble and leaned lord for this cogent explanation <e> <s> i am not completely satisfied <e> <s> nor do i quite understand the scope of his answer at this stage and i reserve the right to raise the matter again if need he at a later stage of the bill <e> <s> meanwhile i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>",

unconstitutional at this late hour in the morning <e> <s> but having regard to what he has said i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i intervene before the noble and learned

way illegal it would be possible for a person to circumvent the enforcement of certain procedures to which as he explained the government attach great importance <e> <s> if i may make an analogy i

dealing with the first amendment realising of course that the minister has also been directing his attention to the other amendments which i did not move at all in my speech <e> <s> i am merely concerned that this bill has no safeguards introduced to it to protect inventions designs know-how copyright and all the matters that are known as intellectual property <e> <s> i believe that it is

just sat down has had a distinguished career in the ministry of defence and he knows a great deal about these matters <e> <s> however the position of decca and racal where decca was taken over by racal is totally different from the position which would arise under this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i do not know whether i should make any comments in relation to what the noble viscount lord trenchard has said <e> <s> he has raised a most important point <e> <s> as i would expect with his experience in the department he understands the real problems that will arise in regard to inventions designs copyrights and drawings <e> <s> i am sorry to pursue the matter that the noble viscount has raised but say for example that there is a contract between the government and a firm in the united kingdom <e> <s> then because perhaps the money is better perhaps the circumstances are better they decide to transfer the property which is the subject of that contract with the united kingdom firm to a united states firm <e> <s> where is the safeguard in relation to avoiding a business arrangement of that kind <e> <s> of course it would lead to litigation forthwith but that is the kind of bother that happens when you do not apply special schemes to intellectual property <e> <s> therefore the object of this amendment is to highlight the question of the importance of

middleton said <e> <s> my view is that perhaps the noble lord lord sandford is a little premature in pressing this matter quite so hard as he has done because there is a promise by the government to

matter as that indicated in at least the first part of the ministers reply <e> <s> in view of the support i have received from everybody else who has spoken i shall take the opinion of the house <e>",

conservation matters <e> <s> i agree that this is probably on a slightly different aspect but it seems to me that the amendment of the noble lord lord montagu of beaulieu as it stands giving a grace

proper that that period should be maintained <e> <s> therefore if necessary i would vote against the amendment proposed by the noble viscount lord craigavon <e> <s> i do not know what the noble lord

illness <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the basically unsatisfactory answer of the noble lord the minister to my noble friend lord ezra can the noble lord give an undertaking that the pollution

happiness <e>", "<cs> as i am a member of the same party as the noble baroness lady stedman i think i can without much danger say that this amendment has been covered by the previous discussion and is therefore not moved <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord very much for giving way <e> <s> if he reads the article he will see that it refers to london parks although it emphasises and particularises hampstead heath solely <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lords lord graham and lord banks for their support in this matter and i am grateful to the noble lord the minister for the lucid way in which he has approached the matter and particularly for the details he has given me relating to this park <e> <s> but the point i am raising and the difficulties that my noble friend lord banks raised with

specialised knowledge will be available through the gre arrangements <e>", "<cs> i have a very high regard for the noble lord the minister and in his reply to my speech he indicated his great sympathy with the area <e> <s> however i have developed the case that this is one of the unique parks in london and therefore in those circumstances it requires special attention <e> <s> what the noble lord is saying to me is we have now a borough who i or my right honourable friends will go along and see and we will ask them what they are going to do <e> <s> surely that does not take me anywhere on the point that i raised <e> <s> this is an area of great national importance and of great historical interest which requires special attention in order that resources shall be provided at least to maintain the area in its present condition <e>", "<cs> certainly <e>", "<cs> i am deeply grateful to the noble lord lord graham for mentioning that <e> <s> i was fully aware of that unhappy situation

did not want to introduce at this late stage of the evening any acrid atmosphere of municipal or borough controversy in relation to the past but i ask the noble lord the minister to recognise that

the borough may change of course we may even have an alliance borough there one day <e> <s> i do not know what would happen in those circumstances but i am certainly not being tempted in the presence of the right reverend prelate to make any prophecies on these matters <e> <s> nevertheless i am afraid that the minister has not adequately considered the fact that this is a special area and that in view of its unique position it should be more closely within the control of the department of the environment and that the department of the environment should be the planning authority <e> <s> i do not think i am going to get very far this evening on this point <e>", "<cs> i am unhappy to see the noble lord nodding his head in agreement with me over the fact that i am not going to make any headway but <e>", "<cs> may i agree with one matter <e> <s> the noble lord has dealt with my submissions very courteously and in a great deal of detail and he has given certain assurances <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord will not mind me saying that in my view those assurances do not go far enough in relation to this matter <e> <s> the noble lord the minister gives his case away when he refers to me as perhaps having an ulterior motive in this <e>", "<cs> the noble lord the minister suggested that i might be here not necessarily tonight but perhaps later on trying to get some protection for all green spaces in london <e> <s> when he refers to holland park merely as a green space he really gives his case away <e> <s> but i am not proposing to pursue this matter any further <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble baroness lady stedman <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i congratulate the minister on his frankness on this matter <e> <s> in order to save him

at large come to it <e> <s> it is not merely a park associated with kensington <e> <s> it is not a municipal park <e>", "<cs> with respect as a lawyer the words special pleading have a significance

run it <e> <s> it has available to it resources and expertise which are not at present available to the borough council <e>", "<cs> yes most certainly <e>", "<cs> the noble lord the minister goes from every piece of greenery to a public park but this is acres of historic buildings <e> <s> we have a little saying in wales that a little chink lets in much light and i rather felt that we ought to get more sympathy than that from the minister <e> <s> before i ask leave to withdraw these amendments as holland park is such an historic area it is unique in london i am asking on various grounds that it should be dealt with separately from some municipal park or to use the words of the noble lord the minister a piece of greenery <e> <s> i am asking whether perhaps the noble lord the minister would be good enough to receive a deputation from the kensington society to discuss this matter a little further <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord the minister for that and on that basis i beg leave to

only your lordships but also the community at large which is concerned with waste disposal <e>", "<cs> i hesitate to intervene but i understand from the few remarks now made by the noble lord lord

rate support grant for wales and particularly for dyfed and north pembrokeshire will be far more generous than it has been in the past <e>", "<cs> i put my name to this amendment because the government said that what we are now dealing with is a major bill <e> <s> they have also said that we are dealing with an oil-operating agency which will be trading and operating in market conditions

is a generalisation to which i am sure the noble viscount would not wish to adhere <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the noble viscount for clarifying that position <e> <s> i thought he was making a great case for the effectiveness of british industry in this field and that therefore the government are satisfied that by this transfer the implications raised by the noble lord lord graham are irrelevant

specific reference although there may be a reason for this or i may have overlooked it to wales and the position in wales <e> <s> will the secretary of state indicate at this stage whether there are any specific proposals dealing with wales in relation to this important matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i follow the right reverend prelate in expressing my surprise at the narrow legalistic view directed

government must have in mind wider regional policy and they should endeavour to encourage regional airports <e> <s> i heard the eloquent statements of several noble lords on the other side of the house about how regional airports encourage employment and are a great asset regionally <e> <s> i strongly support the amendment on the grounds that if that attitude is adopted by the government it will generate employment <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to make a short preamble to my own remarks in support of this amendment <e> <s> my noble friend lord tordoff has asked me formally to apologise for the fact that he is unable to be present today at the report stage <e> <s> my noble friend mentioned this point at committee stage i believe and certainly he mentioned his position to the front bench of the government <e> <s> however he has thought fit to put down his name in support of about amendments at this stage of the bill <e> <s> at rather short notice i have been asked to stand in for my noble friend <e> <s> it is an interesting situation in which i find myself <e> <s> accordingly i have prepared myself by reading everything my noble friend lord tordoff said during the three days of the committee stage <e> <s> i have read all the amendments and the conclusions i have come to may help the house to shorten the proceedings on this report stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to enter into the rather acrid atmosphere of party controversy by mentioning the rhetorical reference to these benches but before the noble lord sits down may i say to him that it is true that in the reply in this house given by the parliamentary under-secretary to the department of transport it was said that the <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank

searches there and had i had more notice of what had happened <e> <s> however if there is any further correspondence i should be grateful if i could be sent copies of it <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down may i go back to the question i asked about the scope of the word securities <e> <s> is it merely limited to shares and therefore are the government not claiming any immunity in regard to any other assets which they propose to offer for sale <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very much obliged to the noble earl <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for explaining the scope of the new clause <e> <s> like the noble lord lord carmichael i wonder what is the magic of the three-tenths <e> <s> is the minister able to clarify the per cent <e> <s> in subsection <e> <s> is there any reason apart from taking a figure more or less out of the air <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister kindly let me have a copy of this correspondence because i am a little confused about the particular conditions and circumstances in the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for interrupting the noble lord but i am trying to follow his argument <e> <s> he has referred to the previous argument at the committee stage at which i was not present <e> <s> would it be convenient for him to tell me where that can be found in the appropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down perhaps he would kindly let me see any future correspondence because as regards the discussion on this particular point i find that i do not understand the argument of the noble lord lord

noble earl asking me personally a question about this matter <e> <s> it seems to me that he has misunderstood the purpose of this amendment and does not realise how helpful it would be in relation to

did not hear what he said but i am sure it was very useful <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish simply to say how delighted i am if this news is correct <e>", "<cs> i also have been approached on this matter strange to say and i hope that the government will take care to consider this very carefully even at this late hour <e>", "<cs> my lords i join the noble lord lord williams of elvel in his tribute to the ministers who have dealt with this bill <e> <s> may i also thank them for the tolerance and sympathy which they have extended to me in coming in as a substitute for my noble friend lord tordoff <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord the minister say either now or later whether this matter has been considered in the context of the ec and in particular of articles and of the treaty of rome <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very much obliged <e>", "<cs> my lords there are two grounds on which i presume to intervene so late in the evening <e> <s> first of all i should like to thank the minister very much indeed for the letters and copies of letters from many places which he sent to me after the helpful discussions which took place at report stage when my noble friend lord tordoff was not able to be present <e> <s> what has also inspired me to speak if i may say so has been to use a word that the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> used when he referred to me only last week in another context the somewhat naive intervention of the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter on this very simple matter <e> <s> it seemed to me that this was a realistic and practical little point which members of this house would find no difficulty in accepting that we should substitute the word throughout for the word in on the lines of the argument cogently put forward by the noble lord lord carmichael <e>", "<cs> may i intervene and declare an interest in that i am a member of the select committee dealing with these consolidation matters <e> <s> i should like to join the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones in praise for the work of the noble and learned lord lord brightman and also for the work of the principal witnesses <e> <s> the principal witnesses did an extremely fine job in relation to this bill <e>", "<cs> i must make a confession in that i was not present when the select committee considered this matter <e> <s> but is it technically correct that the gas act which has not yet passed through this chamber should be now inserted into this bill <e>", "<cs> of course i will accept what the noble and learned lord has said <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord graham of edmonton with his customary tolerance and kindness has referred to many noble lords who have taken part in this debate <e> <s> he referred very kindly to my noble friend lord mayhew <e> <s> he referred to and praised the noble and learned lord lord denning and he praised the great contribution made by the noble baroness lady vickers <e> <s> of course he referred to the charm and tolerance of the minister <e> <s> but i do not think i shall disclose any secret if say that i was a member of a small group who used to meet occasionally to discuss these matters on dockyards with helpful members of trade unions and other experts but the initiative in this matter lay almost wholly with the noble lord lord graham of edmonton <e> <s> therefore i make this brief intervention to disclose i am sure i am embarrassing him that the initiative on so much of the work on this dockyards bill emanated from the noble lord lord graham of edmonton <e> <s> i am sure many of us are grateful to him <e>", "<cs> like the noble lord lord williams of elvel i was surprised to find that this amendment was necessary <e> <s> i have tried to understand what the minister has said on this matter <e> <s> is he really saying that the ordinary law does not cover this situation in protecting investors and that the amendment is necessary or is it merely an oversight in the bill <e> <s> is it the inadequacy of the present law that has triggered off the necessity to have this amendment <e> <s> i still do not understand the ministers explanation but that is entirely my fault i am sure <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> that helps to clarify the position <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down perhaps i may ask him a simple question i am aware that the noble lord has considerable experience of american practice in these matters <e> <s> the noble lord lord morris in his speech made great play with the situation in america which he used to enforce his arguments <e> <s> does the noble lord <e> <s> lord slacking support those arguments of the noble lord lord morris <e> <s> he made no reference to the practice in the united states of america of which he has great experience <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord very much <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to repeat what the noble lord lord bruce of donington has said these amendments are technical and complicated but they are useful and will assist i think the jurisprudence in relation to intellectual property to be more closely affiliated to the needs and the atmosphere of the treaty of rome in relation to which we have to consider many of these international problems <e>", "<cs> before the noble and learned lord sits down may i say that i have been trying to follow his answer to the noble viscount lord colville as to why it is necessary in the context of this bill to have a specific reference <e>", "<cs> i am much obliged for that support <e>", "<cs> my lords i am so sorry to interrupt the noble and learned lord in his most interesting dissertation but i am having some difficulty in following from where he is reading in this interesting and excellent report <e> <s> if he would be so kind as to mention either the paragraph or the page from which he is reading i should be very much obliged <e> <s> i am very grateful to the noble and learned lord for giving way <e>", "<cs> my lords i have been lured into making a few brief observations in reply to observations made by the noble viscount lord colville of culross in his interesting and eloquent speech to your lordships a few minues ago <e> <s> he emphasised how important it is to cut down on litigation wherever possible <e> <s> for my part i have practised exclusively in the field of intellectual property

technicalities of simple science <e>", "<cs> my lords it might be helpful to the noble lord lord williams and myself if the noble lord could give some indication as to the scope of the representations that have been made <e> <s> i do not press this point but it may be helpful to clarify the problems which face us <e>", "<cs> my lords may i presume to congratulate the secretary of state and recognise the deep sincerity he feels in dealing with this dreadful question of unemployment <e> <s> is he aware that the <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister help on how long it will be before the matter relating to fishermen will be dealt with and published <e>", "<cs> my lords it is with great pleasure that i rise to support the bill which has been so clearly and succinctly presented by the noble viscount lord montgomery <e> <s> i must declare an interest in this matter because when i last supported the main theme of the bill presented by the noble viscount some years ago i was not quite in the position in which i find myself now <e> <s> since that time as some of your lordships will be aware i have become the chairman of a trust the brantwood trust which supports the home of john ruskin in the lake district <e> <s> the trust maintains the house which is open to the public and it receives visitors a year <e>", "<cs> my lords at this late hour in the light of the full presentation made by the noble lord lord northfield and in view of the arctic conditions promised for travellers tonight i propose to confine my remarks to a few salient points in accordance with the well-known procedures for second readings in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> i merely wanted to ask him whether he is prepared to disclose who gave him that figure of a million increase in costs <e> <s> there have been figures bandied about even in the papers by well-known persons which are quite wrong <e> <s> i wonder whether he could disclose i do not want to press him about this matter who gave him the figure of million <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not realise that the noble lord was referring to the word plus <e> <s> however i am grateful to him for referring to the letter which i presume is that written by my honourable friend in another place <e> <s> that member from the other place today assured me that the contents of that letter were in many respects wholly inaccurate and he apologised to me this morning for not having cleared that matter up before <e> <s> i am very grateful therefore that the noble lord has given me the opportunity of being able to explain how the member of the other place who belongs to the same party as myself found himself in difficulties having introduced figures which he now confesses were not quite right <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble lord for interrupting him in his peroration and at the end of his speech but there has been so much confusion about the effect of this bill that it would be helpful to have on record that the bill makes no amendment to section of the patents act connected with compulsory licences and applications for compulsory licences that can be made to the comptroller-general <e> <s> the minister mentioned that applications in relation to compulsory licences were in the bill <e> <s> they still remain and there is no attempt to amend that

year of shelter for the homeless <e> <s> at a very large meeting of over people in the palace of peace in cardiff my attention was drawn to the homelessness and the tragedies arising from recent fires

raised this matter and asked the government what plans they have in this respect <e> <s> there is squalor and lack of safety in many large premises occupied sometimes by five to six persons to a room

rendered homeless or have no home to go to <e>", "<cs> i am very much obliged to the noble earl <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord either now or later clarify the position in relation to any intellectual property rights that may arise with employees at devonport or in relation to contracts placed <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord the minister give assurances that the problems

before i ask the noble lord lord bruce of donington a question that when i saw his amendment i found it very interesting from a general point of view and possibly a useful amendment to debate and consider <e> <s> but what worries me is that the noble lord has now said that the purpose of the amendment is to make sure that a policy is laid down as a means of applying guidance <e> <s> he then went on to say something about the unbridled activities of free <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down may i ask a couple of questions for clarification on the matters that he raised <e> <s> i should like to know if possible now but if not later whether in drawing up their report lazard brothers consulted a number of technical advisers or whether this matter was dealt with purely on financial and economic grounds <e> <s> the noble lord said in general terms that it was necessary to deal with a number of legal and formal matters and that these questions were far from routine <e>

considered as some of the legal problems concerned <e> <s> in my last few words i ought to declare an interest in that i am an honorary fellow of selwyn college cambridge and have been associated in a

questions <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the large amount of money received by rolls-royce for engines now admitted by the minister will he agree that there is a strong case for continuing with

practical and realistic way of dealing with the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i must express my surprise and some mystification at the answers given by the minister especially as earlier on in his

the noble lord lord morton is simply that subsection states <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may apologise to the minister <e> <s> i had intended on this occasion to conform to the grouping <e> <s> by way of explanation i should like to say that the identical amendment is concerned with designs which have been registered <e> <s> i think that is right <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the

noble lords submission that the clause should be deleted <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the minister for what he has said and on the undertaking given i beg leave to withdraw my amendment

procedures which provide a very valuable measure for reducing the costs of litigation for small business firms <e> <s> i should like to express very humbly my appreciation of the explanation that he gave of amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords it is well known to the noble and learned lord that possible reduction in costs in patent cases is largely dependent on a proper definition at an early stage of the issues to be decided and upon the firmness of the judge in giving directions to that end <e> <s> i assume that the noble and learned lord will have in mind that costs in patent actions sometimes escalate if the judge is not firm about experiments that have to be made <e> <s> once one side starts having experiments there are reply experiments but no doubt that will be taken

<s> that is not an amendment which is before the committee at present but i wonder whether that suggestion would find some sympathy with the government or even the noble lords lord benson and lord williams of elvel <e>", "<cs> will the later stage be in this house <e>", "<cs> in my experience whenever anybody says to me in the epilogue of his speech as did the noble lord lord bruce of donington that he speaks with great respect to me i know that something very heavy and difficult will be put before me <e> <s> the minister has expressed sympathy for the health of small and medium-sized companies <e> <s> i am deeply disappointed and surprised that such a distinguished member of the labour party as the noble lord lord bruce of donington is and has been for so many years in so many places in the other place and abroad on behalf of the labour party on this occasion at this late hour should not in any way have the slightest sympathy for the difficulties of small and medium-sized companies <e> <s> i express my surprise with great diffidence at this time of night but i thought it necessary to have it on record <e>", "<cs> i entirely agree with what the minister said <e> <s> when one sees a clause in a bill of this kind especially a somewhat technical bill such as this one has to be suspicious of giving more powers to the secretary of state to legislate in that way <e> <s> my suspicions about the clause were somewhat diluted by the observations made by the minister when we were considering the amendment moved by the noble viscount lord caldecote which put forward the proposal that references to research and development should be introduced into the accounts <e> <s> therefore i wonder whether the minister can say without any commitment that generally such an amendment would be suitable and would be received sympathetically by the government for legislation by regulation <e>", "<cs> i rise briefly to support the amendment <e> <s> perhaps it will be helpful for the committee to know that the court has decided on several occasions that an auditor is an officer of the court <e> <s> in those circumstances it is essential to make it clear that for the purposes of this clause an auditor shall not be regarded as an officer or employee of the company <e>", "<cs> i too had some difficulty in understanding whether the able presentation of the noble lord lord benson covered the problems that he has in mind <e> <s> i recognise that he has also received indeed he may have written or edited it the briefing note on arrangements for monitoring by the institute of chartered accountants <e> <s> i agree with everything he said about the desirability of reducing costs in relation to all these matters <e> <s> he says that his amendments would do that <e>", "<cs> as i listened to what the minister said it seemed to me more and more unnecessary for paragraph to be headed monitoring and enforcement <e> <s> the institute of chartered accountants has stated that the <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for his careful presentation of the position <e> <s> i was fully aware of article of this directive which states that <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble lord lord mishcon for his intervention which has been most helpful in clarifying the situation <e> <s> i am also grateful to other members of the committee who have spoken on this amendment as well as to the minister for having said that he will look into the question of appeal in connection with the clause as it now stands <e> <s> will the minister write to me about it <e> <s> i understand from his nod that he will indeed write conveying the governments position in regard to the aspect of appeal <e> <s> in the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i entirely agree with the presentation and the views of the noble lord lord williams that clause is widely drafted <e> <s> i go further than the noble lord and say that in the circumstances of clause this clause is totally unnecessary <e> <s> the previous clause reads <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for that personal explanation but may i point out not only to the minister but to the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe that the word reasonably appears in clause <e>", "<cs> i too take the view that subsection is too draconian and that it should be eliminated <e>", "<cs> i support what the noble lord lord benson has said and support the amendment <e> <s> if the bar is to work under contingency fees the danger is that the position indicated by him may be far worse <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord williams of elvel has indicated this part of the bill deals with investigation powers but it also deals with powers to obtain information <e> <s> like the noble lord lord williams of elvel we on these benches support the government in every way to prevent malpractices and misconduct of all kinds <e> <s> it may help if i were to say now that i shall be supporting many of the amendments put forward for this part particularly those which improve access to information <e> <s> however like the noble lord lord williams i am concerned with the basic principles of natural justice <e> <s> in some cases it seems that the human rights of <e>", "<cs> i accept that the secretary of state will be fair to individuals as will all his colleagues <e> <s> however at some stage he will say that no further action will be taken <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord peston that that is not adequate <e> <s> could he not indicate quite clearly that no malpractices or misconduct have been found which defame or go against the reputation of the individuals concerned <e>", "<cs> i must apologise to the noble lord lord williams of elvel for missing the first minute of his presentation on these amendments <e> <s> the secretary of state said there would be problems in relation to the financial services act if these amendments were accepted <e> <s> in this part of the bill one has to remind oneself that we are dealing as stated in the preamble to part iii of the bill not only with the companies act but also with the insolvency act and the financial services act <e>", "<cs> i hesitate to intervene again but surely the answer which the noble lord has now given justifies the amendment <e> <s> if the present provision comes from a current act dealing with criminal matters would it not be appropriate to include in the bill wording similar to that proposed by the noble lord lord williams of elvel <e>", "<cs> i entirely support the comments of the noble lord lord mishcon because it seems to me that the principle of confidentiality has not been adequately addressed in drafting the new powers which are after all to assist the foreign regulatory bodies <e> <s> it is for that purpose that this amendment has been tabled <e>", "<cs> i should like to support what the noble lord lord rippon said particularly having regard to what i understood the minister to say <e> <s> it was that provisions such as subsection which the amendment proposes to delete are to be found in other acts <e> <s> i understood the minister to say that similar powers exist in several other acts and he referred to the banking act and the companies act <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord mottistone for speaking directly to amendment no <e> <s> z which i tabled <e> <s> the three amendments that have been drawn together have the same purpose <e> <s> the theme is the avoidance of uncertainty <e> <s> i have also been supplied with the extract from the law societys notes which gives the speeches read by the noble lord lord mishcon of the two distinguished judges before whom i have had the privilege of appearing in the court of appeal more than once <e>", "<cs> i should like to follow the noble lords lord mishcon and lord mottistone <e>", "<cs> i apologise for interrupting the minister <e> <s> i merely wanted to be on the correspondence list for whatever letters will be passing <e>", "<cs> i am inclined to agree <e> <s> i agree that the first three amendments are a <e>", "<cs> if the reference was to mis-spelling the name of the chargee

is entirely my fault and i am sorry <e> <s> it may be that it is immaterial <e>", "<cs> i am very much obliged <e>", "<cs> when i moved the amendment i spoke rather bluntly <e> <s> i said that i did not believe that the government had thought through the implications of the four lines in the subsection <e> <s> frankly i am reinforced in that view having regard to our discussions <e> <s> in view of the fact that the minister has agreed to look at the matter again i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to appear to be otiose at this late hour in having any difference at all with the views of the noble lord lord williams of elvel on this matter <e> <s> the noble lord the minister raised the question of cost and i wondered whether the noble lord lord williams has thought that this inspection of the register by the companys auditors every year should not be forced upon the companies which are colloquially called smes the smaller companies and not the larger companies <e>", "<cs> i wish briefly to intervene to say that i also have been instructed by the law society <e> <s> i accept its submissions which are largely along the lines of what the noble lord lord williams said <e>", "<cs> the temptation to support the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls <e>", "<cs> i thank the committee for that support <e> <s> i was at chelsea a week or so ago <e> <s> chelsea won although swindon their adversaries had scored four goals <e> <s> the committee can work out how that happened <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for that applause because in the course of discussions on the bill the players attitude has not been adequately mentioned <e> <s> it is a great pleasure for me to be able to speak in support of the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls because when

majority of three and so i told him that i would soon sort that out <e> <s> i said that i would get a liberal to stand against him <e> <s> as a result the noble lord is in this place <e> <s> i hope that the committee will not hold that against me on this occasion <e> <s> i support the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls because he is talking practical common sense <e> <s> as he said all he is saying

press the minister a little further <e> <s> i do so in my capacity as senior vice-president of the cardiff business club and also as a member of the institute of directors management committee <e> <s>

declared an interest in that at the present time i am a non-executive director of three companies <e>", "<cs> in view of the noble lords great experience in this matter and particularly as he tells us

down i did not gather what his position was <e> <s> i heard his comments in relation to those four paragraphs but he was reading rather quickly and i did not quite understand the position <e> <s>
