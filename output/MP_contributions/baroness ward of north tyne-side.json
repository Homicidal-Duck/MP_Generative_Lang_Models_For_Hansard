["<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend <e> <s> as he quite rightly said that many small factories are now empty and that they would help in dealing with this matter could i ask him what special action he is going to take to help to get work to those particular factories in view of the fact that we have been trying to do this for many years without much success <e> <s> if my noble friend has any special way of giving us this information it would at least be something to encourage the shipbuilders in my part of the world to take action <e>"]
