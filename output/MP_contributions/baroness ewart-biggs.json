["<cs> my lords i am deeply conscious of the privilege of addressing your lordships house for the first time but nevertheless i must admit that the great pleasure that i feel in making my contribution to this debate is somewhat tempered by the sense of awe that the occasion gives me <e> <s> however if i have learned one thing since taking my place among your lordships i have learned of the spirit of tolerance courtesy and indulgence which characterises your lordships house and i gratefully recall that now <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble lord very much for his answer perhaps i could pursue the matter a little further <e> <s> i think it must be agreed that there is at the moment no provision in northern ireland for parents wishing to educate their children in integrated schools <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that it is generally accepted that if children are educated together the fear and tension and mistrust <e>", "<cs> my lords while being very glad to be able to make my contribution to the debate this evening and more especially to stress some of the points already made i should like to say how sorry i am that i shall be unable to stay to the end of the debate and i apologise to your lordships for missing the ensuing speakers <e> <s> as has already been said this seems on the face of it to be an eminently reasonable bill <e> <s> indeed who in their right minds could possibly disagree with the principle that any society should do its best to make provision for ensuring that its representatives are fit for public office and that these people who are placed in a position to rule and make laws should at least have some claim to moral authority <e> <s> there are of course the antecedents which have been mentioned for excluding certain types of people from this elective office and judged from this principle it could hardly seem more appropriate to add murderers and terrorists to that list <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the noble lord taking into account the difficulty that we have in getting the true position in northern ireland over to the people of america what we do to try to persuade the government of the republic of ireland to unite with us in trying to use their influence over their community in america to explain to them the true facts of our position in northern ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first thank the noble lord lord elton very much for his clear statement which i found of very great interest <e> <s> may i at the same time say how much i support everything that my noble friend lord blease said in his as always very clear and concise statement <e> <s> i think it would be impossible ever to start talking about northern ireland without stating ones firm belief in the work that <e>", "<cs> my lords i wanted very briefly to support what has been said up till now and to take this opportunity of giving my support to the motion which was put forward by mr concannon <e> <s> i must also admit that i am very surprised and bewildered <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord lord elton will be able to tell us why this request has been refused <e> <s> after all it is not a demand to change the epa <e> <s> there is no suggestion of that <e> <s> it is a reasonable request to set up an inquiry to ascertain that these provisions still contain the right ingredients to maintain that very delicate balance of containing the existing security situation without offending the sensitivities of people who are affected by these laws <e> <s> also as my noble friend lord gardiner said such a review would serve to take away that air of permanence which is the most insidious feature of emergency legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble lord lord elton very much for the presentation of this draft order i should also like to support what my noble friend lord blease has said about the timing of this debate <e> <s> we are discussing the economics of a very sensitive area and i think a full debate would have been helpful in informing the people of northern ireland who must find it very uncomplimentary to see it put into the dinner hour to be dealt with as briefly as possible <e> <s> having said that i will hurry on to make the two or three points <e> <s> first as other noble lords have said when discussing the economy of northern ireland at this present moment the dominant factor that must be considered is how the employment prospects will be affected by the economic arrangements made <e> <s> at present there can be no doubt that the statistics tell a terrible story <e> <s> it is almost impossible to believe that there are now per cent <e> <s> almost one in four of the working population in northern ireland on the dole and that in the manufacturing industry in northern ireland there are currently more people without jobs than at work <e> <s> therefore with the crying need of job creation before us i should like to bring forward one specific example where the distribution of resources as set out in this appropriation order appears to be wrong and ill-considered <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for the answer but is he aware that it is only within the european framework that the northern irish political leaders have ever really found agreement <e> <s> would he not agree that it would be really beneficial to allow eec funds to be additional to treasury funds so as to strengthen the framework of the european community in order for it to be used for other means of finding agreement between these leaders <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to say a few words about ireland <e> <s> there has been not only the reference in the queens speech to close relations being maintained between the governments of the united kingdom and the republic of ireland but also last week an important meeting took place between the prime minister and the irish taoiseach <e> <s> that meeting was followed by a communiqu and summary of the joint studies and i understand that a full account of those documents will be published tomorrow in london and dublin <e> <s> i know i speak for many <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to thank the minister very much for that answer but i still do not think that he has quite explained the anomaly <e> <s> would he not agree that it is quite extraordinary that in northern ireland where economic conditions are worse and unemployment figures are higher than in other parts of the united kingdom employing bodies using the job creation schemes are generally benefiting less than are their counterparts who are benefiting from similar schemes in the rest of the united kingdom <e> <s> surely the minister should give a commitment that community organisations in northern ireland engaged in this essential work of social benefit should be brought into line with the rest of the united kingdom by being given per cent <e> <s> gross wage cost per employee and the equivalent administration grant of <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister not agree that the work being done by the community groups in northern ireland is essential to the policy that we have had in northern ireland and that they themselves feel that there is an unfair discrimination in this case <e> <s> would he therefore not agree that we should give them all the help and encouragement that we possibly can <e>", "<cs> my lords i should first like to thank the minister for presenting this draft order in such a very comprehensive manner <e> <s> i should also like to thank him for the very helpful explanatory memorandum that he sent to me <e> <s> before raising the few points that i have to make about the appropriation order in particular and the economy in general although my remarks will not be quite so general as those of the noble lord lord donaldson but then i do not like playing golf that is the reason i should like to say how very much i have admired and do admire the courage with which the government are trying to resolve the political situation in northern ireland and how much i admire the personal courage of the secretary of state and of his ministers in handling this desperately difficult and dangerous situation <e> <s> i am quite sure that there must be general agreement over this among all members of your lordships house <e> <s> by this i mean that there must be a common ground of agreement from every side of this house about the need for a move forward in our <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for that answer which i was aware of <e> <s> what i really want to ask him is whether he would agree that it is social anthropology which is in particular of very great value not only because it has an extremely detailed focus but also because of its comparative approach <e> <s> this has to draw of course on foreign on worldwide experience <e> <s> with that in mind will the minister say whether overseas research in social anthropology will continue to be well supported <e>", "<cs> my lords i too would like to thank the minister very much indeed for his explanation which i found of great interest very clear and very fair <e> <s> i am extremely grateful to him for giving it <e> <s> i should like also to take the opportunity to express my very great admiration and respect for all those people who are involved in administering the law in northern ireland and who in doing so are running such appalling risks <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to thank the noble lord lord moyola for giving <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the minister for his presentation of this bill which seems to be a bill which has a mixed range of issues but which are many of them closely affecting peoples everyday lives and relate especially to the changing pattern of life <e> <s> first i should like to comment on certain of the clauses in this bill which appear to me to affect todays youth <e> <s> i feel strongly that any division between the generations is a dangerous situation and an unhealthy one for society and that it is becoming increasingly important to try to look at new legislation from a young persons point of view with regard to how it will affect him or her in the sort of life that the changing world is offering them <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for that answer <e> <s> would he not agree that following a national disaster it is a major objective of government and of the caring and generous public to do all that they can even in some small measure for people who have suffered grievous loss <e> <s> would the noble lord not further agree that we have learned from the last two great tragedies that the machinery at our disposal is not completely suitable in that sufficient and even more than sufficient money has come in to cover the needs of the dependants but that the huge amounts involved have attracted a great deal of hostile and suspicious attention towards those dependants as well as an enormous amount of press publicity while at the same time possibly depriving some very good charitable associations of resources which might have gone in their direction <e> <s> would the minister not agree that the time has come for us to think seriously of a national disaster fund operated by a national disaster committee whose task it would be to look after the interests of those people whom we are all very concerned about <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the minister very much for his very clear presentation of the order and for sending me the explanatory memorandum <e> <s> i should like to make a few comments about provisions in the order mainly in support of my noble friend and principally in the areas of employment and housing <e> <s> i think of when we last debated a northern ireland appropriation order in this house and of the considerable political activity that there has been in ireland both north and south <e> <s> i know that the plans for some kind of an elected assembly in northern ireland are welcomed and admired by many people in this house <e>", "<cs> on second reading i spoke about what is the best way to reconcile the young music enthusiasts who want to have pop festivals with the interests of the local residents <e> <s> the arguments for and against this being best achieved through the local authorities controlling pop festivals seem to me to be as follows <e> <s> the major argument is that the cause of the pop festival could be very much strengthened if it were felt that the local residents interests were represented by local authorities <e>", "<cs> i should like to make one point which although not being entirely relevant to the amendment is very relevant to the issue <e> <s> although i am not concerned so much with whether a local authority should be able to ban or not ban i am concerned with the degree of the shop itself <e> <s> there is no doubt that there are many varied degrees and it is not only my noble friend lord longford who has found out about this <e> <s> where i live in chelsea there is a very discreet establishment and i went to talk to the gentleman who runs it <e> <s> he held very strong views about the type of shop which operates in soho <e> <s> in fact i could <e>", "<cs> very briefly i should like to support the noble lord lord evans of claughton in as i see it this procedural safeguard <e> <s> one must remember that often these take-away foodshops are a one-man business with someone working to hours a day <e> <s> he does not really have time to protect himself find out about it all and take the council to court <e> <s> so i think that he needs things to be made very plain <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment very strongly and i suggest that one <e>", "<cs> my lords first i wish to thank the noble lord lord glenamara for initiating this important debate and secondly to apologise because i shall probably not be able to stay to the end of the debate in view of a long-term commitment which i dare not dishonour <e> <s> i shall introduce into the debate a few ideas and a considerable number of apprehensions about policy towards youth unemployment <e> <s> i appreciate that that is rather a departure from previous noble lords who have concentrated completely on economic theories but i thought i might speak a little about that section of the community who seem to be suffering particularly from those economic theories <e> <s> i shall therefore take this opportunity to present some aspects of youth unemployment first regarding the present initiatives for those school-leavers for whom there are no jobs secondly the general reactions to the proposed new training schemes due to start in september and thirdly a little about the work that is being done for the young unemployed by the youth services and other agencies <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that very helpful answer <e> <s> nevertheless does he not agree that there is now unequivocal medical evidence of the highly detrimental effect which lead in petrol has on childrens health <e> <s> will he not accept that if the government cannot persuade the eec to change its directive on the lead content of petrol the government would be justified in taking action to set a date to remove lead from petrol in britain citing at the same time article of the treaty of rome in defence of their action <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble earl one other point <e> <s> would he not agree that unless our motor industry starts to think of manufacturing cars to run on lead-free petrol they will become even less competitive with japanese cars designed to run on both kinds of petrol which are selling massively all over europe <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister very much for that assurance <e> <s> i hope he will be able to improve on his original answer and in view of his remarks i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords could the minister say whether the number of requests for compensation for criminal injuries has gone up considerably in the last year or stayed the same or indeed decreased <e> <s> that is the actual requests for compensation for criminal injury <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank the noble lord the minister for the assurances he has given both as regards looking at the cost and as to arranging for a meeting between his department and the health and safety executive <e> <s> in those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that we have very nearly reached the end of our time so i think i only have time to thank all those noble lords and ladies who have been so very good in making extremely valuable contributions to this debate <e> <s> i would like to congratulate the maiden speaker that we heard <e> <s> i was particularly touched by what he said about the absence of parents and the lack of nurturing <e> <s> i would also like to congratulate the minister on going at such a huge speed i know that he was promising even more which we shall have to take for granted <e> <s> i would like to thank him for what he said about the extra provision for the latchkey child <e> <s> i hope what he said was true about the real value of the child benefit scheme remaining i am not quite sure if that is true <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the point that the noble lord made is absolutely right <e> <s> we are just giving them a choice of taking up this power if they want to do so <e> <s> nevertheless i am grateful to the noble earl the minister for his answer <e> <s> it seems at least to be a compromise which he has hit upon and perhaps it would be possible at some future time for him to let the house know how this method is working <e> <s> in view of that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that some of the things that the minister said were the same as those that i said but the other way round <e> <s> i still think that he has not answered the point that some of these defects would be detected by electrical engineers when they would not be detected from the inspections that are now being made <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank my noble friend lord wells-pestell for raising this very important subject of the future of elephant jobs and also in a more general way the subject of the future of community enterprise programmes <e> <s> i feel that after the previous speaker there is little i can add but my reason for wishing to say a few words in this debate is because of my interest and personal involvement in an organisation in paddington which is called the beauchamp lodge settlement which is one of a small group of voluntary organisations in westminster that sponsors an adult employment scheme similar to elephant jobs <e> <s> it is in this way that i have become acquainted with these job schemes generally and have also been made very much aware of the important contribution that elephant jobs have been making to the community <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that answer and i am glad the matter is under continuous review <e> <s> nevertheless is the noble earl aware that the police in west germany holland and japan are finding that the modern water gun equipment is a highly effective non-lethal method of dealing with street rioting of great ferocity <e> <s> may i therefore ask him to give a commitment that research is being done by the home office with a view to the future implementation of such equipment in northern ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that simple low-cost water supply schemes contribute a fairly permanent improvement to the quality of life in these areas <e> <s> would he say whether and to what extent the overseas development administration is financing such schemes <e> <s> is he also aware that there are many non-governmental organisations such as sos sahel in which i am involved who contribute a lot to these schemes <e> <s> would he say how the government co-operate with these schemes and how they support them generally <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister say whether the promotion and career prospects of a female member of a diplomatic service are affected by her marriage <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for answering in that way <e> <s> nevertheless is the minister aware of the great consternation which has been caused among many residents of kensington and chelsea by this astonishing event <e> <s> will he not agree that those responsible for making the decision for this nocturnal demolition were behaving more like back-street demolition junk merchants than the elected councillors of kensington and chelsea <e> <s> in order to mitigate the damage done would the minister give an assurance that the government will do everything that they can to ensure that this site will eventually be developed at a scale not greater than existed before and which is also acceptable to the local planning authorities and to the local people <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like first to tell the minister how very much i enjoyed his introduction <e> <s> i should also like to congratulate him and the secretary of state on all the hard work and resolution which they put into bringing the bill to this house <e> <s> secondly i must admit to a great diffidence in speaking about northern ireland in the presence of those who not only live there but whose lives have been very closely involved in its affairs <e> <s> the fact that quite a few of them have now left the chamber makes me feel a little better <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for presenting the order and also to take the opportunity to express our great admiration for the way in which the security forces carry out their duties in situations which are almost impossible <e> <s> furthermore one should always take the opportunity to say how much one respects the efforts of the huge majority of people in northern ireland who despite all the problems in their lives carry on very constructive lives and contribute so much to the work of reconciliation and community relations which is vital to northern irelands future <e> <s> i too agree that in the interests of those people the continuation of the emergency provisions is necessary for who alas <e> <s> can doubt that without the powers fewer terrorists would be convicted and the safety of innocent people would consequently be endangered <e> <s> i feel very strongly that when discussing this issue we who enjoy the security of living in this island should never underestimate the horrific effect that terrorism has on the community in which it operates <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may respond very briefly as the noble lord lord harris referred to something that i said on second reading <e> <s> when i was talking about the opposite situations of the peoples wish for this assembly which was contradicted by the political parties i said that in order to illustrate my great trust in the good sense of the people of northern ireland who wished to give this a try <e> <s> so far as referenda are concerned so much depends on how the question is phrased <e> <s> that goes for any referenda which have ever been held <e> <s> again i do not entirely agree with the principle of referenda within our political system <e> <s> in a way it constitutes a vote of confidence in a certain policy and i agreed with the minister when he said that in this instance a vote of confidence would be demonstrated by the fact that the candidates would present themselves for election to the assembly <e>", "<cs> may i ask the minister a question on one point regarding the actual power of the relevant chairmen of the committees once devolved <e> <s> what power and what influence will they have in relation to say overseas investors <e> <s> will they be in a position to negotiate orders from foreign ministers or again will they be in a position to negotiate with the relevant departments of the eec commission <e> <s> will they be in a position to influence funding from the regional and social funds <e> <s> what i do not quite understand is what they will be responsible for when they take over their responsibilities once their departments have been devolved in the foreign international field <e>", "<cs> i should like to support what my noble friend lord blease has said <e> <s> i should like to ask the minister to look sympathetically at the quandary of these two individuals <e> <s> they took up their places in the irish senate before this initiative by the government was really under way and i think they did it with very much in mind the issue which is also in the mind of the government i think to harmonise the two irish traditions and the two identities and indeed the two allegiances <e> <s> i think they may well have had this in the front of their minds when they did this <e>", "<cs> my lords i too would like to thank the minister very much for his presentation and also for sending notes to help us to understand this appropriation order <e> <s> we have recently debated the affairs of northern ireland rather more than usual and most recently of course we have given a welcome most of us to the forward-looking political initiative of the government <e> <s> however in contrast there has also been during this week the tragic evidence that northern irelands destructive forces are continuing to persist <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like first to thank my noble friend for introducing the subject we have been debating this evening and for presenting it to us in such a very lucid and human way <e> <s> i should like also to congratulate the two maiden speakers <e> <s> remembering the great trauma that the occasion presented to me i very much admired their calm and clear delivery <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like very briefly to support what has been said <e> <s> there can be no doubt that those of us who have supported the principle of the assembly can do no other than support the arrangements and decisions made about the election <e> <s> i think it very important that there has been no postponement <e> <s> on the one hand people have expected the election and have made preparations for it and postponement could only have encouraged the forces of disruption in the feeling that they had succeeded in what tragically they have already started to try to do <e>", "<cs> not to participate in the election and therefore the future were undermined <e> <s> so i would implore the minister to do whatever he can to find a way around this predicament <e> <s> it is a question not just of the anomalies in the disqualification act but also the results that will arise from the disqualification of certain people <e> <s> so much is in the balance and i hope that a way can be found to get around the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i should first of all like to congratulate my noble friend lord rea on an extremely interesting maiden speech <e> <s> it brought great knowledge to one at any rate and luckily also for me bore some relation to what i am going to say <e> <s> when one starts to think about what is fundamental to a debate on home affairs surely one immediately thinks of the family the family unit which after all must be the ultimate focus to all home policies <e> <s> remembering as i am sure we all do and will never forget the claim of the government before their election of being the party who championed the rights of the family we had every justification in waiting to see what there would be in the gracious speech for this countrys least favoured families <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord the minister not agree that there are an enormous number of women who suffer horrible anxiety that they have this dreadful disease with all its ensuing disfiguring treatment and would he not further agree that if it were men who were suffering from this very great anxiety the future of this unit might not be in jeopardy <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord lord banks very much indeed for instigating this debate <e> <s> i greatly enjoyed his presentation of it <e> <s> i should also like to apologise to the minister the noble lord lord banks and your lordships as i may have to leave the debate early if it does not conclude by because i have to attend a meeting of the parent/teacher association at the school which my child attends and i dare not miss it because i must face my child afterwards <e>", "<cs> i should like to support what my noble friend has said about the rather confusing statement of the minister which i too could not quite follow <e> <s> surely if we allow a loophole then someone will take advantage of it <e> <s> as i understand it we are trying to prevent the loophole whereby a site owner makes some money on top of what he deserves anyhow <e> <s> surely the minister must agree that the new clause makes it explicit that such charges should not be demanded or received indeed this applies to all charges whether imposed as part of the agreement or outside it <e> <s> as the minister said the point of the bill is to keep a balance between those two aspects and in this case i do not think that he has followed that up in what he has said <e>", "<cs> will the minister tell me how the inclusion of this clause would jeopardise the interests of the site owner <e>", "<cs> i should like to add a few words <e> <s> the minister spoke about the relative virtues of an arbitrator but surely there is only one important virtue <e> <s> it is not a question of whether he is tall thin rich or poor but simply whether he is impartial <e> <s> the major objective must be to find an arbitrator who is impartial <e> <s> there might be a danger in leaving the situation as it is at present under the bill and as my noble friend has said there might be an occupier who has not understood the position <e> <s> i am quite sure that it is not the same with the minister but the minds of some of us become a complete blank when we look at the small print in agreements <e> <s> so why leave the danger in the agreement when it could be avoided in some other way <e>", "<cs> i should like to make one very general point to the minister <e> <s> would he not agree in principle that on the assumption that mobile homes are being used and will continue to be used more and more as permanent homes the rights of these home-dwellers should in every possible way and this amendment is a typical example be brought into line with those of people who have lived and continue to live in ordinary houses <e> <s> this is an important point which underlies so many of the amendments <e>", "<cs> i also would like to support the amendment and particularly to support what the noble lord lord mcgregor of durris has just said <e> <s> at the same time i should like to bring out what to me is a really staggering statistic <e> <s> it is thought although estimates vary a little that between per cent <e> <s> and per cent <e> <s> of the children in voluntary care come from one parent families <e> <s> that is an overwhelming fact <e> <s> it is true that children from single parent families are the most vulnerable <e> <s> that is the case for varying reasons one of which is that a single parent family would clearly suffer very often from a lower income and from poorer housing <e> <s> however the main reason is that the child would suffer from the anxiety felt by single parents who are trying to bring up their children alone and who have no one with whom to share their anxiety <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend lord wells-pestell for raising this extremely important topic <e> <s> when i looked at the list of speakers i realised that i should not be able to add anything to what would be said i have no background in the probation service <e> <s> nevertheless the very fact that i <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble and learned lord aware that if there is not a definite answer very soon it will have the same effect on the bristol scheme as a negative answer and they will have to start winding down their operations <e> <s> does not the noble and learned lord think that expenditure of is the best spent money in the country when it can in some way help the most bewildered anxious and vulnerable children in the country <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say a few brief words <e> <s> i am compelled to speak in this debate mainly in my capacity as an ex-diplomats wife and a mobile home is truly mobile in that capacity <e> <s> i do not think the point that the minister has made is absolutely satisfactory because he said that if it was wrong meaning that if the occupier did not think it was right to pay this charge he could refuse and go elsewhere or go to court <e> <s> that must mean that the minister thinks that these charges are wrong <e> <s> surely this particular amendment would simplify the position in that if the owner is not able to make his profit he must increase the profit he makes when selling the caravan or he must increase the charges that he makes through his pitch fees <e>", "<cs> my lords in spite of what the noble lord the minister has said i should still like to support the amendment because as i understand it this model agreement is merely a skeleton which can be tilled by both occupier and owner as it applies <e> <s> i cannot see any reason why the occupier should go to the expense of challenging the agreement if he does not agree with it <e> <s> i should have thought that that was one of the things that the bill was trying to avoid <e> <s> can one not see the amendment as something that is providing a simplification and a safeguard in some cases <e> <s> to my mind it is something that would really stand the bill in very good stead and stand the test of time <e> <s> moreover it will try and keep a good relationship between the occupier and the owner <e> <s> from the many letters i have read that have been published in the press it seems to be a tragedy that on these sites which do after all constitute small villages the relationship can sometimes be very much aggravated through misunderstandings that could possibly be avoided by this particular amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords if i might add one short word to the argument it is that the amendment surely is not a very strong one <e> <s> adding just one word surely is only trying to protect occupiers on those very few sites where the site owner does not behave in a completely equitable way <e> <s> there can be no doubt that some occupiers do suffer <e> <s> again there are the letters that i do not think one can totally disregard which have been published <e> <s> i shall read one short extract where an occupier describes the situation on his site <e> <s> he says <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to support what the noble lord has just said <e> <s> to me the major aim of the amendment is to bring the rights of mobile home dwellers closer into line with the rights already enjoyed by private tenants and leaseholders and that seems entirely appropriate <e> <s> the reasons why people especially young couples and elderly couples choose to live in mobile homes are not going to change <e> <s> they cannot afford a mortgage they do not want to become yet another name on an endless council housing list <e> <s> surely anything to balance the rights of mobile home dwellers with those of people who live in ordinary houses should be supported <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that for the past three years in northern ireland a very important pilot scheme to extend and develop community service there has been operating and that this scheme has helped to form links between teachers and the youth and social services in order to interest children in projects to do with the community <e> <s> would the minister not agree that his right honourable friend the secretary of state for northern ireland should start to support this particular scheme and that we should also all start to give serious thought to including community services within the curricula of our schools <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for answering that question <e> <s> does he not agree that even if this is not an exceptional situation it is deplorable in that for nearly eight months now the kensington residents and also the diplomats and tourists who use this very central thoroughfare kensington high street have been deeply affected by the tragic appearance if not the eyesore of the partially demolished kensington town hall <e> <s> with one planning appeal still waiting to be heard building work is unlikely to commence for many months to come so does the minister not agree that a system whereby an owner is allowed to pull down a building many months before redevelopment planning has been agreed is seriously at fault <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister not agree that the council having asked the royal fine art commission beforehand for their judgment for a replacement building then disregarded the advice given to them by the commission <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to prolong the debate on this bill by more than one minute but i should like to say how grateful i am to the noble lord the minister for the concern he has shown <e>", "<cs> my lords as i rise to speak today i must confess to a feeling of slight trepidation <e> <s> this comes from two incongruities which are affecting me <e> <s> first having listened to the speech of my noble friend lord underhill i find myself for the first time ever in some slight disagreement with some of his arguments <e> <s> however i should like to tell him straight away that i view those arguments with very great respect <e> <s> i assure him that this will be the last time i am quite sure that i shall ever find myself on a different side of an argument from him <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank my noble friend lord wells-pestell very much indeed for putting a motion before the house which gives rise to such very wide-ranging discussions <e> <s> i for one will not be examining the governments economic policy but will be examining another aspect of the motion <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that answer <e> <s> nevertheless as regards that answer does he not fear that the nutritional level of school meals will be lowered as local authorities bear the growing amount of the statutory cost and will consequently have less for the direct costs such as food <e> <s> would the minister not agree that this is most likely to happen in areas which are already economically stretched where the resources of the local authorities are going elsewhere and also in areas where there are children from poor families who are most in need of a good school meal <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister not agree that there is a threat of a reduction in the school meals service and that this will lead to another problem of employment for married women <e> <s> i am sure he will agree that many of those working in the schools service are wives of unemployed people and also single mothers who have children at that school <e>", "<cs> my lords i would like to say a few things about this review and this act <e> <s> i do not want to make a long speech but i would like just to put forward a thought about the principle behind this review and also an idea about certain of the recommendations made in it <e>", "<cs> my lords i too thank the minister for presenting the appropriation order in his usual and characteristically very clear way <e> <s> i also thank him for giving us news of the work of the assembly about which on account of the rather negative reporting that often happens in the press here we have not heard enough <e> <s> i was extremely glad and grateful to hear about it <e> <s> i should like to make one or two points about housing and ask the minister two questions of which i fear i have not given him notice but knowing the very capacious content of the ministers mind i am quite sure he carries most answers with him <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down may i say that i know i did not give him notice of my question about statutory rights for the homeless in northern ireland referred to in the report by shelter <e> <s> will he be good enough to write to me on this subject as it does seem a very important point <e>", "<cs> my lords i also should like to thank the noble lord lord hylton very much indeed for introducing this debate and giving us a chance to add more to our debate on northern ireland today than hitherto <e> <s> he covered the subject very well as did previous noble lords who have spoken therefore i feel that there is not very much more to say <e> <s> as the hour is very late i should like simply and briefly to support two of the points which have already been brought out in this debate <e> <s> the first is about the governments policy of imprisoning northern irish prisoners far from home <e> <s> i have never really completely understood why the government wish particularly to penalise and punish families of prisoners <e> <s> i find it difficult to understand both from an humanitarian and also from a practical point of view <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that a recent study of -year-olds showed that one child out of five leaves for school without an adequate breakfast <e> <s> would not the minister agree that for many of the children of poorer families the school meal is the major meal of the day <e> <s> would he not agree that it is of the greatest importance that there should be some level of nutritional value in the school meal as there was before the act <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl not agree that the health of school children can only be safeguarded if there is a nutritional level within those free school meals to which certain children from poorer families are entitled <e> <s> it is that which worries us when so much of the cost on local education authorities is going into other areas except food <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister not agree that studies made in the united states of america japan and australia were sufficient for the governments of those countries to decide to phase out lead in petrol since they reckoned that it was dangerous to the health of children in their countries <e>", "<cs> my lords while also congratulating the minister on his st housing bill i seek his sympathy for being the st speaker which i am so that most of the points have been admirably made and i fear that possibly he may have to hear me stressing one or two of them again <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister give us any idea about how far the research into the causes of children catching this infectious disease has reached <e>", "<cs> my lords first i apologise for speaking out of order <e> <s> my noble friend lord hatch of lusby was good enough to change places with me because i thought at one point the debate would go on at great length and i would sadly have to leave for a very long-standing engagement before it ended <e>", "<cs> i should like briefly to support this amendment <e> <s> it is generally felt that children who stay with their parents until the end and look after them who thus show their loyalty to their parents and also take away this responsibility from the state deserve the recognition of society that they have done so <e> <s> i think that in many cases such children on the death of the parents might well wish to change houses <e> <s> i should therefore like to support what the noble lord lord evans has said <e> <s> in many cases it surely would be possible for this to be arranged between the authority and remaining sons and daughters quite amicably <e> <s> i think that for society to say you have carried out your task of looking after your parents <e> <s> now you must get out is something very hard to accept <e>", "<cs> i should like to say a few words in support of the amendments <e> <s> the way that society relates to and views a particular crime is very much represented by the measure of punishment <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the many argentine casualties incurred by the sinking of the belgrano would the minister say what arrangements he would authorise for the visit by families of argentine servicemen who were killed in the falklands war to visit the graves there <e> <s> would the minister not agree that apart from the point of view of compassion and humanity the lack of enthusiasm towards such a visit is a greater tool for propaganda in the hands of the argentinians than would be a visit itself <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl the minister gave certain details of the rise in unemployment in certain countries <e> <s> will he confirm that france with its socialist government has succeeded in slightly reducing the number of unemployed in that country <e>", "<cs> my lords it would take a much braver person than i to prolong the debate of this particular parliamentary session by more than a few minutes but i believe we owe it to the people of northern ireland whose lives are fundamentally affected by the powers contained in these orders not to treat the passing of them as a mere formality <e>", "<cs> my lords i should first like to apologise to the noble lord the minister and to your lordships because i fear that i may have to leave before the end of this debate <e> <s> i will however read <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister say what if any family problems such as severe illness could be regarded by the minister as justifying the transfer of a prisoner back to northern ireland on compassionate grounds <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel that the subject of the debate is very timely all the more so when it is borne in mind that last week we heard that the number of school-leavers who are not obtaining jobs represents a very high proportion of the unemployment figures as a whole <e> <s> i certainly do not wish to make a long speech there is a lengthy list of noble lords who are to speak after me and like my noble friend lord wells-pestell i am not an expert <e> <s> however i should like to make a few points arising mainly from the experience that i have gained through my involvement with an organisation in belfast called the northern ireland voluntary trust which is deeply involved with young people and the national childrens centre in huddersfield <e> <s> in this regard i feel that i cannot let the occasion presented by this debate go by without mourning the tragic death at the weekend of brian jackson the creator of this centre in huddersfield <e> <s> for so many years he championed the cause of children and young people all over the country <e> <s> i am sure that there will be many of your lordships who will agree with me that the loss of his commitment and of the fruits of his brilliant highly original and innovative mind will be sadly felt by the youth of this country as it will be by those many people who try to help those young people <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that as we are talking about the safety of one building it would not be straying too far from the point to inquire after the health of the old kensington town hall <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to start by congratulating the noble earl on his new <e>", "<cs> my lords my purpose in speaking certainly is not to make a long speech <e> <s> already the points have been very well covered by the noble baroness lady macleod herself with support from the other speakers <e> <s> but it is such an important issue that i would wish to identify myself with the debate and also to underline some of the points that have already been made <e> <s> it has clearly been put forward that the case for closing this important hospital is really financial and that the wandsworth regional hospital health authority has stated that the savings that come out of this closure will go into developing the big new hospital at st georges and that this will provide services for priority groups in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister not agree that although an eec accord would obviously provide the ideal basis for the introduction of lead-free petrol nevertheless is a long way away <e> <s> would he not accept that if britain made a unilateral pronouncement on an earlier date as has germany this would encourage france and itlay who have been dragging their feet and would also help the motor industry to make their own forward planning <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships will be relieved to hear that i am not an expert on the national health service so my speech will consequently be very brief <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend lord molloy for giving us all an opportunity to reflect our fears and doubts about the future of the national health service <e> <s> i wish only to make three very brief points <e> <s> i am sorry if i repeat anything that another speaker may have said as i have not been here for the whole debate <e> <s> as it happened my daughter had an appointment with a doctor this evening so i had to absent myself from the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join all the speakers who have thanked the most reverend primate the archbishop of canterbury for initiating this debate and for presenting his speech in his characteristically lucid and humane fashion <e> <s> secondly i should like to apologise for having a very nasty cold <e> <s> i can only surmise that i caught it from the noble baroness lady trumpington during the national health service debate <e>", "<cs> i was apologising for having your cold <e> <s> i wish to concentrate on the part of this debate concerning the search for new ways of reducing crimes of violence <e> <s> after all the young offenders of today can tragically turn into the violent criminals of tomorrow <e> <s> i should like to concentrate on the work being done by the voluntary organisations and the youth movement to halt the movement of delinquency towards criminality <e> <s> i recognise that the noble lord lord hutchinson has mentioned this aspect but there has perhaps been insufficient reference to the important work carried out by youth social and voluntary organisations in the field of crime prevention <e> <s> i should like to focus especially on a community-based scheme called intermediate treatment which in my view has been highly successful in the prevention of crime among young people <e>", "<cs> my lords it is really impossible to speak in this debate tonight without reflecting on the great human tragedy and all the attendant pain which is brought on by divorce <e> <s> and it is therefore of particular concern to know that with divorce rising in all the western european countries it is nevertheless britain which is in the forefront with its rate of divorce having increased by per cent <e> <s> in the last years <e> <s> that means of course that an enormous number of children have had their lives turned upside down in that period <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness the minister say how often the british consul is allowed to visit prisoners when the british consul last visited prisoners and whether the embassy is giving the highest priority to the need to get medical attention for the prisoners <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble lord lord campbell of alloway for introducing this very important bill and for his extremely clear presentation of it <e> <s> i am sure i speak for all your lordships <e> <s> i should also like to ask your lordships indulgence towards any error i might commit in this my first appearance at the dispatch box on this side of the house <e>", "<cs> may i very briefly support one aspect of what my noble friend lady lockwood said <e> <s> i feel that there has been a lot of talk about marriage being debased but in the end it is only the two partners to a marriage who can debase it <e> <s> after all what will eventually keep those two partners together is either their love for each other or if they are not so lucky and as time goes on it will be the discipline which they exert <e> <s> it is a matter of how the law can best help them exert that discipline and i feel that any time bar and i do not mind how long it is could well deflect them from exerting that discipline of concen <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that in view of the very high level of divorce and of child abuse it would be right to include a course on parenthood within the curriculum and that this is a qualification which is very necessary for children coming out of school <e>", "<cs> may i add a brief word <e> <s> without knowing what the criteria of the government draftsman will be may i put the case that the qualifications represented in this amendment are even more important to certain categories of wives who are more vulnerable to divorce than others <e> <s> i should like to put the case of the category of wife who spends most of her time abroad <e> <s> these are service wives and in particular diplomatic service wives who if they have a profession are unable to implement it when they are abroad <e> <s> if they do not have a profession they are not in a position to gain any kind of other qualification which wives living at home with their husbands in this country would be in a better position to do <e> <s> although i do not want to make a special case of diplomatic and service wives i should like to cite them as an example to put into sharp focus the problems of wives generally who would have to contemplate the clean break which is included in this clause <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for his explanation but i am still not totally convinced about the section having worked perfectly well up to now <e> <s> i thought that one of the points of the bill was to deal with the increased number of children of divorced <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord say whether the level of heating additions for <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister agree that this coin is disliked not because people are unable to get used to it and not because of their reactions to it but because they just do not like it <e> <s> will the minister not agree that we should continue to take soundings for a little longer and keep the note which is popular <e> <s> for a little longer <e>", "<cs> i should like very briefly to say that i accept the criticisms of the noble lord the minister but i would ask him to remember the expressions of concern that came from many speakers on second reading and which had already been voiced in the debates on the local government miscellaneous provisions bill last year <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will bring on with a certain amount of urgency the research work that is now going to be carried out into this very worrying aspect about which teachers and people in the youth service are genuinely very concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i should also like to thank my noble friend lord cledwyn for having presented this very important subject to the house this afternoon and for having introduced it as he always does in a highly interesting and able way <e> <s> as he suggested i am going to confine myself to a very narrow part of the great choice that he has given us and i am going to speak a little about northern irelands housing <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for that answer <e> <s> but would she not agree that it is very worrying that this benefit has such a very low take-up rate when it is a recognised fact that children of one-parent families are among the most deprived in the country <e> <s> will the minister say what the government are doing to publicise the existence of this benefit <e> <s> secondly will the government consider using paid television advertising to try to get through to the per cent <e> <s> of these families who are in very great need and do not appear to know of this entitlement <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister agree that as the number of single parent families is unfortunately increasing and as the take-up of the benefit is clearly proving difficult the government will begin to think that it is becoming important to replace the present benefit with a non-contributory non-means tested benefit in the line of a widows benefit <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble minister for his answer <e> <s> would he not agree that the figure he has just given explains why so many old people have a justifiable fear of what they term a paupers funeral <e> <s> would he say first what means of assistance there are to relatives other than widows and widowers on supplementary benefit to help them meet these rising costs <e> <s> secondly would he say when the government will be ready to report on what many people would think was long overdue that is the future of the death grant <e>", "<cs> my lords i asked the minister what means of assistance in meeting these costs are available to a son or daughter who is not on supplementary benefit <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to support the principle underlying the two amendments which have been put forward by my noble friend lord hatch of lusby <e> <s> i should like to highlight the concern which is felt about the whole matter by giving the example of a particular category of wife who suffers from the quality of her husbands profession and who is therefore a target after divorce as a result of his profession <e> <s> i refer to the diplomatic service wife <e>", "<cs> my lords i should very much like to thank noble lords who have contributed to this short discussion <e> <s> i still maintain that the wording in this amendment is based on trying to safeguard the welfare of the child and of the custodial parent the mother <e> <s> i still do not have the total confidence which the noble and learned lord the lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make one point and that is simply that if your lordships house contained a higher proportion of noble baronesses noted for their brevity this proposition would never have arisen <e>", "<cs> my lords on a more general point would the minister not agree that intimidation of both prison wardens and their families might well have contributed to making this break-out possible <e> <s> would he not agree that it means that government policy should focus on building up greater trust with the minority community in order to drive a wedge between them and the provisional ira <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly do not intend to prolong this debate by more than a few minutes because i feel this would not be popular but i should like to take advantage of the opportunity before this bill moves on to make one or two points <e> <s> first there can be no doubt that those of us who took part in all stages of this bill can only be grateful for the concern and indeed the passion that the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor put into it <e> <s> we have felt very relieved at the general welcome given to so much of it by the noble and learned lords who have taken part in the debates <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord give us an assurance that if public communication breaks down the foreign office will keep the relatives of members of the embassy very closely informed <e> <s> mr david miers and his wife are close friends of mine and they have three young children at school in england <e> <s> i know that sometimes in the heat of the moment it is forgotten to pass on much-wanted information about relatives in places of danger <e>", "<cs> my lords i should first like to thank as i did before all noble lords who have spoken in this debate <e> <s> of one thing i am convinced that all aspects of the subject from the geographic legal and human points of view have been covered this afternoon <e> <s> i agree with the minister that one aspect that has emerged from this debate is the very great depth of knowledge and experience that so many of your lordships have and how so many have such a deep commitment and involvement in the life of the community <e> <s> i am extremely grateful to my noble friend lord rhodes who told us what is happening in manchester and to my noble friend lord longford who told of his experience and his commitment to this particular area of the community <e> <s> i am also extremely grateful to the noble earl lord halsbury not only for his characteristically elegant speech but also for putting forward very practical ideas as did the noble baroness lady macleod of borve <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the ministers original answer that it is youth which forms the highest part of unemployment would he not agree that apprenticeship is a sure way to employment as shown by the youth schemes in germany and austria <e> <s> will he say whether he is satisfied that british firms offer as many apprenticeships as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble lord for his answer but i think it will not quell the fears of those many great organisations dealing with the homeless <e> <s> for example would the minister not agree that those local authorities already threatened with rate-capping legislation will be entirely unable to replace the present glc funding <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that in char alone has been given by the glc for work for the homeless <e> <s> would he not agree that future planning for the increasing problem of the homeless must be the responsibility of central government and that all the voluntary organisations would like to see their fears set at rest by the department of the environment bringing out a long-term planned research on how to deal with future problems of the homeless <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord not agree that he has not really accepted that there is a very great urgency so far as concerns the planning of the voluntary organisations <e> <s> i will give him the example if i may of the piccadilly advice centre which does amazing work for all the young people pouring into london with no homes to go to <e> <s> that organisation cannot do their future planning <e> <s> would he not accept that there is a very great urgency as far as they are concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i support my noble friend in this new clause <e>", "<cs> i am sorry my lords <e> <s> to start again i support my noble friend in this amendment and will speak particularly on how it relates to nursery education <e> <s> first i should like to remind your lordships that it is now years since the plowden report and white paper set out the governments aim regarding nursery provision <e> <s> that aim was that nursery education should become available without charge within the limits estimated by plowden to those three and four year-olds whose parents wished them to benefit from it <e> <s> plowden estimated that provision would be needed for per cent <e> <s> of four year-olds and per cent <e> <s> of three year-olds <e> <s> however the sad truth today is that those years having elapsed there are in fact places available for only just over per cent <e> <s> of all three and four year-olds put together <e> <s> therefore there is no doubt that there has been only minuscule progress made in the direction that the prime minister who was at that time secretary of state for education had hoped for <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble earl for that answer <e> <s> but does he not agree that last nights decision by hertfordshire county council may make the new conditions of service imposed on women working in the school meals service impossible for them to accept and will thereby result in the closure of that service <e> <s> would the noble earl not further agree that hereford and worcester county council has already closed its service <e> <s> does the minister not regret the divisive effect that this will have on children who have free meals as being the only ones receiving them <e> <s> if this trend continues and further local authorities close their services will the government not seek to take some action <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am grateful to the noble baroness lady burton of coventry for <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord for that explanation <e> <s> he is without any doubt better placed than i am to regard the effect of this particular amendment upon the entirety of his bill <e> <s> i will therefore accept his offer of a discussion later <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment for the time being <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord lord campbell of alloway could go a little further in his explanation of this amendment <e> <s> perhaps i am being rather stupid but can he tell me whether he envisages that the operator of an arcade with many machines would pay the same fee as the owner of a single machine <e>", "<cs> my lords i quite understand the noble lords explanation <e> <s> if for my benefit he would repeat it i should be very grateful <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord be good enough to tell me what he means by the reproduction of light <e> <s> i understand all the others <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to support what my noble friend lord carmichael of kelvingrove has said from one particular point of view <e> <s> that is that he has made quite clear the dangers of interfering in any way with entertainment which is a family affair <e> <s> the thought of interfering with that wonderful and totally innocent pleasure that a whole family can have together at a travelling showmans pleasure fair or indeed at any of the holiday resorts is of great concern <e> <s> for this reason i am glad that my noble friend has made this point clear in putting forward his amendment which i support <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that i had not realised that the question about amendment no <e> <s> had been put <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord campbell for that clear explanation and also for his explanation that the responsibility for this should be left with the local authority <e> <s> the reason that i had originally thought my amendment preferable to the noble lords amendment no <e> <s> was that my amendment preserves the well-tried system which has been operating under the gaming act until now <e> <s> this is what gave me the idea that this was a better way of doing it <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord for having explained matters and i now see that his own amendment no <e> <s> covers this aspect probably in a better way <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to speak on amendments nos <e> <s> and which i must admit i do not feel very happy about <e> <s> i think it would be extremely hard to allow children into these premises and yet make sure that they do not use the machines <e> <s> indeed i thought one of the main purposes of the bill was to stop children going into some of these arcades and establishments because of the bad company they would encounter and to avoid the possible dangers there might be within those places <e> <s> so i feel that this is a dilution of the bill which to my mind changes it very much indeed because these amendments seem to stop the protection of children which is what some of us have most in mind in connection with this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord for what he has said about this amendment <e> <s> i tried to include the words vehicle vessel or stall by means of a previous amendment <e> <s> the noble lord understands that i am seeking to ensure that these premises are roomy enough for people to move around in without bumping into each other and that i am trying to avoid the very dangers about which we have previously spoken that children get too close to other people on these premises <e> <s> the noble lord has said that he will consider a shortened version of the amendment for which i am very grateful <e> <s> i shall therefore put forward a revised version of the amendment at third reading <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry about the reaction of the noble lord lord campbell of alloway to my amendment no <e> <s> before i have reached it <e> <s> however i hope that i shall be able to present it to him in a way which will make him a little more optimistic <e> <s> i thank the noble lord for what he has said about amendment no <e> <s> without the reference to my next amendment amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i should be grateful if we could talk about the amendments as the noble lord agrees with the spirit of amendment no <e> <s> and find some way around the problem <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord campbell of alloway for explaining the reason for this mind-boggling decrease because it had not occurred to me <e> <s> it does stress the importance of my amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i believe we would agree that the sum of as a fine having heard at second reading about some of the profits <e>", "<cs> my lords i would like to thank the noble lord lord campbell of alloway for explaining very clearly why he cannot accept this amendment <e> <s> i do of course understand that it has already been sullied by parts of my previous amendments which he has also been unable to accept <e> <s> i would like to think that the noble lord accepts the purpose and spirit of this amendment and that he agrees that the proposed new clause would introduce much more clarity and a more logical way of seeing the responsibility of the local authority <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that one of the present problems is the low take-up of certain benefits the benefits that appear to be most needed such as the one-parent benefits <e> <s> therefore does he think that this review might help a little with that particular problem <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister give the sum which he estimates would be saved in the financial year by the genuine substitution of generic names for brand names in national health service prescriptions <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord campbell of alloway has said these amendments were tabled in a slightly different form at the report stage under my name <e> <s> they were discussed at that time and i give the amended form which the noble lord lord campbell has brought forward now my complete support <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to take this opportunity of thanking the noble lord lord campbell of alloway for all the work and commitment that he has put into bringing this bill forward and to steering it through the house <e> <s> i should also like to tell him of my great admiration for the perseverance that he has shown <e> <s> nevertheless i should like to take this opportunity of making one or two general points about the spirit behind the bill and the purpose which the noble lord lord campbell and i have shared in our attitude towards it <e>", "<cs> in spite of the explanation from the noble lord lord nugent i should nevertheless like to support my noble friend lord mishcon in this amendment <e> <s> i cannot add much to the argument he has put except to stress that the industry will be very hard hit by the effect of this bill and will be looking around very seriously for other means of trading <e> <s> therefore i should have thought that the amendment would protect against the use of the export ticket as a cloak for trading under the black market in this country and would also save this country from getting the name which certainly we do not want of being great traders abroad in video nasties <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware perhaps she is not that i am president of the british branch of an ngo called sos sahel which works against drought in the sahel regions <e> <s> would she not agree that if perhaps i told her about this organisation she would find it worthy of government support <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the first question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his reply <e> <s> nevertheless is he aware that the section of the act to which i referred categorically states that local authorities should not sell land for less than the best consideration that can be obtained <e> <s> would he not agree that the offer from landmark properties was not only higher in financial terms than that of guinness peat but also included square feet of land at the rear of the building for community use <e>

that the offer was late ignores the fact that the sale was by private treaty and moreover that private treaty means that offers and counter-offers are allowed up to the very last moment <e>", "<cs> my

plans for producing a leaflet for claimants showing them what are their rights in respect of bed and breakfast accommodation <e> <s> have the dhss any plans for not giving claimants vouchers for accommodation that they reckon to be substandard <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister not agree that where unfurnished accommodation is available and the claimant has no furniture a single payment out of public funds for furniture is better than putting that claimant into furnished accommodation which very often is bed and breakfast and is going to cost a great deal more than a single furniture payment <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister give us any idea of how many motorists are stopped by the police and breathalysed because the police mistake a motorists hesitation while trying to decipher a road sign for his being under the influence of drink <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the noble minister agree that there is no use in organisations such as the womens cervical cancer <e>",

amendments which i spoke to in the first place <e> <s> they bring the duty of the police to keep parents <e>", "<cs> the minister is quite right <e> <s> i therefore only move amendment no <e> <s> a

rather than in the code of practice <e> <s> i can see that the minister is rot at all keen on that and so we shall probably ponder gloomily upon it <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the amendment includes a provision that juveniles should be strip searched in exceptional circumstances and they would be if the police suspected that they were carrying something or that they were guilty of some previous crime <e> <s> the rest of what the minister said just showed that it would take rather a lot of trouble and it would not be very convenient <e> <s> i feel that this is a bad reason for not taking a great deal of care and keeping those young people who are not guilty of any offence but who are drawn in through the extra powers in this bill out of a police station <e> <s> it is disappointing that the noble lord has this negative approach <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment and we shall think about it before report stage <e>", "<cs> i can add little to what the noble baroness lady masham has already said <e> <s> i should like to support her in her amendment <e> <s> her addition of a registered midwife is important in this case from the point of view of the woman from a particular ethnic origin and because this seems to be the kind of task for which a midwife should be responsible perhaps more than anybody else or any other member of the medical profession <e>", "<cs> could the noble baroness give me examples of children in england and wales who are being used in this way by evil men and by terrorists for the purpose of

involved in excluding them <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble baroness for giving me two examples but i still do not think that that is very many <e> <s> however i should like to thank her for explaining this provision so fully and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> b concerns a child or young person on a care order but living at home <e> <s> this amendment is to ensure that both the authority and the parents should be contacted without delay <e> <s> this is again giving the same urgency <e> <s> the intention of amendment no <e> <s> c is once again to bring some speed into informing parents and so on about a detained young person <e> <s> we feel that this amendment and our proposed new clause under amendment no <e> <s> ya would go a long way to prevent the present abuses in which completely inexplicable delays are made in informing parents of the whereabouts of their children and would indeed greatly increase parents and young peoples confidence in the police <e> <s> apparently complaints of such delays are in fact the most common ones among those received by the childrens legal centre <e> <s> the reason for the delay could in many cases only really be analysed as a deliberate wish of the police authorities to deal with a child or young person without the presence of an independent adult <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank the noble and learned lord for replying to all the amendments in such a lucid way <e> <s> the purpose of several of them was merely to prevent delay <e> <s> as i say there is considerable anxiety and there have been many complaints from parents when delay has occurred <e> <s> as a parent one can recognise that great anxiety is caused by not knowing where ones child is <e> <s> the need to inform a friend or relative is to cater for the fact that some parents do not respond and to ensure that a grown-up is there with the child <e> <s> however as i say i should like to thank the noble and learned lord for his very full reply and for the moment i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for his reply but it is not just a matter of sincerity <e> <s> we are trying to stop children from being incorporated in this ciminal procedure <e> <s> anybody would agree that a child of would suffer serious psychological effects from having an intimate body sample taken <e> <s>

feel that many hopes will be placed on how it is formed and on what it will do <e> <s> i should like to reiterate the priority that there should he on it a young person <e> <s> i think that the minister would agree that there is a very fragile link between young people and authority and that this might be strengthened through young people participating in the advisory body <e> <s> furthermore one important role for it would be to make quite sure that its work is co-ordinated with the youth service so as to inform young people about new developments in the law such as the new powers in the police and criminal evidence bill and to ensure that young people know about their own rights under it <e> <s> i could give other examples but that is one of them <e>", "<cs> moved manuscript amendment no <e> <s> b <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of that assurance i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> moved manuscript amendment no <e> <s> za <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> moved amendment no <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble and learned lord for his answer <e> <s> even if we shared the same principle we had quite a different idea about the necessity for the reasons which i gave to have an independent adult present when young people are being questioned <e> <s> the argument that parents would not want to attend is a bad one which i have heard before <e> <s> if we create a law which allows parents not to wish to come to support their children they will be more likely not to come forward to support their children <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for his answer <e> <s> i still do not think that he met the point that we were trying to make in this amendment namely that there is no doubt that when waiting for an adult to arrive at the police station the police very often do interrogate the child and the child can be years old <e> <s> it is during the early stages of questioning that a child would be most likely to say something <e> <s> it was to prevent the risk of a child making a confession during that early period before the grown-up came that this amendment was put forward <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may speak to my amendment and then bring in a reference to the amendment of the noble lord <e> <s> the aim of our own amendment was to make sure that the rights of parents were strengthened and to ensure the presence of an independent adult at each stage of a young persons being in police custody <e> <s> this has been the aim also of the amendment that we have tabled <e> <s> however if i may speak to the ministers amendment we feel that the onus should remain on the parents needing to be given the information about the whereabouts of their child and that reasonable efforts meaning the continuation of efforts should be made by the police to try to locate the parents and let them know where their child is <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to the noble minister for coming so far towards what we were asking <e> <s> the only point about which i was asking him was this <e> <s> when the police say that it is not practical is that because it is impractical from their point of view because there is a lot of work on at the station and so on and therefore it is not practicable to go in a car try to find the parent and bring him back to the police station or whatever takes place <e> <s> or is it not practical in that they literally cannot make contact <e> <s> in such a case i would say that they should go on trying to make contact with the parent <e> <s> this was what was laid out more clearly in our amendment that they would have to go on taking steps to try to make contact with the parents to ensure that the parents were there with their child <e>", "<cs> my lords again i am very grateful to the minister for having gone towards what we wanted but i am not quite sure that i agree with him that it covers the same purpose as our amendment <e> <s> i feel that the government amendment is obviously very much more vague and generalised and lays down a more vague and generalised requirement <e> <s> in our amendment we are trying to bring the arrested juvenile into line with other young people in care <e> <s> i do not see why we should not wish to bring them into line with other young people in care including those who are remanded to care having been refused bail during an adjournment in criminal proceedings <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add just a few words <e> <s> my major concern during the passage of the bill has been to emphasise that the new powers accorded to the police under the bill will fall heavily on young people <e> <s> i think that possibly that has not been emphasised enough at any point <e> <s> indeed the new powers of stop and search and of arrest will undoubtedly affect many young people in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords on the matter of vacancies to which the minister referred can he say how they are spread over the whole county <e> <s> will he also say whether they are vacancies appropriate to take in the young people who leave the youth training schemes <e>", "<cs> my lords without allowing myself to go into lengthy congratulations to the two maiden speakers i should nevertheless like to take this opportunity to say how very much i admired both of their speeches the more so as both noble lords spoke on the subjects of the european community and the foreign office which are very close to my heart <e> <s> but for my own part i should like to touch on one aspect of foreign policy which was referred to in the gracious speech that of close relations between the governments of london and dublin <e> <s> i do this both <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords i very much welcome the long and clearly <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to say that we are grateful for this opportunity coming at such an opportune moment to debate this particular subject <e> <s> i do not want to speak at very great length as it is rather late but i should like to speak on two different areas <e> <s> first i should like to make a few general points about the vital need for long-term development projects in third world countries and i should like to make these comments <e>", "<cs> my lords granted that this is a hypothetical situation would not the minister nevertheless give a view as to what the relationship would be between the free newspapers and the paid-for newspapers if vat were imposed on the cover price of the latter <e>", "<cs> my lords following the noble baronesss question can the noble minister say how many sniffer dogs are used by customs and excise <e> <s> secondly is he satisfied that adequate staff are deployed in the investigation division of customs and <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister nevertheless not agree that some of the americans who send funds to ireland are ignorant of the situation in ireland and think that they are sending funds to widows and children <e> <s> therefore will the minister give a commitment that any of the cuts envisaged for the foreign office will not fall on the strength of the british information services in the united states who do their very best to educate the american public as to what is going on in ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords not only am i too very grateful to my noble friend for raising this very important issue i am also extremely admiring of the very clear and wide ranging way that he presented this subject <e> <s> so as i am not an expert like the previous speaker like the noble lord lord energlyn and as the subject has already been very well covered and it is becoming very late i should like to make two rather simple and more general points <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord alport in very clear terms has made an overwhelming case for the government to make some changes and to take some remedial action to satisfy the most fundamental human requirements which prevail <e>", "<cs> my lords in putting this question before your lordships this evening my noble friend lord longford has very rightly focussed attention on the plight of a particular group of people who are really among the least fortunate members of the community <e> <s> he has also brought to light the failure to deal satisfactorily with their tragic situation <e> <s> we have benefited from the highly specialised knowledge <e>", "<cs> my lords like the right reverend prelate the bishop of norwich i also cannot resist congratulating the two maiden speakers and saying how much i enjoyed both their speeches and how highly relevant to this motion i found them <e>", "<cs> my lords i think there should not be discrimination of job opportunities between men and women who have the same qualifications <e>", "<cs> i should like to make one general point but first i should like to apologise to your lordships for the disappointment that you must be feeling that it is me at this dispatch box instead of my noble friend lord mishcon with all his wealth of experience <e> <s> however he is out of the country today and so is unable to be here <e> <s> all i can say is that i hope your lordships will take advantage of the fact that i must be very representative of a lot of lay trustees who will be very much affected by the provisons of this bill <e> <s> perhaps they can use me as a measuring stick as to how much comprehension will be inspired by the bill itself <e> <s> i think it is true to say that wide comprehension of this bill is an essential criterion for its success <e>", "<cs> in spite of all the precautions that have been taken i believe that this clause still lays a heavy responsibility on the trustees of a charity <e> <s> as the noble viscount said it is a case where they will have to go in for a do-it-yourself operation changing the objects of the charity <e> <s> having to work out how to adjust them while keeping them similar to the original objects and continuing to be charitable is quite a baffling task to many lay trustees <e> <s> i worry about the possibility that some trustees may become very puzzled <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble viscount for clarifying that and explaining it to me <e>", "<cs> i should like to support everything that the noble lord lord airedale and the noble baroness lady faithfull have said <e> <s> i too believe there is a certain sanctity in the wishes of the founders of a charity being respected <e> <s> very often there could have been something highly symbolic about their wishes in creating a certain charity <e> <s> this is something that to my mind the benefits of raising the level could not justify <e> <s> for this reason and also the reason that if a principle is to be breached then the breach should be kept as small as possible i am unable to support this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords will not the minister agree that while there are no plans to ensure that there is value for money in board and lodgings then provided that the accommodation is within the limits set down it will be supported by the department of health and social security however bad are the standards <e> <s> will he not agree that that is a very unsatisfactory situation <e>", "<cs> my lords there is very little that i can add but i should like merely to support what the noble viscount and what the noble and learned lord lord brightman have said <e> <s> from my way of seeing it the figure was set by the select committee after a very great deal of consideration <e> <s> it was in two minds as to whether to keep this clause in at all and therefore the very fact that it arrived at this figure gives it in my view a considerable strength <e>", "<cs> my lords not only am i very grateful to the noble viscount for the subject of this debate this afternoon but i am most thankful that he won the ballot for this particular wednesday as it coincides with my return from a day visit to the sudan <e> <s> therefore i feel better equipped to join in this debate <e> <s> i visited the sudan in my capacity as president of unicef in the united kingdom <e> <s> not only did i go to see the health and water projects designed to focus effort on self-reliance and self-help but i was able to see also something of the refugee camps both within the country and outside it <e> <s> i will confine my remarks purely to the crisis within the sudan <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for expressing concern and appreciation for the report <e> <s> will he nevertheless agree that the report exposed some very real accommodation problems that young people leaving home prematurely are experiencing <e> <s> will the government take the two following initiatives which might relieve the crisis <e> <s> first will they extend the housing and homeless persons act to include under year-olds within the priority groups and secondly will they clarify for local authorities the legal position regarding tenancies for young people while at the same time urging the local authorities to issue tenancies to under year-olds in need of accommodation <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the piccadilly advice centre which is on the receiving end of a great number of young people who turn up destitute in london estimates that per cent <e> <s> of its callers will have their housing problems exacerbated by the change in the board and lodging regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords from what many noble lords have said already there is no doubt that this bill has aroused a great deal of concern among a great number of people in this country <e> <s> as the right reverend prelate the bishop of southwark said never <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for those figures although i find them quite horrifying <e> <s> is the minister aware and i am sure that he is that this act was brought into force to combat the rates and rent act in northern ireland <e> <s> while it is generally accepted that the emergency created by that strike came to an end in the emergency powers are still in force now in <e> <s> how can the minister justify that northern irelands poorest families should be subjected to different and more draconian methods of reclaiming debt than people in the rest of the united kingdom <e> <s> would the minister not agree that it is time to revise the whole debt legislation in northern ireland with particular focus on the repayment of debt act in order to bring it into line with the rest of the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say whether money taken direct from wages under this act is taken on a more excessive scale in northern ireland than it is in the rest of the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the womens national cancer control <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister comment on my suggestion about a record card system <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister be a little more explicit about what will happen to the endowment fund set up in the first place for the south london hospital for women and what arrangements are being made to carry on this endowment fund <e>", "<cs> my lords i asked the minister to be a little more explicit about what will happen to the endowment fund which was set up in the first place to create the south london hospital for women and which is still in existence <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has chosen for her motion a subject which can always do with an airing <e> <s> for that reason we are extremely grateful to her <e> <s> indeed the very fact that we are having this debate is ample proof that the circumstances surrounding a womans place in society are infinitely less firmly structured than those for a man <e> <s> moreover those circumstances are more vulnerable to the economic pendulum of the times <e> <s> so all in all i think there would be general agreement that it is much harder to be a woman than a man and while that situation remains unchanged there will always be a need for the whole subject to be discussed although i cannot help feeling that if the situation had been reversed and this debate had been concerned with mens position in society then not very much levity would have been allowed to creep into this debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> but my lords will the minister not agree that more is now necessary <e> <s> does he recollect that in the first place the tobacco companies failed in their voluntary agreement not to advertise on television before pm an agreement which was designed to protect children <e> <s> is he aware that since the act banning tobacco advertising on television they have tried to circumvent this law by sponsoring sports events which is designed to make children associate sports such as car racing and snooker and adventure holidays with smoking <e> <s> thus would the noble earl not agree that in order adequately to protect our children from a product which kills one in four of its consumers we should perhaps now follow the example of norway and finland and ban the promotion of cigarettes <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister not concerned i am sure he is that great britain has one of the highest rates in the world of lung cancer among women <e> <s> does this not make him feel that every <e>", "<cs> i rise to support this amendment to which my name is attached but in doing so i view it with a certain trepidation as it is a very controversial and even emotional subject as has already been proved by the two noble lords who have just spoken <e> <s> however i do not agree with them that these amendments are irrelevant to this bill and i shall come to my arguments in favour of that in a moment <e>", "<cs> i was addressing myself to the bill that is before us for discussion this evening <e>", "<cs> may i for one second support this amendment by giving just one other example in which i have myself been involved and which i think absolutely supports what my noble friend has been saying <e> <s> this again is a training and education centre for women this time in haringey <e> <s> its present funding is made up of only per cent <e> <s> from the borough of haringey per cent <e> <s> from the glc and per cent <e> <s> from the ec <e> <s> as my noble friend lady lockwood has said it is very difficult to understand how that funding of which the borough is giving only per cent <e> <s> will be brought up to per cent <e> <s> quickly enough to guarantee getting the ec funding from the social fund <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble baroness two short questions <e> <s> the noble baroness said that it was families with children who needed help most <e> <s> can she elaborate a little on how one-parent families are going to benefit through the changes whether they would indeed go on receiving one-parent family benefit or whether they would benefit from the family credit scheme that the noble baroness was describing <e> <s> secondly the noble baroness implied that an older widow was in greater need of help because she would be less likely to get employment <e> <s> that is what i understood her to say <e> <s> would she not think that a young widow after all there are some is in greater need because she still has children to support and to bring up <e> <s> i wonder whether she might clarify that point for me <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendments <e> <s> as previous speakers have said my noble friend lady david has put the case very clearly and so there is no point in going over it but i should really like to stress two of the arguments <e> <s> it is a startling fact that britain is the only european country which allows the beating of school children <e> <s> it is a point that one cannot really overlook and one cannot in any way justify <e> <s> the other point is that no professional organisation concerned with education or child welfare favours the retention of corporal punishment <e> <s> these are two very overwhelming facts and points <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a very important question which is being put before us this afternoon by the noble lord lord harris of greenwich and one which concerns the lives of very many people <e> <s> it is a pity that it is arising late on a friday afternoon <e> <s> nevertheless it is attracting very serious consideration on this side of the house and i hope that it will also be attracting similar attention from the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support this amendment to which i have put my name <e> <s> the noble lord lord kilmarnock has put the case extremely fully <e> <s> there is only one point which i should like to stress <e> <s> it has been accepted by the government that there will be transitional difficulties for organisations operating within boroughs or districts <e> <s> as the noble lord said the government have proved this most handsomely by promising special funding to act as a bridge to help those voluntary organisations maintain a flow in their services <e> <s> therefore how can the government argue that voluntary organisations operating in a slightly different way on a trans-borough or a county-wide project should not need that bridge <e> <s> it seems to me that it would be rather difficult for the minister to explain the logic behind what appears to be a great inconsistency <e>", "<cs> my lords to be a mere run-of-the-mill speaker today among such an eminent group of maidens is a great honour <e> <s> although the term galaxy of talent is rather over-used it is nevertheless a relevant term to describe the maiden speakers we have heard today <e>", "<cs> my lords it is several years since i have spoken in this particular debate on this highly important subject and although my noble friend on the front bench has made a very clear statement and a very clear analysis with which i entirely agree i should like to take this opportunity to make a few rather more general points about the <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that very encouraging answer <e> <s> nevertheless does the minister not agree that there is a need for urgent action to deal with this situation where out of the women who develop breast cancer annually die <e> <s> many of those women would not die were the disease detected in time <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness assure the house that the research already done in the united states sweden and holland where it has been proved that mammography screening is most effective will be taken into account by our own working groups and that the cost will not deter the government from taking that method seriously into account <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister assure the house that when the review report is being considered the emphasis will be not so much on short-term economies and commercial concerns but rather on the long-term interests of both the patients and the industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that answer and also for his concern <e> <s> does he not agree that the report from the holloway project committee plus the recommendations from mind and the nccl point to an even more positive and structured response from the government <e> <s> does he not acknowledge the fact that in this unit there were in the last month alone no fewer than self <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask one more question relating to the holloway project report <e> <s> in view of the fact that there was a dhss representative sitting on this committee were there any proposals made by that department the dhss for setting up units to assess mentally disturbed women as an alternative to the facilities in holloway <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for that answer although i had rather hoped that she would answer differently <e> <s> will the minister explain why the government have a different approach to this international year of shelter for the homeless than they have had to previous international years for the child for the disabled and for youth where they accepted that there should be a focus on the activity both at home and abroad <e> <s> can the minister justify this apparent inconsistency <e> <s> secondly in order to show the commitment that the government have to the numerous homeless in this country will the minister give an undertaking to put into this international year of shelter for the homeless as much from government funds as that put in by voluntary and private funders <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the proof of the very great importance with which the house regards this order is the number of speakers present on a friday afternoon who wish to take part in this debate <e> <s> before i make one or two points i should like to apologise to the minister in case i am unable because of the debate having started a little later than i thought to be here when he replies <e> <s> i look forward to reading his responses in <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to apologise for having arrived a little late for this debate <e> <s> i had a long-standing speaking engagement at lunchtime in kent <e> <s> for that reason i was most sorry to have missed the speeches of the right reverend primate and the noble baroness <e> <s> i very much look forward to reading them in <e>", "<cs> my lords i think there will be general agreement that if one is st in the list and one of the last speakers one makes a long speech at ones peril <e> <s> i am certainly not brave enough to do that <e> <s> i should therefore like to confine myself very briefly to the second part of the motion of my noble friend concerning the proposals for the reform of the social security system <e>", "<cs> my lords although i respect the views of the noble lord lord moran who has just spoken i think in this case the examples that he gave of the dangers of setting up similar frameworks with other countries are really irrelevant in that we have set up this framework in which a friendly country has a consultative role in dealing with a problem which we have failed to deal with in any other way <e> <s> thus in this case the arguments surely can be seen in an entirely different way <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i can say one thing with complete safety that is that every relevant point both supporting and opposing the bill and supporting and opposing the amendment has been well and truly made <e> <s> i think i can also say with complete certitude that the noble lords who have spoken have spoken with authority in many cases with very many years of experience and all of them with a sincere belief <e> <s> they have shown that this is a question which in good faith can be viewed in entirely different ways <e> <s> it is for that reason that it is of very great importance that we on this side of the house have stressed that we have a free vote as have the alliance parties <e> <s> that is because as i say it is with good faith that one takes one view or the opposite one <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether he can tell the house in how many schools serious courses in methods of self-protection are given to girls <e> <s> would he not agree that if this instruction is given to even very small girls as to how to deal with being accosted in a street this might bring down the heart-breaking number of cases where small girls and bigger girls are accosted by men <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that following the united states withdrawal from unesco private contributions to unicef in the united states dropped substantially because of a loss of confidence in the united nations and confusion between the two names <e> <s> the united kingdom committee for unicef of which i am president fears very much that the same thing will happen in this country <e> <s> does the minister not agree that it would be deplorable if unicef which depends on private <e>", "<cs> my lords i must admit that when i got out of bed this morning i did not think that i should be involved this evening in such a dark part of life as suicide <e> <s> the only reason that i am at the <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may add to what was said by my noble friend lord melchett <e> <s> most of the comments made have been about the education and interests of the children <e> <s> it goes without saying that it would be of great advantage both to education and to children to have experiments on animals <e> <s> but less has been said about the precautions and measures taken for the well-being of the animals in those schools <e> <s> i have no doubt that the masters would be in charge but they might be under some great stress <e> <s> i cannot see that adequate precautions would be taken for safeguarding the well-being and care of animals if they were used in secondary schools <e>", "<cs> this is an important amendment <e> <s> speaking for the laymen and both i and my noble friend are laymen the way in which animals are treated and looked after is a very important aspect <e> <s> there are a great many laymen <e> <s> we have talked about the general public and we must remember that they are an enormously vital part of our discussions this evening <e> <s> therefore the thought that animals which are undergoing experiments may not be under constant surveillance by people who are fully skilled and fully available to do so is very worrying <e> <s> this is an important amendment <e> <s> it is common sense and everybody should relate to it <e> <s> i hope that the minister will look upon it very favourably <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for that answer and also for the personal concern which i know he has shown on this subject <e> <s> notwithstanding that would he not agree that the present situation in the c unit is both intolerable and critical <e> <s> is he aware that in november alone there <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has spoken of assessment but not much assessment is needed to safeguard the security of prisoners by changing the washbasins or the heating installations and surely these could have been carried out <e> <s> may i ask whether they have indeed been carried out <e>", "<cs> i should like to speak briefly to this amendment and to reiterate what are peoples main interests in this bill <e> <s> their four priorities are that the interests of small shopkeepers should be <e>", "<cs> i should like to make a few brief remarks about this amendment which has been clearly presented by the noble viscount and by my noble friend lord graham <e> <s> they have put it forward as another option so that all those who are concerned about de-regulation can think about it look at it <e> <s> and briefly discuss it <e> <s> for that reason it is very important <e>", "<cs> the only trouble with the reply of the noble lord the minister is that he has not really responded to the amendment in the same spirit and light in which the amendment was presented <e> <s> the point of the amendment like many others has been at the same time to restrict sunday trading and to provide for the needs of the consumer <e> <s> my noble friend has suggested many different ways of doing that <e> <s> he is quite honest in admitting that they are all different options and therefore they must be responded to on the basis that they are different ways of changing the present bill <e> <s> the noble lord the minister has replied time and again that it is not for the government to intervene in the market place <e> <s> the noble lord has always gone back to the area from which he argues <e>", "<cs> this is a very important amendment and i hope that the minister will consider it in a favourable light <e> <s> it is as my noble friend lord melchett has said important from the point of view of safeguarding the interests of stray dogs and cats <e> <s> though as he said it does not happen very often it does happen that they have found their way to laboratories <e> <s> also it will contain the anxieties of our enormous pet-owning public <e> <s> i can vouch for that anxiety because we have a spaniel puppy and my daughter takes her for a walk about twice a day to the local park where she meets a club of mainly rather old ladies who also walk their dogs <e> <s> it took only about two days of her taking the dog for a walk to come back with this horrifying story <e> <s> she had been warned by the other dog owners that on no account should she let her puppy go because otherwise this dear little spaniel puppy would end up in a laboratory <e>", "<cs> i am glad the minister said that he would consider the suggestion of the right reverend prelate <e> <s> it seemed to me to mix in well with the ingredients of the membership of the committee <e> <s> not only would a lay member create the balance that he suggests he may also see issues in a purely common sense way more easily related to the thoughts of the general public <e>", "<cs> i too shall be very interested to hear what the minister has to say on this <e> <s> as the right reverend prelate said it is implicit in the whole bill so why not include the words need to reduce the number of animals used in experimentation in the bill <e> <s> certainly one has the feeling that this is very much one of the objectives of the bill and indeed it is taking place anyhow <e> <s> if it is at all possible why not include this reassurance <e>", "<cs> i must say that i think i am more convinced by the fears of the noble lord lord adrian than by the ministers explanations <e> <s> i understood what he said about the danger to the constable owing to the nature of the experiments which were taking place and i felt that if as the minister said such an occurrence were so rare then surely an inspector could be made available <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord lord adrian will be quite happy with the ministers explanation in which case of course i shall be too but up to now i am not sure that i am <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister give some other examples of what that could cover <e> <s> this raises all sorts of possibilities in our minds <e> <s> it has been mentioned that the results of plastic baton rounds would come into that category <e> <s> what other kind of wound could be inflicted that would be permissible under paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment to which i have put my name <e> <s> i should like to give a few additional reasons to those which have already been given by my noble friend for including this amendment <e> <s> there can be no doubt that there are a vast number of unnecessary drugs which are introduced for commercial reasons <e> <s> one can only wonder whether all of them are necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot accept the milksop accusation from the noble earl <e> <s> we must point out straightaway that the noble earl has himself decided to have an operation on his foot and is suffering pain as a consequence <e> <s> we are talking about animals who presumably did not themselves choose to suffer extreme pain but for our convenience they are doing so <e> <s> i do not think that those two arguments should be mixed up together <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not see why we have to bring that argument in either <e> <s> we are talking about animals which are undergoing scientific experimentation which will be to the benefit of human beings <e> <s> all of us who are taking part in this debate have presumably put ourselves to some kind of a test where we accept that pain has to be inflicted on animals <e> <s> say for example that our own child is suffering from an illness and we know that great progress has been made in overcoming the illness as a result of animal experimentation <e> <s> that is the only test that one can put to oneself and accept that animals are put to extreme pain <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much welcome what the minister has said <e> <s> i spoke on this particular amendment at the committee stage and i expressed anxieties passed on to me by other pet owners <e> <s> therefore i very much hope that the minister will keep to the sort of formula which my noble friend has established in his amendment <e> <s> this is a very real worry <e> <s> i know of it simply from hearsay the rspca know it for fact although it is a very difficult fact to prove <e> <s> they know that many pets find their way into laboratories <e> <s> having spoken at the committee stage on this subject i very much welcome what the <e>", "<cs> my lords as i brought this point up strongly in committee i should also like to thank the minister very much <e> <s> i welcome the amendment <e> <s> the balance of the committee will now be established <e> <s> at the same time it will have a link with ordinary members of the public who will feel that they <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> i remember thinking at committee stage that the amendment of the noble lord lord adrian seemed to have a great deal to be said for it <e> <s> i remember also that the noble earl lord halsbury who has now gone supported it as a way of safeguarding what was going on inside a laboratory and trying to prevent any untoward accident happening through somebody who was ignorant of the procedures going on inside entering it <e> <s> i should have thought this was a very good compromise amendment and that it could have the support of the minister who i hope will look at it favourably <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his answer but does he not agree that the two tragedies highlight the inadequacies of the c unit <e> <s> will he say first whether a date has been set and funds allocated for the replacement unit which he mentioned and secondly whether he agrees that every report on the unit has recommended its closure <e> <s> will he agree to meet a delegation made up of all those involved in the unit to see whether an arrangement can be made to hasten the end of that shameful institution <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord answer the latter part of my supplementary question <e> <s> will he receive a delegation <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say how many of these changes have already been carried out <e> <s> will he also say whether he has considered two improvements suggested by the prison officers association one of them the removal of the whole unit to an interim place in the adapted accommodation in block a <e> <s> can he say too whether resources have been provided to enable prisoners to participate in recreational activities during the interim period before the replacement unit has been built <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my voice in welcoming this unstarred question presented by the noble lord lord allen with great clarity and great feeling and also i believe with great <e>", "<cs> would the noble viscount forward a copy of that letter to me too <e>", "<cs> i should like very briefly to give my support to the amendment for the following reasons <e> <s> i am sure there is general agreement that one of the recurring themes in the debate on this bill has been that we do not really know what exactly will come out of it at the end <e> <s> we do not know how many shops will take advantage of the bill <e> <s> we do not know how many shopworkers will choose to work on sundays <e> <s> we do not know how much disruption it will cause to the communities living around those shops which stay open <e> <s> therefore a great deal of the debate has been hypothetical <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter has made a very good point <e> <s> the point about whether the interval is correct has already been brought up <e> <s> i mentioned one two or three years <e> <s> i do not know what the correct time should be <e> <s> however i agree that one year would not be long enough to see exactly what is happening <e>", "<cs> my lords all speakers in this debate have shown their gratitude to the noble lord lord harris for producing this amendment to the gaming act <e> <s> it has produced an interesting debate as i am sure the minister will agree almost as interesting as the telephone bingo debate last night in which he and i shared <e> <s> there is no doubt that the noble lord lord allen with all his authority and experience as well as the noble and gallant lord lord harding gave their support to the bill <e> <s> although the noble lord lord kilbracken agreed that there was a flaw in the present law he suggested another remedy to it and i shall be interested to hear what the minister has to say to that <e>", "<cs> i should like briefly to support this amendment and to build on what was said by the noble baroness lady seear in respect of the enormous importance to women of finding jobs within the retail industry <e> <s> i remind the minister that at one point he said that shops can only be run on the basis of goodwill between employees and employers <e> <s> those two attitudes contribute much to this amendment being a very good amendment <e>", "<cs> i shall be interested to hear what the minister has to say about this amendment <e> <s> obviously it offers us a new idea and new concept about how this bill is going to affect employees <e> <s> it offers the idea that an opportunity for work sharing can be made available <e> <s> also i think that this amendment corrects the balance a little between the advantages to employers and employees <e> <s> the noble lord the minister has spoken a lot about the problems that previous amendments would put on employers and how it would be impossible to run a business and so on if certain amendments which would advantage the employees were adopted <e> <s> i think this is a very interesting amendment and i look forward to hearing what the minister will have to say about it <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add a word because i had my name down to the earlier amendment as well <e> <s> i wish to thank the minister very much indeed for having accepted the point and for bringing it forward in the form of amendment no <e> <s> in such an excellent way <e> <s> i welcome it and i cannot wait to tell all the old ladies who take their dogs to the park where i take mine who will also be delighted to hear about it <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add a brief word after those whom i call the heavyweights have spoken <e> <s> first i should thank lord glenarthur who has shepherded this bill with so much goodwill tolerance and sense of concern <e> <s> these qualities we now expect from the noble lord and i hope we shall not be disappointed on any other bill <e> <s> we are grateful to him for the way he has put this bill through <e>", "<cs> yes <e> <s> i probably explained myself rather badly but the amendment allows marriage between step-parents and stepchildren only if both parties have attained the age of and if a child-of-the-family relationship has never existed between them <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble lord lord meston not least for his sympathetic approach towards the principle of my amendment towards what i am trying to protect <e> <s> but i agree with the point that he made that there is a conflict between my amendments nos <e> <s> and and i do not think that i made quite clear the redefinition of child of the family as contained in amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> however he accepted the point that i made that i think there is a very great risk of an immature girl of living after all in the same village as could be the case perhaps feeling very inadequate in her ability to decide about her step-father whereas a girl of might be in a better position and might be in a more mature position to be able to do that <e>", "<cs> the reason that my noble friend lord mishcon and i gave notice of our intention to oppose the question whether clause shall stand part of the bill is not out of disagreement over specific objections contained in the clause but because we doubt the validity of making changes in the law in such a piecemeal fashion <e>", "<cs> i should like to take the opportunity of thanking the noble lord lord kilbracken for having written to me and given me a clear explanation of the amendments which he proposed to move <e> <s> i must admit that i have been rather baffled by the descriptions of cheque transactions and so on and i am not sure whether the minister if he did not have the full weight of the civil servants behind him may not also feel rather baffled <e> <s> i should like to thank the noble lord for the very interesting description he has given of the changes that he has tried to make to the bill <e> <s> however as i with my limited experience understand the bill moved by the noble lord lord harris it has the very clear objective of trying to rectify an imperfection in the present act <e> <s> the bill which has been put forward by the noble lord lord harris has received the general agreement of the many people who have worked on it <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i might say a few words in support of this amendment <e> <s> perhaps i could start by saying that i think there is a very great difference in the ways that this whole issue is being argued from these benches and from the benches opposite <e> <s> the difference is that we are always arguing in a wider context <e> <s> many of the arguments that are coming from the benches opposite are in support of the consumer <e> <s> the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter was quite right when he said that it is very nice for a woman shopper to have her husband with her to carry back her shopping <e> <s> we are not arguing about that we are saying that this is the case <e> <s> what we are talking about is the sacrifice that is being made so that the consumer has wider choice <e> <s> that is what we are trying to present in these amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the noble baroness will agree that the security on our streets has very much deteriorated since those days <e>", "<cs> my lords i supported the first version of this amendment when it was brought up at the committee stage <e> <s> i should like to support the new version that is before us now <e> <s> i wish to stress one particular aspect of the amendment its importance <e>", "<cs> my lords the point that i was going to make i am glad to make it following the intervention by the noble lord lord campbell of alloway is that it seems fair that a woman should say let me give it a try <e> <s> if some extraordinary family situation should arise she might then say sadly i shall not be able to go on with my commitment <e> <s> this was a point made very well by the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords i recall the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter putting forward that idea previously <e> <s> we on this side have asked why there should be an increase in the number of women who do not have flexibility <e> <s> we are arguing that a woman needs flexibility in the work area in order to give her best both to her work and to her family responsibilities <e> <s> this is a matter of how you see it <e> <s> i do not see these people as a privileged group <e> <s> i see the proposal as a help to that particular group to perform their responsibilities at home and in the workplace <e> <s> i cannot see anything wrong with that <e> <s> this is an important amendment <e> <s> i know that people have been in two minds about many of our amendments <e> <s> but this is one where the principle is practical and helpful both in respect of the future enactment of different trading hours and to those many women workers who are trying to do their best both at home and in the workplace <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say just one word in support of the intention of this amendment i too am very glad that the right reverend prelate is now satisfied <e> <s> i look forward to hearing what the minister has to say in answer to the very complicated and confusing examples that were given by the right reverend prelate about which he was still not too happy <e> <s> as the noble baroness lady seear has said there are examples before us right now where in-laws do wish on different occasions to get married <e> <s> there is complete proof of this and we only have the very cumbersome system of the personal bill to deal with it at present <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to associate myself with what the noble lord lord harris has said on regret at the untimely death of sir anthony rawlinson <e> <s> i should also like to say what a very great source of personal interest this short bill has been and what a very useful purpose it seems to have served <e> <s> this measure will rectify an anomaly which was pointed out by the royal commission chaired by the noble lord lord rothschild <e> <s> the anomaly has now been put right and i cannot help feeling that it will be very much to the benefit of the parties concerned both those who play in casinos and those who run them <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister not agree in view of the vital importance of maintaining the sympathy and understanding of the people on this island with what is happening in the province that the responsibility of the press and media in the following weeks and months is of very great importance not only to report the tragic and dramatic but also to report the very serious work that is going on among the communities in the vast majority of northern ireland <e> <s> would the minister not agree that every encouragement should be given to the bbc and to our press to do that <e>", "<cs> my lords i have never before this evening enjoyed being the last speaker on the list <e> <s> but on this occasion i have been fortunate enough to hear a highly-informed debate in which all speakers have been in total agreement and have given merely different examples to prove the same point <e> <s> they share great anxiety about the future of some of the voluntary organisations <e>", "<cs> my lords we should like to say how grateful we are for the very clear explanation that we have received from the minister about this order <e> <s> i cannot help feeling that a measure that will help the ilr industry can only be welcomed and that the working group that was set up to identify and discover this can only be very much respected <e> <s> so may i say that a measure which relieves these contractors from a liability to the tune of per cent <e> <s> can only be applauded and we on this side of the house should like to give our support to this order <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say how grateful i am to the noble lord lord meston for bringing forward these amendments which go a long way to satisfying the request that my noble friend lord mishcon and i put forward in committee <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to congratulate the noble lord lord meston on presenting explaining and steering the bill through its different stages <e> <s> i should also like to say how grateful we are on these benches for the concessions which he made to us as regards what we considered to be important basic points of the bill <e> <s> i was glad of the contribution of the noble baroness lady seear in bringing forward amendments permitting the marriages of in-laws in certain circumstances because they surely have been the subject of so many painful lengthy and cumbersome private bills of which we are all aware <e> <s> in my view those amendments are a <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that all speakers and all noble lords present this afternoon are very grateful to the noble viscount for having raised this question and he should be very gratified that no fewer than two noble lords found it impossible not to jump up and make their contribution to his debate <e> <s> it is right that the subject should have been taken very seriously because after all this is an area which affects many peoples lives very closely indeed <e> <s> the length of time that our public houses and other centres remain open affects those who go to them affects those wives who in many cases stay behind and wait for closing time to come and as has been said often today affects those visitors from abroad and our own people on holiday in this country who would like to see a change <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for pointing out that i was using the wrong word <e> <s> it is of course an experience and not an experiment <e> <s> nevertheless i was going to speak more in general terms <e> <s> i believe that the following advantages are absolutely true <e> <s> first the longer drinking hours were welcomed both by the public and by the licensees generally <e> <s> secondly the longer hours were thought to have led to more civilised drinking habits <e> <s> the evidence of changes in behaviour lends support to this view <e> <s> public drunkenness became less commonplace <e> <s> there was a very great improvement in relation to the rates of conviction for drunkenness but as i understood it there were also changed police procedures which could have made some contribution to this <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that i find his answer a great relief <e> <s> nevertheless it seems to conflict with the governors own reported comments that he was totally bemused and distressed at his transfer <e> <s> however in view of the real distress of the national association of probation officers about the problems facing both prison officers and inmates at styal prison can the noble lord say how many incidents have occurred at night since christmas which have resulted in disciplinary action being taken against prisoners <e> <s> will he also say why the prison department sends so many and year-old prisoners to styal and whether they still mix freely with the older women prisoners in that prison <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister also say that there has been a distortion in the reporting of the level of bullying that goes on in styal prison <e> <s> can he say whether there is continued evidence of kangaroo courts held at night when there is a mock trial of other prisoners and punishment meted out <e> <s> will the noble lord also say when he will reply to the letter from the national association of probation officers written to him on th february asking him about all these different points that we have mentioned <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend and other noble lords have said it is certainly not by a long chalk the first time that my noble friend has brought up some aspect of our penal system for debate in your lordships house <e> <s> i know that all of us who are concerned with this particular part of our national life are always grateful to him for his perpetual commitment though i must say by the look of the government back-benches that perhaps he has not hit on a favourite topic so far as they are concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that as chairman of the womens national cancer control campaign i am a little dismayed at his answer in view of the fact that the wnccc has for years carried out successful screening programmes throughout the country but was not invited to give its views when the question was decided as to whether or not screening should take place in the palace of westminster <e> <s> therefore does the noble lord agree that not only would a screening programme within the palace of westminster be useful to the women who work here but it would also be an example and an incentive for other women to present themselves for screening <e> <s> in the light of that and the fact that still women die each year from the only form of cancer that can be cured if detected in time will the noble lords services committee reconsider its decision and engage in consultation with the wnccc on this question <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the fact that the members of the medical advisory committee of the wnccc who are the great experts on the subject were not consulted by the select committee would the noble lord perhaps suggest to the select committee that it consults with wnccc <e> <s> after all they are the experts on the mobile unit screening programme which has a good record <e> <s> they should give their view and it should be considered again <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness mentioned the single payments which were used to cover the cost of materials used by voluntary organisations such as neighbourhood energy action <e> <s> will she confirm that those single payments or a substitute for them will continue <e> <s> otherwise the <e>", "<cs> my lords this must be one of the few bills that is so complex that there are still some new points to be made by the nineteenth twentieth and twenty-first speakers <e> <s> i feel very <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord not agree with my noble friend lord cledwyn that noraid benefits mainly through the ignorance of the american public about what is happening in ireland <e> <s> does he not agree that the british information service and our consulate-generals in america have a great role to play <e> <s> will he give a commitment that any cuts that he may be envisaging will not settle on the british information services in new york <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the house is grateful to the noble lord lord renton for introducing this bill into your lordships house after its successful passage in another place <e> <s> we are all aware of the extreme concern which the noble lord has shown in the past about the need for adequate <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the minister agree that as tourists spend more and more of their time in london stuck in traffic jams on account of the increasing number of coaches they will become less willing to visit here <e> <s> have the government never thought of having a depot in the outskirts of london where these coaches could stop and their passengers then travel to central london by public transport <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister admit that the new rating of a part-time student as of a full-time student means a loss of per cent <e> <s> of the grant allocated to birkbeck college <e> <s> that is the figure that has been given to us <e> <s> will she confirm that that is the anticipated loss <e>", "<cs> my lords the topic that my noble friend lord dean has put before us this afternoon is clearly a vital one <e> <s> that has been proved i think by the speeches that have already been made speeches which have contained statistics and statements which have proved that the governments housing policy is in very serious disarray <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble viscount say whether there is any particular training course for members of the metropolitan police coming from the ethnic minorities <e> <s> will he also say whether he is satisfied with the proportion of recruits coming to the metropolitan police from the ethnic minorities <e>", "<cs> as my name is down against amendment no <e> <s> a perhaps i may support the noble lord lord banks in his amendment and at the same time stress one or two aspects <e> <s> i should like mainly to stress the concern that is felt about the special needs of young people who are leaving care and who are the most likely to have no option but to take on the full responsibility of a home <e> <s> this group of claimants will be penalised on many fronts by this bill by the proposed lower rate of income support which would be rectified if this amendment were passed by the requirement that all claimants pay per cent <e> <s> of their rates water rates and all subsidiary housing costs and by the loss of single payments <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness has indeed put me into a great quandary because although like other noble lords i welcome the very good news she has given about the payment of family credit it still leaves an awful lot of criticisms which i made in my initial speech as to the change in the school meals system <e> <s> her reply removes only one of my criticisms <e> <s> therefore i still feel that with cash payments rather than school meals coming in kind there will be a pressure on the mother even if she does receive the payment <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord donaldson that there will always be those bills which are nagging at her conscience and that money will be available for her to use to get rid of one of those worries <e>", "<cs> there is a link between the two amendments in that the child-minding service is at stake in them both <e> <s> as the noble baroness lady faithfull said the first amendment concerns the child-minder and the second amendment relates to the mother whose child is being minded <e> <s> i am prepared to speak to the two together if that would be helpful <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness lady faithfull and i have done our very best to pass on the worries that have been expressed to us which are that it is widely believed in the voluntary sector we made it quite clear that this may be a misapprehension that the intention to place a ceiling of on the amount of expenses which can be claimed before affecting the benefits of unemployed people doing part-time work will catch into its net unemployed volunteers doing work such as hospital car schemes for which the expenses are often in excess of <e> <s> this has been read into this bill and we are asking the noble baroness when replying to say that they have misinterpreted this bill and that they need have no fear <e> <s> this is as we have understood it <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble baroness has dimmed the fears <e> <s> what does the noble baroness mean when she says genuine expenses <e> <s> all the examples that we gave were of travelling expenses <e> <s> sometimes we were given different examples of how much was charged per mile when cars were being used but i should like to know what the noble baroness meant by genuine expenses <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness has not actually said anything about whether a driver who incurs petrol costs of more than will be reimbursed <e>", "<cs> then in that case i will centainly read carefully what the noble baroness has said <e> <s> if we are not content with it we will bring it back at a later stage <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> when i asked the minister for an explanation i merely meant a justification for the change and it is indeed a change from the present system where a young schoolgirl mother gets maternity benefit in her own right <e> <s> when my noble friend said that the families need this benefit she meant <e>", "<cs> the minister said that no new arguments had been brought forward but she has not answered the arguments on either of the occasions on which they have been put forward <e> <s> there is serious <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that somewhat reassuring reply <e> <s> in view of the basic principle that a prisoner is entitled to the same medical care as anybody else and the concern shown by the association for prison dental surgeons that the budgetary constraints were more widespread can he assure us that in the coming year no arbitrary financial ceilings will be placed on penal establish-ments and that dentists should be guided by the normal consideration of the need of patients <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware of the rather unsatisfactory system that exists that when a remand or convicted prisoner is expected to move to another prison the dentist is not allowed to start the necessary treatment <e> <s> does he agree that it would be better if dentists were permitted to start the treatment and that the dentist in the establishment to which the prisoner was moving was given instructions and details of the treatment already carried out <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for that encouraging answer <e> <s> may i press him a little further on two other aspects of the proposed improvements for the cl unit <e> <s> first can he give us news of any progress on the planning of the replacement unit for c <e> <s> secondly in view of the recent manpower report on holloway when can we expect a response to the recommendations made on the staffing levels of the c unit and on the organisation of the discipline and medical staff necessary to render flexibility between those two groups of staff in the c unit <e>", "<cs> my lords it is crucial that within the c unit two groups of disciplined staff should work well together and at the end of the day it will be for the prison department to make a decision on the recommendations of the manpower report <e> <s> in view of that will the minister give an assurance that he will press for the prison department to come to an early decision as to the level and organisation of staffing in the c unit <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for this clear explanation of this order for which we are most grateful <e> <s> i agree with him that <e> <s> unlike the previous order there is not a very contentious element in it <e> <s> i am grateful to him for giving us the background as to how this matter arose <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support this amendment in spite of what the noble lord lord thorneycroft and the noble baroness lady gardner have said <e> <s> i find it very hard to go against the conviction of all those who are concerned with the well-being of children who are all convinced that child benefit is the most effective way of tackling child poverty while at the same time achieving a degree of equity between the living standards of those with and without children <e> <s> there can be no doubt that this is the view in other european countries <e> <s> indeed child benefit in france and in several other of our neighbouring european countries is at a very much higher level <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may also assist with the point that my noble friend lord ennals made <e> <s> i should like to ask the minister to explain the inconsistency of a government who see fit to exempt certain groups of young people from the board and lodging regulations thereby accepting that there are certain groups that have special needs and who are vulnerable but who do not see fit to make certain exemptions in this case <e> <s> that is difficult to understand and i hope that the noble baroness will have an answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i support my noble friend and the noble baroness lady faithfull <e> <s> it seems that what is requested by the amendment is most extraordinarily reasonable and moderate <e> <s> after all every family has its crises and those crises because of their very nature always need an immediate response <e> <s> the amendment seems to deal with the situation and obviously would only focus on particular cases which need immediate help <e> <s> therefore as my noble friend lord ennals has said the amendment seems to be a proposal that may melt what up to this moment has been the rather frigid heart of the noble baroness opposite <e>", "<cs> my lords as i had my name down to the amendment when it was mooted at committee stage and as it now appears in a different form perhaps i can say a few words <e> <s> as many of us know from our postbags a great deal of concern has been expressed about the effect of the proposal in the bill <e> <s> the majority of people involved were unemployed and doing voluntary work as the noble baroness lady faithfull said for which they were paid only expenses <e> <s> at committee stage the minister was very sympathetic and said <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that the explanation of the noble baroness was related to my amendment but i cannot say that i am very happy about it <e> <s> the noble baroness said yet again that she felt that child minding expenses were relatively low but i thought that i had made a very definite point to show that some parents who do not have relatives to look after their children when they are working have to pay a high price <e> <s> as my noble friend said what we worry about is that these lone parents will either retire from work or put their children into the hands of carers who cost very much less <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank those noble lords who have contributed to the debate <e> <s> i am most grateful for the support that i have received from noble lords in all parts of the house <e> <s> only two have spoken against the proposal the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter and i am sorry to say the noble baroness lady carnegy <e> <s> i can perhaps say one thing to the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> i was grateful to the noble lord for his suggested changes to the amendment <e> <s> it has already been said that if there is need for further change we would be delighted to do that on third reading <e> <s> the noble lord may have an awful lot of experience but he has not had the experience of being a mother <e> <s> i do not believe that he can possibly know amid all the preoccupations that mothers have at tough times in their lives how the removal of one preoccupation namely the knowledge that their children are being properly fed at lunch time without the worry of finding the money saving it or losing it or stopping the husband taking it to the pub represents a most important factor <e> <s> i should have thought this was borne out by the fact that per cent <e> <s> of mothers far from feeling that it was patronising or that their dignity was at risk said that they should like to go on with the school meal and not have the cash benefit even if it was higher <e> <s> that is surely incontestable <e>", "<cs> so my lords i should now like to test the opinion of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble viscount very much for explaining this order in such a clear way <e> <s> it certainly helped me to see what is its objective <e> <s> we very much welcome the measures that have been taken to protect children in every conceivable way <e> <s> as the noble viscount said the right balance seems to have been achieved by the new proposals in this order <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that there is one thing on which the minister and i would agree that is that this is a most complicated case and it is a bill of enormous complexity <e> <s> however unfortunately the interpretations seem not to be in agreement at all as to how the very poorest families who are on family credit while at the same time claiming housing benefit will be affected <e> <s> i have listened to the ministers answer and i understand it but it does not fit with other interpretations of how a certain number of families will be affected <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for that answer <e> <s> would he not agree however that a serious number of organisations have ceased to give their services to the most vulnerable sections of the community in london <e> <s> is he aware that an even greater number of voluntary organisations are struggling to exist and are doubtful about their future funding <e> <s> in view of the fact that the minister stated in this house in may that a trust would be set up endowed with the proceeds of the sale of glc assets will the noble lord say how much has been collected from the sale of those assets how much will be put into the trust and when the voluntary organisations will be able to claim grants from that trust <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord not able to tell the house what funds have accrued from the sale of glc assets <e>", "<cs> my lords may i press the minister once more and ask this question <e> <s> will he not accept that voluntary organisations have to have some idea about their future planning <e> <s> although it takes a little time to get this organised more and more of them will have to close their doors unless something is known of the future <e> <s> will the noble lord give an assurance that he will do his best to ensure that the money which should revert to the london boroughs following the law lords ruling in april on the forward funding is returned to them by the london residuary body as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords coming after so many very expert and highly-informed speakers my own short contribution will seem rather low key <e> <s> however i should like to say how very grateful i am to my noble friend lady llewelyn-davies for outlining the house of lords select committees report which did so much to clarify the consequences of the bill before us <e> <s> i am equally grateful to the noble and learned lord lord templeman for also bringing out further points to help us understand the consequences of this bill <e> <s> i very much look forward to hearing the ministers reply to my noble friend lord bruce who quite rightly brought out the all-important concerns of british sovereignty and how the safeguards would be written in <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has just said that she is determined to improve screening facilities for all women <e> <s> can she say whether a decision has been made following the suggestion earlier this year by the tgwu and apex that women of the palace of westminster should have a screening service provided by the womens national cancer control campaign <e> <s> does she recollect that the house of commons services committee rejected this but that the house of lords administration committee is considering it <e> <s> does she not agree that this would not only benefit the women working in the palace of westminster but would also provide a lead for women all over the country to present themselves for screening <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for answering my question though the answer is not a very satisfactory one <e> <s> does not the minister agree that many prisoners on discharge cannot get their social security payment from the dhss office nor can they get their giro cheque cashed if they are homeless and have no form of identification <e> <s> is he further aware that new bridge of which i am chairman out of its slender resources often has to give to a discharged offender so that he can get a copy of his birth certificate <e>", "<cs> my lords but does not the minister agree that an ex-offender does not have a driving licence or those other forms of identification that others of us may have and therefore he has no way of proving his identity at the post office or the dhss office <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that answer as far as it goes <e> <s> however does not the noble lord agree that growing concern from different quarters about the miscarriage of justice warrants a greater urgency <e> <s> therefore in the light of the irrefutable presentation of evidence and facts by robert kee and in order to remove something which has nagged at and will continue to nag at the conscience of british justice will the noble lord urge his right honourable friend to set up an independent review which will investigate and report on the inter-relationship between the two cases rather than look at the two cases separately <e> <s> i am sure the noble lord will agree that admitting an error would not weaken british justice but in this instance enormously strengthen it <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the fact that the ira gang which was arrested in the balcombe street siege claimed sole responsibility for the guildford bombings can the noble lord say why the criminals who confessed to the crime at guildford were not charged with it <e>", "<cs> my lords i too followed the clear presentation by the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor with great gratitude <e> <s> not only did he help me to understand the bill but i must say made me feel that it is quite extraordinary that for so long so many children were discriminated against because of their parentage <e> <s> however as the noble and learned lord said once the law commission made up its mind the decision was taken very quickly <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord for his answer <e> <s> however is he aware that the problem of women who are sentenced for drug-related crimes is escalating <e> <s> it is estimated that in there were about and the figure rose to in <e> <s> in view of that and the fact that the advisory council on the misuse of drugs commended and applauded holloway for setting up an in-house therapeutic unit within the prison does he not think it was a great mistake to close down the therapeutic group in the a wing at holloway without any notice when in fact it was responding to the needs of the women who were trying to kick the habit while they were in prison <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord say that the time factor then is not of such importance <e> <s> also would he perhaps comment on the recommendation of the advisory council that further therapeutic units for dependency on the lines of those at holloway should be established <e> <s> would he also briefly comment on what was said by the social services committee of the house of commons which published in its report a note about its deep concern at the time so many addicts spend in custody which represents a wasted opportunity for tackling the problem of their addiction <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the british society for nutritional medicine plans to continue research started in the united states concerning the effects of nutrition on children <e> <s> will the government consider supporting that work <e>", "<cs> i too should like to support what my noble and learned friend lord silkin has said and to reiterate that all of us who have put our names to this amendment see it as a probing amendment <e> <s> but we are quite sure that the intention of the amendment is right <e> <s> we have no doubt about that <e> <s> i should not like to go through the whole explanation again but i should merely like to stress the great concern of those organisations representing the rights of children <e> <s> they are delighted by this bill <e> <s> they are organisations that have not always been highly supportive of all government legislation <e> <s> they are extremely supportive of this bill except for this one area <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble viscount must be very grateful that his bill has aroused so much interest and support <e> <s> he must also be very pleased that so many noble lords have spoken even at this late hour and at close proximity to christmas shopping <e> <s> as the noble viscount said this is not the first time he has brought the subject of our licensing laws to our attention <e> <s> in april of this year he asked the government to consider introducing flexible hours in public houses following the reform in scotland <e> <s> i remember that the minister was not persuaded that this was the right course to take though in his speech he allowed a glimmer of hope to emerge <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say what kind of training in physical protection is undertaken by female members of the nhs <e> <s> do they have some training in judo for instance <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness not agree that one of the best ways to help old people with their fuel bills in cold spells is to ensure that their homes are well insulated <e> <s> is she aware that some important home insulation work by the neighbourhood energy action group has been jeopardised by the intended withdrawal of single payments <e> <s> can the minister say whether the government have decided on a replacement for this very important benefit as far as home insulation goes <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble viscount for putting forward these amendments to his original bill <e> <s> he put them forward partly i think through the suggestion i made and indeed the minister made at second reading <e> <s> therefore he no longer proposes that licensed premises should be allowed to be open for hours a day which was his original intention <e> <s> this makes a very great difference to the first proposal and goes a long way towards quietening the anxieties i expressed at second reading which had been passed on to me by certain organisations concerned with our licensing laws <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord lord harris for having presented his amendment to the gaming bill with enormous brevity and also with very great clarity <e> <s> i was also happy to listen to the noble and gallant lord lord harding adding his own approval to this intended reform with all the experience and knowledge of the industry that he commands <e> <s> i was most grateful to hear him say that this had been thouroughly discussed and thought out by the industry and his association <e>", "<cs> my lords i think all of us who have been involved with the passage of this bill will be very grateful to the noble viscount for in the first place bringing the subject forward yet again this time in a slightly different guise <e> <s> also we are very grateful to him for his willingness to make some fundamental changes in his bill at committee stage as a result of certain suggestions coming from speakers in the debate <e> <s> there is little doubt that his bill is now a better bill and that the proposals it contains really will give restaurant owners the benefit they want and will also give the users of restaurants and tourists a very much more peaceful way of having their meals <e> <s> so there is a great deal to be said for the noble viscounts initiative in the first place and also for his flexibility in making the changes that were necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords i too was grateful for the painstaking presentation of the minister in explaining the bill though having heard previous speakers i feel that the contents of the bill may have been rather less acceptable than the presentation that the noble baroness made <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble baroness is very knowledgeable <e> <s> she is probably a governor of several schools of the inner london education authority and perhaps they are not as well run as the two of which i am a governor <e> <s> i speak having some knowledge of how those schools are run and the standard is very high <e>", "<cs> my lords i was very pleased to listen to my noble friend lord stallard making such a comprehensive introduction to his debate which concerns an all-important subject <e> <s> i was also extremely interested to hear the noble lord lord ezra covering so many points first the new building regulations which seem of absolutely fundamental importance secondly the heating deficiencies of our existing housing stock and thirdly the importance of the work being done by the voluntary organisations working in the field of home insulation <e> <s> i very much hope that the minister will respond to some of the points which he made at the end of his speech <e>", "<cs> my lords to return once more to the replacement of single payments for draughtproofing is the noble lord aware that on several occasions his right honourable friend in another place also accepted the principle that it should be replaced and said that an answer would come in due course or shortly <e> <s> will the minister say first when this equivocal period of time will finally come to an end and secondly whether the obstacle to coming to a decision is perhaps that the departments involved cannot agree who will bear the cost of replacement of the single payment <e>", "<cs> i should like to add a few words to what has already been said by the noble lord lord kilmarnock and i should like to speak specifically to amendment no <e> <s> i shall speak from my base as a governor of ilea and i shall deal with one or two matters which the noble lord has not mentioned <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to avail myself of the opportunity which the noble lord lord donaldson has given us by this debate to raise again the theme of a debate which i introduced here last year about the problems of women in prison and the conditions that they suffer <e> <s> but this time i do so with the support of a report which the tuc produced earlier this month and which concentrates on different ways by which conditions for women and their whole position within the penal system could be improved <e> <s> there is little doubt that much of the anxiety and many of the recommendations which are put forward in this report and in this debate echo my debate in so i hope very much that this time the minister will look carefully at what the tuc has said in its discussion paper and take heed of some of the recommendations it has made <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i shall be able to measure up to the specialised knowledge of the noble lord lord kilbracken concerning the particular games that we are discussing this evening <e> <s> however i was content with the great clarity with which the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale presented his bill <e> <s> as he introduced it i understood exactly what it was intended to do <e> <s> the noble lord made it abundantly clear that the changes proposed in his bill are necessary even if they do not affect very many groups <e> <s> like so many other betting and gaming bills which have been introduced by private members there does not seem to be anything in the least controversial about this <e> <s> it will be welcomed by those who run the public halls where the games are played <e>", "<cs> i rise to support this amendment <e> <s> i have put my name to this amendment because i moved a similar amendment at committee <e>", "<cs> i see exactly what the noble baroness means but i should like to point out that as i understand it the maternity payment is specifically intended to meet the needs of the baby and should therefore not be viewed as a payment which is given because of the independence of the mother <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend said it is getting rather late and so i intend to make only a short intervention in this debate <e> <s> i wanted to take the opportunity given to us by my noble friend to make a small contribution to an extremely important subject <e> <s> it is a great pity that due to the length of the preceding debate not more members of your lordships house have presented themselves to speak this evening <e> <s> my noble friend made the overriding point that it is a cruel irony that the very people who in the course of their work are carrying out a service to others should suffer from the risk of violence and brutality <e> <s> this can only be a major source of concern and anxiety to us all <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that this report like the black report in stresses the importance of what children eat and how this influences their future health <e> <s> will she agree therefore that the removal of nutritional standards previously enforced with regard to school meals the fact that many children are no longer eligible for free school meals and the fact that the free school meals service is disintegrating might have a very great effect on the health of future generations <e>", "<cs> my lords i find myself very much in agreement with my noble friend lady phillips when she said that those of us who have the temerity to speak in this debate and who are not part of that magic circle made up of eminent judges lawyers and recorders feel very much like intruders <e> <s> however i shall be making only a brief intervention in language which i know the minister at least will understand because he and i are agreed that we are the only ordinary mortals taking part in this debate this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i should like to congratulate and thank the noble lord lord brougham and vaux for presenting the bill in such a clear and lucid way and also for giving us a fascinating historical background <e> <s> in the other place the debate was exceptionally thorough <e> <s> having read the debate in <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord tordoff has given us a very full and clear explanation of what the bill is all about <e> <s> he leaves me just to make a few comments about it <e> <s> i welcome this bill as a small but very worthwhile step towards giving people the right to know what information is held about them by public authorities <e> <s> what gives me a personal attachment to it is that i introduced a debate on this subject on th november last year <e> <s> i was therefore very gratified when the access to personal files bill was introduced as a private members bill in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the clear presentation that the noble viscount has made in moving this short but very important bill <e> <s> i also very much enjoyed the highly informed details which he gave concerning the historical background of the question of animal baiting and dog fighting <e>", "<cs> my lords rather unexpectedly it has fallen to me to respond to the noble lord <e> <s> i fear that i do not consider myself to be a great expert on this subject <e> <s> however i have listened most carefully to what the noble lord has said and everything he has said seems entirely logical and acceptable <e> <s> therefore on behalf of my noble friend lord carmichael of kelvingrove i should like to support the noble lord in his bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend <e> <s> i welcome the statement and the news that there is to be an inquiry <e> <s> i should like to put one specific question and one general question <e> <s> i do not understand from my reading of the newspapers why the parents of the children concerned in the cleveland case were never allowed to put their case before losing their children <e> <s> my second and more general question is to ask whether the minister agrees as unhappily more and more cases of child abuse come to light that the whole procedure following discovery of such cases must be reassessed <e> <s> otherwise there is a real danger that a child will be doubly abused <e> <s> a child will be abused mentally under the very cruel procedure whereby a child is examined and cross-examined on various occasions before the court procedure takes place <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for the extra information he has given us <e> <s> nevertheless <e> <s> in view of growing evidence of the increased number of child abuse cases nationally does the minister not agree that there should be thinking additional to the inquiry as to how much the legislature should interfere in the life of the family and also to what extent we should change our present procedure <e> <s> does he not agree that we should look at what happens in scotland which has a more informal base for dealing with childrens problems and perhaps set up an extension of childrens panels whereby the whole family unit and social workers would be assisted <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say whether the new hospital building will include sufficient maternity wards <e> <s> is the minister aware that press reports are saying that women already in labour are waiting in passages because there are no beds available for them <e> <s> that must be a very unsatisfactory situation for them <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support what was said by my noble friend lady jeger and the noble lord lord banks in relation to the freezing of child benefit <e> <s> the minister must be aware that all those interested and involved in child poverty agree that universally child benefit helps poor families the most <e> <s> surely the minister will agree that poor families with children have fallen behind in the poverty stakes <e> <s> compared with our european partners we have lagged behind in family support and particularly as compared with the french who are more generous with their universal benefits for children <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say a few words in support of this amendment as i have my name down to it <e> <s> i think that it is not the objective of the noble lord lord henderson or myself to press for the wording of this amendment but it is a fact that over a very long period of time there has been a lot of support from many different and varied quarters for this minimum standard to be laid down <e>", "<cs> my lords i should also like to thank my noble friend for introducing this debate the more so because i do not think that childrens issues are debated often enough in the house <e> <s> for that reason we are doubly grateful to him <e>", "<cs> my lords on the assumption that a new date will be found for the meeting will the minister say what consultations have taken place with the national consumer council and the consumers association in preparation for the meeting <e>", "<cs> i support this amendment as moved by my noble friend <e> <s> it seems to produce a compromise which as he explained would allow for racing on sunday at the same time as providing a safeguard for local communities <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may just say a few words <e> <s> i speak personally and not on behalf of my noble friends as i have been asked to make clear <e> <s> the noble lord lord wyatt has not proved to me that it is necessary to bring in this very controversial clause <e> <s> i should have thought that a limitation to on-course betting would be sufficient for most racegoers and the foundation for sunday racing <e> <s> he has put to one side the example of ireland in a way which does not persuade me at all <e> <s> i believe it is fairer to say that the irish have racing on a sunday because they are true believers and lovers of the sport and therefore they have not thought it necessary to have off-course betting <e>", "<cs> this amendment was chosen because the noble lord lord glenarthur moved a similar amendment during the passage of the shops bill to protect the workers who were already employed before the law was changed <e> <s> my noble friend chose this amendment because it had been moved by the government during the passage of the previous bill <e> <s> if the noble lord lord wyatt does not like the amendments wording he can amend it on report <e> <s> everything he has just said points to the fact that he himself would very much like to see the workforce right behind the reform which he is bringing about <e> <s> successful sport on sunday would need the support and the backing of the workforce <e> <s> therefore so far as i can see the noble lord lord wyatt agrees with the principle of the amendment <e> <s> perhaps he would like to re-word it for report <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support what noble lords have said in expressing my condolences to the families of the victims of the atrocity and to wish them courage in the time ahead <e> <s> in support of what the noble lord lord harris has said the best way to commemorate the dead is to examine clearly and closely our own actions in the wake of these disasters <e> <s> i should like to ask the minister three questions <e> <s> first arc we quite sure that <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that there are occasions when wives on supplementary benefit miss out on that one visit to their husbands <e> <s> their travel warrant is made out for a specific date but it arrives by second class mail from the dhss office too late for the day that they have to go <e> <s> therefore does he agree that it would be better if these warrants were made out for an unspecified date <e> <s> the wives could then visit on any day during the -day period for which the warrant was valid <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord houghton of sowerby has made it abundantly clear in his excellent introduction that the subject of his unstarred question is of very great importance and urgency <e> <s> he has made it clear that the replacement of animals in medical and scientific research is an issue which people in this country regard as important <e> <s> those of us in the house are very grateful to my noble friend for having brought this matter up as also are many people outside the house who will be pleased to see the point being discussed this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of what my noble friend said can the minister say whether he is aware of the instructions that ici gives to its small users <e> <s> does he know whether other producers of chemicals such as du pont issue the same very unsatisfactory instructions <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not see the logic of the noble earls argument <e> <s> the purpose of my amendment is to ensure more non-custodial measures for offenders between the ages of and <e> <s> i pointed out that one-quarter of all people in prison for fine default are between the ages of and which is the age group that we are trying to keep out of prison <e> <s> while i am grateful to the minister i do not feel that what he has put forward is any comfort to those of us proposing the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the minister for having made it quite clear that this apparent inconsistency is being given a great deal of attention and that there is genuine concern that young people who are locked up in secure accommodation or in prison establishments under the unruly certificates should not be kept there longer than necessary <e> <s> i am grateful to him for having explained it so carefully <e> <s> i look forward to reading what he said and consulting with those who advise <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like strongly to support the noble lord lord hunt <e> <s> i agree with him that it is most unfortunate that this extremely important amendment has come up so late this evening and that there are not very many noble lords here to listen to the arguments <e> <s> it represents a valid non-custodial measure for dealing with offenders in a certain category <e> <s> as the noble lord made clear a similar system has been tried out successfully in new zealand and therefore we have an example to go by <e> <s> it also has the virtue of having had the support of the all party penal affairs group <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the fact that so many people wished to speak in this debate and also that nobody withdrew shows how very much appreciated it is by the house <e> <s> as many noble lords have said the intention of the report of the overseas students trust is to bring more coherence to britains policy on overseas students and i think the report has been praised by all those who have spoken so far <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister recollect that when mothers were asked whether they would prefer free school meals and milk or a cash replacement eight out of said that they would prefer free school meals and milk <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree in view of the wide-ranging experience of the united kingdom in the field of distance learning that the pneu the external services of the bbc and many other institutions have made valuable contributions <e> <s> does she agree that we are in a better position than canada and india who have supported the new venture most generously and that we should do a little more than the measure which the minister has put forward today <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say whether the government will agree to the toy safety directive at the meeting on th december <e> <s> can he also say what steps the government are taking to ensure that the british consumers views of the ec proposals on the harmonisation of vat tariffs are adequately expressed at community level <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for his reply <e> <s> in the light of it what does he suggest should be done about the situation set out in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall say only a few words because in this company i may not be considered qualified to speak as i am a non-betting and non-racing person and not even a very rabid sabbatarian in the strict sense of the word <e> <s> i believe in having occupations on sunday <e> <s> i believe in racing on sunday <e> <s> for lonely and depressed people sundays can be the saddest of days <e> <s> i therefore have nothing against sunday racing <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the news the minister has given about the setting up of the cancer screening programme <e> <s> will he say whether guidelines were set down to help local health authorities to carry out the programme and to carry out quality control <e> <s> will he also say whether he feels that there are sufficient back-up services to sort out the abnormalities and bring women back on a recall system in this large and ambitious programme <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the minister for his very clear explanation of this order <e> <s> i should like to say from this side of the house that we accept that the intention of the order seems a very reasonable and practical one <e> <s> i note that the minister has said that he may come back to the house with primary legislation a little later so if there are to be any discussions or debates perhaps we can reserve them for that time <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord the chairman of committees for that answer and also for all that he did in making the screening programme possible <e> <s> will the noble lord agree that the response speaks for itself and that it is proof that on-site screenings are a good way of protecting working women from developing cancer of the cervix <e> <s> will the noble lord provide two statistics if he has them available <e> <s> first for how many of those women was it the first screening that they had attended <e> <s> secondly how many of the women were asked to return for further testing as a result of abnormalities found in the screening <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not agree that the reason why so many women ignored the deadline for compensation claims resulting from the use of this particular shield may have been a lack of communication between the dhss and the american company in question and also a failure to mount a sufficient publicity campaign <e> <s> can the minister say when the government first knew that the dalkon shield was a defective product <e> <s> secondly why was it only recalled in one year after it was withdrawn in the united states <e> <s> thirdly why were the women who had been fitted with this device not themselves recalled by their family planning associations and informed of what had happened <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that this matter was brought to the attention of the foreign office as much as two months ago by my right honourable friend the shadow home secretary from whose constituency the two girls come <e> <s> can the minister assure the house that there will be no lengthy impediment as regards their return home which is clearly what the two young women wish <e>", "<cs> my lords in february i instigated a debate in the house calling attention to the steady increase in the number of homeless people in this country <e> <s> i have read the debate again and being the nineteenth person to speak this evening i have been able to compare what was said then nearly four years ago with what has been said this evening <e> <s> there is a tragic similarity in all the concern expressed then and now indeed one finds complete agreement between all the speakers in that debate and those who have spoken today <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord lord newall for giving such a clear presentation of his bill <e> <s> i am the more grateful because i personally feel rather inadequate when confronted with these serious matters in this sport <e> <s> the noble lord has made very clear what the problems for the sport are and that there is a need for <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of all the measures that the minister has listed to take care of child abuse does he think that eventually it may become necessary to find parliamentary time for the passage of a child care bill <e>", "<cs> my lords the house always expresses its gratitude to noble lords who have tabled motions for debate which are of great public concern <e> <s> with this motion we have more reason than usual to be grateful to the mover <e> <s> the noble lord lord rodney has raised a topic which has created much anxiety and to which at the same time there is clearly no simple solution or antidote <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for his clear presentation and also for giving the reasons behind this bill to extend our licensing laws <e> <s> he made clear the changes in our way of life that he felt necessitated the changes now proposed <e> <s> before i say anything more let me say that the views i shall be putting forward in this debate are my own <e> <s> i do not speak on behalf of my noble friends who will no doubt be presenting different arguments of their own <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his answer but does he not accept that the recent deterioration in relations between the two countries is a bitter blow to those many people who have for many years been trying to build up understanding and trust between dublin and london <e> <s> will he say first whether the anglo-irish agreement is being used as a framework for communicating important announcements between the two countries <e> <s> secondly will he say whether dublin was informed of the result of the stalker review prior to the announcement in the house of commons <e> <s> thirdly will the minister say whether the government will try to meet the minimum requirements needed under irish law to enable extradition to continue between the two countries as agreed and wished for by the two countries <e> <s> finally without any disrespect to the noble lord will he say why he has answered my question which is about relations between the two sovereign countries of ireland and britain <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for her very good and clear presentation of what is obviously not a controversial bill <e> <s> i give it the support of this side of the house <e> <s> as the noble baroness said it is a bill which will give ratification to the convention establishing the multilateral investment guarantee agency and we wish it a safe and speedy passage on to the statute book <e> <s> we also congratulate the government on being a founder member of the convention <e>", "<cs> rose to ask her majestys government whether they are satisfied with the effectiveness of the arrangements for representing the consumer interest in the telecommunication and gas industries since privatisation <e>", "<cs> my lords that was not my statement <e> <s> it was the gas consumers council which said that unemployment might have been one of the reasons for the disconnections <e> <s> that appeared in its statement yesterday <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord newall has put forward a good case for the amendment and after having thought about it i give it my support <e> <s> on second reading the noble lord made the case that the sport needed extra funding <e> <s> he has now reassessed that need even more by quoting how many racetracks have had to close on account of the shortage of such funding <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say a very brief word on this matter <e> <s> i agree with the logic of what has been said in support of extending licensing hours on a sunday <e> <s> the logic is that there will be more people who will benefit from it <e> <s> they will not be only tourists young people or the unemployed because they are the people who will most benefit during the week <e> <s> there will be families and those who got up rather later and wish to have a later lunch <e>", "<cs> i am strangely happier about supporting this amendment than i was about the previous one <e> <s> i feel that a different public is being served at an airport <e> <s> my reservation about the other amendment that there would be more drivers going to public houses on a sunday does not apply to this one <e> <s> sundays are like any other day at an airport except that possibly there are more people there <e> <s> therefore i should have thought that the situation in an airport presented a special case <e> <s> i shall be very interested to see how the minister feels about this because i think that the logic which led me to support the earlier amendment means that i must support this one even more strongly <e>", "<cs> i was very interested by the presentation of the noble lord lord morris <e> <s> his proposal seems a very sensible idea <e> <s> i wonder whether he can give the committee an example of how it would be beneficial to the neighbourhood if licensing justices were given such power <e>", "<cs> the safeguards incorporated in these amendments were introduced by my honourable friend mrs taylor in another place <e> <s> i am therefore very happy that the government have accepted them and have seen fit to bring them forward in the bill on this occasion <e>", "<cs> i have my name to the amendment which has come in for a great welter of opposition so perhaps i could make a couple of brief points <e> <s> all members of the committee who have spoken have an interest in the sale of alcohol <e> <s> i do not say that they do not have an interest in safeguarding young people and so on but their primary interest is in the sale of alcohol <e> <s> the only speakers who do not have that interest are the noble viscount lord falkland and myself <e>", "<cs> i add my support to this amendment <e> <s> i stress that it seems to be the most paradoxical situation that with one hand and with a great deal of expense we try to suppress drink-driving and on the other we allow the garage the home of the car to sell drink <e> <s> the licensing of garages undermines the message if you drink you do not drive and if you drive you do not drink <e> <s> surely this is the message that we want to get out in every possible way <e>", "<cs> we are in total agreement with the first part of the clause but are worried that it is negated by the second part which says that the licensee had no reason to suspect that the person was under <e> <s> therefore the licensee could always protect himself with that defence <e> <s> the young person should perhaps be questioned <e> <s> i see no reason why not <e> <s> in america i have seen young people go into a pub and automatically produce some kind of identification which gives their age <e> <s> if we are worried about underage drinking and wish to stop it we may have to inconvenience young people a little because it will prove an even greater inconvenience to them if they go along the road of heavy drinking <e>", "<cs> i am not one bit convinced by what the noble earl has said <e> <s> we are merely trying to strengthen the position in regard to the young person being refused a drink <e> <s> we are strengthening the possibility that he will be turned away because he is under age <e>", "<cs> i am quite sure the minister agrees that it is highly incongruous that people under are allowed to sell a product which it is illegal for them to buy <e> <s> i believe that no one can dispute this fact <e> <s> we are worried that it seems very unlikely that someone under would prevent the sale of alcohol to another minor <e> <s> it seems likely that he or she would cast a blind eye at it and there would be the danger of an illegal sale <e> <s> i believe that the arguments for our amendment are stronger than for having the bill as the government have written it <e> <s> however again it is rather late and i do not seem to have had any spoken support <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> although my noble friends argument was logical and his explanation makes sense the amendment means one more liberalisation of the sale of alcohol <e> <s> the only changes that have been made to the bill which in itself is a liberalisation of alcohol have been to extend the availability a little more <e> <s> this is yet another extension of that availability and it is on that basis that i cannot support it rather than on the logical arguments which he presented <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the minister agree that great britain is seriously jeopardising its international reputation on human rights through not ratifying this convention <e> <s> can the minister say why it is not possible to include provisions covering torture within the criminal justice bill which is at present going through the other place <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the minister agree that the work of the fao in the promotion of agriculture in the developing countries and in the fight against famine is vitally important <e> <s> therefore can the minister say whether he has some criticism of the structure of the fao and that that is the reason the government are getting behind with their payment <e> <s> if so will the government try to put this right within the structure of the fao rather than withholding vital payments <e>", "<cs> my lords did the minister imply that he was going to channel funds through bilateral assistance rather than through the fao <e>", "<cs> my lords i see that this amendment has very strong support from the three previous speakers but i still wonder about the logic which is that in supermarkets which open at am the time of the sale of alcohol should coincide <e> <s> the noble lord lord montgomery just said that it seemed quite right that all products sold in a shop should be available while it is open <e> <s> how would he feel about those shops which open before oclock <e> <s> would he say that the sale of alcohol should be permissible from oclock in the morning and so on <e> <s> indeed the noble earl lord arran at committee stage said that perhaps shops would like to be able to sell alcohol from am <e> <s> i shall be interested to hear what the minister says in response to that <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be interested to hear the ministers response to this amendment <e> <s> i think that the parity with licensed premises as described by the noble lord is very important <e> <s> he pointed out the growing tendency to eat out at lunchtime when people like to use their clubs <e> <s> there is a more controlled environment within a club <e> <s> clubs are more used by local people who do not go there in a car and therefore the danger of increasing drinking and driving does not exist <e> <s> it would be a pity if club members went to their club only to find it closed and were then compelled to move on to a public house with expanded opening hours <e> <s> i should like to support the noble lords amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i have put my name to this amendment as i did to the similar amendment that we moved in committee <e> <s> i cannot add very much to what the noble viscount has already said except to stress again that the previous amendment had powerful support from all sides of the house <e> <s> the major argument put forward by the minister was that there were few such premises <e> <s> he said that the total in was only <e> <s> from my personal knowledge i know that two or three have come into being since <e> <s> if i have such knowledge i cannot help feeling that the number may well have increased in the past two years more than one would have thought <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot claim to have followed the technical presentation of the noble lord lord lucas but i very much enjoyed his explanation <e> <s> i understand that the confusion arises from the modern process of producing non- or very low-alcohol beer from which the alcohol content has been extracted <e> <s> as my noble friend lord graham said i understand the purpose is to remove the confusion and restrictions concerning the availability of low-alcohol or non-alcoholic beer to the public <e> <s> surely that must be beneficial <e> <s> moreover perhaps i may mention that the government gave a very strong indication that they supported that objective when in the budget they lowered the taxation on low-alcohol drinks <e> <s> i think that should be borne in mind in considering the amendment of the noble lord lord lucas <e>", "<cs> my lords during the passage of this bill i have on some occasions argued against making further outlets for alcohol and i have been concerned at some points that the greater accessibility was perhaps going too far <e> <s> however in this case i feel that the logic of having the same hours for pubs and clubs seems to be absolutely irrefutable <e>", "<cs> my lords i again support the noble lord and his amendment <e> <s> i agree with him that the ministers reply on report was baffling and difficult to understand <e> <s> if he is going to refuse to accept the amendment moved by the noble lord i <e>", "<cs> my lords i would certainly not wish to prolong the debate especially after the very kind invitation just made by the noble earl but perhaps i may say that this is an important bill and i think its provisions were needed and will make a great deal of difference over coming into line with the habits conventions and customs of society which is one of the objectives mentioned by the noble earl at the beginning <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for having explained exactly what the commons amendment to the lords amendment is <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down perhaps he can clarify one point <e> <s> the noble viscount was implying that when the premises were sold they would be of greater value because they carried with them a licence <e> <s> however i understood that the new owner would not have the licence <e> <s> the owner of the premises licensed would continue to have the licence while he remained in those premises but when he moved he would lose it as would a new owner of the premises <e> <s> perhaps the minister can clarify that <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give us an idea of how many members of staff of the refreshment department and how many peers have been afflicted by this illness <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may also thank the noble lord lord lucas for his clear presentation of the bill and say that i in common with previous speakers believe that it is a useful and helpful piece of legislation <e> <s> we on these benches may be even more pleased to welcome it than anyone else <e> <s> the only slightly sour note that i might adopt would be to point out that the measure was due to come before the house years ago <e> <s> as the noble lord lord lucas implied the provisions of the bill fill the gap which was left when the unfair contract terms act was introduced by a labour government in <e> <s> that act in large measure safeguarded consumers from the mischief of small print and the result has been that for the past years consumers cannot be unfairly deprived of the basic legal rights which parliament intended them to have <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for explaining this important development about knitting yarns <e> <s> i should like to support the measure from this side of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the volume of letter traffic carried by the post office has increased by per cent <e> <s> over the past five years <e> <s> in the light of that does he agree with the statement made by the chairman of the post office users national council that the substantial increase in mail volumes means that substantial investment in infrastructure and network will be needed in future years <e> <s> will the minister say whether the post office tariffs have increased in relation to the retail prices index and if so by how much <e>", "<cs> i should like to add a word of support for the amendment of the noble baroness <e> <s> i am disappointed that the noble baroness lady <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord houghton has presented and explained this bill very well and very clearly <e> <s> i do not think that there is <e>", "<cs> i am a little confused because the minister opened his remarks with all the same arguments that we have heard until now against the exemptions <e> <s> he did not answer the point that was made by the right reverend prelate and myself that volunteers were making a contribution to local services even though it may not be in monetary terms <e> <s> he did not answer the points that we made but at the end just when we had all given up hope the minister changed his tune altogether and said that he would look at it <e> <s> i should be grateful if he would clarify this because it puts me in rather a difficult position <e>", "<cs> my co-sponsors are a long way away and therefore i am unable to consult them <e> <s> obviously i thank the noble earl very much indeed for saying that he will take this amendment back and look at it <e> <s> we reserve our position to put down our amendment again perhaps in better terms <e> <s> we have been asked for a definition of volunteer and that we can easily produce if there is nothing satisfactory down at report from the minister that is what we shall do <e> <s> i thank him for what he said and in the light of it i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that this important report points up some of the particular responsibilities of the industrialised countries and the measures that they can take <e> <s> can he not be a little more specific about the financial assistance or new technology that the government might think of providing to help bring about the aims set out in the report <e>", "<cs> as the minister has said the amendment implements an assurance made at an earlier stage to take collective community charge <e>", "<cs> i should like to speak primarily to amendment no <e> <s> a which is grouped with amendments nos <e> <s> and but which addresses a slightly different situation <e> <s> as the noble lord said clause provides for couples to be jointly and severally liable for each others community charge <e> <s> one objection is that it makes nonsense of the governments much-repeated insistence on the value of individual liberty as essential to individual accountability <e> <s> another <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe i have time to thank all noble lords who have taken part in this debate <e> <s> i thank also the minister for answering very fully and for the tone she used <e> <s> i congratulate the right reverend prelate the bishop of salisbury on his speech and i am happy that he chose this debate in which to make his maiden speech <e> <s> i am also delighted that he chose to speak about the sudan <e>", "<cs> i support these two amendments <e> <s> it seems entirely appropriate and relevant that those who publish or cause to be published an advertisement

houghton of sowerby brings forward proposals regarding animals i am always confident that it will be to their benefit <e> <s> indeed this small bill is no exception <e> <s> i am most grateful to him for his clear introduction to the bill and like the noble earl i also hope that the necessary time will be given to it as my noble friend has indicated that there will certainly be one or two amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that it was reported in the <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord cledwyn opened the debate with a very full and comprehensive introduction

members of your lordships house <e> <s> i hope that the friends whom i recognise listening to the debate today will be pleased that the subject has been gone into so fully and that when this debate is recorded on bbc hong kong they too will realise the very great seriousness with which the subject has been taken <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may thank noble lords who have spoken in this debate <e> <s> i am very grateful for the support that my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government continue to press the commission to produce practical proposals in its report requested by june in the council resolution <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble and learned lord not agree that in other countries special cases are made for divorced wives of diplomatic officers whereby a proportion of the occupational pension will go to each wife <e> <s> will the noble and learned lord say whether we can perhaps <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say whether there is any evidence that homosexuality within our prisons is a reason for the spread of aids <e> <s> if so can he say whether the use of condoms is legal in prison <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may add a couple of points here <e> <s> i do not wish to enter into the discussion on terminology but to reiterate a point which i made on second reading <e> <s> the great irony of this bill is that it has caused great anxiety to travellers and gypsies the very people who tether their horses and the very people against whom the rspca makes it quite clear that the bill is not directed <e> <s> they are the people who look after their horses best <e> <s> the trouble is as i said on second reading that travellers are very often viewed with great suspicion by the local people <e> <s> they feel that this bill could give an extra stick to the local people with which to beat the travellers <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the minister for having told me beforehand that he would be making a few changes to this bill and that it would be mainly a tidying up process <e> <s> he said and i am grateful to him for having repeated it that he did not think the amendments he would be putting down would cause any impediment to the passage of the bill when it got back to another place <e>", "<cs> i wish only to say that i am glad my noble friend has sought clarification on that point and that the minister has been able to give his assurance <e> <s> again from my point of view and that of the sponsors of this bill we are grateful for the effort that has gone into clarifying these points <e> <s> we see this as an improvement and therefore we are grateful to the government for having gone through it so carefully and for having made these technical changes which to our minds have improved the bill <e> <s> i give my support to the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords

requirement on the boroughs only in the event that the voluntary arrangements broke down it would be a safety net <e> <s> the example she gave was not my point which related to the breakdown of voluntary arrangements <e> <s> i gave examples of where that happened following the abolition of the glc <e> <s> it would be something on which the boroughs could fall back <e> <s> it is disappointing that the minister has not taken seriously the amendment which as i said the noble lord lord carlisle said that he preferred <e> <s> i find that disappointing <e> <s> it is late and we have had a great deal of exercise down to the lobbies <e> <s> although dissatisfied i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that the noble baroness started by saying that she had some sympathy for this amendment because that gave me some pleasure <e> <s> but she said why should this be applied to inner london and not to other boroughs <e> <s> the reason is that inner london is not the same as elsewhere <e> <s> that is why we are trying to make special provisions for the vast mixed cultural community and mixed needs existing in london <e>", "<cs> my lords i supported the amendment moved by the noble baroness at committee stage <e> <s> throughout the course of our debates on this bill the government have stressed the importance of parental choice <e> <s> why then have they not given parents who work abroad more choice <e> <s> my experience has been that the predominent worry of parents who work abroad for whatever reason is how they will educate their children <e> <s> i was supported by the padding of the diplomatic service and therefore finances were available to send our children abroad <e> <s> but more and more parents do not want to send their children abroad and they are educated in another language and probably suffer as a result <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the report also found that disorders were primarily caused by white affluent employed youths <e> <s> therefore can the minister say a little more about what the government intend to do to enhance the respect of these young people for the community in the light of the prime ministers comment that there is no such thing as society <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say a word at this stage rather than later <e> <s> i should like to say first that i too share my noble friends regret that the poetic ring to the name of his bill has now been rather sadly diminished <e> <s> but in spite of that i must say that i very much welcome the change that he has made in the title <e> <s> as he says the specific intention of the bill is now most clear <e> <s> as i spoke both on second reading and in committee about the anxieties which had been provoked among travellers and gypsies who were most worried that the bill was merely against tethering rather than against cruel tethering i must say that i think this change will go a long way towards setting their anxieties at rest <e> <s> i am most grateful to my noble friend for making the changes and i entirely support the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords having listened to some very interesting speeches covering different aspects of the bill i wish to speak about one particular implication for the interests of women <e> <s> i shall be speaking from information received from the womens organisations interest group which formed a sub-committee to look particularly at the bill <e> <s> its members have expressed extreme concern <e> <s> perhaps i may emphasise that the groups making up the womens organisations interest group represent women of all backgrounds and of all political <e>", "<cs> i should like to add a few words <e> <s> i have supported everything that the minister has said up to now but i wish to make the point that it is important that disabled people should not be disqualified from doing something because of their disability <e> <s> that case has been very strongly put this afternoon <e> <s> as the minister has said the amendment before us now would mean that others besides the disabled would be allowed to use these weapons <e> <s> will the minister put forward an amendment which would make a specific case for the disabled to be able to use these weapons which are the only kind of weapons that they can use on account of their disability <e>", "<cs> i am disappointed that the minister did not appreciate the important points that i felt i had made <e> <s> nor did i find convincing the problems suggested as regards shooters in scotland who would suddenly find themselves unable to purchase guns <e> <s> i should have thought that in scotland there would have been a great number of suppliers in many areas through whom those people could obtain guns <e>", "<cs> where is that <e>", "<cs> obviously i am extremely disappointed because we were trying to protect mothers and their children from becoming homeless <e> <s> that was the whole object of these amendments <e> <s> it had nothing to do with social tenancies as the noble lord lord trafford said <e> <s> we do sometimes refer to social tenancies but in fact not in this case <e> <s> it

new human rights accord in vienna <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister say whether it is true that at the present time neither the british government nor the gibraltar government are prepared to make any contribution to the remaining million owed to the pensioners <e> <s> have the government taken legal opinion that liability in this case lies with the gibraltar government <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister give an assurance that in line with the recommendations from the foreign affairs committee in another place and from oxfam the funds that the government will give for emergency relief will be new money and will not be subtracted from the overseas development aid that we are at present giving <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to press my point but the minister did not answer it <e> <s> will the money given be new money or will it be subtracted from funds that we already provide for the overseas development budget <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say whether it is true that the turkish government are also reluctant to allow an investigative mission into their country <e> <s> if so what reasons do they give <e> <s> what pressure have the british government brought to bear on the turkish government to allow such a mission into turkey to investigate the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords many speakers have already said that my noble friend has brought forward many questions relating to penal issues but <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all very grateful to the minister for having answered so many of our questions <e> <s> but i put a few questions to the minister i refer particularly to those questions put to me by the national schizophrenia fellowship which have not been answered <e> <s> i should be grateful if he would read what i have said and write to me on those points <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that since the number of council houses sold for owner-occupation is nearly in excess of those constructed during the same period <e> <s> does he think that that has any bearing on the number of people who are homeless <e> <s> secondly can the minister tell us which proposals within the housing bill can possibly affect the outrageously high level of homelessness and can help to bring it down <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the importance of a campaign which aims to reduce the number of accidents to children in the ec by to per cent <e>

camps for vietnamese refugees which i have seen myself i should like to ask this question <e> <s> can the minister say what progress there is in negotiations with the vietnamese government with a view to repatriating the vietnamese refugees who arrived in hong kong after june <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister confirm that the oda held talks with the adam smith institute during the past year and that they discussed the institutes proposal to set up a privatisation unit in the oda <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter has brought before us today a subject which is always controversial and of great concern not only to us in this house but to many people outside <e> <s> it is appropriate that we should be considering this question again after the intervening years since

manufacturers of goods <e>", "<cs> my lords what is the purpose of listing a building if british rail can demolish it <e>", "<cs> my lords although it seems a long time since the noble lord lord reay

extra minute <e>", "<cs> my lords i mentioned to my noble friend that i might use an extra minute <e> <s> i have reached the end of my remarks and should like to draw the situation to the ministers attention in the hope that he will take it to heart <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that as international agreements have clearly failed to improve the romanian presidents record on human rights international disapproval is perhaps the only course <e> <s> therefore does he accept that there should be some way in which european disapproval can be shown even though as he said it is not possible to withdraw honours <e> <s> can he give a commitment to continue to raise the issue at forthcoming csce conferences <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may first point out to the minister and to the house that i have seriously underestimated the length of the debate <e> <s> i am sorry to say that i may riot be able to stay until the end but i shall read <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join other speakers in thanking the noble lord lord home for giving us this timely opportunity to debate this particular subject <e> <s> i was happy that the noble lord took the opportunity to measure the chance that has occurred in this area since his previous debates <e> <s> in presenting his motion he took the two major questions what should be the response of the west to the present soviet policies and can europe work together to deal with that present position <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to hear that from the noble lord lord chalfont <e> <s> i must have misunderstood him because i

speech on an interesting theme where i completely agreed with him <e> <s> he hoped to see the emergence of a pluralist eastern bloc and i think that this is what we may well see happening but perhaps he and i saw a different way for that to come about <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of what the noble lord lord cledwyn has said and the very real anxieties felt by the people of hong kong as evidenced by the high degree of emigration can the noble lord say what measures her majestys government intend to take in order to allay those worries <e> <s> will the minister state whether there is any case for the introduction of a bill of rights in hong kong which might make the people there feel better prepared for <e> <s> that has already been mentioned by the secretary of state for foreign affairs

sorrier that the content of what she said received so very little support from previous speakers <e> <s> i believe that only the noble lord lord beaverbrook and the noble baroness lady gardner of parkes supported the minister although much of what the noble baroness lady gardner of parkes said was in support of what is happening now <e> <s> that made me rather sorry <e> <s> however the noble baroness lady gardner of parkes herself admitted that many changes were necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble baroness for explaining that point <e> <s> however it is not the position as it has been explained to me by the national campaign for the right to fuel <e> <s> it has said that people are not allowed a pre-payment meter on request but that such meters are provided only if the electricity supplier is willing to do so <e> <s> we should like to see a provision in the bill allowing people to have such meters and for any dispute between the supplier and the customer to be settled by the regulator <e>", "<cs> my lords as previous speakers have said we are all very grateful to my noble friend lord houghton for introducing the debate this evening because these three reports present the first major tests of the animals scientific procedures act <e> <s> i remember in the debate on the third reading of that bill saying with the support of other speakers that the hope of the house was that one of its main effects would be a reduction in the number of experiments on animals <e> <s> that is what my noble friend has repeated this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords in

whether the government will seriously consider introducing legal limits on the time that a person can spend on remand <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl answer more specifically the two questions that i put to him <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may start by saying despite the slightly cool reception which my noble friend lord longford gave to these proposals how very much the labour

my lords in view of the fact that for years now the west germans have been staunch supporters of nato and in view of their concern about the short-range weapons on their soil would it not be very much in the interests of nato to give sympathetic consideration to their views at next weeks summit <e> <s> will the noble baroness press her right honourable friend the prime minister to do that very thing <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that president mitterrand announced some time ago that france would be writing off as much as billion of debt owed from african countries including the

run through all the different speeches <e> <s> it is a firm determination that a fair and equitable solution should be found for the people of hong kong <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the very serious situation regarding the rise in the <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister give me a figure of any attempted suicides in the prisons mentioned by the noble lord lord hylton <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the fact that some of the crime is committed by young people under the influence of drink will the minister say whether there has been any success as a result of the recent licensing act which strengthened the law governing the sale of alcohol to under-age drinkers and whether there have been any prosecutions of licensees and publicans <e> <s> what training is given to teachers and social workers to help prevent young people falling into the habit of drinking or to help them out of it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to press the minister but can he answer the question that i put to him <e> <s> it was whether there had been any prosecutions of publicans for selling drinks to under-age drinkers following the introduction of the licensing act <e> <s> also what training is available to teachers and social workers to help young people avoid becoming involved <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask the minister for a little more information as regards two points which he made in the statement <e> <s> first he spoke about the basic law <e> <s> however can he say whether work has resumed in that connection <e> <s> i am sure that he will agree that everything should be done to maintain some movement and action in hong kong in order to fill the dangerous vacuum which is clearly visible <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his rather predictable answer <e>

two substances to the convention <e> <s> it is clear that these drugs if misused can cause harm <e>", "<cs> my lords i should also like to thank my noble friend lord houghton for again bringing forward an important measure <e> <s> in this case it relates to the problem of dangerous dogs <e> <s> the bill goes some way towards strengthening controls over such dogs <e> <s> it allays the fears of some members of the public who are anxious about the more combative breeds of dog <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that general answer <e> <s> is he aware that the most recent census on school meals carried out in october showed a most alarming decrease in the number of children having free school meals <e> <s> the decrease was per cent <e> <s> which represented children out of which were reported from manchester alone <e> <s> does the minister agree that the reasons for the decrease is the low take-up of family credit <e> <s> therefore will he say whether the government will extend eligibility for free school meals to those children whose parents receive family credit <e> <s> will he also say whether the government will set up a review as they did in of the prices charged whether they are deterring parents and whether the children are substituting for school meals junk food and sandwiches from home which are not good for growing children <e>", "<cs> my lords

lowest income <e> <s> there is much evidence to show that those on low incomes are over-represented in property which is in a poor condition <e> <s> it is that type of property which has a lower standard of insulation and the least efficient heating system <e> <s> the low income groups are least able to afford to invest in energy efficiency measures yet they can eventually reap the most benefit in terms of heating bills and improved comfort <e>", "<cs> i support the noble lord and stress the importance which i attach to the amendment <e> <s> i agree with him that there would seem to be little incentive for local authorities to make grants for energy efficiency measures if they have to make a contribution from their own resources <e> <s> the whole matter hinges on that <e> <s> i should like to hear from the minister why he thinks there will be an incentive for local authorities to pay for this enormously important work <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for what i take to be a sympathetic answer <e> <s> nevertheless does the minister not agree that a decision to adopt sdst is now becoming urgent in the light of firm evidence from the transport and road research laboratory

merely that they will be deported <e> <s> does he not feel that more preventitive action should be taken <e> <s> one scheme suggested by prison governors is that videos should be shown either on flights or at airport passport control desks spelling out the very high sentences which drug carriers risk and inviting women in particular to give themselves up <e> <s> can the minister say whether

occasions about the shortages of staff and what would happen should the situation continue <e> <s> can he comment on that part of the report <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister told his noble friend

protested to the government of el salvador about the murder of six jesuit priests and the imprisonment and torture of church leaders by members of the armed forces and security services <e>", "<cs> my

rates and thus register at different levels <e> <s> for example women register having absorbed less alcohol <e> <s> does not the minister agree that one way in which to deal with this matter would be

die each day of preventable illnesses and malnutrition and that if this trend continues in the next years million children will die <e> <s> therefore will not the minister agree that britains position of being th out of in the league of aid donors is deplorable <e> <s> will the minister give a commitment to increase the aid from per cent <e> <s> of the gdp <e>", "<cs> my lords i too was happy to hear the ministers answer <e> <s> however can he say whether he has any information about the ethiopian government allowing relief aid to be transported to rebel-held territories <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to my noble friend for bringing this very important question before us <e> <s> it is a very great pity that there are not more noble lords here either to listen or to take part in a debate on a subject which is fundamental in terms of humanity and in practical good sense <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say a little more about the human rights group which the kuala lumpur summit conference agreed to set up <e> <s> for example can he perhaps say what the proposed powers and responsibilities of that group will be <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches are grateful to the minister for repeating the statement with regard to the grave events in panama <e> <s> on these benches we certainly agree with what the minister has said about general noriega who we believe is a brutal dictator who has deprived the panamanian people of their democratic rights <e> <s> we too condemn his record on human rights <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say that i really do not believe that what my noble friend lord mishcon has said will add to the anxieties of the people of hong kong <e> <s> it is more the sparsity of this statement that will add to their anxieties because as the noble lord lord maclehose has said there will now be an enormous worry about qualifications for points <e> <s> we have no idea what the criteria will be for heads of households to acquire points <e> <s> so what the noble lord lord maclehose said about the urgency of information being put forward is of the greatest importance <e>", "<cs> my lords we are most grateful to the minister for presenting the bill and for describing the implications so clearly <e> <s> it must be rare for a bill to come before us which i feel will receive unequivocal support and will also attract a great deal of pleasure and enthusiasm <e> <s> indeed it is a relief to have left behind us the hurricane caused by the subject of student loans and to enter the calm waters which are represented by such a reunification <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to contribute three short points to the important debate which my noble friend lord callaghan has brought before the house this afternoon <e> <s> my first point concerns our reaction to what has happened in east germany and elsewhere <e> <s> secondly i wish to mention the need for a vision of the shape that a restructured europe might take <e> <s> thirdly i wish to mention the role this country should play to bring that vision into effect <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware of the debt for development scheme now operative in sudan <e> <s> thereby instead of repaying debts to certain banks notably hambros deutschesbank and midland the sudanese government pay them to unicef to be spent on development projects concerned mainly with afforestation schemes <e> <s> will the minister say what the government are doing to encourage other banks to take part in the scheme and to assist a country such as brazil in preserving its rain forests <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a very great pleasure for me to speak from the front bench in support of another attempt by my noble friend lord longford to bring attention to some improvements to some aspects of our penal or prison system <e> <s> i am very glad it has been echoed that he gave such a well deserved tribute to the work and achievement of the very important and dedicated service that we are discussing this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness say what caused the shortage of the vaccine <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards what the minister said about targeting those people who are worse off can he tell the house what is the take-up of family credit at present <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may briefly express my concerns about the amendments <e> <s> the noble lady lady saltoun quite rightly said that fathers are important <e> <s> no one would disagree that fathers are of great importance to children <e> <s> however the noble lady also said that it was wrong <e>", "<cs> the noble lady implies that a single-parent mother is under a disadvantage but that is not acceptable <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister give any information as to whether there has been damage to crops forestation or roads from the floods <e> <s> have there been any requests from the tunisian government for technical assistance to help them rebuild after such destruction <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say whether there has been a reduction in the illicit slaughter of elephants and if so can he give the present figures <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may first say how much i appreciate the occasions on which it is for me to respond from this front bench to propositions put forward by the noble lord lord allen <e> <s> i always welcome these opportunities for two reasons <e> <s> the first is that the noble lord lord allen always presents his propositions with such clarity that i am able to comprehend what they are <e> <s> secondly i have every anticipation of being in agreement with his objectives <e> <s> in the case of the gaming amendment bill i certainly agree with the objectives that he has in mind <e> <s> i am most grateful for his clear presentation <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that one of the resident psychiatrists at holloway prison has told me that he and his colleagues have recognised more and more that they are treating in prison now the same women they used to treat in psychiatric institutions <e> <s> does she not agree that that is strange care in the community for the mentally ill <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware of the forbidding statistic which arose in a programme last night that the right reverend prelate referred to namely that the childrens society which carries out such a large amount of work in looking after children who run away from home and from care is in the red to the tune of million <e> <s> does not the minister think that is a serious situation <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl give greater consideration to the suggestion made by the noble and learned lord lord hailsham of saint marylebone that court funds should be used to compensate victims and to reduce the length of time they have to wait and that the sum should be retrieved from the offender <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for that answer <e> <s> however is he aware that there is now clear scientific evidence that kurdish refugees from iraq have been poisoned by chemical warfare agents <e> <s> can he say what representations the government have made to the iraqi government either unilaterally or through the ec middle east working party about those outrages <e> <s> can the minister also say how many kurds from iran iraq and turkey have asked for asylum in this country how many have been granted asylum and how many have been refused it <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister say whether britains exports to iraq have risen in the past year <e> <s> if so does he agree that that is hardly a way to express condemnation of the human rights violations of a country <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am glad and grateful that the noble lord lord birkett has chosen such an interesting subject for his debate this evening <e> <s> the debate comes at an opportune time because there has been considerable interest and much comment has been made recently about the possibilities of a national lottery <e> <s> the noble lord lord birkett made out a persuasive and enthusiastic rationalisation of his case this evening <e> <s> he gave a long list of mouth-watering opportunities which would arise from a national lottery one could only be attracted by the idea of the retention of pictures which would otherwise go abroad <e> <s> there would be a greater number of theatres and greater flexibility for work within the theatres <e> <s> there would be additional woodlands and parks and other benefits which the noble lord described <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i see myself in rather a different position from that of the noble lord lord donaldson <e> <s> i think i should not be drawn any further down that route <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that clarification <e> <s> it brings much relief to my anxiety <e> <s> i believe that everybody has agreed that the objective of raising funds for the arts is thoroughly acceptable <e> <s> it was interesting to hear the historical background which the noble lord lord birkett gave this evening <e> <s> it is worthy of note that as he said the principle of state lotteries was accepted as far back <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like briefly to thank all noble lords who have spoken in the debate <e> <s> there is no doubting the fact that there was one aspect upon which we all agreed namely the effectiveness and devotion of the managers the paid workers and the volunteers of the cabs <e> <s> i very much hope that they will read the <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the timely visit which the minister was able to make to nepal at such a critical time and bearing in mind our historic links with the country was he able to request the release of any of those who are detained without trial <e> <s> further having regard to the very worrying reports from amnesty international about the methods used by the security forces after the demonstrations can he say whether the united kingdom still trains any of those forces <e> <s> can he also say what type of military equipment we export to nepal and its value <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say whether the demonstrations were dealt with in a brutal manner <e> <s> can he also say how many detainees are still held without trial <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that answer <e> <s> however will he agree that it is a horrifying and worrying situation whereby young people are being criminalised purely because they are homeless and penniless <e> <s> in view of the fact that under the act no one can be prosecuted for sleeping rough unless he refuses a place of shelter can the minister say what places of shelter are offered to young people <e> <s> as the latest department of the environment figures show that homelessness has risen by per cent <e> <s> over the past year can he say how the inter-departmental review which includes young people is progressing and when it will be completed <e>", "<cs> my lords when does the noble earl expect that review to be published <e>", "<cs> my lords i congratulate the chairman and members of the select committee on science and technology on their report <e> <s> as previous speakers have said the committee took on a vast subject <e> <s> the result has been a good and constructive report <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am grateful to the noble lord lord st john of bletso for giving us this opportunity because after all the subject of south africa is close to our thoughts and hopes <e> <s> i found the account of his recent visit that the noble lord gave of great fascination and very moving <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord eonham-carter made a very good case for his bill and i was extremely interested in the speech of the noble lord lord cockfield based on his experience and his deep knowledge of this subject <e> <s> for me the major argument in favour of making this change in relation to our electoral system for the european elections is that under the treaty of rome there was a requirement that there should be a common electoral system for the european parliament <e> <s> in my view that means that this particular change in our electoral system is something which belongs entirely to the european argument rather than to the general arguments about changing our electoral system here <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that reply <e> <s> however in view of the seriously deteriorating situation in guatemala the reports that the guatemalan president is no longer in control and that assassinations have been carried out by police and military squads can the minister say whether there is any hope of negotiations between the government and the opposition the urng <e> <s> will the minister also say whether the government will give assistance to the committee of the national reconciliation dialogue which was set up in guatemala <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say how the number of prisoners at strangeways rose as high as <e> <s> can he tell the house at what point it is decided that a prison cannot take any more inmates <e> <s> if the population is in excess of it is remarkable how the overpopulation rose to such a high level <e> <s> can the minister further say whether the staffing levels were those agreed under the fresh start programme <e> <s> can he also say what the programme was for refurbishment and the establishment of integral sanitation and at what speed that programme was moving <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say what third world countries are in a position to produce chemical weapons <e> <s> can he also say what his response is to the horrifying report in the <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has given very good news about the speed with which the documents arrive before parliament <e> <s> can he say who outside parliament has access to those documents <e> <s> with regard to the commission inquiry into the rover group can he say when documents relating to that matter will be put before parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say whether diplomats wives are automatically given language training <e> <s> is it not important for the wives also to be well versed in the language of the country to which their husbands are accredited <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that it has been reported that a considerable number of people involved in motor accidents are subsequently found to have poor eyesight <e> <s> therefore does not the noble baroness agree that the unsettled position she describes and the results of the surveys that have been made can only exacerbate that grave danger <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say what resources her majestys government will be contributing to the un international decade for natural disaster reduction <e>", "<cs> i find it disappointing that the minister has produced all the old arguments when the facts are strong <e> <s> the nhs provides creche facilities for less than - per cent <e> <s> of its staff <e> <s> there is a long way to go <e> <s> the noble baroness suggested that the children act would provide a miracle and would change everything <e> <s> i agree that it will make a start <e> <s> however when the princess royal said that <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree with unicef that the only way to decrease world population growth is by reducing the level of infant mortality which as the noble baroness said is a reason for women having bigger families <e> <s> does he believe that more aid should go towards improving the health of small children and babies as well as towards the education of women <e> <s> are her majestys government currently commissioning any research into population growth and the means of reducing it <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the national health service loses married nurses with children because of the low rate of child care and creche provision that is made <e> <s> will the minister say what the government think about that <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to noble lords who have taken part in this debate <e> <s> i find myself in a very unusual position which i hope i shall not occupy too often again <e> <s> i am proposing a bill which is heartily endorsed by the minister and which is very strongly slated by my noble friend on my own front bench <e> <s> the noble lord lord allen has pointed out the anomaly of an opposition spokesperson introducing a bill which contains the law commissions recommendations which were asked for by the government in the first place <e> <s> that again puts me into a very unusual position <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say what proportion of our international aid budget goes to environmental protection projects <e> <s> can he also say whether the government are supporting survival international an organisation campaigning to save the yanomani indians who live in the brazilian forests and who are in danger of extinction because illicit gold mining is poisoning the rivers <e> <s> has he made representations to the brazilian government about their decision to allow the gold prospectors into the rain forests <e>", "<cs> my lords a short time ago i noticed a tragic but unfortunately true statement in a recent world health organisation report <e> <s> the report said <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> how will support be channeled in international literacy year if we do not do that through unesco <e>", "<cs> my lords since i came to your lordships house there has not been a single aspect of penal affairs which my noble friend lord longford has not presented to the house <e> <s> the subject he has put before us this evening is as important as all the previous ones and i very much look forward to the reply that the noble viscount will give my noble friend on the two crucial questions <e> <s> the first was whether the government are prepared to agree that a new approach to sentencing is required <e> <s> the other was whether he can confirm the forecast of an increase of in the prison population which would be worrying <e>", "<cs> my lords although it is a very long time ago since the minister gave his very clear presentation of this bill it has nevertheless been a great pleasure to listen to this debate both because it has been so well-informed and also because there has been so much agreement among speakers on all sides of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to follow the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls not so much because i agree with what he said but because there is a certain scarcity value today in following speakers from the government benches <e> <s> the noble lord devoted a great deal of his speech to defending government policies against the points made from this side of the house which entirely related to the motion now before us <e> <s> i am happy that my noble friend lord donoughue is not here i hope that he does not read <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend lord williams for presenting the amendments so clearly <e> <s> i very much regret the absence of the noble baroness lady oppenheim-barnes <e> <s> i am sure that we all wish her a very good recovery from her rather serious back operation <e> <s> however the noble baroness made clear her intentions in her second reading speech <e> <s> those intentions have been clearly reflected in the amendments before us and in the explanation given by my noble friend lord williams <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord has said the object of the amendments is to provide consumers with a long-term right to reject <e> <s> although i have sympathy with the thrust of the amendments they are unrealistic because in practice they will mean that the right to reject goods is indefinite or will at least exist for the six months allowed by the limitation of time act <e>", "<cs> the minister is not looking favourably on the consumer this evening <e> <s> however i am grateful to him for having taken so much trouble to respond to my amendment <e> <s> we shall certainly reconsider the matter before report <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all very grateful to the noble lord lord elton not only for bringing forward the bill but also for his very clear explanation of what it means <e> <s> i was glad that he gave the reasons for the need for this legislation making it clear that his wish was not to prevent entertainment but to meet the concern which i am sure that we all share <e>", "<cs> often the organisers and their responsibilities are unknown to anybody <e> <s> as the noble lord lord elton said very dangerous and unsuitable buildings are used <e> <s> large profits are made but they are not used for security providing toilet facilities or for the general safety of the audience <e> <s> there seems little doubt that there is a drug culture at the centre of such acid-house parties and a considerable amount of peddling of drugs takes place <e> <s> as the noble lord also said there has been violence at the events which has often been caused by the security guards hired to protect the promoters <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> before anything else perhaps i may say how happy i am that this debate has attracted two maiden speakers from whom i expect a great and important contribution to this debate <e> <s> i know how much we all look forward to what they have to say <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say how happy i am at the most favourable response that there has been to this bill <e> <s> anyone who may have anticipated that it would be a rather dry subject would have been wrong <e> <s> i do not think i have ever spent a friday morning in your lordships house having a more enjoyable time or listening to better speeches <e> <s> i am not going to pay any more compliments to the maiden speakers because i believe that every adjective has been used <e> <s> they might get swollen heads if any more adjectives were used <e> <s> i very much appreciated and enjoyed what they said in support of this bill and the way in which they said it <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e> <s> therefore unless any noble lord objects i beg to move that the order of commitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has spoken of the bills state of health <e> <s> i agree that it has had a very rumbustious background <e> <s> however i remind him that it was not the fault of the promoters that it took five hours at second reading in another place and three days in committee <e> <s> it was because at that time the government appeared to favour the bill <e> <s> it was only at the very last instance that it was talked out in another place and only the rump of the bill remained <e>", "<cs> my lords the speeches of all noble lords who have taken part in this debate have amply demonstrated the great concern of this house for the people of hong kong <e> <s> the bill acutely affects the lives of people in britains remaining colony <e> <s> it is little wonder that the subject has aroused so much passion both inside and outside parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i cannot clarify that point because i do not have the figures <e> <s> even if i had i do not believe that i would be persuaded by the noble lords argument <e> <s> i believe that the situation is entirely different and in absorbing million people we should not show responsibility toward the people of this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now further considered on report <e>", "<cs> my lords we considered amendment no <e> <s> in committee <e> <s> the point at issue is whether the house agrees that there are circumstances where a consumer should lose his right to a refund under the sale of goods act even before he has had a reasonable opportunity to examine the goods <e> <s> the minister responded to this at committee stage <e> <s> i am moving it once again because i cannot think of any good reason why a consumer should lose the right to a refund even before he has had a fair chance to see whether the product works satisfactorily <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a third time <e> <s> without wishing to take up more than a few minutes of your lordships time i want to reiterate my thanks to all noble lords who have made such constructive contributions to the debate on this bill <e> <s> i particularly wish to express my gratitude to the minister and to the noble baroness lady blatch who have given the bill both great encouragement and a fair wind <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls becomes disturbed rather easily <e> <s> my point was that an enormous number of women enter the industry <e> <s> i did not mean that direct discrimination made them leave i meant that they were unable to stay because of lack of facilities for child care bad maternity leave arrangements and a whole variety of reasons <e> <s> the point i made was that there was no lack of a wish to go into the industry <e> <s> many women go into it but very few of them end up <e>", "<cs> my lords i notice that the sponsor of this bill in another place called it a brief worthy and uncontentious piece of legislation <e> <s> i would go further and say that it is an admirable proposal <e> <s> it <e>", "<cs> i too was very happy that the minister responded in the way he did <e> <s> he showed his obvious concern about the issue <e> <s> he also pointed out the various changes that the government have made or are making to try to strengthen the training base <e> <s> however there can be no doubt as the noble lord lord bonham-carter said that everything that we can do to redress the lack of training in this country is to be welcomed <e>", "<cs> my lords under the act has there been an increase in the number of convictions of people under the age of <e>", "<cs> my lords once again we are debating a report by her majestys chief inspector of prisons <e> <s> this time it is birmingham prison <e> <s> we are very fortunate that the noble lord lord harris of greenwich has brought this subject before the house <e> <s> clearly the report is of very great significance <e>", "<cs> i can understand that the minister believes the word dependent to be more difficult to evaluate than a simple age limit <e> <s> however i found difficulty in accepting another of his reasons that it would encourage young people to stay at home not get married and so on <e> <s> that is highly unlikely <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the minister <e> <s> he has responded exactly to the anxieties expressed <e> <s> i repeat my gratitude and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords has the minister received any information from humanitarian agencies or ngos about the plight of the kurdish refugees from iraq in the turkish camps <e> <s> how much humanitarian aid is being sent to those camps <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that answer <e> <s> however does he agree that there is a real danger that the khmer rouge will seize power unless urgent action is taken <e> <s> therefore can he be a little more specific about what progress has been made in the un security councils current session <e> <s> further will he confirm or will he deny the recent news which was released only this morning that the united states will no longer recognise the khmer rouge-dominated coalitions right to occupy cambodias seat at the un <e> <s> if this report is correct will her majestys government follow suit <e>", "<cs> i wish to make a few remarks from the front bench on this side of the committee in support of these amendments <e> <s> i am sure that the minister recognises that there have been overwhelmingly strong arguments coming from all parts of the chamber in favour of these amendments <e> <s> the warning that came from the noble lord lord buxton was a serious one concerning the future of the programmes that are covered by these amendments <e> <s> what he said about the part played by the iba in the promotion of such programmes was also of great significance <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord both for his explanation of amendment no <e> <s> and also for speaking to our amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord that the wording in the amendment is somewhat mixed up <e>", "<cs> i also wish to support this amendment which has been clearly explained both by the noble baroness and by the noble lord lord thomson <e> <s> it seems proper that the itc will be able if it wishes to continue the practice which has been followed by the iba of specifying dual itv regions <e> <s> for all the reasons that have been put we wish to support this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am pleased to hear the optimistic note in the ministers answer <e> <s> perhaps i might point to some other figures which show rather a different picture <e> <s> is the minister aware that figures released recently show that firms <e>", "<cs> my lords it has been a great privilege to take part in the debate which has included contributions from those who have played a vital role in the life of hong kong <e> <s> this includes in particular the noble lords lord kadoorie and lord maclehose <e> <s> what they have said during the passage of the bill has been of great help to those of us who in all honesty have found it difficult to put forward firm and unequivocal views <e> <s> the reason for that was given by the minister the question marks which hang <e>", "<cs> i too should like to give my very strong support to the amendments <e> <s> the noble lord lord thomson has made abundantly clear how modern technology if used can absolutely revolutionise the lives of the blind the partially sighted the deaf and the disabled <e> <s> he has made quite clear how modern technology can be used through teletext <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment which was so clearly introduced by the noble lord lord swinfen <e> <s> the broadcasting consortium is anxious that the quality of these services should be maintained because of their great importance to the organisations that the consortium represents and the people with whom they work <e> <s> the consortium wants to ensure that the information which is of particular importance is safeguarded <e> <s> in order to minimise expenditure the franchise holder could reduce the number of services offered on teletext and those services with small audiences would be lost <e> <s> that is the consortiums great fear <e>", "<cs> i had intended to speak to amendment no <e> <s> but perhaps i shall do that having heard the ministers response to the amendment that has been moved <e>", "<cs> i rather anticipated the ministers reply <e> <s> however i still think that there is a grave risk in not writing on to the face of the bill a provision to ensure that listeners have an adequate choice of programmes <e> <s> that was what this amendment sought to do <e> <s> however i have no choice at the moment but to withdraw it <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i agree with the noble baroness lady seear who has made the central point of the argument <e> <s> if under the present requirements the right reverend prelate found six out of programmes utterly distasteful and wished that they had not been permitted then surely that proves that those requirements do not work <e> <s> it is not that we want programmes to be in bad taste or to be offensive to public feeling but we believe that those requirements are of little use <e> <s> therefore since one only wants to include in bills what is necessary we suggest that those requirements should go <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the committee for rising straight after my noble friend <e> <s> i should like to say a few brief words in support of her remarks <e> <s> we feel rather worried that already the radio authority does not have to apply any quality requirements to the applicants for the three commercial services <e> <s> this amendment further weakens the bill by not giving the authority any direction in defining exceptional circumstances and allowing it to interpret exceptional circumstances in different ways for different licences <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment <e> <s> it seems right for the reasons given by the noble lord lord bonham-carter that the radio authority should publish in detail its reasons for deciding to award a local licence <e> <s> the bill requires the radio authority to publish its reasons for awarding a national licence to an applicant <e> <s> therefore it is logical that the same should apply to local radio services <e>", "<cs> i wish briefly to support the amendment <e> <s> as the noble lord lord bonham-carter said the authority should be required to advertise the additional licence rather than just to award it <e> <s> it makes the process more open and fair and in many ways less arbitrary <e> <s> the noble lord lord bonham-carter has put a strong case for making this small but important change and i hope that the minister will listen to it <e>", "<cs> i add a few words in briefly supporting the amendments put forward by my noble friend lord blease and supported by my noble friend lord prys-davies <e> <s> they have made a strong case for incorporating these amendments into the bill <e> <s> as my noble friend lord prys-davies said these provisions are consistent with those made for wales and scotland <e> <s> they are also consistent with the policies of the northern ireland office the northern ireland arts council and indeed of the irish government rte and ulster television <e> <s> all have supported and moved forward the whole notion of including a proportion of irish language programmes to be broadcast in northern ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his explanation <e> <s> however it was slightly at variance with the concerns expressed by the noble lord lord bonham-carter <e> <s> he was supported by the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls who appeared to express the same concern as i had <e> <s> however we shall read carefully what the minister has said and hope that it will comfort us <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment to which my name is attached <e> <s> i am very happy to see the government amendment <e> <s> i would have been even happier to see a more specific requirement <e> <s> it is important to use new ideas for the benefit of the people who need them most <e> <s> there must be encouragement to push innovative developments otherwise they are often ignored <e> <s> it is important that the amendment should specify what we should like to see to assist the blind <e> <s> the noble lord lord thomson has described how these descriptive services operate and how effective they are <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the fact that some very important targets were agreed by the world leaders who met at the world summit for children recently some of them very relevant to the stemming of population growth and in view especially of the target that there should be family planning advice for all couples i am sure that the minister will agree that men need education in family planning as well as women <e> <s> as a result will the minister say what agreement there was as to the funding of those important goals and more specifically will he say when her majestys government plan at least to meet the un target of per cent <e> <s> of gnp <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for having gone carefully through these amendments and responded to them all <e> <s> however i do not think that his hope that we will rest content will be quite fulfilled <e> <s> what the noble lord lord bonham-carter said was both extremely realistic and true and it is therefore a pity that the minister kept repeating that this is not the bill in which to put these safeguards <e>", "<cs> my lords for the reasons that he has given i should like to support the remarks made by the noble lord lord bonham-carter when he moved this amendment <e> <s> i too would like to remind the minister that he admitted that he found attractive the original amendment moved in committee although he offered practical reasons for not being able to accept it <e> <s> we have removed the problems and difficulties to which the minister pointed at committee stage and i hope therefore that he will regard the amendment in a more positive way <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that information <e> <s> however does he agree that in the absence of a un security council requirement for a cease-fire there is a very real danger that the khmer rouge will continue to keep the war going as it is in its interests to prevent the un peace framework from being put in motion <e> <s> will the minister say what her majestys government are doing in order to bring about a cease-fire <e> <s> in view of the appalling poverty in cambodia the hundreds of children who are dying each day from preventable diseases the fact that per cent <e> <s> of the water is contaminated and the enormous number of amputations carried out daily as a result of injuries caused by minefields will he also say when her majestys government will restore bilateral aid to cambodia <e>", "<cs> my lords regarding support for the cambodian economy can the minister say what trade we have with cambodia what exports go to cambodia from this country and what imports come here <e>", "<cs> my lords has the minister studied the excellent report of a house of lords select committee on product safety <e> <s> if he has done so is he <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the noble lords clear explanation of the order and for his description of the role of the judges of the court <e> <s> the reason for the order is clear from his explanation <e> <s> there is not much to say on this matter as the order clearly flows from an international protocol in which we have little or no discretion <e> <s> as the minister has said the order continues the underlying principle that members of the court of human rights should be relieved from national taxation because they serve the international community <e> <s> the main result of that practice is that it appears very generous and it makes <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for explaining the order very clearly <e> <s> we on these benches welcome the decision to allow the crown agents to deal with the private sector <e> <s> i should also like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the work of the crown agents <e> <s> after all the crown agents have come very a long way from their original role as the agency responsible for sending men money and material from britain to the colonies <e> <s> now they are in the forefront of ensuring that official aid donors obtain value for the money they spend <e> <s> as the minister has said the crown agents now face new challenges in the battle to develop and expand their unique range of services <e> <s> i should like to seek clarification from the minister on one or two points <e> <s> first perhaps the minister could say what steps the crown agents will take to deal with the new challenges afforded by the worldwide trend away from tying aid to procurement of the donors goods and services <e> <s> secondly how will they adapt to the single european market and the opening of eastern europe <e> <s> their role will now be to compete with the private sector to provide services even to the uk government who owns them <e> <s> will the minister outline to the house what progress has been made by the crown agents european economic interest group in obtaining business in eastern europe <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a disappointing reply especially when one considers that countries have now ratified the convention including significant european states such as france the ussr portugal and spain <e> <s> does not the minister agree that if britain continues to drag its feet our isolation within the united nations will be almost as great as it is at present within the european community <e> <s> is the minister further aware that we need to ratify the convention urgently as the convention has provided that at the beginning of next year a -member committee will be set up <e> <s> however only countries that have ratified the convention can take part in the selection process <e> <s> will the minister assure the house that britain will ratify the convention before that time in order to take part in that important procedure <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister give more information in respect of some of the articles of the convention which as the noble lord said we signed in april <e> <s> will the government restore income support for and year-olds to a level which will enable those young people to secure independent accommodation where necessary in line with articles and <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a question which may have a simple answer <e> <s> while i too cannot possibly disagree with the principle that fathers should be responsible for the maintenance of their children nevertheless for a single mother bringing up her children the bottom line is that the cash comes in at the end of the week so that she can feed and maintain her children <e> <s> if a mother is reliant on maintenance rather than income support or part of each and there is a breakdown in the payment of the maintenance what can be done for that family in the short term <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish briefly to say a few words in support of these amendments having spoken in their favour at committee stage <e> <s> i shall certainly not repeat any of the more specific arguments that were put forward at that time <e> <s> i strongly support these amendments because it is vital that the media play a part in providing public education <e> <s> it is for that reason that documentaries education and social action programmes should be given some protection <e> <s> the noble lord lord wyatt said that the public did not want social action programmes <e> <s> he rather doubted that they would know what they meant <e> <s> i assure him that there are small and very vulnerable groups of people who know exactly what they will receive from such programmes <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his very clear explanation of this order <e> <s> at the same time i apologise for the absence of my noble friend lord mishcon who as the minister knows is fulfilling the joyous task of carrying out his duties as father of the bride <e> <s> he is sorry to be absent <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble earl <e> <s> i understand the contribution the scheme will make but i want to know how it is perceived in hong kong as contributing to the future <e> <s> i should be most grateful if he could give me an idea about that <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not agree that there is a very real anxiety that there should be such a shortage of hospital beds at the beginning of the winter <e> <s> does she not agree that when winter complaints such as bronchitis and flu start there may be a real crisis <e> <s> will she give an undertaking that special provision will be made if there is a serious flu epidemic <e>", "<cs> my lords it gives me pleasure to take part in a debate which has included two such excellent maiden speeches on subjects of very great interest <e> <s> i reiterate the congratulations that have already been given <e>", "<cs> my lords first i thank the noble lord for his very full and clear explanation of the bill <e> <s> one of the merits of the bill is that it is not too difficult to understand <e> <s> the noble lord has made quite certain that there is no part about which we are not clear <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister recollect that at the recent world summit on children the prime minister and other world leaders signed a plan of action designed to alleviate the suffering of children in the poorest countries <e> <s> is he aware of their commitment to make available resources to meet those goals <e> <s> has the oda adjusted its development aid policies so as to honour the pledge and so help children in the poorest countries <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for giving those figures <e> <s> will he nevertheless confirm that the oda is now under an obligation to adjust its development aid policies to meet the aims signed by the leaders including our prime minister <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord greenhill must be very satisfied with the very positive response that noble lords have given to his motion today <e> <s> he must also be happy with the proposals that have been put forward for its future <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful for the clear explanation that the minister gave of this small but nevertheless significant bill <e> <s> as the minister said the bill aims to modify certain united kingdom enactments in relation to the commonwealth institute the armed services and visiting forces and shipping in the light of the admission of namibia to the commonwealth <e> <s> i too wish to take this opportunity to reiterate the sense of pleasure we all felt at namibias independence some months ago <e> <s> i wish to express the high hopes we had and have that the people of namibia will enjoy better lives now that they have emerged from the maelstrom of events which occurred in the long period of conflict which unfortunately lasted for many years in their country <e>", "<cs> my lords all of us and perhaps in particular those of us who have been involved with the voluntary sector and charities for a long time will be extremely grateful to the noble earl for bringing forward this important subject and putting interesting and pertinent questions to the government this evening <e> <s> the noble earl said clearly how charities in britain hold an important place in not only the life of the country but also in the culture of the country and that there is a particular ethos attached to our voluntary sector and to our charities which is really quite different from that to be found in any other country <e>"]
