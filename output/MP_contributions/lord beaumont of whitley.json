["<cs> my lords like the noble baroness i was not entirely sure on what day it would be right for me to speak during the debate on the gracious speech because the subject with which i want to deal is ecology and the environmental policies of the government and whereas the matters dealing with the environment undoubtedly belong on home affairs day the extension of this subject to what is now commonly called ecological politics takes us into the economic field <e> <s> therefore i hope that noble lords will forgive me if i sometimes stray over slightly to yesterdays subject <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i think he would like to correct a slip which he inadvertently made <e> <s> when talking about the ld test he said that referred to the number of animals that had to be killed <e> <s> it refers of course to the percentage of animals that have to die in the final test <e> <s> the test may kill far more than animals on the way <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while i thank the noble lord for that helpful and encouraging answer may i ask whether he can give us a little more information <e> <s> for instance what will be the position of the eec and the individual national governments at such a conference and what will be the nature of our delegation <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> i follow on the whole the arguments which have been made by the opposition front bench but there are two extra points that i should like to make <e> <s> one is that i do not think that the statement which the noble baroness has made about the total satisfactoriness of the representation by the local government representatives of the opinion of the people of an area stands up entirely <e> <s> we all know that people are elected to local government councils for all sorts of reasons <e> <s> what they are usually elected upon is an across-the-board profile of whether or not they like a particular party at a particular time <e> <s> there are occasions when particular interests and particular subjects affect elections <e> <s> in the history of the battle over comprehensive schools it has more than once happened that a case has been won by the election of people to local councils against the grain of the general feeling in the country about elections according to party allegiances <e> <s> nevertheless on the whole it is not true to say that the election of a conservative or labour majority or even of a liberal majority to some local council will reflect necessarily the peoples views on whether there should be a particular kind of educational system in that area <e> <s> i think therefore that there is a very good reason to have a great deal of consultation <e>", "<cs> with respect i did not say that we could not trust the local government system nor is there anything in this amendment which in any way detracts from representative government i am a total believer in and supporter of representative government <e> <s> what i tried to say and what i believe is that in dealing with any particular single subject in the case of a body which is elected representatively on issues across a much wider field it is a very good thing to add to the representative nature of the democracy by special consultations in that particular field to find out what people want and take specific advice in connection with that particular point as opposed to the whole spectrum of what kind of complexion of government a particular council wants <e> <s> that seems a thoroughly different matter and in the spirit of this amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to say a few words on the constitutional issue <e> <s> no one will pretend that it is a particularly earth-shaking case and i entirely accept the point put by the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge and other noble lords that there is a significant constitutional difference between rejecting the second reading of the bill and a wrecking amendment which completely emasculates the bill and sends it back to the commons <e> <s> nevertheless i agree with the noble viscount lord eccles <e> <s> although i have not been as long as he has in this house i have been here some years <e> <s> i cannot think of a serious attempt having been made to return a bill in this particular way <e> <s> it is probably going outside the bounds of what we accept in this house <e>", "<cs> i should like to emphasise my belief in representative local government by saying that i think that the noble baroness lady young is entirely right on the question of what we must leave to local authorities <e> <s> if the opposition really are to press the amendment i think that i will be voting with the conservatives on an educational matter for the first time in the whole of my life <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble baroness lady bacon made a very good speech in favour of this amendment even though she seemed to be disclaiming her signature <e> <s> not only did she point out one of the very bad cases which occur of difficulty in transferring but also in the reference she made about headmasters and headmistresses of grammar schools who do not want to accept pupils from secondary modern schools and although there may not be many there are undoubtedly some she pointed out something which needs psychologically to be broken down <e> <s> one of the worst things that happen in the division of schools under the non-comprehensive system is this feeling of we of the grammar schools which in fact is not matched by a corresponding pride of we of the secondary modern <e> <s> if only we could have found some way of making a parity of esteem it would have been much better <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that some of us can really accept either of the points which the noble baroness lady young is making <e> <s> on the first one about provision for transfer between schools i admit that there is an arguable case on both sides though i think that in putting forward this amendment a lot of us had in mind the really appalling difficulties that have been found in the past in seeing that this happened <e> <s> the noble baroness spoke rather as if everything went smoothly and children were transferred when they needed to be <e> <s> we know from speeches made at the committee stage that the system does not always work well and the contribution of the noble baroness lady bacon gave us an example of that <e> <s> back in the days when there was selection universally many were the horror stories about the difficulty of getting children changed from one type of school to another when it was necessary <e> <s> a very great deal of that has disappeared over the years because of the comprehensive system <e> <s> but where that system does not apply there are still difficulties and there is probably still a need for that to be in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly would join in the gratitude extended to the noble lord lord montagu of beaulieu for having produced for our debate this evening this very important topic which thank goodness <e> <s> we in this house do have time to take notice of <e> <s> i think we have a particular duty at this moment to pass on a message to the minister for the arts that we do understand the very real problems which he faces <e> <s> i do not think there is much dispute that with britain in its present state a certain amount of pulling-in the belt is needed and it is totally unrealistic to think that the arts can escape any cuts that are to be made <e> <s> all we can hope and pray for is that the cuts will not be disproportionate <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the element in grant aid which is in theory for museums but which at the moment goes into the whole block of grant aid and is spread around the country without differentiation between where there are museums and where there are not <e> <s> i am suggesting that money should be separated and separately allocated <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i am very grateful for that help <e> <s> the third point which i should like to <e>", "<cs> my lords i put down my name to speak on this bill in a spirit of gentle inquiry because it appeared to me rather enigmatic and an enigma not the easier to penetrate because on consulting all the various animal welfare societies i could not discover that they could see much point in it or had been consulted about it or knew anything at all about it <e> <s> their reaction tended to be one of mild hostility if only because your lordships and parliament in general will be discussing a major bill dealing with a number of subjects including the welfare of wild animals over the course of the next few months <e> <s> this appeared in some way to detract unnecessarily from it <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> my lords since i had not by convention sat down and since i have not urged rejection of the noble lords bill i shall have time to consider that point before we come to the committee stage <e> <s> i should be very surprised if this matter could not be fitted into the bill although i accept that the government department may not at this particular moment wish it to be incorporated into the bill <e> <s> that is a slightly different matter <e> <s> perhaps we could look at that afterwards <e> <s> meanwhile i give about half a cheer for this bill as i sit down <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord lord kennet for initiating this extremely important debate <e> <s> it is true that we have discussed this subject two or three times over the last few years but each time we discuss it it seems to me that it deals with topics which are becoming more and more important <e> <s> we have at least three of the major interests of the immediate future for this country involved in maritime matters <e> <s> fish is an extremely important part of the diet of a great many countries of the world and as the numbers in the world become greater and as the amount of food becomes less per person as unfortunately it shows signs of doing the conservation and the <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord davies of leek has said this has been a very fine debate indeed and a great amount of information has passed <e> <s> it is i suppose a notable debate concerning the largest education bill that we have had since the butler act and it is a great pleasure and privilege that we have had the benefit of a speech from the noble lord lord butler of saffron walden <e> <s> this is particularly so for me as i virtually had my first education in his house <e> <s> when my mother died when i was seven the noble lord which he was not at that time and his wife took me in and for a short time i was educated with his sons <e> <s> i do not think that either of us ever looked forward towards a day when i would be winding up for the liberals in the house of lords in a debate in which he had taken part <e> <s> i shall not detain the house long at this time of night <e> <s> there are just three or four points i want briefly to take up <e> <s> they are matters on which we on these benches will be seeking to amend the bill or on which we wish to ask questions and there is one matter i shall discuss at slightly greater length <e>", "<cs> my lords we very much welcome this <e>", "<cs> we too on these benches are concerned about this matter and would support this amendment but we would withhold our judgment until we hear what the government have to say <e> <s> the relationship of any special schools and the ordinary educational system is very much in the melting pot at the moment as the noble baroness had told us before <e> <s> while i think it is an immense pity that we have not been able to deal with these matters while this bill is going through nevertheless we must look carefully at the various arguments <e> <s> in principle i am sure that this amendment should be supported widely throughout the chamber <e>", "<cs> i am extremely grateful to the noble baroness the minister <e> <s> i am sure that this is an improvement <e> <s> i did not at any stage consider that my drafting or the insertion at this point were necessarily right and i look forward to the amendment which the government will bring forward on report <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> there is a great deal in what the noble lord has said as one would expect of someone with his great experience but i think the case that he has so ably deployed is in fact a rather backward-looking one <e> <s> there are enormous difficulties in producing a popularly controlled and democratically elected number of people to serve on these bodies but we think that the forward way is the way which was recommended in the report of the taylor committee <e> <s> we think that because it is quite clear that over the last or years citizens of this country and not just of the middle classes have been becoming more and more interested in having some real say in the institutions which govern their lives <e>", "<cs> if the minister hopes that the debate and the fact that this amendment has been put forward will encourage such people to come forward and encourage people to appoint them how much more so would that be the case if this were written into the bill <e> <s> i am not entirely happy with the wording of the amendment it is not just the needs of industry and agriculture although of course it includes those because it concerns the needs of the children to know about these things and perhaps at a later stage we could have another look at the wording <e> <s> nevertheless this is an important amendment and the minister has not answered it <e> <s> maximum flexibility would in no way be impaired by acceptance of the amendment nor can we leave it to the local authorities as anyone who looks round some of the local authorities and their appointments will be aware <e> <s> i therefore hope the amendment will be pressed to a division <e>", "<cs> i accept what the minister says <e> <s> i had a feeling when drafting the amendment that i did not fully understand the clause <e> <s> however i hope that the committee will have some sympathy with me <e> <s> i am delighted that the government have covered the point in the bill <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps the committee will take notice of the fact that i said not moved before the noble baroness spoke so that i do not have to come back quite so soon after dinner <e>", "<cs> it may be for the assistance of the committee if i say that we on these benches are not entirely happy with the government response to our amendments and therefore we think it right to divide this argument as it is divided on the order paper into two because if we do not get the right response we are prepared to divide the committee on both sections <e> <s> there are certain matters which i would adduce in reply to the ministers comments on amendment no <e> <s> paragraphs <e>", "<cs> it is not our intention to test this in the lobbies tonight <e> <s> i think that after the last exchange it is surely right that we should give the government time to go away and think <e> <s> this committee has shown in the speeches that we are not at all partisan <e> <s> there is a very real point here and a very real feeling that there should be something written into the bill to give guidelines to encourage those authorities which have the right ideas and to discourage those which have the wrong ones <e> <s> the noble lord lord james said that to write into the bill that people on the governing bodies should have special knowledge of educational matters and should have personal links with the relevant schools and live in the immediate neighbourhood of the schools was as platitudinous as to say that they should be clean honest and sober <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness lady young has just produced an extremely good reason for supporting this amendment <e> <s> if there are really going to be three parents and three teachers let us have it <e>", "<cs> at the moment all the noble baroness is <e>", "<cs> when the noble lord lord donaldson puts on his angry act it is usually rather disingenuous <e> <s> quite often it is a way of distinguishing between the pure motives which no doubt distinguish him from some of the less pure motives from the benches behind him <e> <s> i wish to substantiate that statement <e> <s> it is not that he is seeking to lay blame on the benches behind him but he is wishing to distract our attention from what is being said on the benches behind him <e> <s> listening to the speeches that have been made from the back benches of the labour party it is amazing how many of them have been about how this provision will in fact be a nuisance to the authorities <e> <s> on these benches we are much more interested that it should be an advantage to the parents <e> <s> the noble lord lord donaldson and other members of the labour benches know perfectly well that when we talk about freedom of choice and it merely means freedom by the purse we are on their side and we vote with them because we know that when it is put forward it is a sham <e> <s> however it seems to us that as regards the particular case which is being put forward by the government there is genuine choice only for a limited number of people and only partial choice under regulations <e> <s> but of course what more could it be <e> <s> it is a genuine extension of choice and if there is a division we shall vote with the government <e>", "<cs> i must say that before the noble lord got up to speak i was inclined to support the government because i thought that the amendment would not have any effect <e>", "<cs> no i am sorryi am not going to rise to that bait <e> <s> the noble lord myself and other noble lords who are speaking in this debate have been over this time and time again <e> <s> i have argued the straight comprehensive system against him before now and i am prepared to do it again but i do not honestly think that this is the time to do it <e>", "<cs> i should be interested whether the noble <e>", "<cs> the minister has not answered the specific question i asked how does she think parents can be satisfied with an appeals committee which has a majority representing those who made the original decision <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble viscount will forgive me <e> <s> i bow to him but i would like to put the official liberal view which will be very short and then the noble viscount can proceed <e> <s> the noble earl lord swinton does me an injustice when he says that i would be surprised about the small number of appeals <e> <s> i know there are any number of really good authorities where the unofficial or official appeal system works extremely well and i have absolutely no doubt that his is one <e> <s> equally i have no doubt that the government are absolutely right to establish some kind of formal appeal system which is written into the bill <e> <s> there are plenty of things which may be wrong with it partly because it may be almost impossible to have a bill which is absolutely rightbut i am certain that it is better to have one appeal system even if it is imperfect than to have none at all <e>", "<cs> the noble viscount lord ridley put forward an extremely good reason just now for keeping in this subsection not that i have anything against welsh members of county councils as your lordships will understandindeed i would not dare to in the presence of those who are with us tonight <e> <s> but i think it would be right that the chairman of the appeal committee should not only not be a member of the education committee but indeed should not be a member of the council <e>", "<cs> since we have been appealed to i must say that for various reasons we think that the schedule is imperfect although the reasons would very often be diametrically opposite to those held by the labour front bench <e> <s> however the fact that we think that it is in some ways imperfect will i think move us to look more closely at it at the report stage and not to oppose it <e>", "<cs> we are all grateful to the noble lord lord wells-pestell for his constructive suggestion because this is a unique <e>", "<cs> my lords may i intervene to ask whether that is the end of that part of the noble lords analysis <e>", "<cs> my lords in that case would the noble lord give way when he has finished that part <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord but this really will not do <e> <s> we are not talking about forecasts being wrong anyone can be wrong in his forecast <e> <s> we are talking about a situation where every single time that a forecast has been challenged by independent people with the proper resources and working with forecasting material the departments forecasts have been shown to be wrong and have been accepted as wrong by the inspector <e> <s> this has happened not once or twice out of times but on every single occasion <e> <s> in those circumstances the public has a right to say that there should be a second opinion <e>", "<cs> i do not my lords i accept it <e>", "<cs> my lords i would thank all noble lords who have spoken particularly the noble lord lord mishcon who i think put this in its context <e> <s> i really am appalled at one or two of the replies we have had from the government benches <e> <s> i think the tone was set by the courteously phrased remarks of the noble lord diagonally opposite to me who said that in the schools of which he had been a governor there had not been any doubt that this happened <e> <s> i know this is so <e> <s> the noble lord lord derwent seemed to think that the amendment meant nothing <e> <s> admittedly it is not a prescriptive amendment but it does mean something because unknown to a lot of noble lords on those benches there are plenty of schools in this country where the governors do not include anyone who knows anything about educational matters nor anyone who is even a vague relation of any child within that school nor anyone who would be seen dead living in the immediate neighbourhood which means the catchment area of that school because the people who are appointed are not the people who live in those rundown areas and who send their children to those schools <e> <s> that is absolutely true and really it should be taken into consideration <e> <s> but having said all that it is quite clear that the government are <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to be able to be the first to thank the noble lord lord vaizey for having raised this matter with us tonight <e> <s> we know of his work with the committees of the gulbenkian foundation and also some of us know of other work that he does in the arts world helping the proliferation of the arts and helping others and we are grateful to him <e> <s> i think we ought also to express our thanks for the immense help which the gulbenkian foundation has given to the arts in this country and to this subject in particular <e> <s> i think it is right to say that our discussion tonight would not be half as informed as i hope it will be if it had not been for them <e> <s> although unfortunately some noble lords have had to remove their names from the list we have a distinguished list of speakers and we are delighted to see the name of the noble viscount lord chandos who is about to make his maiden speech <e>", "<cs> as i did my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister very much for his explanation of the bill <e> <s> may i be allowed to say since by some chance it is the first time that i have been speaking on a matter of which the minister was in charge how much <e>", "<cs> will the minister give way <e> <s> from the interchanges that we have just had perhaps the minister would undertake to consider as he has already very generously and rightly agreed to do as regards the later amendments at the same time the differences between the two types of amendment which the noble lord lord hylton has just pointed out so that we can come back with the whole principle at a later stage <e> <s> if he did that surely the noble lord lord hylton and the noble baroness lady birk would be prepared to withdraw <e>", "<cs> i do not really think that the first argument put forward by the noble lord the minister is very satisfactory i mean the one about the inconsistency of decisions <e> <s> there are times on this bill when i listen to the conservative front bench and i really think i am listening to the labour party at its worst <e> <s> they are always for centralism <e> <s> they always appear to want to take away any decision from the local sphere <e> <s> of course if you give decisions to the local sphere contesting decisions may be inconsistent <e> <s> there may be things one would not want and they will be different in different parts of the country <e> <s> they may even be as the noble lord said different in very narrow areas close by each other but that is one of the prices to pay for popular democracy and that is one of the few good things that i thought the conservative party was putting forward at the last election and in its present philosophy <e> <s> as we go through this bill more more and more <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble lord is not being entirely logical in his approach quite apart from the fact that if it was the nth time he said it it must by definition be the last time because you cannot have anything after infinity <e> <s> however that is a purely lighthearted after dinner debating point <e>", "<cs> i am not unhappy <e> <s> i take the noble lords point <e> <s> with the leave of the committee i will withdraw this amendment <e> <s> i will try and at first sight it does not appear totally impracticable to come back at report stage with an amendment which will catch the people who make distant <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount lord thurso very much regrets that he is unable to be here today <e> <s> he has already been down as your lordships know for the scottish housing bill and he was not able to be here today <e> <s> i am to a certain extent speaking on his behalf although not as eloquently as he would <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to make heavy weather over this and in any case there is nothing we can do about it <e> <s> i accept the noble lords assurance which deals with the reservation i had but it does not actually appear in the bill it does not say it is the owner or occupier with shooting rights <e> <s> what will happen if an occupier say the forestry commission which was instanced by the noble lord who does not have the shooting rights gives the kind of permission envisaged in the bill <e> <s> is there any reason why he should not <e> <s> the statute law says he may <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord will write to me if he does not have an immediate answer <e> <s> as i say it is an academic point at this stage of the bill although it might be as well to clear it up <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that the whole house will be extremely grateful to the noble earl lord kinnoull for having asked this question <e> <s> i am sure that everybody here in what looks a rather slim house unfortunately will be wholeheartedly grateful to him because the theatre is not only one of the great glories of britains culture these days it is also an immense fund of satisfaction and help to a great many of your lordships and a great many people in britain today <e> <s> i think we must try to do as much as we can to keep it that way because as the noble earl lord kinnoull said our theatre is probably the best in the world at the moment and the most diverse <e> <s> it is also a great earner of money both in tourism and in what it sells abroad by way of the prestige it gives to the kind of plays which are now being written for television by some of the playwrights who have served their apprenticeship in the theatre which plays again are sold abroad <e> <s> the profits to this country not just monetary but monetary as well are enormous <e>", "<cs> my lords i humbly beg the noble and learned lords pardon <e> <s> it was totally inadvertent and i apologise profusely <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may clear this up <e> <s> of course it pays vat in the same way <e> <s> the point that i was making was that a larger proportion of its income comes from grants therefore it sells at lower prices and it does not pay vat on the portion of its income that it gets from grants <e> <s> that was the point that i was making <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord very much for that <e> <s> the noble lord can pass on now from the compliments of the noble lord lord davies of leek who said that he worked like a lion <e> <s> in fact lions do no work at all they lie <e>", "<cs> my lords we too should like to thank the minister for repeating the statement and on the whole welcome the idea of a new nationality law which will bring some consistency into a very complicated field <e> <s> in particular we very much welcome what appears to be a complete absence of sex discrimination which will be a considerable step forward although in this context i would join with the noble lord lord boston in asking about the question of fiancs and fiances <e> <s> the question of wives and mothers is a fairly clear one <e> <s> that of fiancs and fiances is not entirely so <e> <s> we cannot from these benches think that this idea of dividing not only as suggested by the labour green paper into sheep and goats into sheep and two kinds of goats is a very good one <e>", "<cs> my lords it is slightly better than nothing <e> <s> thank you very much <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord bellwin for explaining this bill in his speech <e> <s> he is a very brave man to have not even yet fully emerged from the housing bill and to be embarking on this one <e> <s> my noble friend lord evans of claughton is made of less stern stuff <e> <s> he has departed on engagements previously entered into and i am taking his place rather humbly this afternoon although he will be taking charge of the efforts from these benches during the committee stage <e> <s> we welcome the debate that is to be held this afternoon and we look forward particularly to the maiden speech of the noble lord lord grimston of westbury and expect that his experience in this field will help us not only on this occasion when he will of course be uncontroversial if indeed one can be uncontroversial on this bill which i doubt but during the committee and report stages <e>", "<cs> my lords i find it slightly difficult to follow every single clause through all the stages of this very complicated bill <e> <s> did i understand the minister to say that on this <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that in the years i have been in the house i have ever known the house divide on exactly the same amendment at two successive stages <e> <s> i do not think that this is a precedent we should set and i ask the opposition front bench to think again <e>", "<cs> my lords if it removed all the defects from this bill it would be a great deal longer <e>", "<cs> my lords i am overcome by a sense of <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a very important statement <e> <s> i do not feel that we have a great deal of time to go into its intricacies this afternoon although i am sure that noble lords will want to raise the matter very very fully in the immediate future <e> <s> i have therefore only one comment to make and one question to ask <e> <s> the comment is that it is a very strange world and a very strange form of economics that we appear to work under when with unemployment at over million the secretary of state can boast to parliament about the number of jobs that he has killed and the number of jobs that he proposes to kill in the immediate future <e>", "<cs> my lords in reverting to the bill it is a pleasant duty to be able to thank the noble lord lord bellwin wholeheartedly for his exposition of it <e> <s> we particularly look forward today to two maiden speeches <e> <s> i suppose it must be rare that in this house we get such a good bag as a brace of yorkshire earls though possibly on this occasion it might be inaccurate as well as improper to refer to them as the right and the left <e>", "<cs> my lords those whom i represent on these benches very much welcome the reintroduction of the bill <e> <s> i had the honour and pleasure to serve on the committee and it was a most interesting and fruitful experience <e> <s> we owe much to the hard work and the peace-making faculties of the noble earl lord halsbury and of course to the chairmanship of the noble lord lord ashby whom we very much look forward to hearing during the debate <e> <s> it was a considerable achievement that a unanimous report and therefore a unanimous draft bill were produced at the end of the day particularly since the whole bill had been completely redrafted from top to bottom in the course of the proceedings <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper and may i take this opportunity to wish noble lords a happy and prosperous new year <e>", "<cs> my lords while i thank the noble earl for that helpful and hopeful answer may i ask whether he agrees that in view of the ongoing energy crisis there is a very forceful case for trying out with full-scale trials any experiment which seems likely to succeed <e>", "<cs> this is in effect a very small bill <e> <s> it has plenty to be modest about but it is not very modest in the sense that it has the very grand title of energy conservation bill <e> <s> the noble earl the minister will note that there is an amendment down later to change the title of the bill to something which is more suitable having regard to what the government have included in it <e>", "<cs> the noble earl has put the case very persuasively but i do not think he has really covered it <e> <s> let me assure the noble lord lord monson that no quango is the slightest bit involved <e> <s> by definition i think the secretary of state cannot himself be a quango <e> <s> it is he whom we are suggesting should do the things which are necessary here <e> <s> nor i think are we talking about any great sum of money <e> <s> we know that a certain amount of study of potential energy savings has been done already <e> <s> to turn that into a national one by extrapolation and other techniques would not cost very much <e> <s> nor would determining the obstacles nor would establishing a target nor would formulating proposals and policies <e> <s> what we come up against here is a straight division between the government and certainly those of us who occupy both sets of benches on this side of the committee <e> <s> we think this is an absolutely genuine matter where the government should be making a survey and not just leaving it to developments which no doubt will happen and will have some effect through the course of the market economy and through the new inventions which the noble earl spoke about <e> <s> i was most interested in what he was saying <e> <s> this is a question where we differ on what should be in this bill <e> <s> there is no point in disguising it and i suggest that we test the opinion of the house <e>", "<cs> i am not totally convinced by the noble earls arguments <e> <s> it seems to me that he has not at all put up a case against making this amendment except that it is unnecessary and i do not think he has proven that entirely <e> <s> i still think that to give the cegb a statutory duty in this field would be a useful step <e> <s> but i do not think that it is worth arguing about <e> <s> i appreciate that the government are going forward in this

argument to convince us i thought it would be a little more persuasive than that <e> <s> i thought he would be pulling a rabbit out of a hat <e> <s> incidentally the fact that the noble lord lord strabolgi very kindly refers to me as his noble friend does not mean that the noble earl the minister should presume that there are only two parties in the house <e> <s> the tendency in politics at

of the committee <e> <s> however may i ask the noble earl the minister to look tomorrow at <e>", "<cs> my name appears to have crept on to this amendment by mistake probably mine which does not mean i

this point which he referred to in his last sentence <e> <s> i say that in passing but we are reaching one of the key parts of the bill which will come up time and time again that in the last resort

about the rights of the owner or occupier shall be overridden <e> <s> i entirely agree with my noble friends that compensation is important but compensation is written into the amendment <e> <s> perhaps we should look again at the whole question of compensation and survey it <e>", "<cs> i should like to make one quickpoint because i think that there is a little misunderstanding <e> <s> certainly the noble lord lord melchett and i seem to differ slightly on the construction of the amendments that he has put forward and i have put my name to as well as the noble viscount lord thurso

no <e> <s> is not passed then amendment no <e> <s> will be moved <e> <s> the fact that they are discussed together has rather led us into a false trap <e> <s> amendments nos <e> <s> and together do not work but they are alternatives and possible ways of solving the same problem <e>", "<cs> he will have got a robin <e>", "<cs> the contempt of the noble lord lord mackie is something which we would

reasonable amendment and possibly the one to be preferred when we come back to it <e> <s> but i do not think this is the time to test the feeling of the committee on this <e> <s> indeed it is something about which we ought to think further <e> <s> it seems to me something where an amendment is definitely needed <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my

we are always told that the british people are not prepared to pay for the abolition of cruelty <e> <s> if it is put to them they are and that argument against it does not stand up at all <e> <s> noble lords are quite right to want to press on with what this bill was actually intended for <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord melchett put the point correctly <e> <s> the matter should be looked at again and i am delighted that the minister said he would do that <e> <s> although the noble earl said that another measure dealt with the treatment of birds in the course of conveyance it may be necessary to insert a provision in this bill to deal with birds while travelling <e> <s> knowing the matter will be looked at i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> may i pick up one small point that the noble lord the minister made <e> <s> i do not know whether it was a freudian slip or not but it is certainly worth correcting <e> <s> in his first speech on this subject the noble lord said that he was giving the benefit of the doubt to the birds <e> <s> he is not giving the benefit of the doubt to the birds he is giving it to the bird fanciers and that is a different thing entirely <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask why the whole of schedule part ii is not included in schedule part ii which would be remarkably more simple

small simplification in what is a complicated series of schedules <e>", "<cs> no the noble lord misunderstood me <e> <s> i am suggesting that it should be permissible for all the birds listed in schedule part ii those are the birds which may be killed or taken by authorised persons at all times to be sold dead at all times as dealt with in schedule part ii <e> <s> i am not suggesting they should be sold alive <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to detain the committee any longer perhaps the noble lord will write to me but i should like him to explain if lie can the thinking behind the european convention which allows us to make rules providing that these birds may be killed by authorised persons at all times but may not be sold dead at all times <e> <s> no doubt there is a reason for that and i hope the noble lord will write and tell me what the reason is but the imagination boggles <e>", "<cs> i accept what the minister has said <e> <s> i think that this amendment may have been useful

necessity of keeping them on large hill areas is also valid and that the amendment as it stands is not one which we should support <e>", "<cs> one just cannot win in this chamber or in parliament <e>

another opportunity or the government are prepared to have another look at it <e> <s> for those years we usually endure in silence not necessarily in silence but we endure <e>", "<cs> in effective speech as the noble lord says <e> <s> then when by chance it so happens that a bill comes within whose long title this amendment which it is agreed by all can absolutely rightly fall without in any way infringing the constitutional proprieties we are told that it is not suitable <e> <s> i do not think that is a good enough answer <e> <s> this is an inspired use of this bill for doing something we all want to see done <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will take it away to look at it and then bring it back again and say yes <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the government for accepting this amendment and very happy to leave to them the business of working out in what alphabetical order this list should appear <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i too would like to congratulate the government on deciding not to break up ilea <e> <s> we on these benches only wish they had similar sense about some of their other policies <e> <s> we are sympathetic to them

they have to make ilea more responsible to the electors of london <e> <s> will they consider the possibility of having separate elections for the authority preferably by a sane method of election <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl has produced a number of heavy arguments some of which are very much the same as he produced before <e> <s> but that is not surprising because presumably <e>", "<cs> may i just say with great respect that i think the noble lord lord houghton got his last intervention slightly wrong <e> <s> in fact this amendment deals with products whereas the next amendment deals only with living animals <e> <s> the noble lord lord mowbray raised the very important question of the danger to innocent people <e> <s> i am very well aware of this problem and would not wish to widen unnecessarily the number of cases in which the burden or proof is on the ordinary person <e>", "<cs> of course noble lords who are in favour of this amendment welcome the increasing designation of ports for specific licences <e> <s> that is very useful and i am delighted that it is being done <e> <s> it probably achieves a lot but the government have said nothing although the noble earl was making faces across the chamber which makes me want to withdraw this amendment <e> <s> the point validly raised about animals possibly suffering because they come to ports where they are not allowed to come is i am sure true <e> <s> but i am quite clear that it will be well outweighed by the growing proportion of animals which come to designated ports and therefore are well looked after and do not run into the kind of problems that we have heard about at other ports and other airfields <e>", "<cs> indeed <e> <s> of course there will be problems but they will be less if this amendment is passed very considerably less than if it is not passed <e> <s> i do not take the other main point which was made about clandestine smuggling <e> <s> all right it may be that there will be some <e> <s> i do not know quite what the government have in mind <e> <s> if they are speaking about clandestine smuggling at ports of entry other than the designated ones it is difficult to see why it should be any more so than it is at the moment and the chances of discovering a boa constrictor tucked away in someones suitcase will be exactly the same as they are now <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord would care to expand on that <e> <s> what kind of difficulties have they had <e>", "<cs> if i may continue with my argument about clandestine smuggling if the noble lord is saying that this will be not at normal ports of entry but by motor boats from the french coast or something like that i do not see that that would be any more encouraged if this amendment is passed than if it is not <e> <s> i must admit that i am intrigued by what the noble lord the minister says about american experience <e> <s> i wish we had been given greater information about this it seems to me very germane to the governments case and after all it is they who are putting this bill forward <e> <s> i am surprised that they have not thought fit to enlarge upon this particular argument <e>", "<cs> i am delighted that we should consider it at the same time if that meets the wishes of your lordships committee <e> <s> mine is a more general and probing amendment <e> <s> there is this worrying remark statement sentence at the beginning of clause <e>", "<cs> yes indeed i am grateful to the noble earl and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for that assurance and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> if the statutory maximum is an inflation-linked sum and yet it is the highest fine that can be imposed the government appear to have got themselves into rather a difficult situation <e> <s> one can quite well see that it is in some ways in the interests of justice that fines can be worked on a different scale with four different scales depending on the gravity of the offence and that these can be tied to inflation in such a way that we do not have to go on passing bills the whole time <e> <s> on the other hand you have a very difficult situation where as is occurring now the profit to be made from a crime which is not in itself one that you would necessarily put in the absolute top category is such that just one of these crimes successfully committed just once will produce a larger profit than the fine <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord is to take this back and look at everything including the remarks made by the noble lord lord melchett i should like him to consider whether or not animal is or is not included at the moment <e> <s> at the risk of sounding sentimental i do not think that we should encourage the giving of powers for the confiscation of say peoples dogs <e> <s> i have no sympathy with poachers and the kind of people who prey on the rare species we are talking about in the bill but there are certain <e>", "<cs> i still stand by my remarks which were purely personal and have nothing to do with my party which on this extremely important point has no policy on it <e>", "<cs> parts of that reply seem extremely satisfactory with regard to the number of reports which will be published <e> <s> but i should like to ask why the secretary of states hands should not be tied in order to publish something <e> <s> the noble earl did not produce a single reason why this should not happen <e> <s> it seems to me to be a very good idea <e> <s> however i suppose that it is not all that germane as the other alternative arrangements are satisfactory <e> <s> it is exactly typical of what the noble earl lord onslow was saying governments saying we must not have our hands tied by having to publish material for the benefit of the public <e> <s> it is an instinctive reaction and it is to be deprecated <e>", "<cs> although it is a much more minor point i should like to know whether subsection means anything at all <e> <s> presumably even if it were not included in the bill the secretary of state would be able to consult such persons or bodies as be thought fit <e> <s> with that subsection included in the bill as i see it he need not consult any persons or bodies if he does not see fit <e> <s> has the subsection any purpose whatever <e>", "<cs> he can do that anyway <e>", "<cs> i think that this is a symbolic amendment <e> <s> i should certainly like to support it <e> <s> i think that we shall have to see in the future and it will be a very good thing too a major change in the relationship of agriculture as it is seen by government to environment preservation as it is seen by government <e> <s> we spend a very great deal of money piling up food mountains under the eecs common agricultural policy when we could be spending exactly the same money paying farmers to produce a little less and to preserve the countryside <e> <s> as it is we expect them to do a very great deal without giving them much incentive <e> <s> i have every feeling for those farmers who experience that problem and every admiration for those farmers who in spite of the fact that they get no reward for it do their duty by the countryside <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord melchett was swift in withdrawing his amendment no <e> <s> and i wanted to raise a small point on that part of the clause <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble earl when re-considering amendment no <e> <s> which is what i understood him to say would consider that the right time is that which is included in that amendment plus the possibility that it should be perfectly all right for the landowner to get compensation even if he had not used the land in that way for years if he could produce any evidence at all from the time before the notice was served that he intended to use this land in this way <e> <s> that is an extra matter that it might be useful for the government to consider <e>", "<cs> it would be interesting to know if in addition to the colour plate of the barn there was also a colour plate of the limestone pavement from where the stone had been taken <e> <s> i am not at all satisfied with the noble lords explanation <e> <s> i felt it was through no fault of his extremely specious and did not stand up <e> <s> on the other hand his noble friend lord middleton raised a point which had not occurred to me and i will study that point before possibly returning to this issue on report <e>", "<cs> i had not got that far <e> <s> it is my fault i should have picked up this point since the noble baroness did not in fact move amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> since the noble baroness lady david does not wish to withdraw amendment no <e> <s> i shall help her by making certain that her amendment is grammatically all right by not withdrawing amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i want very briefly to support this amendment <e> <s> when town and country planning was first brought in one of the reasons why agriculture was exempt was that very little was changing in the countryside <e> <s> there had been of course the upheaval of the war the ploughing of all the old leys and the changes that had come from intensive food production <e> <s> but things were in a way going back to what they had been before the war and no one in the late s early s visualised the kind of extreme changes we are seeing in the countryside today <e> <s> even as recently as the kind of change that has happened over the last years was not foreseen <e> <s> the figures we have already heard for hedge removal in huntingdonshire provide one absolutely outstanding example <e>", "<cs> i had made a note that i would accept the point the noble lord lord sandys made about subsection of the proposed new clause but in view of the intervention of the noble lord lord melchett i shall not do that <e> <s> i am in a way sad that i have not had more support from noble lords on other benches <e> <s> i was hoping that for example the noble lord lord stanley of alderley and the noble earl lord caithness would be leaping to their feet to support me and i am glad the noble earl lord radnor did <e>", "<cs> we would agree with the minister on this <e> <s> i think these two amendments the one at present being considered and the next one to be moved by the noble lord lord mottistone are an extremely good example of the contrary influences on this bill <e> <s> a very great deal of work and negotiation of one kind or another has gone into the drafting of the bill not just in government offices but in the whole consideration of the matter over the last few years <e> <s> on the whole an extremely sensible result has been arrived at and i am sure the government are right to resist the amendments on both sides <e>", "<cs> we on these benches would also very much like to support this amendment <e> <s> i do not think there is any need to add to what the noble lord lord nugent has said so ably <e> <s> the first subsection will not cost much money and should be embarked on at once <e> <s> with regard to the second subsection i think the time-scale given that the work should be initiated within years is absolutely right <e> <s> it gets away from the point about spending money now in the depression <e> <s> i may point out that if the government turn this down for a period of up to years because of expense it will be a vote of no confidence in their own plans for our economic recovery <e> <s> i am sure they would not want to do that and so i am sure they will accept this amendment <e>", "<cs> i understand by a rather circuitous route that there is some slight doubt as to whether my amendments to both of which i propose to speak together are completely in order <e> <s> i can <e>", "<cs> i thank noble lords for their interest in the amendments and i am particularly grateful for the support of the noble lord lord somers urging me on <e> <s> i do think something ought to be done about this <e> <s> the government say there are not very many examples of it happening apart from goldfish <e> <s> i think there probably are quite a few <e> <s> the rspca certainly seems to think it is a problem which ought to be dealt with <e> <s> i do not think it necessarily needs sanctions i do not think that would be a fault in the amendments <e> <s> i think very often in these matters all you need to do is to go along to the promoter of the lottery and say look this is against the law <e> <s> i do not think you need any sanctions they would immediately withdraw it whereas it is a bit more difficult to go and argue the ethical toss when they say children in this part of the world know how to look after their pets <e>", "<cs> my lords if the government do not wish to encourage this amendment they are certainly doing their best not to encourage it <e> <s> i am sure that neither the noble lord lord melchett nor myself would want to be understood to say that we thought that wildfowlers did not contribute an immense amount to preservation <e> <s> we know that over a long period of time that is absolutely true and that those of us who are interested in wildlife owe a very great debt of gratitude to those who over the years have been interested in this particular form of sport <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to the noble earl for the trouble that he has taken to meet us on this point <e>", "<cs> my lords this is one of a number of cases in the bill where this question of ultimate compulsion comes up <e> <s> it is a question which in principle was settled about years ago when the railway acts first started coming in that where one person wishes to hold out among a large number of others who are prepared to be compensated for something which is for the public good there should in the last resort be an element of compulsion <e> <s> all parties have gone along with this <e> <s> this is not a very extreme case <e> <s> what we are talking about is basically shooting rights and i would not have thought there would be any difficulty with due respect to the noble lord lord stanley in putting some kind of figure on that <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord stanley however that i think possibly there should be some appeal and maybe that could be looked at again if your lordships pass this amendment it is something which could be put in at third reading <e> <s> it seems to me that there is a strong case here for having an ultimate compulsion to take away a small part of peoples rights in a case which really seems worthwhile for the benefit of the whole <e> <s> i think this should be supported <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful <e> <s> this is quite definitely a useful amendment <e> <s> without this amendment there might have been problems and i am delighted to find that the government have been able to find the right solution <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should have liked something stronger and i still do not really understand why we cannot have something stronger <e> <s> it surely is not too much to ask that an owner or occupier of land should have the duty of instructing his employee about certain things which he is not allowed to do <e> <s> many of us on both sides know of cases where employers have quite deliberately kept quiet on such matters knowing what their employees were doing but covertly encouraging it <e> <s> but we could not have that <e> <s> we have put this forward again and i certainly hope that the government will be able to give us a completely positive response either by accepting this amendment or by putting forward their own amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i was a reluctant convert to the cause of this particular amendment to which i have now put my name <e> <s> i had strong reservations as i know my party has on any interference with the doctrine that an englishmans home if not at least his castle is at any rate his home <e> <s> the fact that that right of his to have his home uninvaded and uninterrupted has been broken time and again does not derogate from that <e> <s> one of the very few things <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord and the government for doing all this hard work for sorting it out into alphabetical order and for putting it into the right number <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certainly grateful to the noble lord lord kilbracken for pointing out that the emperor wears no clothes <e> <s> i myself thought he was wearing no clothes but i did not like to say so because i am not as knowledgeable as the noble lord on this subject <e> <s> the noble lord has pointed out where the governments provisions are clearly inadequate and this is the main point that there really is not enough good reason for the kind of measure which they are trying to introduce here <e> <s> they should be able to have a schedule of plants which they can ban as they discover and occasionally it may happen that we shall discover only through sad experience that certain plants are harmful <e> <s> that is absolutely necessary and it is a very good thing that the schedule should be here <e>", "<cs> my lords we too feel like that but perhaps we should reserve our formal thanks until we reach the end of this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to carry this on too long but although we have heard from the liberal benches we have not yet heard from the liberal front bench on this particular matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i will only be very short <e> <s> it is not so that it is only those landowners and farmers who have not been informed that there are sssis and what they are about who have behaved badly and caused some of the wreckage of the sssis i know my noble friend feels very strongly about the cases where this has happened but we all know of other well-documented cases where it has happened and where the farmer or the landowner has known perfectly well and has gone ahead <e> <s> it is that situation that we must deal with <e> <s> if we pass both these amendments we will get the best of both worlds because if the government are right and if their amendment works the second amendment will never need to be used but the second is there as a fallback and it is important that it is a fallback <e>", "<cs> my lords we too would like to express our sympathy to the farmers who have suffered this loss and hope that there will be no more <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord peart basically i feel that our policy on these matters in dealing with outbreaks of foot and mouth disease is the right one <e> <s> may i ask the noble earl whether there is any confirmation of the suggestion as reported in todays papers that the infection was brought in airborne from france <e> <s> is there any means of identifying the virus as one that is of continental origin <e> <s> have we any further information about the source of the infection <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord and i am grateful to the government for having taken this on board <e> <s> as the noble lord lord melchett has said while it does not go quite far enough it was an important thing i think to try to close what was quite clearly a real gap in the law or what could in practice turn out to be a real gap in the law and we are grateful to the government for going quite a long way to meet us <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot find anything in schedule which would need this exemption or which would benefit from being subject to this extra qualification <e> <s> if the noble earl is not able to answer now it would be good to receive an explanation by letter but i should have thought that we ought to have a verbal explanation now <e> <s> on the face of it it looks as though it is modifying something which not only does not need to be modified but which ought not to be modified <e>", "<cs> suitable assurances my lords have been given about the landscape value <e> <s> i think however that without the words of the noble earl people would not necessarily take the word physiographical as meaning anything to do with beauty as such <e> <s> we welcome his assurance that it does include it and that if he receives advice

in order to give thanks himself but as i say he is not able to be here yet <e>", "<cs> my lords this is one of the most important matters in the bill and it is indeed a matter of gratification that the government have seen fit to meet the wishes of your lordships house on this matter <e> <s> we are very grateful to them for the trouble that they have taken and for including this provision <e> <s> i am sure that it is an enormous improvement and that if it had not been put in there would have been a very real sense of justified grievance on the part of a great many people in the countryside

and strengthens the law <e> <s> the government have said that the law is satisfactory as it is <e> <s> it is not quite satisfactory enough in the situation of what i might call dogs loitering with intent <e> <s> there is a need for strengthening the law there and this is a reasonable amendment <e> <s> i just have one major reservation <e> <s> despite what the noble lord lord melchett said i do not think that this in fact covers the case of hounds <e> <s> in fact there was one moment when i thought this was probably an amendment secretly backed by the noble lord lord houghton <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble earl the minister is slightly mixing up two things <e> <s> it is an entirely different case whether one follows or does not follow the advice of the nature conservancy council

everyone has been <e> <s> it is not always justified but with this bill it really has been <e> <s> this bill has done a tremendous amount <e> <s> what is more it has not been the work of just a few

in private affection as in duty bound to thank my noble friends lord winstanley lord foot and lord avebury for their great help during the passage of this bill and i suppose to a certain extent my noble scottish friends for stimulation if nothing else <e>", "<cs> i am surprised that so many noble lords have urged me to withdraw this amendment when in fact in my opening words i announced my intention to do so <e> <s> i see no reason to change my mind <e> <s> of course i shall beg your lordships leave to withdraw this amendment <e> <s> but i think that this little debate has been worthwhile for a number of reasons <e> <s> i was impressed by the argument advanced by the noble lord lord adrian and i must admit that the major point he made had not occurred to me and i imagine had not occurred to the noble earl lord halsbury either as he did not raise it in debate <e> <s> it is an interesting point and i shall obviously look at it <e>", "<cs> i cannot pretend that i am happy with the responses that i have received <e> <s> the noble lord the minister and the noble earl lord halsbury seemed to me to be putting up the kind of smoke screen barrage against amendments which one is used to encountering <e>", "<cs> is there no such thing as a smoke screen barrage <e> <s> well noble lords know what i mean but really there is such a thing as a smoke screen barrage <e> <s> one can lay down smoke shells in front of a position and that is exactly what the noble lord and the noble earl were doing <e> <s> i do not think that the arguments they used are of tremendous import <e> <s> nevertheless i take seriously the fact that for various reasons they do not wish me to proceed with the amendment and that they do not wish to accept it <e>", "<cs> i think this particular amendment has in fact produced a useful debate but i accept the arguments of the noble earl lord halsbury that in fact this amendment is unnecessary because it is in substance covered by the bill <e> <s> i do not as a matter of interest accept his argument about the drafting for reasons which i shall be happy to explain to him outside and will not weary your lordships with but as to the argument about it being unnecessary i think that probably is so and therefore i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble earl is fighting a battle that i did not open <e> <s> he is making a speech in answer to the speech that he thought i was going to make instead of the speech that i made <e> <s> i made it quite clear that i was not putting forward the kind of argument that he suggested but i was asking a question as to what he understood as to the meaning of this bill regarding whether the secretary of state is bound to give a licence in these circumstances or whether he has discretion <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble earl or the minister can answer that <e>", "<cs> the issue is even more complicated by that answer <e> <s> when we get to the stage of considering the governments bill and its relationship to this bill i probably have raised a question which needs a little more elucidation <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> this is a most interesting amendment particularly if it is taken together with the previous one <e> <s> at the end of our discussion on that amendment i did not think we made ourselves clear <e> <s> if the answer to my question was yes the secretary of state has a duty to give a licence to matters which are affected by subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord like to explain what is the difference between openly flouting the law which he said did not happen and breaking it in broad daylight <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to promote the use of refillable beverage containers to prohibit the sale of beverages in non-returnable containers and to provide for regulations to be made to standardise beverage containers <e> <s> i beg to move that the bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mackie has already spoken from these benches on the straightforward approach to the report as it stands <e> <s> i wish to touch on another consideration which is a certain amount that it does not say <e> <s> indeed i want to talk though not for very long on the matters to which the noble lord lord sandford and the noble lord lord walston have already referred <e> <s> some of this is included in the report in paragraphs and and the paragraphs to which the noble lords referred <e> <s> it concerns the social and regional objectives and also the environmental objectives <e> <s> i speak in a way as an ex-member of sub-committee g straying into your lordships deliberations <e>", "<cs> my lords this bill seems to us on these benches to be to a large extent unnecessary although admittedly it covers such a wide range of measures and subjects that some of them are an asset but it is unnecessary with regard to its main purposes and also unacceptable <e> <s> there are a number of reasons for thinking that the major part of this bill is not necessary <e> <s> to start with the secretary of state already has powers under the act a matter which the noble earl the minister mentioned which can be invoked if an authoritys expenditure is considered to be excessive and i believe that those powers have never yet been used <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to express our gratitude to the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby for so ably and fully introducing this bill <e> <s> it is a vast subject covering not only animal welfare but economics and rights of local communities and he has covered the field excellently and well <e> <s> in view of the number of speakers on the list today i do not think that it is for me to try to cover anything like the same ground <e> <s> i shall do my best to be extremely brief because there is one particular point on which the noble lord touched towards the end of his speech which from these liberal benches i wish to underline <e>", "<cs> my lords as we cross the gap on the list of speakers i think there must be an element of relief in some of your lordships minds not that the speeches we have heard have been too long or too many <e> <s> it is a sign of great interest and commitment on the part of a large number of the members of your lordships house that very unusually for a speakers list of this length only one speaker has scratched and the speeches have got no shorter as the afternoon and the evening have gone on <e> <s> that <e>", "<cs> my lords a number of your lordships have suggested that this is not a matter for party speeches <e> <s> nevertheless a number of noble lords have made speeches which were very representative of the philosophies of their various parties <e> <s> and speaking from this bench at the end of the debate on this subject i shall not refrain because my party has over a very long period of time nothing whatever to be ashamed of on this subject <e>", "<cs> my lords we owe a large debt to the noble lord lord craigton for introducing the bill into your lordships house and for the immense amount of work he has put into the subject over a period of years <e> <s> there are of course many others who have put a great deal into it too not least in another place recently and we should express our gratitude to them <e>", "<cs> my lords when this bill first came to your lordships house it was the result of a firmly established compromise which the government had reached between the pressures of two well-recognised and thoroughly respectable groups the environmentalists on the one side and the mine-owners on the other <e> <s> we on these benches like the majority of your lordships house thoroughly approved of the work which had been done behind the scenes to produce an extremely good bill and an agreed step forward in this particular field <e> <s> it was on that basis that my colleagues on these benches and i helped the government to repel any amendments which were put forward by either side <e> <s> all this work having been put into the compromise we thought that it should go forward <e> <s> therefore we consider that it is a great pity that having gone to another place the government have given way on this point <e>", "<cs> there is i think one key question which one can ask the noble baroness at the moment even though one realises that the amendment is not yet drafted nevertheless a great deal of thought must have gone into it and it is this if the parents are not satisfied with the information they get and if they use the procedure which will be produced by an amendment and go and talk to the professionals then having talked to the professionals and having gone through what i might call the process which it may be softens the blow or explains in human <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord hampton is sorry that he cannot be here to speak on this order this evening and i am rising to say that we on these benches welcome this measure as <e>", "<cs> my lords i have two short but i think important points <e> <s> first certainly we welcome this bill and are delighted that it is to pass into law <e> <s> i should like to add our congratulations to the noble lord lord craigton and all others who have worked hard on this bill <e> <s> secondly since the point has been raised in all quarters of the house tonight about the procedure and fate of private members bills i think i can say on behalf of all members of my party that we too feel that the situation is not at all satisfactory when you get private members bills as late in the session as this <e> <s> this is not by any means the only example we have had over the last few years <e> <s> i am not sure what exactly the solution is <e> <s> i am very interested in the one the noble lord lord craigton put forward <e> <s> undoubtedly i think that is a matter which must be taken aboard by the authorities of the house <e> <s> i hope that the attention of the leader of the house and of everyone concerned will be drawn to this matter and we will have some discussions and some movement about it over the next year or so <e> <s> it really is a disgraceful situation that we find ourselves in and for the good of parliament it is right that we should try and mend it and find some solution <e>", "<cs> my lords do i understand from the statement of the noble lord the minister that the sum of will soon be out-of-date and that either the government expect to lose the forthcoming election fairly soon or they are unable to control inflation <e> <s> what other explanation do the government otherwise have for the statement <e>", "<cs> i am very sorry about that last answer from the government <e> <s> i should have thought we had got somewhere today if bearing in mind the reservations which some people have about ordinary schools and about discriminating between the different kinds of pupils we could nevertheless have gone away with some hope that at report stage we could at least establish the case in special schools themselves where there is no serious argument <e> <s> but since we have had no encouragement from the government and i do not wish to waste the time of your lordships house in future by bringing back something which obviously stands no chance of being <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to promote the use of refillable beverage <e>", "<cs> my lords we are approaching the end of an interesting debate on a fascinating subject <e> <s> to a certain extent what i hope to do is to comment on a number of things that have been said in this debate particularly in the field of electoral systems in the hope that some of the statements that have been made will not necessarily remain as gospel truths in your lordships minds or on the pages of <e>", "<cs> i entirely agree that we all have our problems my lords <e> <s> i venture to suggest that the noble lord has rather more problems if he is really interested in the independence of local government than any we are likely to find on the social democratic benches in this place in another place or among those who are shortly to get into another place <e> <s> but it is a valid point which the noble lord makes and i would be the last to claim purity in this matter <e> <s> liberals in this house are regularly saying every week and month we are saying it that we believe in devolution and believe we should give powers to local authorities and leave them there <e> <s> having said that we are used to having other liberals lobbying us and saying but you must make the government do this or you must stop the government doing that <e> <s> we reply but we are in favour of devolution remember to which they reply but not in this particular matter <e> <s> it is true that this is a disease which affects us all <e> <s> i hope it affects my party and i hope it affects the social democrats rather less than it does other parties but it is a disease and i am not fighting against something which rears its head only in one particular party <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> i am delighted to see that so many noble lords are interested in the bill and have put their names down to speak <e> <s> in particular i am sure we are all looking forward to <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the noble lord would not want to give a wrong impression <e> <s> there is general agreement that it will cause some unemployment in the manufacturing industry but over all there is absolutely no doubt that it causes no unemployment whatever <e> <s> it balances out if anything it causes more employment <e> <s> that is the experience in america and is shown in the figures which are accepted in england <e>", "<cs> it was not me my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will allow me to interrupt him quoting again from the <e>", "<cs> my lords at this hour of the night i shall be very brief <e> <s> your lordships have responded well to the plea made by the chief whip and i think we have gained about an hour on the standard time for the number of speakers <e> <s> none the less it has been a good debate with fascinating contributions from several noble lords <e> <s> i was particularly pleased to welcome the maiden speech of my noble friend lord winchilsea and nottingham partly because it is good to have him now having opened his batting on these benches and to know that we can look to him in future for other speeches of that calibre and particularly because i was grateful for an extremely trenchant speech on the side that i was putting forward coming from real experience <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord strabolgi has said this is a money bill and a small bill and as he suggested perhaps a general debate is not entirely appropriate <e> <s> however i think that there are one or two points to be raised on this matter <e> <s> although of course the actual finance raising is none of our business in this house the method that the government have chosen is a rather peculiar one though also a very useful one from their point of view <e> <s> after all the two main ways in which the government raise money for nationalised industries and other matters are through government funding or commercially and in this particular case we have an unfortunate hybrid of the two the third method of a government guarantee <e> <s> this has a considerable advantage for the government in that they are let off the hook of including the money in the psbr <e> <s> furthermore they do not have to persuade the financial institutions that the schemes for which they are raising money are financially sound because the loans for the purpose will have government guarantees behind them <e>", "<cs> my lords the company surely does not have to convince the financial institutions once it has a government guarantee <e> <s> that is quite enough <e> <s> it does not have to say another word <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord the minister for repeating the statement <e> <s> we on these benches give a welcome to the green paper and look forward to studying it in the hope that we shall be able to find and support a system of rating which will give true independence to local authorities all over the country the kind of devolution to which this government paid lip-service when they came to power <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords who have taken part in this debate i should like to thank the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter slightly half-heartedly i must confess but i do particularly thank him for raising the subject because it is a most important one and one which it is absolutely right that your lordships house should debate at this time <e> <s> i also thank him for the very impressive and enjoyable speech with which he introduced the debate <e> <s> but as a result of his introducing it i find myself having to speak from these benches on the subject instead of my noble friend lord evans of claughton <e> <s> unfortunately my noble friend is unable to be here <e> <s> as your lordships will be well aware he has very considerable knowledge of local government and it is probably a sadness to most of us that he is unable to contribute today <e> <s> however he is kept in birkenhead partly by the rail strike and partly by the fact that he is not able to drive a car because he is suffering from that most illiberal complaint more like a tory complaint of gout <e> <s> we must feel sorry for him but i feel almost more sorry for myself <e> <s> it is for this reason that i have stepped into the breach rather at the last moment and was not able to be here during all the previous speeches <e> <s> i apologise for that but i was able to hear the opening speeches and of course i will read the ones i have missed not least that of the noble baroness lady stedman if only because one is always interested to find out what ones allies believe <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that the noble lord had caught me out <e> <s> the taxpayer would normally be paying his tax through paye <e> <s> the tax return which he would send annually would be dealing with the total of tax just the bare total <e> <s> that would not demand the kind of confidentiality which is talked about in the green paper <e> <s> it is not just the totals is it <e> <s> the totals are not nearly so important for confidentiality as all the things that go to make it up which is what goes into the <e>", "<cs> my lords i was afraid of as much <e> <s> in fact though i think that the argument holds water <e> <s> however we must both read <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank everyone who has taken part in this debate <e> <s> there is no doubt at all that it has been an extremely good debate and that the record of it in <e>", "<cs> my lords the whole house will be genuinely grateful to the noble lord lord hylton for having raised this matter today in the house <e> <s> it is a matter upon which between them noble lords have a large amount of expertise <e> <s> we certainly look forward to some of the contributions which we shall hear in the course of the next couple of hours <e> <s> the noble lord lord hylton was extremely careful in his use of the time available in a limited debate such as this <e> <s> for that we are partly grateful to him for leaving us more time and partly sorry for not having heard him at rather greater length <e>", "<cs> my lords owing to an error in the channels of communication i am afraid that my name did not go on the list of speakers although in fact i had been intending to speak for some time <e> <s> therefore i beg your lordships pardon for that error i do not think that it was anyones fault in particular <e> <s> however i am grateful for an opportunity to speak in this debate on behalf of my party <e> <s> i am grateful to the royal commission its chairman and its members and i am grateful to the committee of the noble earl lord cranbrook <e> <s> above all i am grateful to the noble lord lord campbell of croy for having initiated the debate <e>", "<cs> i wish to make a few remarks about the clause as a whole and i should preface them by saying that like it appears every other member of this committee i patronise fast food shops <e> <s> it is interesting to see the notable rush there is to pay patronage to fast food shops after dinner compared with the shops we were considering immediately before dinner <e> <s> maybe it is the relative weight which a committee comprised of the average age of noble lords puts on the sins of lust and gluttony <e>", "<cs> the minister misunderstood me <e> <s> i did not for a moment say that we were taking away powers from local authorities and i know perfectly well what the bill is designed to do <e> <s> the real trouble is that it is designed to give local authorities powers which should be theirs by natural right already <e> <s> what is needed is not a bill to give them this power and that bill to give them that power as we think it up year by year as a new problem comes up be it sex shops this year and fried fish shops the year after or whatever may happen to arise <e> <s> we should have a basic devolution bill with basic devolution powers so that local government really have powers to organise their own matters <e> <s> i assure the minister i am under no apprehensions as to what the bill is about <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships may be reassured to know that i have not risen to add another winding-up speech to this debate but merely to raise one matter which should not take me more than a couple of minutes <e> <s> although i slightly regret that i have not decided to make a winding-up speech i must say that this has been one of the debates in your lordships house which connoisseurs for years to come will treasure and will mine for the nuggets which your lordships have produced from time to time sometimes inadvertently and sometimes not so <e> <s> to respond to it would have been a very great pleasure indeed <e> <s> but it is not for that reason that i want to rise nor even to say that i think that even with the noble lord lord houghton the one case against this bill has not been seriously put the case that in fact we shall deal with this menace <e> <s> i agree with noble lords about that <e> <s> we shall deal with the vile people who make such fortunes out of it and i agree about that <e> <s> but we shall deal with it better through liberty and freedom than we shall from laws which merely drive them further and further into corners and cause their making of money to be more successful <e> <s> why do they make money <e> <s> they make money because they sell things which are against the law <e> <s> there are two ways out of that impasse and the other one has not been explored tonight <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches do of course welcome the implementation and introduction of this grant scheme <e> <s> it is something which noble lords in all parts of the house have been agreed upon in principle and we are only glad that after rather a long time we should actually be coming somewhere near to fruition <e> <s> our free library system in this country is probably one of the great institutions of the world <e> <s> we all of us benefit from it and it has only been sad that in the past the benefits of this institution have been coupled with possibly a certain amount of injustice to individual authors <e> <s> however that is now being remedied and we are all grateful <e> <s> i would like to join with the noble lord lord ardwick in his remarks congratulating the elegant simplicity of the statistical base which has been found for making the calculations <e>", "<cs> my lords we too should like to thank the minister for repeating the statement and we should like to give it a broad welcome <e> <s> while not sharing the governments total reaction against quangos we believe that very often they are cumbersome bodies with too much to do and with aims that are too muddled <e> <s> we think that the suggestion of two separate bodies with very specific aims is an intelligent and useful one <e> <s> nevertheless there is the problem of the relationship of each body to the other which has been mentioned by the noble baroness lady david <e> <s> how are they to connect with one another <e> <s> which of the two is to have the greater influence <e> <s> it would in particular be an extremely bad thing if it were the new examinations body that was going to make the running <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord did not answer my question about the appeals procedure envisaged for this small examination body and how broad would be its scope <e>", "<cs> of course it is a complex subject <e> <s> my noble friends amendment which no doubt is slightly lighthearted in its intention nevertheless exposes a very real flaw in the thinking behind this bill and the various steps the government are taking <e> <s> the steps to which the noble lord on the government front bench is driven in trying to answer this amendment really amount to an attack on his own policies <e> <s> if we must attack over-spending why should we not <e>", "<cs> my lords the whole house will be extremely grateful to the noble baroness for having chosen this subject for debate this afternoon and for having introduced it in such a very comprehensive way <e> <s> in particular i believe that the remarks she made and the questions she posed towards the end of her speech are going to repay more detailed re-reading and understanding than we have been able to give in a short time because the noble baroness asked some very deep and searching questions to which all of us and not only the government would do well to pay attention <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that everyones thanks are due to mr michael hamilton for having introduced this bill in another place and also to the noble lord lord sandford for taking up the good work here <e> <s> mr hamiltons hard work on this particular issue stemming from his experience with the wiltshire case many years ago has been unremitting and i think was topped with one of the most interesting second reading speeches that it has been my pleasure to peruse reading as it did at times as part of a rather nasty thriller <e> <s> the secrecy which was involved in that case and which has finally landed up in this bill was indeed most unfortunate <e>", "<cs> my lords i originally put down my name to speak on this bill because i am the peer charged on these benches for dealing with the arts and this could possibly be regarded as verging on the arts if only just <e> <s> but i then scratched because it seemed to me that apart from a general welcome to the bill which the noble viscount introduced i had nothing to say and therefore that it was a very good thing not to say it <e> <s> but in the course of the noble viscounts remarks a question has occurred to me which i should like to ask <e> <s> i hope noble lords will bear with me if i very briefly do so <e> <s> i have not been able to give to the noble viscount who inquired <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord sandford may be forgiven for not realising <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like also to thank the minister for explaining the regulations <e> <s> it is of course an extremely worthy aim if rather long overdue to stem the abuse of eady money and the laundering of dubious cash-flow through film enterprises <e> <s> to a certain extent it is rather sad to think that it is locking the stable door after the horse has gone <e> <s> the eady money is diminishing the coming years projection i believe is that it will be less than million and the nffc will be getting less than which is half what is needed for one modest feature film <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that the rayner report did not in fact touch on any of the matters dealing with the local <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government consider how their reaction to this particular suggestion can be brought into line with their determination last night to take through the special development order <e> <s> if you are going to bring in special development orders on sites of this nature in this area should you not also consider carefully the possibility of a whole defence of the whole area <e>", "<cs> my lords i too would like to thank the noble lord the minister for repeating the statement <e> <s> it is as the noble baroness lady birk has said a very complex statement on a very complex matter and we are going to need quite a time to digest it <e> <s> indeed the local authorities are going to need quite a time to digest it and it is just as well that they have been given it <e>", "<cs> my lords i too would like to thank the select committee for the work they have done on this extremely important subject and i should like also to thank the noble earl for his introduction <e> <s> both speakers so far have started by defining noise and the noble lord lord bishopston seemed to be complicating the matter with his noisy noise which annoys rather like the riddle we all knew in our youth i think <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to express my thanks to the noble earl for the speedy and clear way in which he expounded the code of practice and i should also like to add my thanks to the noble lord lord melchett because by covering the ground as thoroughly as he did i think he earned your lordships gratitude if only for the fact that it will enable me to keep my speech down to a very short one indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government give some estimate of what they think it might cost and therefore when they are likely to do it in view of the fact that the sections in question only require the local authorities to consult to prepare statements and to give adequate publicity none of which one might think was particularly expensive <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to delay the house unduly on this matter but there is just one matter which as i understand that this bill is opposed and will go to committee it might be as well should be mentioned in your lordships house on second reading and <e> <s> therefore taken aboard by the committee before it reports back to your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords we have a long and distinguished list of speakers today and i will do my best to set a good example by being brief <e> <s> we have had a very full and very necessary explanation from the minister for which i thank him and the noble baroness lady birk has brought to bear her own experience of the whole field she must be among only half-a-dozen members of your lordshipss house who have this very wide experience in the very important speech which we have just heard <e> <s> but the rest of us will probably want to raise mainly questions and individual points arising from various parts of the field and we look forward to gaining a lot during this second reading debate from the experience that noble lords have to offer <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all extremely grateful to the noble lord lord polwarth for having put this motion before us <e> <s> we can measure the appreciation to a certain extent by the number of distinguished speakers who have put down their names to speak this evening and by the consequent rationing of the time that any single one of us has <e> <s> in

in your <e>", "<cs> unfortunately i was not able to be present at the second reading of the bill and therefore i have not in accordance with the customs of your lordships house put down any amendments at this stage <e> <s> however i do not think that this is a bill that is entirely uncontroversial indeed equivalent bills in other countries have caused considerable problems <e> <s> i think that it would not be out of order if at the moment i were to limit what i have to say to asking two or three very brief questions of the minister in charge <e> <s> i have not been able to give him notice and of course i shall understand if he feels that he has to write to me but i think that these are questions that we ought to get out of the way before we move on to the report stage <e> <s> one of the questions comes under clause one comes under clause and one comes under schedule and they are all reasonably brief <e>", "<cs> i have a brief question at this stage while thanking the noble earl the minister for his reply to my question on clause <e> <s> the mention that this bill is not uncontroversial stems from the fact that the convention he referred to is very much disliked by a great number of third world countries and it seems to me for perfectly good reasons <e> <s> under clause there is widespread concern about the question of the patenting of life forms including plant varieties <e> <s> could the government make clear whether or not under the bill it will be possible to patent a newly-discovered variety of flower or fruit discovered in the third world <e> <s> i think this was raised in an article in last weeks <e>", "<cs> one of the peculiar aspects about this bill is that it is entitled the plant varieties bill and in this schedule paragraph states <e>", "<cs> this is one of a number of complex amendments on the balance of control which we shall have to face in the course of looking at this bill and they are fairly difficult problems which are put before us <e> <s> with some regret i too find myself opposed to the amendment in the name of the noble viscount <e> <s> i say it is with some regret because the philosophy and policy of my party would on the whole lead me to be in favour of having on the various boards as many people as possible who are employed and take part in the running of these institutions <e>", "<cs> we definitely must press the minister to go a little further on this matter or at any rate to take it away and look at it again <e> <s> having expressed his sympathy with the amendment in the name of the noble lord lord strabolgi and myself and having heard the arguments from around the committee he can do very little else particularly since in his speech on this point he said that there were questions which were evenly balanced although he did not actually give us any on his side <e> <s> if this amendment is to be rejected in your lordships committee we need much stronger reasons than we have been given tonight and i hope that the noble earl will take this away and look at it again <e>", "<cs> i support this amendment <e> <s> it seems to me that the trustees system of governorship is a good one and it is able to call on a great deal of wisdom and experience not least in this country as has been said by several noble lords in an earlier debate <e> <s> but to balance that it is probably an extremely good thing to be always on the lookout for new people to be able to bring in new blood and not get into the habit of thinking that because a person is wise and good and has been there for a long time he must necessarily go on there forever <e> <s> one of the happier ways of being able to make certain that that does not happen is to have it laid down that someone should not be reappointed for three years or whatever <e>", "<cs> i should like to speak mildly against this amendment <e> <s> i agree with most of what the noble lord lord strabolgi has said <e> <s> of course we want to spread the duties and of course we do not want the same people serving on boards and to limit the pool of talent from which we can draw <e> <s> nevertheless it seems to me that on the whole in laying down the qualifications in this act we want to try and open the choice to the prime minister as much as possible <e> <s> on the whole the amendments which we have put forward and the amendments which the noble earl has either taken away or has accepted do just that <e> <s> this amendment would specifically limit <e> <s> it would admittedly mean that we would have a greater number of different types of people as trustees covering the whole of the boards <e> <s> but in any particular event our choice would be limited by a specific exclusion <e> <s> i do not think that we should have exclusions where we do not need to have them and it seems to me that this is a place where we do not need to have them <e> <s> i rather hope that the noble lord lord strabolgi will eventually withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the arguments which have been produced by the noble lord lord kennet and the noble baroness lady birk <e> <s> the noble earl lord avon has as usual been extremely helpful to the committee <e>

report stage i hope that the government will be able to come forward either with agreement to a consolidation bill or with some equally constructive suggestion <e>", "<cs> i agree with the noble lord lord kennet about this <e> <s> i think it is important to have something in even if it is only purely permissive <e> <s> the whole question of gardens <e>", "<cs> many of your lordships must be extremely grateful for the progress we have made as a result of the noble earls recent speech <e> <s> flexibility the retention of profits and sponsorship are the three important factors and if the moneys involved in each of those three are dealt with in the way the noble earl outlined we shall have made a considerable step forward not only in the bill but in the way the matter is treated by the government and the treasury <e> <s> in a way we have made a bit of a breakthrough and we are indeed grateful to the minister even i would say to the government for making the point he has made <e> <s> we look forward of course with the usual suspicion of the oppositon to what will actually emerge in the form of amendments at the next stage but it appears extremely hopeful and i am sure we are all pleased for what the noble earl said <e>", "<cs> the noble earl seems in his reply to have effectively stated that there is in fact no need for this part of the bill at all because no one is envisaging changing the proportion <e> <s> it seems to take away most of the reason for having these lines in the bill <e> <s> the only reason that the noble earl put forward is that it seems to be administratively easier to remove the control of the proportion from parliament to the secretary of state <e> <s> i think i speak for these benches when i say that that is a thesis that we will always resist in principle unless a case was seriously made out <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord lord strabolgi will stick to his point <e>", "<cs> my lords the most that anybody can find to say about the order is regret and even that in a not tremendously convincing tone <e> <s> it was notable that although the spokesman for the labour party in another place went through the motions of regret none of his colleagues who spoke <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord the minister moves on he has said that he and his colleagues regard the film industry as being grossly over-regulated by any standards <e> <s> would he care to give some examples <e> <s> now having done away with this particular quota what else is there in the film industry which is ripe to come under the pruning hook <e> <s> presumably he has not made such a wide statement without being able to produce some other candidates <e>", "<cs> my lords the longer i stay in politics the more i should learn not to be amazed at anything but i still am <e> <s> i am always particularly amazed at the way in which efforts to gain commercial advantage of one kind or another can be wrapped up in high-sounding language <e> <s> on this occasion i am particularly amazed and rather distressed by the attitude taken by the labour front bench <e> <s> i can only hope that in the other place there will be another look at the matter <e> <s> i cannot believe that the fine traditions of the labour party in dealing with the third world over matters of this kind are going to be treated in quite the way they have been treated tonight <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl for his explanation <e> <s> i will go away and study it and no doubt those who will have to deal with this bill in another place will be doing the same <e> <s> i was not entirely satisfied with the reassurance that the interests concerned will be consulted on this matter because i was making the point that the interests concerned are very often of such a nature that the minister will be most unlikely to consult them <e> <s> i suspect that the minister will not be consulting any of the developing nations in whose land a number of these plants have their origin <e> <s> the particular point about the development of the end product is a complex one and whereas i believe we do need to look at it again and by we i mean parliament as a whole i do not propose taking it any further at this time <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords we must express our gratitude to the noble lord lord oram for asking this question tonight <e> <s> i am very grateful indeed <e> <s> to start with he has restored my belief in the labour partys loyalty to the developing world which was sadly shattered last night by the contribution of the noble lord lord john-mackie in the debate on the plant varieties bill which led me to believe that the labour party history of the last years had been in vain <e>", "<cs> thank you and from noble lords on this side too <e>", "<cs> my lords my point is that many local centres have had to give up having paid workers and this has inevitably cut their effectiveness <e> <s> southampton and oxford are examples <e>", "<cs> my lords when i was coming here i thought that one thing which was incontrovertible about this bill at committee stage and report stage was that party politics did not enter into it <e> <s> we have now spent one and a half hours on an amendment from which it appears certainly from the point of view of noble lords on these benches that party politics do come into this to a certain extent <e> <s> the amendment which has been put forward by the noble viscount lord eccles although in some ways defective and i am sorry that the proposal is for appointment by the prime minister because i believe it should be by some form of election by the members of the staff themselves as <e>", "<cs> my lords just very briefly <e> <s> i should like to support the noble lord lord strabolgi and the noble lord lord donaldson on this matter <e> <s> i do not really think that the arguments which have been put up by the government spokesman hold that amount of water <e> <s> he said i think i quote him correctly that the government would be unhappy if the prime minister had no opportunity to consult on such an important appointment <e> <s> i should have thought that the prime minister has quite enough to do in a modern state without necessarily being consulted on appointments like these important though all of us in this chamber admit that they are <e> <s> it is a field in which i think they would be happier if the appointments were made by the minister for the arts rather than the prime minister anyway <e> <s> i think that the arguments and reasoning behind the amendment of the noble lord lord strabolgi are absolutely sound <e>", "<cs> my lords are we not wildly out of order now <e> <s> the last two speeches should surely be made when we have dealt with amendment no <e> <s> a and get back to dealing with amendment no <e> <s> which is the substantive new clause <e> <s> i think that we were slightly thrown out by the noble lord lord skelmersdale who thought that the noble baroness lady birk had sat down when she was deemed not to have sat down at that particular moment <e> <s> whatever the fault is surely this business about the small houses which i support is something to which we must come back when we refer again to clause <e> <s> in the meantime we are discussing amendment no <e> <s> a on which i am in full agreement with the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that is a very disappointing response <e> <s> in fact when we look at <e>", "<cs> my lords since this has been formally moved although it has been thoroughly thrashed out in your lordships committee i did not think that the noble earl in replying to it had totally taken on board the strength of the desire to include in this objects which are not necessarily connected with the building or with persons connected with the building <e> <s> it is an extension of the bill that we are searching for here <e> <s> i am sure it is a right one <e> <s> i hope <e>", "<cs> my lords we revert to the water bill which is a reasonably complex bill <e>", "<cs> my lords we are extremely grateful to the noble lord for fulfilling his pledge at a previous stage by bringing forward these amendments <e> <s> i am sure they improve the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord the minister for at any rate giving me that reply if not for the content of it <e> <s> is he aware that the director general of the international service of national agricultural research has said of this particular organisation that it is recognised throughout the world as an outstanding scientific institution which is essential to the development process in developing countries and has brought excellent recognition to the united kingdom in the field of research and development <e> <s> in view of that and in view of the fact that sir neil marten also said that transfer of expertise could be very cost effective will the government not now reconsider their decision <e>", "<cs> i rise to speak very briefly partly because of the jibe of the noble viscount lord ridley the days are long past when the liberal party could not amend bills before this house and win a by-election at the same time <e> <s> we definitely support the amendment now before your lordships committee <e> <s> an important point has just been made by the noble lord lord sandford <e> <s> it is important that the representation of local government should be written on to the face the the bill <e>", "<cs> in this debate it appears quite often to be my fate to expose the fact that the arguments of the noble lord on the front bench hang together in a horrible way <e> <s> the closing speech of the noble lord the minister was very helpful <e> <s> he went to the heart of the matter <e> <s> he exposed a basic flaw at the heart of the bill <e> <s> he may well be right in thinking that one cannot have this kind of reform without doing away with democracy those are my words not his and without doing away with the freedom and access of the press to the procedures of government <e> <s> but if we cannot do that we should not have the bill <e> <s> it is the belief of those of us on this side of the committee that if we cannot reject the bill as a whole we can do something to lessen its bad effects if we include certain safeguards <e> <s> they include the access of the press to the procedures of bodies which will be making decisions about our affairs and about taxes imposed upon us <e> <s> contrary to what one back-bencher on the other side said they are taxes because they are applied although possibly in only a minority of cases where no water or sewerage services are provided <e> <s> although these cases are exceptional they do exist and it is a form of taxation <e>", "<cs> it really is an appalling situation when we come across these objections to having the kind of information that the general public needs and that members of your lordships house need when it comes to putting into operation any of these particular schemes <e> <s> this seems to be i will not say one of the last havens but one of the most obvious and dreadful havens of secrecy for no known reason <e> <s> it seems to me that the noble earl lord onslow and the noble lord lord melchett between them have thoroughly demolished the case that there is any real need for this confidentiality <e> <s> admittedly once the thing has been entered into on a confidential basis the authorities do find themselves in a difficult position but of course it ought never to have been entered into on such a confidential basis <e> <s> landowners and farmers are the trustees of the land for the community a concept which i think is very well taken and indeed accepted widely by people of all political parties <e> <s> as the noble earl lord onslow said there is very little in what i might call the industrial details the economic details of the agricultural plans which by being made public is going suddenly to mean great disaster or that kind of thing for the individual farmer <e>", "<cs> i shall look forward to hearing that and i have no doubt that that can be so <e> <s> but what i am saying is not necessarily that just the amendment by itself is something which i support <e> <s> i do not have my name to it but i think that the idea behind it is a reform which is absolutely necessary and which we in the legislature must do something about as soon as possible <e> <s> this is a prime way of tackling this matter and i hope that the government will have another thought about it before the next stage <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord winstanley regrets that he cannot be here to support the amendment he has been called away <e> <s> i wish briefly to support the amendment because it brings us back to an extremely important area which i raised earlier in the bill <e> <s> if consumers are to have access to the affairs of the various authorities which we have been maintaining they must have it is extremely important that the arrangements that are made are efficient above board and written onto the face of the bill <e> <s> that is why i think that the amendment is important in itself <e> <s> i very much regret that the whole idea of the authorities is such that there cannot be <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for his remarks <e> <s> his opening statement about the relationship of the authorities with the press was one of the few cheerful things we have heard this evening <e> <s> i thank him for outlining the intentions of the government which i hope have been sharpened during our debates <e> <s> i shall not pretend that the whole thing is nearly as satisfactory as it should be but i think the government are trying to do the best they can in the entrenched position that they have adopted <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord wells-pestell for initiating this debate about poverty <e> <s> i have a slight criticism of the way in which the debate has been framed <e> <s> it is in fact some time with the exception of one debate initiated by my noble friend lord banks since we discussed what boils down to the fate of the poor <e> <s> it is high time that we did it again <e> <s> the noble lord lord wells-pestell in his introductory speech to this motion concentrated very much on this side of the whole debate but it is unfortunate that we are discussing at the same time all the efforts which are apparently needed to put the economy right in order to do this <e> <s> that may seem a bit of a paradox but i hope to defend my paradox in a moment or two <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not my intention to make a second reading speech at this moment because i do not believe there is anyone left to convince <e> <s> the noble lord lord houghton has several times previously produced a bill such as this and certainly my noble friend lord airedale and myself have spoken in support on previous occasions <e> <s> this seems to be one of those minor but important reforms which is long overdue <e> <s> the longer i remain on my feet the longer it will be before we hear whether the government have any comfort to give us in speeding along this reform and giving what is undoubtedly the will of your lordships house some real effect <e>", "<cs> my lords i too would like to thank the minister for repeating this statement <e> <s> of course as far as the central part of it goes it is very pious and very encouraging <e> <s> we look forward to reading the white paper now that it is published <e> <s> i hope that we shall be given a fairly speedy opportunity to discuss the white paper in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i should just like to say that we ought to be grateful that the government are taking this on board whatever machinery has broken down in the past <e> <s> i have been looking at this particular matter over the past few weeks and as your lordships know it will come before this house in a minor form tomorrow afternoon <e> <s> the more i look at the problem of cost-benefit analysis for this kind of work the more it seems to me essential that the workings and the assumptions be laid open to the public and to everyone who has a right to make a judgment as to whether they should be <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord the chairman of committees for those comments <e> <s> it is true that the point arose only after the petitioners withdrew <e> <s> the time has been extremely constructively spent by discussing with the promoters of the bill what would be the best way of approaching the problem <e> <s> there is a serious matter here which should be discussed <e> <s> i entirely agree it is unfortunate that by a series of mischances the usual procedure was not followed <e> <s> i think the best thing to do now would be to look at the whole matter and i therefore hope your lordships will agree to the motion <e>", "<cs> my lords the liberal partys attitude towards nationalisation has always been a coherent one which has been opposed to the extreme views sometimes at any rate in theory held by both the conservative and the labour parties <e> <s> i have never believed that we are naturally a party of the centre but <e> <s> in this case the centre which in this matter includes large parts of both the parties i have mentioned has i believe got it about right <e> <s> on the one hand we do not believe that nationalisation is a cure-all <e> <s> in so far as it replaces workable and well regulated competition it is to be resisted <e> <s> on the other hand there are various parts of todays economy which are natural monopolies and if they are to work it is far better that they should be owned and regulated by society a a whole rather than by private enterprise since private enterprise as its description implies will always or almost always put private interest first <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that this is the occasion to spend a great deal of time on speeches <e> <s> we have discussed very thoroughly the details of the bill and we have made some notable improvements <e> <s> we on these benches have not changed our view that this is a misconceived bill and that a system which operates as part of the rating system without democratic representation is bad in principle <e> <s> however we in your lordships house have made the best of it <e> <s> with the help of the government we have reinstated the power of the ombudsman <e> <s> we look forward with a great deal of interest and maybe with a little doubt to what the consumer consultative councils will do <e> <s> there is absolutely no doubt that apart from the major point of the principle of the bill the government have been as helpful as they could be <e> <s> we are very grateful to the noble lord lord bellwin and to the noble lord lord skelmersdale for meeting us on a number of matters <e> <s> i wish that they could have met us on more but undoubtedly they went as far as they could without betraying the unfortunately misconceived basic principle of the bill <e> <s> it is a pity that we could not do more but what we have done has been worth doing <e>", "<cs> my lords i should just like to thank the noble earl the minister and the government for meeting this point <e> <s> i believe that it is a worthwhile one and i am delighted that the government are able to do this <e>", "<cs> my lords i am no great admirer of the two brandt reports i think they suffer from a great many disadvantages not least of which is that they were brought together by a group of very able people of extremely different views and therefore they suffer to quite a large extent from the fault of the lowest common denominator <e> <s> a report which could be signed by mr heath and by some of the other members was obviously not going to be a very sharp-nosed report <e> <s> nevertheless i think that these two reports have had one very good effect which is that they have given us a focus for discussion of a subject which is one of the most important in the world today <e> <s> i am indeed extremely grateful to the noble lord lord oram for having raised this matter today <e> <s> he is indefatigable in his pursuit of this particular subject and as someone who is deeply involved in it myself i think we should all be extremely grateful to him <e>", "<cs> my lords the house is indebted to the noble lord lord willis for the way he brings this matter to our attention <e> <s> we are all the richer for having noble lords like him who specialise in particular matters and bring amending legislation before your lordships house at varying intervals <e> <s> in <e>", "<cs> my lords the whole of the reason for this bill and the fact that it had to be produced at all stems from dilatoriness on the part of the government and before that from a very bad basic policy as the noble baroness lady david said <e> <s> we can be pleased and relieved that it is ending in a helpful way with a bill produced with the maximum of good grace as one would expect from mr waldegrave <e>", "<cs> my lords even if the government do not sign this convention will they undertake to take steps to improve the welfare of british prisoners abroad <e> <s> is the minister aware that the attitude of the foreign office in these matters is not always as helpful as it might be when as in thailand which has been drawn to our attention recently overcrowding diet and everything else is frequently of a very low standard <e> <s> will the government really take this matter on board even if they do not go ahead with the convention <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government bear in mind that this is possibly not a case for an ideological stand and that a great many governments prefer to deal with the departments of our government knowing that they are extremely efficient and have no particular axe to grind <e> <s> will the government bear that in mind when coming to their decision <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the true cure for the irresponsible actions of which the minister speaks he to introduce a method of election that would return councils that represent the voters <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord quinton has raised a number of fascinating points in the speech that we have just heard <e> <s> he is really the first person to deal with the problem of population although as he said it was raised by the noble lord lord oram <e> <s> i am not capable of producing anything like a full answer to what the noble lord lord quinton has said <e> <s> nevertheless i think it is the general experience of developing countries that they go through a phase when they get above starvation level if they happen to have been at that level and when they are getting enough food so that people are no longer dying of starvation and when the population goes up by leaps and bounds <e>", "<cs> my lords we are particularly grateful to the noble lord lord houghton for having asked this question in the house tonight at a time when we certainly should be considering the white paper <e> <s> of course we are also extremely grateful to him for his work on this particular subject over the years <e> <s> he is one of those who has helped to bring the status of animals and their welfare <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord who introduced this bill for his explanation of it <e> <s> it is a bill which i think will get widespread support in this house and certainly from these benches not that we think that necessarily it has been produced in the most satisfactory way or that we are entirely happy about everything in it <e> <s> but basically it is a bill to give more power to local authorities to do work which is necessary to be done <e> <s> this is fairly unusual for this government and we are delighted that they are taking these steps <e> <s> the objective is admirable the improvement of the inner city and the use of our resources in order to make that improvement <e> <s> unfortunately in order to do it apparently we have to produce some slightly convoluted legislation dealing with where it is a matter of debate as to what controls need to be imposed on the local authorities in their use of the monies which they can raise <e>", "<cs> my lords we are indeed grateful to the noble lord lord beloff for introducing this debate <e> <s> we are grateful because of the immense importance of this particular subject at this particular time and grateful i think because of the fascination that a great many of us find in it and in the whole subject of how democracy should work at a local level in this country and in the western world in the future <e> <s> we are also grateful because of what seems to me the high quality of the speeches that we have had in the course of the debate matched only possibly by the considerable length which comes from long experience of the council chamber <e>", "<cs> my lords in my parish church last sunday when we were praying on the question of cruise missiles the parish priest made a slip of the tongue and talked about the immediate delivery of missiles in this country <e> <s> he quickly realised as did the congregation the unfortunate ambivalence of that word and corrected it to import but there was a great deal of truth involved in the slip <e> <s> the import of so-called defensive nuclear weapons may well later on involve the delivery of another countrys offensive weapons in an offensive category <e>", "<cs> my lords sufficient for per cent <e> <s> of the population <e> <s> nonsense <e> <s> it may have better civil defence potential than we have but that would not be difficult <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the job of those members of your lordships house who wish to change the governments mind on what seems to be some of the minor matters of their responsibilities sometimes to go in for a bit of overkill <e> <s> how else we sometimes think are we to alert a minister or a permanent secretary to what seems to them possibly not the most important matter among all the major problems which beset them day by day except by a bit of exaggeration <e> <s> it is for that reason that when briefs come on to our desks some of us certainly i include myself are apt to treat them with a measure of scepticism and when we have translated that scepticism into the enthusiasm needed to convince the powers-that-be a certain amount of it remains <e> <s> but the more i look at this particular matter and it is thanks to the wholly admirable assiduity of the noble lord lord oram that we are given this opportunity of doing so again the more i am convinced that this <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the whole house will be grateful to the noble lords who sat on that select committee for the work that they put in <e> <s> i should just like to add one piece of information to what the noble lord the chairman of committees has told us and to ask a question which i think is addressed to the government front bench if there is a minister on the government front bench who feels that he can take this on board <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the minister for repeating the statement <e> <s> i congratulate the government on the whole for the speed and the thoroughness with which they have tackled this problem <e> <s> the only question that i wish to ask follows along the same lines as that put by the noble baroness lady birk <e> <s> on the question of refunding expenditure the position of local authorities financially in this field as in others as noble lords will not need reminding is not a happy one at this moment and the prospects for the next year are not happy <e> <s> it is good to know that large proportions of the expenditure will be met centrally and also that according to the extremely vital paragraph the need for expenditure will be taken into account in determining housing investment programme allocations <e> <s> it is clear that when the minister consults the local authority associations one of their requests will he for per cent <e> <s> help in this matter <e> <s> it is possibly what they should have <e> <s> have the government considered this <e> <s> if so why have they rejected it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am fortunate enough to be the first to be able to congratulate the noble lord who has just sat down on taking up his duties on the opposition front bench <e> <s> we certainly look forward to hearing from him quite a lot in the future as no doubt we shall <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while of course many recipients of the order would not wish to live in this country is it not very anomalous that those whom her majesty has delighted to honour in this particular way do not necessarily have the right to enter or to live in this country which has honoured them <e>", "<cs> my lords since the noble baroness agrees that the people of this country have admired those who have received this order would it not be fitting that the people of this country should also offer them hospitality when they need it <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble earl for initiating this debate <e> <s> i am rather overcome by the expertise in the art world which has been shown by the speakers so far and which no doubt will be shown by the speakers who are still on the list <e> <s> i cannot boast any such expertise myself except possibly my wifes expertise because at the moment she is representing the contemporary art society in scotland and buying pictures from contemporary painters with the funds of that extremely-to-be-praised body and thereby possibly doing more for contemporary painters than we are in your lordships chamber <e> <s> but i suspect that we may have a longer lasting effect because i think that a great many things can be done and a number of them should be close to the heart of a conservative government <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl is deploying an extremely good and detailed reply to the debate as a whole but a very important point has been raised <e> <s> in his reply the noble earl seems to be skating over the fact that these part-time teaching posts have been disappearing at a rate of knots over the last few years and are still disappearing <e> <s> he and i both know artists who have still got such jobs but i know for a fact that a survey in the art teaching profession which covered the whole country showed that these jobs have disappeared <e> <s> i would be the last person from these benches to say that the government ought to be forcing on local authorities exactly what they should do in this particular way though i am surprised that the noble earl speaking from those benches is prepared to defend that point of view at this particular point in time <e> <s> nevertheless is there nothing that the government and the minister for the arts can do to tackle what has already been seen to be a very grave problem indeed <e> <s> it is not a minor matter it is a very important matter <e>", "<cs> my lords more than the average amount of conventional thanks are due to the noble lord lord teviot for having raised this matter this evening <e> <s> he has given two opportunities to the house first to ask about ditchling secondly and this is no less important to ask about the presently established procedures for coming to a decision on a matter like this <e> <s> i know that the department has this matter under consideration at the moment but this is a very suitable moment to reinforce the argument that there should be a rearrangement of the procedures in aid of preserving the countryside both in areas of outstanding natural beauty and in national parks <e>", "<cs> if the noble viscount will give way my lords i should like to make it plain that i was not in any way suggesting that the oil companies were doing that on purpose <e> <s> i was merely suggesting that it was the effect that happened from the public point of view <e> <s> it may be just as bad for the oil companies because they may get to a stage where they find that public opinion tries to stop them a stage where they find that they have been put into a false position <e> <s> i was certainly not suggesting that it was the oil companies fault <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all grateful to the noble lord lord strabolgi for this opportunity grateful and for my part appalled at the task of tackling the whole of the arts in six minutes <e> <s> talk about renaissance man <e> <s> i am particularly appalled because i believe that my party has a policy for the wholesale restructuring of the subsidy system which the nation ought to take on board and which this government in particular could take on board without in any way sacrificing their principles <e> <s> i hope that the noble earl the minister has read it <e> <s> if he has not read it i hope that he will do so i will get a copy to him if he does not have one <e>", "<cs> i think the point is how is parliament to know that this lease is going to be entered into <e>", "<cs> my lords we too should like to welcome the statement and to thank the minister for making an interim statement even though at this particular time it does not add very much to what we already know <e> <s> nevertheless it was a very important incident <e> <s> we shall want to comment more fully on it when the time comes <e> <s> in the meantime it is right that the house should be kept informed <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the noble lord answered the second of my questions which was about advice to the public and this is brought up by the point about children on the sea shore <e>", "<cs> my lords i intervene at this moment not merely to say that i welcome this bill and the way it has been introduced to us nor merely to say although it is true that i go along with a very great deal almost entirely of what the noble lord lord houghton has said but because it is conventional at this stage even if one cannot make a second reading speech and there is not very much about this bill which calls for a second reading speech to put down a marker about various amendments that may be necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords i had imagined that probably most of your lordships would applaud the purposes of this bill <e> <s> to a certain extent i think that is probably still true <e> <s> even the noble baroness lady david in her very luke-warm reception of it did say that she could see no powerful objections i think to its main purposes <e>", "<cs> nothing of course is further from the truth <e> <s> we were all involved <e> <s> my party and i am not making any particular claim for it

same as the one i asked when the intermediate statement was made to which i did not receive a very satisfactory answer <e> <s> what steps have been taken to alert the local population and people entering the area to the danger and to inform them what steps they should take if their children should stray onto the beaches or play on the beaches and so come into contact with these radioactive objects <e> <s> last time i received the impression that either nothing much had been done about alerting these people or the government did not <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to congratulate the noble lord on producing this bill <e> <s> first it gives us an opportunity to discuss a most important subject which he has given us before in this house and a bill of this kind is certainly overdue

<e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord is unaware that proportional representation cures all ills <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for repeating the answer to the question and to congratulate the government on the steps that they have been taking <e> <s> but is it not true to say that the risk of outbreaks of newcastle disease and the damage that they can cause are much greater in conditions of intensive poultry keeping <e> <s> will the government bear that in mind in their attitude when this subject comes up for instance in regard to the present draft directive of the european community on standards for laying hens in battery cages <e> <s> do not the government agree that one of the best methods of reducing this disease and ensuring against it lies in smaller intensification in poultry rearing <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down may i say that i do not think he has turned his attention to subsection of the proposed new clause <e> <s> that is <e>", "<cs> will it be for publication <e>", "<cs> i should like to congratulate the noble lord lord wallace on the series of amendments that he has brought before the committee this evening because they very much improve the bill <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> in particular meets a point which as the noble lord has said was raised in several parts of the house and it was the only serious fault that we on these benches found in the bill <e> <s> we are delighted that the noble lord has been able to amend the bill in this thoroughly satisfactory way <e>", "<cs> i do not think that the governments criticism of this amendment is fair <e> <s> it seems to me that if one is to have any kind of allotment system at all the publication of a simple statement of where that system stands from year to year is a basic necessity <e> <s> it is not to be labelled as bureaucracy or unnecessary it is something to which every ratepayer is entitled <e> <s> i believe that this is a good amendment and a good clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate as always to differ from my noble friend lord airedale with whom i usually agree on almost everything even though this is clearly no party matter <e> <s> i do so because i think that the easter act was an extremely misconceived act should never have been put upon the statute book and should certainly never be brought into force <e> <s> it may be argued that this is too late a stage for me to intervene <e> <s> i can only plead that when the act received its royal assent i was still in the womb and if it has taken me years to mount my opposition there has equally been years during which the state has for various reasons mostly laudable been unwilling or unable to go ahead with this so-called reform <e> <s> so my short speech tonight is in the nature of an opening shot in a battle against the act and in particular against the concurrence of the churches in the act <e> <s> for that reason i am particularly pleased to see the most reverend prelate the bishop of london in his place because my argument is really directed to the churches rather than to the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords i am surprised that the noble lord the minister who was undoubtedly in the house last night during the debate and presumably voted with his government in the division is now rallying to the defence of the local authorities to do what they like with their own money <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that is entirely so <e> <s> two separate questions arise out of this amendment <e> <s> one concerns whether the councils should have a definite duty to charge a particular kind of rent <e> <s> here i think it is absolutely <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to congratulate my noble kinsman on having initiated this debate <e> <s> i must confess that when it first came forward my reaction was almost the same as that of the noble baroness lady david not that i did not believe my eyes but when i saw that we were invited to discuss the assistance given by independent schools to state schools in britain i thought that it would be a very short debate <e> <s> indeed so it is proving <e> <s> i think that is a pity because there are a number of good reasons why we should welcome as much interplay as possible between the two sectors <e>", "<cs> my lords some of us who speak from party front benches on this bill can find ourselves in a rather difficult situation reduced as i certainly am to speaking about why we should not be speaking <e> <s> my party historically varies in its attitude to the establishment of the church of england from the cool to the frigid and it is for this reason among others that on the whole we have over a period of time very much welcomed the taking over by the church of the regulation of its own affairs with the minimum recourse to parliament <e> <s> there are of course a number of liberals who resent the continuation of what they see as the advantages of the establishment with outside control <e> <s> the ability of the church of england to have its cake and eat it has long been the wonder if not necessarily the admiration of all <e>", "<cs> i want to pick up one point made by the noble lord the minister when he spoke about it being unlikely that the proponents of this amendment would want him to draw a line between and <e> <s> i cannot speak for them but as a supporter of this amendment i thoroughly support the notion that a line should be drawn at some point like that <e>", "<cs> my lords the number of your lordships who have put down their names to speak an almost unprecedented number for an unstarred question is token enough of the debt that we owe to the noble lord lord fanshawe <e> <s> we are particularly lucky tonight in having two maiden speakers both of whom have great practical experience in this field <e> <s> your lordships house has a reputation for producing experts on any given subject <e> <s> i remember that i made my maiden speech on an unstarred question on primary schools in hong kong on the basis that as the only member of your lordships house who had actually been governor of a primary school in hong kong i was keeping up the record of your lordships house for expertise <e>", "<cs> my lords it has been said that this is three or four bills in one <e> <s> judging from the debate it is certainly two very separate bills on two separate subjects and i wish to move the debate slightly away from the optical side about which we have been hearing in the last few speeches from the side which can possibly be dealt with by according to the noble lord lord mottistone the non-consumption of a bottle of whisky in three days or the non-consumption of bottles over two years which seems to me to be a much smaller rate of consumption i suspect that if he grossed it up he would find it was rather different <e> <s> i want to deal with the other part of the bill which moves to a very different world indeed a world where there are no luxuries and not even the ability to go out for an evening to a pub among the kind of families about whom we are talking <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches certainly welcome this bill <e> <s> the encouragement of cycling in itself in an age where fuel and power become more and more expensive is to be encouraged <e> <s> equally it is to be welcomed for its effect on the health of the nation <e> <s> however the health of the nation is very much dependent on the cyclists actually getting to the other end of their journeys and not being mown down on the way <e> <s> therefore any bill which deals with safety is one which we welcome in principle <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to intervene at this moment <e> <s> obviously the whole of this area impinges on the arguments put forward by the noble lords lord marsh and lord bellwin on the last amendment <e> <s> i must confess that i had some sympathy with the case that they put forward believing as i do wholeheartedly in the giving of as much freedom as possible to local authorities <e> <s> however on this amendment it seems to me that the noble lords lord kilmarnock and lord ennals have a strong case for putting forward the idea that there should be a special exemption from this general principle <e>", "<cs> but what happens my lords if the basis of the assumption has changed in the interim <e> <s> the figures are worked out for the whole year on a basic assumption but by the second stage that basis may have changed particularly in view of <e>", "<cs> my lords may i with the leave of the house say that i believe we have won the basic logical argument on this point <e> <s> however the cash argument which the noble lord the minister produced the difference made because of the fact that we are talking about cash limits is one which i should like to study <e> <s> the minister has said that he too will look at the arguments <e> <s> therefore at this stage i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> both the noble viscount and the noble lord lord henley seem to have missed the point <e> <s> if these amendments are carried it does not mean that local authorities must put in a barrier <e>", "<cs> no it does not <e> <s> it means that they should put in a barrier if it is necessary for safety <e> <s> that is what it says and that is what it means <e> <s> it does not mean that they have to put in a <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the minister has produced a very detailed explanation of what is being done and what is planned and for that i thank him very much <e> <s> i asked for it and i wanted it and it is something which i will go away and study <e> <s> there were points in what he said that gave me some comfort <e> <s> i am particularly interested and will go away and study what he was saying about the rights of appeal <e> <s> but the main arguments which he produced and which the noble lord lord henley produced were based as i said in my intervention on a complete misunderstanding of the amendments and went on for a long time dealing with a non-existent bogey <e> <s> if my amendments were agreed to subsection would read <e>", "<cs> my lords are we to understand the minister to be saying in the last part of that reply that the principles referred to in clause are likely to change from time to time because if that is what he is saying it becomes even more of the nightmare as my noble friend lord kilmarnock was trying to put together of the two ideas of shifting sands and the minefield <e> <s> if you can think of anything more of a nightmare than a minefield and shifting sands i cannot <e> <s> i think that this bill is that <e>", "<cs> hear hear <e>", "<cs> my lords the commons amendment seems to be baffling if nothing else because the noble baroness lady birk seems to think that it slightly weakens the situation and i think that if anything it slightly strengthens the situation <e> <s> i like it my way <e> <s> i think we are all reasonably contented <e> <s> i should have thought that on the whole it is a good amendment and the bill certainly is a very good bill <e> <s> we welcome it <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to take the limited time available to talk about one <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already paid tribute to the goodwill the industry and the determination to consult which the proposers of this bill and the government have shown and i do not withdraw a word of that <e> <s> i just wish that it was not necessary at the same time to produce a number of extra arguments many of which do not by any means stand up to examination <e> <s> some of them depended upon the possibility of re-drafting the amendment a question which was not raised at the previous stage <e> <s> i have absolutely no doubt that it will be quite feasible to redraft these amendments so that they cover other kinds of barriers other kinds of works and which allow for their being removed if necessary <e> <s> neither do i accept the argument of the noble viscount the minister that to put in such an absolute standard would be an inappropriate burden upon the courts <e>", "<cs> my lords while we welcome the fact that there has been a private notice question and that an answer has been given we on these benches certainly deplore the actual answer <e> <s> the idea that this action is not going to jeopardise the halvergate marshes as a whole seems to me not to hold water in any way <e> <s> it is a serious encroachment an encroachment which is irreversible <e> <s> although this may be only a small encroachment at this time every encroachment that is made in this way causes irredeemable damage <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will give way i do not have the greatest regard myself for the minister whom he is quoting i must say but he ought in fairness to say that that first quotation was from a member of his own party mr george bernard shaw <e> <s> as he pointed out it was <e> <s> it was then denied by mr hattersley who was not aware of the remarks of mr george bernard shaw but i am afraid that he will find that it is a very typical remark if i may say so from mr shaw who was given to making remarks of that kind <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to start by saying that if i was in error when i interrupted the noble lord lord stallard i apologise <e> <s> the noble lord is someone i have admired in politics for a very long time and i certainly did not mean any discourtesy <e> <s> in addition as i think the noble lord lord barnett realised the quotation might well have been one from george bernard shaw even if it were not because it was the kind of thing he did say <e>", "<cs> my lords we too welcome the order as a whole and thank the minister for his exposition of it <e> <s> i think that the weight and complexity of the order and the complexity of the explanations which the minister was able to give without in any way being able to go into detail is some evidence as to the unsatisfactory nature of law-making as it refers to northern ireland at present <e> <s> i do not think anyone denies that <e> <s> the longer the present situation goes on the more it is incumbent upon us to find some way in which parliament deals with these matters whereby we too can have a say in what we are supposed to be passing <e>", "<cs> my lords we too should like to thank the minister for explaining the terms of this order <e> <s> i think we have some reservations about the nomenclature of the new university <e> <s> admittedly it stems from two institutions which both had ulster written into their title <e> <s> nevertheless as everyone who has anything to do with ireland knows ulster is nine counties of which only six are in northern ireland <e> <s> it is a fact that there has been a certain amount of resentment at this appropriation of the name ulster for this university <e> <s> i should be grateful if the minister would comment on that observation or tell us the thinking behind the adoption of that name <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord for his exposition <e> <s> i have no comments or questions on the main point of the order but i am afraid that it gives me a chance to raise a question which i have raised previously in your lordships house and which although i have not yet had an answer has puzzled a great many people to whom i have spoken and who have read the <e>", "<cs> my lords what is the advice which the noble lord the minister thinks is contained in that particular sentence <e> <s> it does not appear to contain any advice at all <e> <s> it is just a statement <e>", "<cs> my lords may be <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the minister for repeating the statement <e> <s> as is so often the case with this government the energy and enthusiasm with which they wield the axe is not completely matched by the thoroughness with which they do the replanting <e> <s> most members of your lordships house will agree that the eady levy was unsatisfactory in a great many ways and that it is not at all a bad thing that we should be moving on from it <e> <s> however the question is whether the eady levy is going to be replaced by anything which is more satisfactory <e> <s> we shall have to wait and see <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord the minister for explaining the regulations and join in congratulating the government <e> <s> this is the second part of their two-pronged attack on the tyre problem <e> <s> the way they have tackled it and have succeeded in producing the regulations is admirable <e>", "<cs> my lords we too should like to welcome the statement and indeed join the noble baroness in welcoming the timing of the elections <e> <s> that seems to be an extremely sensible suggestion and the procedures so far outlined in this statement appear to be of the right kind <e> <s> we on these benches have always been in favour of a directly elected ilea unlike some other noble lords on this side of the house who are late converts to the idea and we certainly hope that this will be a successful experiment <e> <s> the question which the noble baroness lady david raised about the financial constraints under which the new authority will operate is a very pertinent one <e> <s> will it in fact have freedom to operate as it should within the limits which are necessary in london and can we have some assurance this is presumably the case that the costs of the elections for the ilea and there are bound to be some costs even though they are taking place at the same time as the borough elections will in no way come out of the education budget <e>", "<cs> my lords todays regulations are part of a process which i think appears to a number of your lordships to be deeply disturbing <e> <s> in fact the whole matter appears to be another example of the governments tendency to take a sledgehammer in order to crack a rather small nut <e> <s> that is a process which involves a great deal of danger to anyone or anything which happens to get in the way <e> <s> i say a tendency since noble lords will recall only too well that the whole of the nonsense which the government parliament and the greater part of the urban administration of this country is plunged into as a result of the governments determination to avoid the cheap simple and obvious answers to the problems of local government overspending <e> <s> this appears to be another exercise in the same area <e>", "<cs> my lords i suspect that in spite of what has been said so far the country as a whole is fairly unanimous in its attitude to the united states <e> <s> this attitude consists on the one hand of affection and admiration and on the other of that complex mixture of envy resentment and even fear which is felt by a client state to its protector a complex of emotions which we must be well aware of since we ourselves as one of the great nations of the world in the past must have been or should have been infinitely aware of how it was borne to us by our colonies and our client states <e> <s> such a relationship is a perfectly understandable one but because it is complex i think it can often lead to the wrong estimation of what is happening and to actions which are guided often or sometimes anyway more by emotion than by common sense not always as well thought out as they should be <e>", "<cs> my lords this is an historic moment in the history of the commonwealth and particularly of hong kong <e> <s> so far we are extremely grateful to the noble baroness for her lucid exposition of the bill and i personally have also been very interested to hear a leading socialist give such a fine exposition of vehement support for the continuation of capitalist activities in hong kong <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down for a second time she having made a point about the eurasians and the chinese <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join in the very sincere and heartfelt thanks to the noble lord lord jenkins for initiating this debate but to temper them with a slight complaint about the widening of the field <e> <s> each of these subjects that we have before us today has the makings of a first-class debate and the lumping of the two together will not produce a result as useful as that from taking each one separately <e> <s> your lordships debates are at their best when they are not too diffuse and i say that in spite of the extremely able interesting and to me sympathetic speech of the noble lord lord ardwick which i would have welcomed doubly warmly on another occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think the noble lord the minister answered the question of my noble friend lord kilmarnock about the indexation of charges for those in residential care and nursing homes which are already over the level <e> <s> this is a matter which absolutely needs to be spelt out as soon as possible <e> <s> quite clearly if this provision is not indexed it will result in very considerable distress for those people least able to cope with the situation over the forthcoming years <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord the minister discovers that he is wrong in what he tentatively said in reply to my last question that the indexation is going to be subject to review <e> <s> this is not a question of review it is a question of a guarantee to people elderly people who are already in places where many of them are hoping to live for the rest of their lives that they will have security <e> <s> it is not a question of a review it is a question of indexation <e> <s> i hope the noble lord will find that he is wrong and i hope that if he does so he will take steps to let the house know <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> he referred to the level in force <e> <s> does that mean the cash level in force or will it be indexed <e> <s> will it be the same next year and the year after or will it go up as inflation goes up <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the minister for repeating the statement <e> <s> in my now quite long experience secretaries of state for education can be divided quite neatly into those who have a real interest in the subject and those for whom it is merely a department on their way through politics <e> <s> the present secretary of state falls into the former category and it is no surprise that this white paper is a rather elegant signpost forward the directions on which most of us would welcome <e> <s> i have only one question to ask in that connection <e> <s> it is as to whether the money for in-service training which we certainly welcome is new money that we are getting into the service in this way <e> <s> if so it is doubly welcome <e>", "<cs> it is completely complacent my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to take up your lordships time this afternoon on this stage of the bill not because it is not seen by us as of the greatest importance because it is but because we are happy to be able to register the fact that so much of the necessary work has been done on it and has been done satisfactorily <e> <s> i really should like to congratulate the government on the spirit in which they have undertaken all the negotiations on this matter and the openmindedness they are showing towards arrangements for the future <e> <s> the progress we have made on previous stages of the bill as the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos said has allayed the fears of a large number of people in hong kong <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to welcome the noble baroness to her responsibilities <e> <s> in particular i hope that she will never again have as bad a brief as this to defend <e> <s> i can reassure her about one thing she will never have a worse one <e> <s> i can also wish her something more <e> <s> i wish her as much moderation and courtesy for all her time on the front bench as she has experienced in the course of this afternoon <e> <s> frankly it has been quite amazing <e> <s> the noble lord lord stallard has refrained from asking many of the questions which he had <e> <s> this is merely a sign of the really appalling unpreparedness in regard to the regulations which are before your lordships house <e> <s> i shall come to that point again in a moment <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness mean uprated or does she mean reviewed <e>", "<cs> i should not like the only speech from the liberal benches to be that of my noble friend lord winstanley much as i respect his expertise in this particular field <e> <s> as a member of the party which has long had john stuart mill as its guru i suspect that that great man would be turning in his grave at some of the arguments which are being put forward against this amendment <e>", "<cs> i am not quite certain about the argument about thalidomide <e> <s> my answer in regard to pot is certainly yes as members of the committee know from my past record in this chamber <e>", "<cs> did i hear the noble baroness say that different substances are already added to the water <e>", "<cs> if that is so it is a new argument that is being introduced <e> <s> i have no objection to it but i was not aware of it and i do not know how many other people are <e> <s> perhaps the noble baroness will write to me and place a copy of the list in the library <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble earl for having asked his question tonight and certainly for enabling me to put to the government a question i want to raise <e> <s> in addition this occasion has already provided an extremely interesting debate <e> <s> i entirely agree with the noble lord lord ezra on the points he was making <e>", "<cs> do i really understand what the government are saying on this matter that it is really a matter of more or less indifference to them whether the care of these very valuable and very important natural sites should be continued that the functions of looking after them and seeing that they continue to go on would be entirely in the hands of the boroughs <e> <s> if so it really is a totally inadequate attitude <e> <s> i would have thought that even if there were specific duties laid on the boroughs the idea of a consortium of boroughs with a lead borough dealing with these scattered sites and not all of the boroughs in the glc area have them by any means and the idea that there should be somehow an <e>", "<cs> is the minister saying that there is no natural responsibility whatsoever for the preservation of these extraordinarily important sites <e>", "<cs> whatever its faults the greater london council has a splendid record in looking after these sites and in putting together a department to look after them with extraordinarily <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to congratulate the noble baroness on her promotion to the hot seat <e> <s> i have long looked forward to the day when i as a liberal trendy in education matters would be able to debate with one of the authors of the black papers across the floor of this house <e> <s> my surprise must be as great as that of the noble baroness to find that in this particular bill we are on the same side <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for pointing that out <e> <s> i was not entirely clear what he meant <e> <s> but the first case for its being absurd i would reject entirely as i imagine would the noble and learned lord lord wilson of langside and other noble lords from scotland <e> <s> why should scotland not have different laws customs and habits from ourselves <e> <s> there is no justification for the appalling habit of wanting to have everything the same all over the country <e>", "<cs> my

no <e> <s> <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> provides that corporal punishment shall only be given by the head teacher of any school <e> <s> our amendment is that corporal punishment should be given by head teachers and people acting with the authority of the head teacher <e>", "<cs> i do not really think that the minister has managed to answer the case for this amendment <e> <s> the main argument which i understood the noble baroness to put forward is that teachers will know the problems of the children with whom they are dealing and they will know which child they ought to be punishing with corporal punishment and which child they ought not <e> <s> that is a perfectly fair argument or at least it would be perfectly fair in any bill except this one <e> <s> but this bill has substituted for that judgment the wishes of the parent <e> <s> i have already said on second reading that unlike many of my noble friends i rather support the government on this but i cannot see that the government can have it both ways <e> <s> if they have substituted the judgment of the parents it seems to me that they should not be arguing that the teacher should be judging between which child to punish and which not to punish <e> <s> it seems to me that the case for the amendment still stands <e>", "<cs> the european court of human rights has nothing to do with the ec it has to do with the council of europe <e> <s> the noble lords objection does not really stand up <e>", "<cs> nonsense <e>", "<cs> i am far from convinced by that answer that the government have really looked at the

amendment no <e> <s> may i say that i have the greatest respect and sympathy with the arguments which have been deployed by the noble lord lord ross of marnock over the past few minutes <e> <s> but i still want to get back to the answer that we had from the minister on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> if i understand her aright she was saying that punishment books are kept in all schools and that it is not open to schools not to keep them <e> <s> if that is so why does it matter that they are administered by local education authorities and that it is not laid down in an act of parliament <e> <s> no one would accuse noble lords on these benches or me i think of not being very firmly in favour of devolution on almost any occasion when we possibly can <e> <s> but i do not see the point of saying that this amendment should not be in the bill <e> <s> if it were open for local authorities to differ if they could say that punishment books might not be kept in some local authorities and it was open to some schools in their area not to keep them then one could consider the merits of the matter and one could come to the conclusion that this was a right opportunity and a right occasion for local option <e> <s> that is not the case as i understand it <e> <s> the case is that there is no option <e> <s> if there is no option why do we not write it into the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i was

order to get a supply of water as it is normally and naturally produced in the area where one was born or in which one had originally settled <e>", "<cs> i made that point my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend lord winstanley for his remarks <e> <s> he and i see eye to eye on many subjects and this amendment is not about medical evidence but purely about watchdogs on public concerns <e> <s> i tend to agree with the noble lord lord houghton when he says that he does not particularly trust ongoing reviews and that he should like periodic checks <e> <s> i too should like periodic checks <e> <s> i am delighted that there is an ongoing review as the noble baroness has said <e> <s> it seemed to me that she destroyed a lot of her case for saying that this was a cumbersome amendment <e> <s> if the department is consistently monitoring the whole situation presumably it would be extremely easy every five years to muster the evidence and consider it it would not in any way

should like to thank the minister for repeating the statement <e> <s> the undertaking that there is to be an urgent investigation into all the matters concerned is reassuring <e> <s> i imagine as the noble baroness said that there probably will not be a case for a debate on this matter in your lordships house <e> <s> nevertheless i hope that the appropriate committee will consider the matter very fully when the report is available and will in turn report to your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords the house has heard very full speeches by two of the proposers of the amendment and i do not propose to add another long speech to what they have rightly spelt out as being the major problems <e> <s> i want to explain briefly why i put my name to the amendment <e> <s> this is a subject on which we have not yet had an answer from the government <e> <s> unlike a lot of things which we have come to at this stage we did not fully discuss this matter in committee <e> <s> a large number of matters came up under the amendment which was discussed then and the details which are now before your lordships house are very different <e> <s> i think it is quite clear that amendment no <e> <s> c which the government have tabled is an effort to meet some of the problems involved <e> <s> however without going into detail on that <e>", "<cs> my lords it is my very pleasant duty to congratulate the noble baroness lady turner of camden on her maiden speech and indeed i can do so with great sincerity because we have heard a speech of extreme competence in the field and extreme compassion <e> <s> those two things are very much respected and welcomed by your lordships house <e> <s> we hope that she will make many more speeches in this house in the years to come <e>", "<cs> my lords i was casting no aspersions on the bishops themselves <e> <s> i know how very seriously they take this problem and indeed a number of them are fully associated with the body on whose behalf i was trying to speak <e>", "<cs> my lords the house is i think united behind the feeling in this amendment <e> <s> the noble lord lord colwyn spoke on the general subject and agreed very strongly with my noble friend lord winstanley whose name appears to this amendment <e> <s> the noble lord lord campbell of croy raised the point of natural fluoride <e> <s> all relevant medical and scientific evidence on the effects of fluoridation will i believe necessarily include all relevant medical and scientific evidence on the effects of fluoride <e> <s> in fact this amendment asks only for a report on fluoridation which it is clear is the addition of fluoride to drinking water <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that it does <e> <s> it is reassuring to have the undertaking that the evidence will not only be kept under review but that it will also be imparted to parliament <e> <s> i think that this meets the point <e> <s> therefore unless any of my colleagues differ i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches also welcome the general tenor of the order and note too the inadequacy of the money which has been pledged <e> <s> we understand some of the reasons why more money has not been given but i must add that i would have welcomed from the government front bench this afternoon an acknowledgment that it is inadquate as well as not merely a hope but a firm intention that the money will be increased as soon as possible <e> <s> we had an acknowledgment of that inadequacy in another place and i think i am right in saying that unless i nodded off we did not have that acknowledgment this afternoon <e> <s> i hope that before the debate is over we shall have that acknowledgment from the government <e> <s> it is extremely important <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not true that there have been major delays over the past year or so in companies receiving answers to their requests for aid to accompany their bids and that this has sometimes led to the loss of contracts <e> <s> is not really the only reason for keeping this provision with the aid budget a matter of concealing the pitiful smallness of our real aid budget <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness has not answered the major question which is is it not true that sometimes it has taken months for companies to get answers to their requests for help and should not a better way of dealing with these matters be found <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble baroness for repeating the statement <e> <s> i am appalled by the attitude and by the tone of the two statements that we have heard this afternoon <e> <s> in both cases the government appear to be treating with very severe arms length disdain the fact that they themselves have caused the troubles which the community is now reaping <e> <s> this was so when we were talking about the rioting it is so when we are talking about the very real misery which is being imposed by some of these regulations on board and lodging payments which have indeed resulted in the past in suicide and a very great deal of distress <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish very briefly this afternoon to express the support of the alliance for the ideas behind this bill <e> <s> the case for applying to south africa the sanctions and measures which it envisages is not that that country is alone in denying basic civil rights to millions of its citizens <e> <s> there are plenty of members in the club of police states <e> <s> nor is it that south africa even with all the torture and the deaths of young people which have become daily news the most brutal regime of recent times <e> <s> it is true that uganda under obote for example suffered the murder by the army of hundreds of thousands of people and we must all hope that a better day may dawn for that unhappy land <e>", "<cs> my lords as the first speaker below the line i am able to vary slightly the congratulations which are being paid to the most reverend primate for having initiated this debate because we are now able to look back and see what a good and satisfying debate it has been in many ways <e>", "<cs> my lords if i manage to keep my remarks on this occasion brief it is not because i do not feel deeply on the subject or that my colleagues do not feel deeply on the subject it is because we should like to associate ourselves entirely with everything that the noble baroness lady jeger has so admirably said <e> <s> the noble baroness lady trumpington says that we have been down this road before and a very muddy mucky and manured road it is <e> <s> she also expressed the pious hope that we shall not go over the same old arguments again <e> <s> i can well understand her desire and that of the government not to do so but the view of those who are on the receiving end of these regulations is very different <e> <s> so is the view of those who speak for them bodies such as char the campaign for single homeless people and church action on poverty <e>", "<cs> my lords that is welcome so far as it goes <e> <s> but why will the <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that statement <e> <s> may i ask him how much of what he has said will happen is new and how much of it requires new money which would not otherwise be forthcoming <e> <s> would he not agree that in view of the report which has just been produced by the church of england on the state of the inner cities something rather more thoroughgoing is called for <e>", "<cs> my lords i asked whether something more thoroughgoing was called for <e>", "<cs> my lords with this bill small as it is we are treading on the edge of a complex and emotion-charged matter <e> <s> it is a legislative minefield which i for one have long felt needed clearing up but i have always been too cowardly to attempt it lest i should do more harm than good <e> <s> it is for that reason that i am heartfelt in my thanks to the noble lord lord jenkins for bringing the bill before us and above all i am thankful for the ingenuity of those who have drafted it in this way <e> <s> it may be that it needs improving and that it can be improved but i shall come to that later <e> <s> i think that the basic idea is right <e>", "<cs> the reason for the amendment as i said in putting it forward is that in fact there is no safeguard in this bill against the discarding of the very good and important ideas involved in the guidelines <e> <s> no one is saying that it is something which would happen immediately but i think we should be careful to try to provide safeguards if possible <e>", "<cs> i absolutely take the point that my amendment as drafted is too comprehensive and too sweeping <e> <s> the points which the noble lord lord melchett and the noble earl lord selkirk made are very valid <e> <s> i am delighted that the noble lord lord glenarthur has given an undertaking to look at the possible inclusion of this in the guidelines and in view of that i am very happy to beg leave to withdraw the amendment standing in my name <e>", "<cs> can the noble earl tell us which amendment of his is badly drafted <e> <s> i cannot see it <e> <s> his amendment no <e> <s> together with my amendment no <e> <s> deal with a totally different point <e> <s> does he have another amendment which we have not seen <e>", "<cs> not only have we strayed on to a totally different amendment in the debate but it looks at moments as if people have not even read the amendment which basically we are discussing <e> <s> it merely says that the secretary of state shall take into account <e> <s> it does not say that he shall not issue licences if more than one drug company is producing the same kind of drug <e> <s> it simply says that he shall take it into account <e> <s> knowing the way in which the noble lord the minister has been responding sympathetically to the amendments put forward i was expecting him to say that the secretary of state will of course take this into account that it goes without saying that he will take it into account and that there is therefore no need to put it into the bill <e> <s> but clearly from the ministers reply that is not the case <e> <s> if it is not the case that the secretary of state will not take this into account that is all the more reason that we should have the amendment and have it on the face of the bill <e>", "<cs> this debate has given an opportunity for us to get some important information particularly on the draize test <e> <s> i certainly am considerably the wiser for that <e> <s> on the ld test i still have a basic philosophical objection to that kind of testing but i very much welcome the governments determination to go on reviewing the situation with the intention of reducing it <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i think that many of your lordships even those not present tonight will read in <e>", "<cs> i thank noble lords <e> <s> i do not think that the noble lord lord auckland was quite right <e> <s> i think that clause does not cover the point <e> <s> i should still prefer the provision to be in the body of the bill but i take the ministers point and understand his position <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> where in the amendment does it say that any of these people will have to be consulted <e> <s> the bodies appearing to represent relevant interests have to be consulted <e> <s> where is all the rigmarole about people all having to be consulted <e> <s> where is that stated in the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for coming back to us once again on this fraught subject <e> <s> we welcome the statement that the government are to identify those who are entitled to arrears of payment <e> <s> but how are they going to do it <e> <s> how are the government going to identify claimants a number of whom have disappeared from the system owing to the governments illegal action <e> <s> will they ask any of the voluntary bodies to help them to publicise the position or identify these people <e> <s> i am thinking of bodies such as the citizens advice bureaux <e> <s> if so will they privide the money to help those bodies to do so <e>", "<cs> i have the feeling from this short debate that in fact the noble earl lord selkirk and i would go rather further than the bill intends to go <e> <s> but it has been an interesting and informative debate and i think some of the references which have been quoted are matters which i for one and i daresay the noble earl lord selkirk agrees would like to look at further <e> <s> for my part although i think this will be the first of my amendments which i may want to bring back at a later stage nevertheless at this moment i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> i did not move amendment no <e> <s> which would require the secretary of state to revoke or alter <e> <s> i did not move that <e> <s> i am afraid that the ministers brief is slightly impaired as a result <e>", "<cs> as regards amendments nos <e> <s> and i am to a certain extent <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord the minister for that explanation <e> <s> i recognise that certainly my amendment goes too far as it at present stands <e> <s> i should like to take it away and read what the minister has said and talk it over with various people to see whether i think anything rather less far-reaching would need to be brought forward at a later stage but in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> we shall be coming in a moment to an amendment that i have put down with regard to the make-up of the committee <e> <s> but i thoroughly agree with the noble lord lord adrian and i think that this is a very worthwhile amendment <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> while i agree with practically every word that the noble lord lord melchett has said nevertheless i am reassured by the ministers reminder that clause has a safeguard <e> <s> it has the backstop that the committee shall make a report on its activities and that the secretary of state shall lay copies of the report before parliament <e> <s> therefore there is a safeguard <e>", "<cs> if the committee makes a report and lists the number of things which the secretary of state has not allowed it to do there will be an almighty row <e> <s> it seems to me that that is the most that one can hope for and it will happen <e>", "<cs> i want to re-examine this matter <e> <s> like the noble lord lord melchett i am not happy about it <e> <s> equally i feel that the amendments that i put forward need to be reconsidered and possibly redrafted <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his continued reassurance and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord lord glenarthur is right <e> <s> we are in danger of slipping into a committee stage <e> <s> the house always gives licence to the minister to come back at least once at report stage <e> <s> i believe however that we should now wind up the debate <e> <s> i thank the noble lord for trying to help as best he can <e> <s> i do not believe that he has in fact put forward a very good answer for not writing this into the bill <e> <s> but obviously given the goodwill of the government on this point it is not worth pressing this any further <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not pretend to be convinced <e> <s> as my noble friend lord halsbury has said it is undoubtedly another of these questions as to where you draw the dividing line between what should be in the bill and what should be in the various other documents <e> <s> i do not think that the decisions which have been made are necessarily immutable or that all of them are absolutely the right ones although i certainly think that the general basis on which they have been put forward is the right one and is the result of good thinking which is going to be very useful and helpful to the welfare of animals <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make a point because i was very struck by what the noble lord lord prys-davies said <e> <s> it seems to me that this is the moment when we put an extra ethical imperative into the bill <e> <s> as a whole as i have said before we are all agreed that this is a civilised bill of which we as civilised people approve <e> <s> there will be less pain suffered by animals yet the cause of medical research is going on <e> <s> but where a procedure involves risk of substantial pain or distress this is the moment when we should put in the extra dimension of saying that this is very serious and that not just the number of animals and the amount of suffering weighed against the amount of good is important but that it actually matters whether any animal even rat no <e> <s> out of a particular batch suffers unnecessarily <e> <s> this is important <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has produced extremely cogent arguments as to why this amendment is unnecessary <e> <s> i did not detect in what he said any real argument as to why there would be any harm in passing it i did not detect any argument that the amendment itself would do any harm <e> <s> nevertheless it is clear that the minister is right in saying that in this area there are very considerable safeguards <e> <s> i shall therefore beg the leave of the house to withdraw the amendment but not with any particular guarantee that others may not take it up on another occasion and maybe in another place <e> <s> i do not regard this argument as having been settled but i think that for this evening i shall beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the minister sounds thoroughly convincing <e> <s> i shall report what he said to my advisers in order to see what they say <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i belong to the school that believes that this matter involves a principle and a very important principle <e> <s> i am not lured by the arguments that say that if one charges for admission then one can buy the priceless masterpieces that the museums and art galleries want <e> <s> our museums and art galleries are already crammed with priceless masterpieces <e> <s> it may be that we will get the offer of some more and it may be that we shall be able to encourage rich people to help us to buy them as they have done in the past by the generous gifts that we have been told about <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise if any noble lord has been taken aback by the change in the order of speaking <e> <s> it seemed only right and proper that a prelate should take precedence over a mere parish priest <e> <s> i did my best to inform the necessary authorities but i am not sure that the messages got through <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all indebted to the noble earl lord longford for raising this subject with us once again <e> <s> if anyone has earned the right to speak to us on this subject by his long sympathy and involvement with all concerned both criminal and victims the noble earl has earned that right <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord sudeley tells us that we owe this debate to an invitation to him by the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor to put down questions from time to time <e> <s> it is not unknown for hosts to issue invitations and not be there when the visitors arrive <e> <s> i am not certain that the noble and learned lord has judged ill in doing so but we know at least whom we have to blame <e>", "<cs> my lords during or years of speaking on education subjects in this house i have heard a great deal of nonsense talked about various education subjects and no doubt have contributed my own share <e> <s> of the various subjects talked about a great majority of the nonsense has been on language teaching and the necessity for teaching languages to children almost universally <e>", "<cs> my lords as this debate draws towards its close i feel like one of those fish who sees being trailed across the water over its head a fishing line baited at intervals with luscious looking baits and hooks <e> <s> i shall attempt not to seize any of those lures <e>"]
