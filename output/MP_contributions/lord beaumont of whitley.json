["<cs> my lords we very much welcome this <e>", "<cs> we too on these benches are concerned about this matter and would support this amendment but we would withhold our judgment until we hear what the government have to say <e> <s> the relationship of any special schools and the ordinary educational system is very much in the melting pot at the moment as the noble baroness had told us before <e> <s> while i think it is an immense pity that we have not been able to deal with these matters while this bill is going through nevertheless we must look carefully at the various arguments <e> <s> in principle i am sure that this amendment should be supported widely throughout the chamber <e>", "<cs> i am extremely grateful to the noble baroness the minister <e> <s> i am sure that this is an improvement <e> <s> i did not at any stage consider that my drafting or the insertion at this point were necessarily right and i look forward to the amendment which the government will bring forward on report <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> there is a great deal in what the noble lord has said as one would expect of someone with his great experience but i think the case that he has so ably deployed is in fact a rather backward-looking one <e> <s> there are enormous difficulties in producing a popularly controlled and democratically elected number of people to serve on these bodies but we think that the forward way is the way which was recommended in the report of the taylor committee <e> <s> we think that because it is quite clear that over the last or years citizens of this country and not just of the middle classes have been becoming more and more interested in having some real say in the institutions which govern their lives <e>", "<cs> if the minister hopes that the debate and the fact that this amendment has been put forward will encourage such people to come forward and encourage people to appoint them how much more so would that be the case if this were written into the bill <e> <s> i am not entirely happy with the wording of the amendment it is not just the needs of industry and agriculture although of course it includes those because it concerns the needs of the children to know about these things and perhaps at a later stage we could have another look at the wording <e> <s> nevertheless this is an important amendment and the minister has not answered it <e> <s> maximum flexibility would in no way be impaired by acceptance of the amendment nor can we leave it to the local authorities as anyone who looks round some of the local authorities and their appointments will be aware <e> <s> i therefore hope the amendment will be pressed to a division <e>", "<cs> i accept what the minister says <e> <s> i had a feeling when drafting the amendment that i did not fully understand the clause <e> <s> however i hope that the committee will have some sympathy with me <e> <s> i am delighted that the government have covered the point in the bill <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps the committee will take notice of the fact that i said not moved before the noble baroness spoke so that i do not have to come back quite so soon after dinner <e>", "<cs> it may be for the assistance of the committee if i say that we on these benches are not entirely happy with the government response to our amendments and therefore we think it right to divide this argument as it is divided on the order paper into two because if we do not get the right response we are prepared to divide the committee on both sections <e> <s> there are certain matters which i would adduce in reply to the ministers comments on amendment no <e> <s> paragraphs <e>", "<cs> it is not our intention to test this in the lobbies tonight <e> <s> i think that after the last exchange it is surely right that we should give the government time to go away and think <e> <s> this committee has shown in the speeches that we are not at all partisan <e> <s> there is a very real point here and a very real feeling that there should be something written into the bill to give guidelines to encourage those authorities which have the right ideas and to discourage those which have the wrong ones <e> <s> the noble lord lord james said that to write into the bill that people on the governing bodies should have special knowledge of educational matters and should have personal links with the relevant schools and live in the immediate neighbourhood of the schools was as platitudinous as to say that they should be clean honest and sober <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness lady young has just produced an extremely good reason for supporting this amendment <e> <s> if there are really going to be three parents and three teachers let us have it <e>", "<cs> at the moment all the noble baroness is <e>", "<cs> when the noble lord lord donaldson puts on his angry act it is usually rather disingenuous <e> <s> quite often it is a way of distinguishing between the pure motives which no doubt distinguish him from some of the less pure motives from the benches behind him <e> <s> i wish to substantiate that statement <e> <s> it is not that he is seeking to lay blame on the benches behind him but he is wishing to distract our attention from what is being said on the benches behind him <e> <s> listening to the speeches that have been made from the back benches of the labour party it is amazing how many of them have been about how this provision will in fact be a nuisance to the authorities <e> <s> on these benches we are much more interested that it should be an advantage to the parents <e> <s> the noble lord lord donaldson and other members of the labour benches know perfectly well that when we talk about freedom of choice and it merely means freedom by the purse we are on their side and we vote with them because we know that when it is put forward it is a sham <e> <s> however it seems to us that as regards the particular case which is being put forward by the government there is genuine choice only for a limited number of people and only partial choice under regulations <e> <s> but of course what more could it be <e> <s> it is a genuine extension of choice and if there is a division we shall vote with the government <e>", "<cs> i must say that before the noble lord got up to speak i was inclined to support the government because i thought that the amendment would not have any effect <e>", "<cs> no i am sorryi am not going to rise to that bait <e> <s> the noble lord myself and other noble lords who are speaking in this debate have been over this time and time again <e> <s> i have argued the straight comprehensive system against him before now and i am prepared to do it again but i do not honestly think that this is the time to do it <e>", "<cs> i should be interested whether the noble <e>", "<cs> the minister has not answered the specific question i asked how does she think parents can be satisfied with an appeals committee which has a majority representing those who made the original decision <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble viscount will forgive me <e> <s> i bow to him but i would like to put the official liberal view which will be very short and then the noble viscount can proceed <e> <s> the noble earl lord swinton does me an injustice when he says that i would be surprised about the small number of appeals <e> <s> i know there are any number of really good authorities where the unofficial or official appeal system works extremely well and i have absolutely no doubt that his is one <e> <s> equally i have no doubt that the government are absolutely right to establish some kind of formal appeal system which is written into the bill <e> <s> there are plenty of things which may be wrong with it partly because it may be almost impossible to have a bill which is absolutely rightbut i am certain that it is better to have one appeal system even if it is imperfect than to have none at all <e>", "<cs> the noble viscount lord ridley put forward an extremely good reason just now for keeping in this subsection not that i have anything against welsh members of county councils as your lordships will understandindeed i would not dare to in the presence of those who are with us tonight <e> <s> but i think it would be right that the chairman of the appeal committee should not only not be a member of the education committee but indeed should not be a member of the council <e>", "<cs> since we have been appealed to i must say that for various reasons we think that the schedule is imperfect although the reasons would very often be diametrically opposite to those held by the labour front bench <e> <s> however the fact that we think that it is in some ways imperfect will i think move us to look more closely at it at the report stage and not to oppose it <e>", "<cs> we are all grateful to the noble lord lord wells-pestell for his constructive suggestion because this is a unique <e>"]
