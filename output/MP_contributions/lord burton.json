the noble lord lord gibson said this matter can be looked at again <e> <s> the problem seems to arise where there is no planning control <e> <s> so far as i can see there is no great difficulty where there is planning control because before anything is done the planning committee will be consulted and the ncc will have their say before the planning committee <e> <s> the problem arises if i understood the noble lord lord gibson correctly where there is no planning control such as in ploughing up some ground or blanket planting of an area of ground <e> <s> some of us have complained bitterly about the forestry commission doing this <e> <s> there is no planning control on that <e> <s> also for that matter in some cases destroying a natural area <e>", "<cs> the noble lord accused me of misleading the committee <e> <s> i think that he is misleading the committee now <e> <s> he said that it is only a matter of serving a notice <e> <s> in fact if you have to get planning

memorandum under the heading financial effects of the bill <e> <s> it says <e>", "<cs> from what my noble friend lord inglewood has said perhaps this only applies to england but if it does apply to scotland i point out that we do not have county councils <e>", "<cs> having been a chairman of a roads committee i find the answer given by the noble lord is not altogether correct <e> <s> the first fence if a road is widened and a fence has been demolished it must be replaced by the road authority <e> <s> but where there is no fence they are under no obligation to put up a fence despite the fact that in one case the land court stipulated that a fence should be erected because the situation had changed they had made a fast road which was dangerous <e> <s> that caused considerable ructions in the ministry of transport <e> <s> i am not sure what the final outcome was <e> <s> certainly the first fence should be and is the responsibility of the ministry of transport <e> <s> thereafter it is not <e> <s> that is partly what causes the trouble because if you replace a wall with a fence the fence will last only seven eight or years whereas a wall may last for years apart from the amenity value <e>", "<cs> any road if a fence is removed by a roads authority they are bound to replace it <e>", "<cs> as the law is somewhat different in scotland and the problem of motor bicyles on footpaths there is rapidly increasing i wonder whether my noble friend would look at this at the same time as he is looking at the situation in england <e> <s> i think that perhaps part of the trouble with this motor-cycle cross-country business is that it is not properly organised <e> <s> if the riders had behind them a national organisation like the british horse society there might he a great many fewer problems <e>", "<cs> i am sorry about that last remark of the noble lord lord houghton because i thought that we had a unique occasion when he was agreeing with these benches in which case probably the amendment ought to go through if it was unanimous <e> <s> it is sad that both front benches have taken the attitude they have and in particular the noble lord lord melchett because in the course of our dealing with this bill he has spoken on a number of occasions about the need for agreement with europe <e> <s> in most european countries unlike the fine which is suggested here the dog would be shot <e> <s> it seems to me that this amendment is the most moderate of proposals <e> <s> it seems the greatest pity that the noble lord lord houghton made that last remark because the greatest cruelty arises through the worrying of sheep and anything that can be done to control dogs surely must be in the interests of the countryside the interests of this bill and the interests of everyone in this country <e>", "<cs> i believe a lot of this trouble has arisen because a number of notices have been put up beware of the bull when in fact there was no danger at all <e> <s> it was done in order to keep people out possibly for one reason alone that farmers were afraid of gates being left open in view of the trouble which arises when stock is let out <e> <s> there are also the problems of litter and fires <e> <s> at least two noble lords have referred to the difference between scotland and england <e> <s> if you meet a wild bull if there is one or a wild cow on an open hillside you have a lot further to run than you do in a closed field and therefore i think the argument that has been put forward is totally invalid <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will give way for a second he was misinterpreting me again <e> <s> what i said was that it is further to run if you are out on the open hill <e> <s> i have in fact been caught by a cow in a field and i was jolly glad

<s> the mares are out in the wild there and i feel that we should not rush into this without further consideration <e> <s> many stallions if they want to get to a mare will jump out of a good many obstacles so to have them shut in one field may not have the desired effect <e> <s> furthermore as my noble friend lord massereene and ferrard said highland stallions run out with the mares <e> <s> we will take a stallion out and bring in the stags <e> <s> he goes out with a mare very often <e> <s> if this is going to apply i would ask the minister whether he would consider it not applying in scotland <e>", "<cs> there seems to be no mention of forestry here <e> <s> whereas this amendment might be applicable on agricultural grounds it seems to be totally impracticable as regards forestry <e> <s> i think that it would be quite impossible for the forestry commission to have any forest walks if they were unable to cut down the trees <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lords who introduced this debate <e> <s> certainly it has come at a timely moment <e> <s> the situation is serious <e> <s> first i must declare an interest as i have been responsible for planting in the region of acres or to be more modern about hectares <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> i think that the forestry commission and other noble lords will bear this out have a lot of land which is not plantable and i am sure he would not object to that being sold <e> <s> there is a lot of high ground particularly in scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment does not include schedule part ii birds which i think has been referred to as the pest schedule <e> <s> one of the species of birds which is particularly injurious in the countryside is the hooded crow and the carrion crow <e> <s> they are one of the latest birds to come to roost and one of the times that one wants to shoot them is when there is no moon because otherwise one has to sit up all night watching in the moonlight and hoping to get them <e> <s> as they come in to roost so late an hour after sunset this amendment would make it impossible to shoot them coming into their roosts which is one of the most effective methods <e> <s> how anyone could possibly mistake a bewicks swan for a goose i do not know but i suspect that any shooting of bewicks swans has been entirely intentional and has not been by mischance as the noble lord would like to suggest <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the strongest arguments put forward by the noble lord lord melchett was that birdwatchers wanted to look at birds on sundays <e> <s> he went on to try to impress us with the number of areas in england which were already closed to shooting on sundays <e> <s> it seems therefore that there is already a large part of the country where birdwatchers can go on a sunday and where there cannot be any shooting taking place <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply and no doubt that will be the best course <e> <s> it has been suggested that these birds be put on schedule <e> <s> that would cause an awful upset in forestry circles <e>", "<cs> no my lords i think it came from the noble lord lord melchett <e> <s> i have not said so <e> <s> to put it on schedule would cause a lot of difficulties <e> <s> the amendment is a conservation measure <e> <s> a number of those who have knowledge of the capercaillie have supported me on this <e> <s> it is interesting to note that the main opposition came from lord melchett <e> <s> this is definitely a conservation measure and he is leading the conservation lobby and it seems extraordinary that he should be so inconsistent as to oppose me on this <e> <s> in view of my noble friends proposals i hope he will consider the matter and come back on third reading <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord lord donaldson has a point about trying to reconcile the seasons and get them together but may i suggest that for once england might come into line with scotland <e> <s> so far as i can see there would be no great objection to removing paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall probably be shot by some wildfowler for suggesting this but if the arguments of the noble lord lord melchett are factual could not subsection of this clause be implemented in any year when the weather might be hard and would that not solve a lot of his problems <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord said it could not be controlled in scotland <e> <s> am i not right in thinking that the local authority can impose by-laws <e> <s> in fact i think they have done so in a number of areas <e>", "<cs> my lords has there ever been a case where a farmer has vetoed a bird sanctuary <e>", "<cs> my lords the next amendment is down in my name and is on exactly the same subject <e> <s> i am happy to accept my noble friends wording <e> <s> as we have different words on the same theme it shows that we are of the same mind while not being in collusion <e> <s> i understand that this matter has gone to the eec but we should not wait too long for the bureaucracy there to deal with it we should have the matter dealt with by third reading <e> <s> we should not send a bill of this type to another place containing something of which we do not approve <e> <s> if an answer has not been received from the eec by third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask a question on this point <e> <s> i think that on this one unique occasion i may be in agreement with the noble lord lord houghton <e> <s> looking at clause the interpretation clause i am not sure that anything in subsection is defined <e> <s> i know that when we tried to get a crossbow included in the deer legislation there was some difficulty in defining a crossbow <e> <s> perhaps this might be looked at in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i was accused of not having figures but i quoted the fact that there were no fewer than pairs nesting in one estate which is more than the figures produced by the noble lord lord melchett <e> <s> my noble friend lord margadale mentioned this on second reading and several noble lords this evening have mentioned the situation <e> <s> these birds are expanding quickly in number <e> <s> how the figures are compiled i am not sure <e> <s> nobody has had permission <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that assurance <e> <s> in that case i suspect that no count has been done on a large chunk of scotland and therefore the remarks made by my noble friend on the front bench saying that the hen harriers had failed to regain lost ground showed that there were no statistics to prove this to be the case <e> <s> this is what worries me <e> <s> then we would have our employees landed with the same penalty as someone who takes osprey eggs <e> <s> in view of the assurances from my noble friend on the front bench one must withdraw the amendment but it is a worrying case and i hope he will look at it carefully <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords there was some accusation about poisoning the birds <e> <s> i believe these birds are not basically carrion eaters <e> <s> therefore if they are doing fresh kills i am not sure how these wild accusations are made <e> <s> furthermore though i thought it was degrading schedule to keep the hen harrier on it

rapidly recovering <e> <s> to put this bird on schedule would degrade the schedule <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not feel very strongly on this but i wonder whether anyone can give us some idea of the magnitude of the problem <e> <s> i would have thought that the number of these birds which are shot is very small <e> <s> i may be quite wrong about this but nobody has given us any facts and if it is only a small number why should we bother about it <e>", "<cs> my lords once again i have had this question of numbers thrown at me and have been accused of producing no evidence as to what damage is done <e> <s> recently fishery boards have stocked a river and i have seen the fish that they have put in mopped up wholesale by merganzers <e> <s> it must be quite disheartening to them if they are able to do nothing about it <e> <s> a rapid increase in the numbers when they have had no protection seems to be the answer <e> <s> the conservationists cause looses much goodwill when they move to protect birds which are increasing and doing damage <e> <s> i think that the question of being a host to the fish worms must be looked at very carefully <e> <s> if it is contrary to the eec convention i suppose that we shall have to comply with the convention <e> <s> but this constantly comes up in the bill <e> <s> it seems a great pity that this convention was signed before either house of parliament discussed it <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords had the noble lords friend any permission to remove the snares <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to hear sound sense coming at last and coming from the noble viscount lord thurso because it comes from scotland <e> <s> a lot of this fury appears to have arisen in england although in proportion scotland is far more acutely affected <e> <s> at preceding stages i have been accused of not giving figures <e> <s> scotland of course represents only a small proportion of the land area of the united kingdom but one-third of all the sssis in the united kingdom refer to land in scotland and one half of the total acreage covered by sssis lies north of the border <e> <s> for instance the whole of the tweed valley is classified as such <e>", "<cs> my lords as one who also advocated this at the second reading may i also add my congratulations to my noble friend <e> <s> i was a little concerned about consultations because i understood this morning that one body which has an interest was not asked to make their observations before august which seems to me to be a little late <e> <s> provided the minister is happy that consultation will take place before this bill finishes its passage through the other place then it is very satisfactory indeed and we must congratulate all concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords surely they can go on reviewing this <e> <s> it would be quite valueless if they did not go on reviewing the special or whatever you like to call it sssi <e>", "<cs> my lords may i make one small observation <e> <s> i am just wondering whether this amendment is correct <e> <s> i think that the noble lord wanted it to refer to areas designated as sssis but what it says is special interest <e> <s> i am just wondering whether that is sufficient <e> <s> i do not know how the forestry commission know that something is of special interest unless it is actually designated and the amendment as worded might be faulty <e>", "<cs> my lords i support my noble friend lord gibson-watt in what he has said <e> <s> in one area i know where the public very much like to walk there was the most awful outcry when one had to cut down some timber <e> <s> one cannot have it both ways <e> <s> one cannot say that one does not want the situation altered because one must not grow trees in a particular place and then when there are trees there is an outcry in the other direction when you want to cut them down <e>", "<cs> my lords earlier in this debate there was talk about battle lines being drawn <e> <s> it seems a wonderful occasion now when the back-benches on this side seem to be united with those opposite <e> <s> i am one of the few who will get up and say that i am not

definition he is right on this <e> <s> there are one or two other problems which arise <e> <s> i hope that the government will accept this in principle because we are all absolutely in agreement on the principle of this issue <e> <s> if the government can draft an amendment for third reading this would be most valuable <e> <s> i hope my noble friend on the front bench will agree with this <e>", "<cs> my lords since the committee stage i have carried out a good deal of research on this amendment <e> <s> noble lords may wonder why i have such an interest in this particular matter <e> <s> i have been a district commissioner of the pony club for years and naturally as such i am most interested in the safety of children riding and also in the welfare of ponies <e> <s> my researches have revealed that the breed societies <e>", "<cs> my lords could not the proposal read <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just ask what exactly is impracticable <e> <s> if something is extremely expensive is that to be considered to be impracticable <e> <s> i can understand that if something is going to be eroded again that would be impracticable but what about cost <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank my noble friend for that very lengthy and useful answer to the amendment <e> <s> first i should like to say to the noble lord lord underhill that i appreciate that of course there is a commercial use for the canals <e> <s> in fact the income as he probably knows was from commercial uses whereas leisure produced only <e> <s> i am wondering whether the leisure side is paying as much as it should because these waterways cost a great deal of money to maintain <e> <s> furthermore the reason why i made remarks about leisure uses as opposed to commercial uses was that the noble lord lord winstanley said that my noble friend lord bellwin indicated that the main purpose of the inland waterways network was frankly recreational <e>", "<cs> i should like to make two short points <e> <s> i am rather at a loss to understand how the north-west water authority managed to expend i think not as is stated in <e>", "<cs> i should like to raise one point on clause <e> <s> it is a question of individual water pipes <e> <s> i believe that this question arose through urban development particularly where council houses were being sold <e> <s> will the government please look at the rural situation where when a pipe is renewed if the public supply is not close enough to the individual dwelling three or four lengths of pipe may have to be used where only one has existed before <e> <s> i can think of one particular instance of two cottages and a farm building <e> <s> if these cottages were separated away it would involve quite a long piece of pipe to reach the individual properties whereas probably it would be better for the mains to be moved nearer to them <e> <s> i do not know whether i have made that clear <e>", "<cs> i join my noble friend lord nugent in welcoming the new clause on which i have three points to make <e> <s> the first is that it says the provision shall come into force on a day to be appointed by the secretary of state <e> <s> can my noble friend give any indication as to when it is likely to come into force <e> <s> secondly can he give any indication at all of the extra cost which is likely to call on water authorities <e> <s> that may go part of the way to answer what lord nugent was saying <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for his answer to the question about the starting date <e> <s> if the actual starting date cannot be fixed can consideration be given to advancing the date of liability even if payment is to come at a later date <e> <s> i should like my noble friend to think about that i do not want an answer at this stage <e> <s> i gather that we are pressed for time and so i shall raise now a point which i had intended to raise on a later amendment <e> <s> the scottish local authorities have apparently been refusing to pay compensation unless the aggrieved person can prove that the authority concerned was negligent <e> <s> clearly that is a very hard thing to do <e> <s> can the minister tell me whether or not the scottish authorities are right in withholding compensation in such cases <e> <s> if the authorities have a right to withhold compensation unless negligence is proved can the government give an assurance that scotland will be brought into line with england on this matter <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for giving a little perhaps on this and for his helpful reply <e> <s> i only hope that scottish local authorities are not as unhelpful as my noble friend lord nugent seems to have been on the english part <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may also add my congratulations to my noble friend lord elphin-stone <e> <s> your lordships will be pleased to hear that he made a number of points which i had down to make myself so that has cut down the length of my speech <e> <s> there is little doubt that there is great worry in the farming community at the current financial situation in british agriculture and i cannot believe that at least some of the rumblings of the grave situation have not penetrated government circles <e> <s> as my noble friend lord gisborough has said there was a drop last year of per cent <e> <s> in united kingdom farm incomes but the governments own figures show that in scotland the drop in that income was per cent <e> <s> it was down to million in total as opposed to million in <e> <s> the total income of all scottish farms was only one month of british leyland losses <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that my noble friend was not advised that the amendment was faulty at the report stage because we might have corrected <e>", "<cs> my lords i must disagree with my noble friend lord onslow <e> <s> i certainly agree with <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i could reply to my noble friends lord renton and lord onslow <e> <s> they both referred to the position of gundogs <e> <s> i think

not the case that there has been only a slow increase there has been a very rapid increase in these birds <e> <s> if they were to continue like this i should be very concerned about <e>", "<cs> my lords once again i have to say that the governments advisers are wrong <e> <s> there are goosanders on one raft yet the government say that the total population of europe is only pairs <e> <s> i cannot believe that half of them are on that raft <e> <s> my noble friend says that they are not nationwide <e> <s> it depends which nation he is referring to <e> <s> the whole of scotland has merganzers and goosanders <e> <s> they may not be found throughout the united kingdom as a whole <e> <s> this information is extremely dicey <e> <s> we want to look very carefully at the composition of these bird protection lists as drawn up by the secretary of states advisory committee <e> <s> people are protecting injurious birds for no apparently good reason <e>", "<cs> my lords may i by leave reply to my noble friends question <e> <s> the goosanders are on the island of gigha which is off the west coast of scotland <e> <s> they were counted by bird experts not by me <e> <s> some of the very people who are supposed to be giving figures counted them so they cannot be right in all respects <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords how many prosecutions were there as regards the allegations which the noble lord is making <e> <s> how many prosecutions have there been in view of the fact that that action is clearly contrary to the existing law <e>", "<cs> my lords how many prosecutions were there <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not wish to detain your lordships for long <e> <s> while i appreciate the good intentions of the noble lord lord houghton i am afraid that i must tell the house that this bill would be devastating for scottish agriculture which is already struggling as i have said recently with an average net income for the holdings of per annum per holding <e> <s> which of your lordships will expect anyone in this country today to work often for long hours for as little as or less than a year <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to agree with my noble friend <e> <s> some of us would have a great deal more sympathy with the birdwatching fraternity who appear to want an excluded day of the week if one felt that the birds would get some peace <e> <s> but i know of a heronry which has been completely deserted because the birdwatchers have arrived and photographed it and driven the birds away altogether <e> <s> this summer there was a rare diver nesting on a log not very far from me <e> <s> one could see into the nest from the overhanging bank by means of a telescope but one day a bearded wonder arrived in a rubber boat and put the bird off the nest <e> <s> these are the sort of disturbances and troubles that we have to put up with and clearly he was not one of the shooting fraternity <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask whether it in fact means any other live animal <e> <s> because it does not say so <e> <s> ft says live bird but other animal <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say that i think it is a great pity that the bill was not left in the same plain condition as it left this house rather than having this amendment attached to it <e> <s> certainly the government amendment to the commons amendment is a slight improvement but i am afraid that this really comes from the more populated areas and does not take account of the really remote areas where foxes can be a great problem and can inflict a great deal of damage and suffering upon lambs for example <e> <s> in these remote areas if one visits a snare even once a day let alone twice the probability is that a fox will never come near because the smell of the human being will still be there <e> <s> of course it is rather different in the suburbs of london where foxes now abound because they are used to it but in the remote areas they are not used to seeing human beings and the snare is really therefore almost ineffective as a means of catching animals there <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not intended to speak but if this bill is to proceed i think that perhaps the noble lord lord willis might like to look at a small <e>", "<cs> my lords has my noble friend the minister considered that possibly the best way of reducing the prison population would be to increase the penalties because then the deterrent would be greater there would be fewer people coming before our courts and therefore fewer to go to gaol <e>", "<cs> my lords my

number of points in it to which we shall have to return at a later stage <e> <s> if my speech is a little disjointed it is because i have tried to delete large sections of what i have written down on this heap of paper since my noble friend lord dulverton who is sitting behind me has made many excellent points <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend on the front bench will not only listen to but will act upon what my noble friend lord dulverton has said <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it depends whether or not you call ireland civilised <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask a question <e> <s> am i not right

or three noble lords whose speeches i missed when i was called out of the chamber for a few minutes <e> <s> i shall certainly read their speeches with interest <e> <s> i too should like to add my very sincere thanks to my noble friend lady elliot for initiating this interesting debate but unlike some of my noble friends who said they regretted the delay i should like to say that i rather welcome it at this time because i think this is a particularly opportune moment at which this debate should be held <e> <s> so often different speakers talk on the same subject in these debates as they happen to be topical or perhaps because there has been a lobby document sent round to a number of your lordships <e> <s> as a result i am trying to refrain from talking on the nfu circulars but this does not mean that i do not agree with them <e> <s> i think i agree with them in their entirety <e>", "<cs> i am not at all happy about withdrawing this <e> <s> perhaps there could be more consideration given to it <e> <s> if the powers of the commission are to be extended to roe deer without fallow deer then i hardly feel that my noble friend can call it a modest extension <e> <s> there are far more roe deer than red deer in scotland <e> <s> therefore if they are to look after roe deer as well and after all this amendment says that it will mean that they will be furthering the conservation and control of roe deer if the secretary of state gives them these powers then the work of the commission must be more than doubled <e> <s> they will be a deer commission and not a red deer commission and they are not constituted as such <e> <s> this wants carefully looking at <e> <s> i sat in on all the working party meetings in the red deer commission offices <e> <s> not in my recollection did the working party at any time come out with a recommendation that the red deer commission should look after roe deer <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i beg to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am not entirely happy with that <e> <s> a lot depends on the wind and the weather and so on and the deer still move about considerably <e> <s> i think that this would largely arise when the commission were considering making some sort of a control order <e> <s> i think it undesirable if a control order is made without considering the deer on the neighbouring land <e> <s>

much more accurate return to the red deer commission <e>", "<cs> i am afraid i think this is a very good amendment and it is important that we should have it in the bill <e> <s> i have quickly looked at amendment no <e> <s> which i think is the one my noble friend has referred to and i do not think that really meets the case at all whereas this one does <e> <s> this is in three parts <e> <s> there is the prior information of intention to kill and i think that is only reasonable because after all why should anyone be allowed to run about on somebody elses ground at night with a light so that the staff will wonder what on earth is going on with no information having been given beforehand <e> <s> surely it is reasonable for some information to be given <e> <s> later on i see there is an amendment to the effect that the police should be notified <e> <s> then of course there is the intimation of what is to be killed <e> <s> if a landowner is to control his deer properly he must know what is to be killed and he must know in reasonable time otherwise the season for that particular species or sex could have expired <e> <s> i do not think that days is too long a period <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend withdraws the amendment i wonder whether any noble lords here have had experience of tenants running around their property at night with a light and without any notification <e> <s> it is an extreme aggravation to the staff who are supposed to look after that ground <e> <s> you do not know what the lights are doing in the fields or the woods <e> <s> i have quoted what happened on three or four different occasions this winter <e> <s> i was taken up by the noble lord lord john-mackie who admitted that he himself did not have much experience <e> <s> but i have had practical experience and i do not see how your lordships can tolerate people running around at night in this way <e>", "<cs> i do not want to take up your lordships time on this amendment <e> <s> there is not a great deal to choose between serious and substantial <e> <s> however the word substantial was chosen by the working party when we discussed the legislation in inverness with practically all the parties involved <e> <s> it seems to have been the preferred word <e> <s> this matter was discussed by a number of other bodies upon which i sat and they all seemed to prefer the word substantial to the word serious <e> <s> if on the other hand the noble lord lord northfield who has no doubt studied the matter considers that the word serious is better than the word substantial i shall be happy to accept it <e> <s> nevertheless i should prefer the word substantial to be retained <e>", "<cs> i am a bit of a quandary because i am not sure that the noble lord is not right <e> <s> on the other hand my noble friend behind me lord dulverton has proposed very much better wording than this <e> <s> i believe that for the first time this evening my noble friend who is moving the bill may agree that this particular part of the bill is not well worded and that it certainly wants revising <e> <s> but whether we should revise it by taking the amendment moved by the noble lord lord northfield and removing lines and altogether or whether we use my noble friend lord dulvertons amendment leaves me in a bit of a quandary <e>", "<cs> would it be possible for the two amendments to be discussed together <e> <s> if we can hear what the noble lord lord dulverton has to say then we might be able to decide which amendment to concentrate on <e>", "<cs> i shall have great pleasure in withdrawing the amendment <e> <s> i am delighted that at long last we have found something on which we largely agree <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> if my noble friend had ended his amendment at section and left out as may be practicable then i would have been quite happy <e> <s> however what i am concerned about here is that the commission would be out they would find some roe deer about and they would shoot them and then they <e>", "<cs> i should like to draw attention to subsection where it says and <e> <s> this would permit the red deer commission to shoot roe deer at night <e> <s> from what your lordships said on second reading i got the impression that most of your lordships were very opposed to roe deer being shot at night <e> <s> i should like to draw attention to this matter because i think that perhaps we should look at it again on report <e>", "<cs> on this occasion i think that i must disagree with the noble lord lord houghton <e> <s> the current chairman is very fit and active and we hope that he will be there for many years yet <e>", "<cs> i was delighted to hear the noble lord lord northfield talking about the powers of apprehension of poachers since clearly these are sadly lacking in the bill <e> <s> i had made a note to mention the point later but he has beaten me to the gun <e>", "<cs> i had not expected to enter into this realm tonight because this question of the apprehension of poachers is not dealt with particularly in the bill but without the authority of the landowner the police cannot pursue a poacher on to someones land and apprehend him <e> <s> equally the landowner or his staff cannot apprehend a poacher they are not allowed to arrest him <e> <s> clearly this is something you can do in england <e> <s> the law is very much stronger in england and this is something which wants to be taken into account <e> <s> on the other hand there was a prosecution in the kirkcudbright sheriff court which is after all a little nearer the home of the noble lord lord ross of marnock only a fortnight ago in which a poacher who they all knew had been at it for some time got three months in gaol for shooting seven red deer i think it was with a shotgun <e>", "<cs> no but that was just one a fortnight ago <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that my noble friend has not been able to give more of an undertaking that legislation is pending rather than saying that the farm animal welfare council are getting round to it <e> <s> could he not expedite this <e> <s> i think that it is urgent now <e> <s> there are lots of complications arising <e> <s> deer farmers are anxious to get something in and they have approached me about this <e> <s> if my noble friend is not able to give an assurance of something forthcoming in the near future i shall try to put something into this bill later <e>", "<cs> i welcome the last remarks from my noble friend lord mansfield in particular his remarks about the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby <e> <s> i was going to say that i am sorry if he had a guilty conscience <e> <s> this must be one occasion when the farm animal welfare council would be welcomed by the farmers <e> <s> i hope that having drawn this to his attention there will be effort to get them to co-operate with the farmers and try and get some suitable legislation at an early date <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> with your lordships leave on that undertaking i have great pleasure in withdrawing the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am trying to increase the area in which the secretary of state would have powers to make orders <e> <s> this is the important side of the argument <e> <s> i am not saying that these sights should or should not be used <e> <s> however new devices are coming along all the time <e> <s> therefore it is important that we should look <e>", "<cs> apart from the minister the noble viscount lord thurso was one of the few who spoke against the amendment <e> <s> he spoke about the matter being phased in <e> <s> this occurs hardly at all <e> <s> there is absolutely no need <e> <s> there is no question of phasing it in <e> <s> it is used on so few occasions anyway except as has been said it has been used for wounding deer <e> <s> i do not think that we should allow this to continue <e>", "<cs> when we began discussing the amendment i thought that there was a good deal of agreement between my noble friend the minister and the noble lord lord northfield and that it was just a matter of drafting <e> <s> it now appears however that there is a difference and that the government may produce a different schedule from that proposed in the amendment <e> <s> the one proposed by lord northfield is already in operation in england and has proved to be effective <e> <s> further it seems to cover much of the point made by my noble friend lord dulverton in that it would partly take the place of a movement record <e> <s> if only the minister had said that he would accept the schedule when the time is ripe after the passing of the civic government scotland bill i think there would have been no difficulty <e>", "<cs> i think the noble lord lord ross of marnock and to some extent the noble viscount lord thurso are oversimplifying matters <e> <s> the noble lord lord ross said that this bill was perhaps oversimplifying things <e> <s> both referred to the protection of crops <e> <s> i do not believe that anybody would object to a person protecting his crops but this is not where the buck stops <e> <s> the trouble is that too many people are looking for the profit motive <e> <s> far too many deer are being killed out of season and at night entirely for what the occupier can get out of it namely what he can sell the deer for <e> <s> he can usually sell the deer for a good deal more than the damage which he has suffered if any <e> <s> at the moment he does not even need to have any damage caused by deer <e> <s> if there are any deer on his ground he can kill them <e>", "<cs> perhaps i might do the noble lords arithmetic for him <e> <s> if the noble lord lord ross of marnock will look at the column for venison dealers rather than the column for estates he find at the bottom the number of stags killed in season and stags killed out of season <e> <s> if one adds those two figures together one gets the total number of stags killed <e> <s> if one then takes the number of stags killed out of season the figure is almost one-fifth or per cent <e>", "<cs> here again we have the position where apparently the occupier is going to be allowed to authorise people to shoot on his ground without possibly the owner knowing anything about it <e> <s> this seems to be totally unreasonable <e> <s> i cannot understand why my noble friend lord glenarthur cannot accept this amendment i thought that he would be quite amenable to it <e>", "<cs> we know that many of the people who have been authorised in the past have not been satisfactory and that is why my noble friend moved his amendment which i believe has now been accepted that there should be some restriction on the occupier as to whom he can authorise <e> <s> with due respect to the red deer commission they do not necessarily know everything that is going on <e> <s> i can think of another body that has landed me with some very unsatisfactory tenants which it would not have done had it known the background of those people <e> <s> all we are doing in this case is to say that the owner should be notified who is coming on to his ground so that if the person is undesirable the red deer commission can be told and the undesirable person would not get authorisation <e>", "<cs> i would so like to agree with what my noble friend has just said <e> <s> to come back to what the noble viscount lord thurso has said i cannot see how he can defend that per cent <e> <s> of all the stags killed are killed out of season <e> <s> that is a valuable asset which is being wasted to a large extent <e> <s> you will not get any rates for those stags <e> <s> there will not be any rent for those stags and the venison is very much inferior <e> <s> in <e>", "<cs> it has been said that there is little hope for this amendment but i cannot quite understand why <e> <s> this amendment is to try to stop up a loophole in the existing law which is widely abused at the present time <e> <s> surely neither the nfu nor any other body would insist on retaining an abuse and this amendment is stopping up that abuse <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord john-mackie referred to the damage which has been caused in forestry commission plantings <e> <s> may i ask him can he tell us whether there is any restriction on the hours the rangers can work <e> <s> there are some excellent men there but clearly if you are to control deer properly you cannot be fixed to civil servants hours <e> <s> can he tell us what sort of hours the rangers are allowed to work <e> <s> secondly with his experience of the forestry commission does he not know that roe deer should be shot selectively <e> <s> if you shoot the wrong ones you cause extra damage <e> <s> that is now a well-established fact and it is about time the forestry commission learnt that <e>", "<cs> it was the question of the rangers hours <e>", "<cs> i do not think the noble lord answered either of the points that i put to him but perhaps we can come back to them <e> <s> we ought to be quite clear i am afraid that a lot of trouble in the forestry commissions plantings has been caused not through any fault of the deer but entirely because of mismanagement by the forestry commission <e>", "<cs> i believe the thing to do would be to leave out either and sika or or sika <e> <s> i do not see why the poor sika should be persecuted if we are not going to persecute my noble friends fallow deer or any other deer <e> <s> sika deer are also very territorial <e> <s> admittedly they are being brought into this bill to be controlled by the rdc but in this particular respect i do not see why the occupier should be allowed to bang away at them at night <e>", "<cs> when i questioned the noble lord lord john-mackie about the killing of roe deer and how it had to be done selectively i had in mind the fact that this is a long and complicated matter <e> <s> when my noble friend is considering the question of shooting roe deer at night which must inevitably be indiscriminate i wonder whether he would take this up with some <e>", "<cs> surely it is generally available to occupiers now <e> <s> this is what we are complaining about <e>", "<cs> i think that my noble friend will get up and say that there is not time that one must shoot them the moment they get into the field <e> <s> that is no doubt what he is about to say but before he does so i should like to make a point <e> <s> if we accept an amendment which i think the noble lord lord northfield put forward to the effect that there had to be damage then i would point out that it would already be known before dark that there had been damage <e> <s> one of the troubles we have here is that everyone is saying you must shoot the deer the moment you see it in your field <e> <s> it may not be doing any damage at all it <e>", "<cs> if this amendment is accepted what will be the penalty if the occupier does not make a return <e> <s> will there be any comeback <e>", "<cs> the problem is that per cent <e> <s> of the tenants would make a return willingly but the ones that you want to get at are probably the ones who may not make a return <e> <s> i hope my noble friend will take it back and perhaps add something at a later stage <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord ross of marnock has a point <e> <s> so far as i can see the mention on the first page of sika deer or any hybrids thereof is a reference to section of the act <e> <s> the noble lord lord northfield withdrew his amendment <e> <s> i was rather surprised that he did because that was where the definition was that any cross of the two was either red or sika <e> <s> i should have thought that it ought to be brought in to cover the other clauses <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to associate myself with the remarks made by the noble lord lord northfield since i have been one of the strong critics of the bill in the past <e> <s> i am grateful for the very agreeable way in which my noble friend lord glenarthur has progressed <e>", "<cs> although appreciating the situation on amendment no <e> <s> i am a little worried that paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords if we proceed with this bill as it appears we might and we are to have a code of what is required for night shooting that will require suitable equipment <e> <s> therefore if there has to be suitable equipment i do not see why this amendment cannot be accepted because clearly a shotgun is not a suitable part of the equipment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the noble lord lord northfield on this amendment <e> <s> one of the reasons why we would like it written into the bill is that if i remember rightly in committee my noble friend on the front bench strongly resisted having put in the schedule the question of how the deer was killed <e> <s> it is quite easy to see when an animal is hanging up in a game dealers premises whether it has had a snare around its neck <e> <s> if he has put it in his records as having been shot then clearly he is committing an offence <e> <s> i think that this must be written into the bill <e> <s> indeed although i agree with my noble friend lord glenarthur that we do not want more in than is necessary in view of the resistance that there was in committee i think that the noble lord lord northfield is quite correct in asking for an assurance at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to amendment no <e> <s> it is not only roe that will be exempted but also fallow deer <e> <s> i rather wondered why the poor sika there are thought to be only of them in scotland should be the ones left in <e> <s> i do not want a reply on this tonight but i hope that the noble lord will consider it <e> <s> i see that there is a case for red deer and if one accepts the hybrid point hybrids would be covered by red deer <e> <s> i do not see any reason why the sika should be harried by the occupier at night <e>", "<cs> my lords i too must declare an interest as an agricultural landlord and also as an agricultural tenant <e> <s> i must declare a further interest as a member of the slf executive and a member of the nfu area committee <e> <s> as such i welcome this modest alteration to the agricultural law of scotland <e> <s> all parties seem to acknowledge the need for young men to be able to get a foot on the farming ladder <e> <s> this is obviously of the greatest importance if our great and efficient agricultural industry is to thrive <e> <s> one of the best methods of securing this foothold we are told is to be able to procure the lease of a farm so that the landlord provides a large proportion of the capital required <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord said that he was on the committee and because of what he said i thought that he had had a great deal of influence on these bills <e>", "<cs> the fact is that these acts have caused a drop in agricultural lets from per cent <e> <s> of holdings to per cent <e> <s> or as the noble lord lord ross of marnock said from per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> whatever the percentage there has been a marked drop in agricultural tenancies in scotland <e> <s> therefore scottish landowners not surprisingly went to the national farmers union to try to get some proposals introduced <e> <s> this bill is the result <e> <s> regrettably the proposals put forward by the landowners federation have been very much watered down <e> <s> indeed i very much doubt whether these proposals will provide the incentive for more land to become available for let <e> <s> i was very pleased to hear my noble friend lord stodart of leaston agree with this <e> <s> he was more forceful than i intend to be <e> <s> i rather hope that i am wrong but time will tell <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask one question <e> <s> my noble and learned friend the lord advocate has given me the impression that this legislation is not to apply to scotland because the law in scotland is better than the english law in this respect <e> <s> my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor may disagree but it is my impression that somewhat similar legislation to this would be welcomed in scotland <e> <s> i wonder whether the government will consider the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i also should like to warmly congratulate the noble lord lord howard of henderskelfe and i think that i agreed with all he said <e> <s> may i first declare an interest not as an english landlord as some of your lordships might expect for i do not own any land in england <e> <s> but am a tenant farmer in staffordshire paying a rent of more than per annum with a rent review due shortly <e> <s> therefore i have a considerable interest in this legislation <e>", "<cs> exactly my lords <e> <s> there is little doubt as several noble lords have indicated that would be madness to re-let it even with strong hopes for concessions in the spring budget <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the shortage of time i hope that your lordships will take as read the preliminary remarks of thanks and congratulations very sincere congratulations which i should have wished to make <e> <s> first i should like to draw attention to a small administrative problem <e> <s> the boards written report is for the calendar year whereas the accounts are for the year to st march <e> <s> as these are published together there must inevitably be a considerable delay before the public can see what the board has been doing <e> <s> perhaps my noble friend could look at this <e> <s> however as we are working on the report the board chairman mr cowan with his usual efficiency has provided some of us with a brief updating for <e> <s> obviously he cannot give his report <e>", "<cs> my lords one should consider for example the aluminium smelter at invergordon the objectors told us what would happen <e> <s> they knew that the cost of fuel would be far too expensive <e> <s> but this was one of the projects which at that time the board was putting forward <e> <s> in the jack holmes report which was commissioned by the board in its earlier days you would find innumerable mistakes which the board would not look at now <e>", "<cs> i am sorry my lords but where there are large plantings of sitka spruce and where there are signs of acidity i think one will find that it is nearly always very much worse where the sitka spruce is planted <e>", "<cs> i have listened with great interest to this debate <e> <s> unfortunately i was unable to be here for the second reading but i am surprised that this bill ever got a second reading <e> <s> it seems to be fraught with difficulties <e> <s> i do not like straw burning so i have seldom done it <e> <s> i must say it has been done occasionally <e> <s> i would rather see the stubble left as long as possible to give some cover for the partridges <e>", "<cs> i question whether this amendment is sound <e> <s> the minister of state for agriculture has no jurisdiction in scotland <e> <s> as i understand it this bill applies to the whole of great britain <e> <s> i wonder therefore whether the noble lord lord alport could answer that problem and if his amendment is invalid perhaps he would withdraw it <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not intended to speak in this debate but i am afraid i have been stirred into action by what i have heard today <e> <s> i welcome the bill as far as it goes <e> <s> when i was chairman of a district council we had a rate of one old penny <e> <s> when there was a change of currency this was doubled to one new penny <e> <s> as a result in we had a surplus and we had a nil rate <e> <s> that must be fairly unique i think over many years now in local government but that is what happened indeed at the end of that year when we handed over to the new district council we handed over quite a considerable surplus i think <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry <e> <s> i knew the noble lady had not mentioned them but i did not <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not intended to speak on this amendment but it is a rather unique occasion because i think for the first time ever i have been able to agree entirely with what the noble lord lord ross of marnock has said <e> <s> on the other hand as the noble baroness has said putting in this amendment could cause difficulties <e> <s> might it not be a solution for the minister to give an undertaking that he will do what the noble lord lord ross wants instead of writing it into the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords the front bench have played a very defensive game over this matter and drawn a number of red herrings across the very unsatisfactory state of affairs which exists at the moment <e> <s> i now only hope that what appears to be an eminently reasonable amendment from my noble friend will be accepted <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i put two questions to him <e> <s> neither woodlands nor rough grounds are rated in england <e> <s> how then do they include an element for shooting rent as i think was said in the reply just now <e> <s> furthermore if a hotel uses neighbouring ground for ski-ing <e>", "<cs> noble lords opposite have considered only farming and i am very surprised that forestry appears to be entirely forgotten <e> <s> surely any of this spraying applies equally to farming as it does to forestry <e> <s> in some of the remoter areas it would be extremely difficult to comply with some of the regulations which the noble lord lord john-mackie has just suggested <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the noble lord i must have missed his remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords i too must start by declaring an interest <e> <s> for many years i have been a member of the ness district fishery board and i am also a director of a salmon netting company <e> <s> then let me hasten to thank and congratulate the noble viscount on having introduced this bill <e> <s>

lords before my noble friend sits down perhaps i may ask him another question <e> <s> canada and norway have both imposed legislation which clearly was not agreeable to all the parties <e> <s> why cannot that be done for scotland <e> <s> clearly whatever legislation is introduced will not be agreeable to all the parties so why try to reach a consensus <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord winstantly

that is the case surely one man would have some difficulty in shifting that quantity of fluoride <e>", "<cs> if there are tonnes to be shifted surely this is going to involve a considerable manpower requirement <e>", "<cs> my lords in committee i drew attention to the effect on livestock of the escape of fluoride from the british aluminium works at fort william <e> <s> has any inquiry been made

deleterious effect on the human body <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as it goes i too should like to welcome the amendment of my noble friend lady trumpington if i may call her my noble friend this evening having consistently voted against her <e> <s> however the noble baroness rejected a short time ago the proposal that health boards should reconsider the matter every five years <e> <s> as i read it i hope i am wrong if an authority is fluoridating at the moment it looks as though there will be no opportunity for the public to be consulted <e> <s> this amendment instructs the authority to consult <e> <s> but if they are already fluoridating i cannot see that the public in that area will be consulted at all <e> <s> perhaps i am wrong i hope so <e> <s> if not perhaps my noble friend will manage to put it right on third reading <e> <s> however bearing in mind that the government are trying to save public expenditure i really find the proceedings in regard to this bill amazing <e> <s>

far as i can see <e> <s> it might just as well go into milk and save a great deal of money <e>", "<cs> that reply is not very satisfactory as far as i am concerned <e> <s> my noble friend on the front bench gave no assurance that any efforts would be made to put the system right <e> <s> clearly the current system of licensing is not working <e>", "<cs> it is not working the delay is intolerable and

bird that was doing the killing last year <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank all those members of the committee who have taken part in this discussion <e> <s> i think it has brought out some interesting points <e> <s> i should like particularly to thank my noble friend on the front bench <e> <s> following his advice and example there is little doubt that certainly at this juncture one

already given clearance for this <e> <s> they then decided that it was not in their area that they had made a mistake and that it had to go to aberdeen <e> <s> it was not really altogether surprising

speaking to this bill <e> <s> indeed i was finding it a good deal more difficult until my noble friend lord lansdowne rose to speak <e> <s> he really is an expert on this and knows about this law <e>

caused some confusion i gather to my noble friends but it does tie up with amendment no <e> <s> b <e> <s> what i have put down is the suggestion that clause and clause should be deleted and replaced <e>", "<cs> the position is that if my proposal were adopted that the secretary of state should be given three years in which to set up boards for the whole area then both clauses and would not really be relevant <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank all your lordships who have spoken and have made comments on this amendment <e> <s> i should particularly like to thank the noble lord lord ross of marnock who confirmed my concern for this clause and for the next one <e> <s> indeed i think that most of your lordships who have spoken expressed some degree of apprehension about this clause <e> <s> i only wish that i had the same confidence in these clauses as has my noble friend lord home of the hirsel <e> <s> i fear that little or no improvement will follow from these two clauses and from reorganisation and that we will remain with the current unsatisfactory state of affairs <e> <s> i am quite certain that large areas will remain uncovered even after this legislation <e>", "<cs> i too should like to support the amendment of the noble viscount <e> <s> it appears that this would remove part of the objections relating to my first amendment in schedule <e> <s> clearly this is something which would if it is not altered be an <e>", "<cs> in view of the discussion we have had previously i do not want to oppose the schedule but i should like to ask my noble friend two questions <e> <s> first who is a proprietor <e> <s> this was something raised on second reading on which there does not appear to have been any answer provided <e> <s> secondly are there not single proprietor districts <e> <s> in line sub-paragraph <e>", "<cs> on second reading i asked a question about the sub-division of fishings such as in a large loch <e> <s> although the noble lord answered the question of time-sharing i do not think that that answers the question of what is to stop someone going on dividing up fishings more or less <e>", "<cs> i am a little surprised at that answer because subsection <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble lord and with that undertaking i am very happy to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> on that undertaking i am very happy to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i too should like to support the noble viscounts amendment <e> <s> my noble friend who has just spoken has made a very valid point <e> <s> i know that our fishery boards are particularly worried about the proliferation of fish farms <e> <s> it happens to be rather a success story of the highland development board which has been developing fish farms perhaps excessively but certainly extensively over recent years <e>", "<cs> may i raise one point in reference to what my noble friend said <e> <s> he referred to the crown estate commissioners having to give permission for use but large parts of the sea bed are not owned by the crown estate commissioners so i do not see why they have any authority in the matter <e>", "<cs> i cannot understand why my noble friend is so much under the influence of the fish farming community <e> <s> the same thing happened on tagging <e> <s> they seem to have a very influential lobby <e> <s> if as the noble viscount suggests powers are given to the secretary of state perhaps he could use the purification boards to look at these matters <e> <s> at the moment they cannot look at the disease <e> <s> they have their waters polluted by a fish farm and apparently have no come-back whatsoever under the present setup <e> <s> it seems totally unsatisfactory <e> <s> there are large cages erected just at the top of the fish-pass at the end of the inverness-shire loch garry and so far as i know although planning permission may have been given the planners are not the people who know about disease or pollution <e> <s> it must be either the fishery board if there is one or else the purification board <e>", "<cs> i should dearly love to support this amendment but i regret that i cannot support amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i think the application is probably inoperable certainly in most rivers <e> <s> as my noble friend lord home of the hirsel said the whole set-up is extremely complex <e>", "<cs> subsections <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask a question <e> <s> as the noble viscount lord thurso said earlier papers have been dropping through our letterboxes by almost every post <e> <s> it is unfortunate that the time has been so short <e> <s> however this morning i received a letter from the law society of scotland and i know that there are difficulties about the question of the mean high tide water mark or any tide mark <e>

difficulties as my noble friend has explained <e>", "<cs> i have great pleasure in begging leave to withdraw the amendment on the basis of that assurance <e>", "<cs> if the river is stocked with little fish which it is illegal to take they will then migrate to the sea and there will be a period before they come back again <e> <s> therefore there may be no fish in the river at the time but there would be a strong expectancy that they will arrive within a period <e>", "<cs> i am happy to do so <e> <s> i very much hope however that they will be given these powers <e> <s> but i appreciate that this amendment comes before the powers are given <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> may i add to that <e> <s> it is important that one should be able to acquire a house for

to circulate people but an awful <e>", "<cs> may i interrupt the noble lord <e>", "<cs> surely he must read subsection a with this <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that i am not as previously today in wholehearted agreement with the noble viscount <e> <s> there is a difficulty with this proposal <e> <s> there may well be three netsman tenants but at least one may not be a suitable person to serve on a fishery board <e> <s> he may be of doubtful character <e> <s> regrettably the crown commissioners are inclined to let to the highest bidder when letting their nets <e> <s> they are not terribly particular as to whom they appoint as their tenants <e> <s> in many areas the people who have to be watched the fisheries board are watching them are some of the netsmen who fish illegally <e> <s> it would be extremely difficult if they were members of the board <e> <s> much of this problem could be solved i not not know whether the noble viscount agrees if we changed the words shall co-opt to may co-opt members <e> <s> i am all for having the tenants rodsmen and netsmen but where there is difficulty with a small board in finding the right people it is not advisable that we should be made to co-opt them automatically <e>", "<cs> the noble viscount did suggest that the numbers were reduced to two <e> <s> i am suggesting that they remain at three but with an option open to the remaining members of the board <e>", "<cs> as far as the drafting is concerned i am very happy to ask leave to withdraw it <e> <s> but i think this is not altogether satisfactory <e> <s> the finder could well be an employee of the fishery district and when it is handed to the chief constable to decide who should have it if he hands it back to the finder then it goes back to that individual <e> <s> clearly it does not belong to the individual because he is merely an employee of the board or committee concerned <e> <s> i would ask my noble friend to have a further look at this because i know that problems have arisen and it is something which needs to be cleared up <e> <s> with that i would ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> with the leave of the committee i beg leave at this juncture to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i also should like to support the noble viscount <e> <s> at second reading i referred to pike being introduced into the headwater of the inverness-shire garry which was a ridiculous state of affairs <e> <s> there are also a certain amount of rainbow trout put into loch ness every year by one of the sunday papers i think the <e>", "<cs> i was rather concerned about the reference to the stocking of waters by angling clubs <e> <s> this could well be very damaging to the salmon industry <e> <s> if you put a lot of trout where salmon fry are hatching out the trout can be gobbling them up as quickly as they are hatching <e> <s> it is a case where salmon boards must take priority over trout fishing <e>", "<cs> before we agree this clause i should like to put a question to the minister <e> <s> if there is to be licensing and if records are to be kept who will be empowered to inspect the books and the records <e> <s> under the deer scotland act the police can do so and also the red deer commission can do so <e> <s> however the red deer commission is only allowed to take statistics out and it cannot give you any facts and details <e>", "<cs> may i say how pleased i am that the noble lord lord ross of marnock has raised this matter <e> <s> it is one that has exercised my mind considerably <e> <s> on second reading it was said that the licensing offence was singularly ineffective <e> <s> in this case a lot of the poached salmon goes through hotels <e> <s> a hotel has only to buy one or two fish legally through a fishmonger and no one could ever check up how many illegal fish were going through and then being sold and cooked <e> <s> there is no check at all <e> <s> it would be difficult to follow this up <e> <s> i think i said on second reading that although this licensing was better than nothing it would be very ineffective <e>", "<cs> i wish to put three questions to my noble friend <e> <s> first his amendment refers to a salmon fishery district <e> <s> i wonder what will happen in the very large part of scotland that is not covered by a salmon fishery district and whether restrictions on the methods of fishing will apply there also <e>", "<cs> i asked about the setting of nets for white fish <e> <s> i am sorry to ask awkward questions when we all welcome this amendment but i should like an answer <e>", "<cs> i am sure we all welcome what the noble lord lord belstead has said certainly that part at the end of what he has just told us <e> <s> there was one point which concerned me <e> <s> he said that anyone sending fish from scotland to england would have to be a licensed dealer <e> <s> this would mean that a great many netting stations in scotland would have to be licensed because a lot of fish goes straight to billingsgate and probably to other dealers in england <e> <s> anyone who had any quantity of fish and wanted to sell it south of the border would then have to get a licence <e>", "<cs> i was not questioning the amendment of my noble friend lord trenchard <e> <s> i was questioning what the noble lord lord belstead had said that any salmon going south of the border would have to come from a licensed dealer <e> <s> it would markedly reduce the number of outlets for scottish salmon fishermen if this were the case <e> <s> this should not be the case <e> <s> a venison dealers licence at the present time certainly from our district council costs and not the p which some of the other licences apparently cost <e> <s> it is quite a substantial amount for a venison dealers licence <e> <s> consequently we would not want every salmon fisherman who wanted to sell salmon south of the border to have to pay a licence <e>", "<cs> i congratulate the noble lady on bringing forward this amendment <e> <s> there is one slight point arising from it which i think should be considered <e> <s> licences issued by the district council will be confiscated by the court but i believe that on past occasions there has been a slip up between the courts and the district council <e> <s> i do not know whether there is a requirement upon the courts to inform the district councils but apparently licences have continued to be issued <e> <s> i merely ask that this matter be considered otherwise i wholly support the noble lady <e>", "<cs> may i raise just one question <e> <s> at the end of the clause there is the reference to section of the act which gives a water bailiff powers to search a vehicle on any private land adjoining any water <e> <s> with the current mobility of poachers one gets into difficulty about what is private and what is public and it seems to me that if the vehicle is sitting on a public road then the water bailiff has no power to search that vehicle and would have to wait until a policeman turned up <e> <s> accordingly i suggest that what might be considered is that the wording on any private land be changed to in the vicinity of any water <e>", "<cs> this amendment has the same effect as my amendment no <e> <s> b except that it is in reverse but i am pleased to say that my noble friend on the front bench has improved on my amendment because he has added the word on without which i think my amendment would have been wrong <e> <s> i shall not attempt to move my amendment because my noble friend is right and what is more he has managed to be right in two places where i like my noble friend lord haig only managed to deal with one place <e>", "<cs> with all these other excellent amendments which have been put down on the marshalled list i had not intended to move the second amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> however while i am on my feet i should merely like to ask the noble lord lord moran why he has six miles in his amendment <e> <s> i should have thought we might have gone to the full sea limit but there may be some very good reason for it <e>", "<cs> several noble lords have referred to our international reputation <e> <s> important as this is i think that what is really important is that these fisheries are killing the goose that lays the golden egg <e> <s> this fishing will not continue at the present rate of or whatever it is because there is a seven-year cycle of fish coming back and there has already been a few years of it <e> <s> i have little doubt at all that in a very few years the numbers of fish they are catching will drop materially <e>", "<cs> it has already started <e> <s> that is very possible <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend sits down i should like to ask him how he intends to assess what effect it is having on conservation <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may suggest a gesture by which we put down an amendment for report <e> <s> clearly the noble lords reply was unsatisfactory <e> <s> we can discuss it there and if he does not give us something better we can divide the house on it <e>", "<cs> may i draw attention to two matters at this point <e> <s> section of the salmon and freshwater fisheries protection scotland act refers to one mile from low water <e> <s> i think that this bill is now changing it to three miles <e> <s> i do not ask for an answer now but may i ask the government to look at this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords with that undertaking for which i thank my noble friend on the front bench of course i should be very happy to withdraw it <e> <s> i think this could well resolve the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say how much i welcomed this amendment <e> <s> i only hope that it is effective and that my noble friend will be able to accept it <e> <s> i have very strongly felt all along that there must be room to make these boards different sizes <e> <s> the tweed has a great many more people in its set-up at the moment than any of the fishery boards <e> <s> it is quite ridiculous that a river such as the tay or even the spey should have a similar number of people on its board as the thurso has <e> <s> therefore i very much hope that my noble friend will be able to accept this flexibility <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful once again to my noble friend for having put in this amendment <e> <s> i am a little apprehensive about one point he was making in that it does not appear to apply to statutory undertakers and where a lot of highland rivers have the hydro board which may be covered under something else i had not appreciated as i have not had a chance of checking this or even the caledonian canal drawing off water there may well be other statutory undertakers and it would be unfortunate if they did not have to screen off any abstraction points i hope that this was very carefully looked at <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very disappointed with that reply <e> <s> i am not clear how the fishery boards are expected to know about all the planning applications they are not all advertised <e> <s> one point which was not mentioned but which is extremely important for fisheries is not so much the pollution aspect but the digging up of salmon reds where they have spawned or are likely to spawn <e> <s> that can have a very material and long-lasting effect on a salmon river <e>", "<cs> my lords once again i find that a most unsatisfactory answer <e> <s> after all it was fish farms <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the fact that half the amendment will be accepted by my noble friends next amendment and in view of the fact that i shall require further time to consider what he has said on the first part i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> i think that my noble friend is taking back a number of things which may come up again on third reading and i cannot guarantee that i will not bring back this first part again <e>", "<cs> my lords again i am not happy <e> <s> it <e>", "<cs> my lords once more i am most grateful to my noble friend on the front bench <e> <s> i hope that your lordships will accept the amendment <e> <s> i think that we are nearly now on agreement and disagreement <e> <s> i should like very much to thank my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to all noble lords who have put forward suggestions <e> <s> i am particularly grateful to the noble earl lord perth for putting forward a very worthwhile suggestion <e> <s> between us we seem to have persuaded the minister to change his mind <e> <s> that is very satisfactory <e> <s> i hope that this will continue that my noble friend the minister will take it back and that he will come forward on third reading with a suitable amendment <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i must congratulate the drafter of the bill <e> <s> as it is drafted it has foxed us <e> <s> it is however very sensible and i have pleasure in asking leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords on that assurance one has little option <e> <s> it is however rather difficult to fix rates at this time because rates are liable to alter <e> <s> i beg leave however to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords if this amendment is agreed i think that probably it will not be possible to take my amendment no <e> <s> because it will aready have been dealt with <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not entirely happy with that but i ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i took it that the ability to sue was to allow someone to be pursued such as a poacher who might be prosecuted by the fiscal <e> <s> but if this is extensive i should be happy to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> i feel this is something which needs further attention <e> <s> meanwhile i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope my noble friend will resist this amendment <e> <s> i quite appreciate the noble lord lord carmichaels concern about this but there are also difficulties <e> <s> the police are not infallible <e> <s> only last week we had the godfather of all the local poachers in the bag but one of the policemen started blethering on the wireless and the trap was sprung <e> <s> it is important that the bailiffs do have the powers that they know what they are about and they have an opportunity of catching these people <e> <s> to remove any of their powers would be the greatest mistake <e> <s> i know there was a lot of fuss made about one or two appointments that were made in the western isles and i know there have been troubles there but overall i do not think this applies <e> <s> it is a case very often of the water bailiffs being a lot of idle ones rather than being over zealous i hope my noble friend will resist this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps we may return to amendment no <e> <s> of my noble kinsman lord lansdowne <e> <s> i am afraid that i cannot support him on this one <e> <s> i should like to suggest that if he was in a car on his way home from fishing and had the misfortune to have a car accident and a policeman came along and found a salmon in his car the policeman would say oh my lord you have a salmon in here <e> <s> can you show sufficient authority for having this in your possession <e> <s> it is most unlikely that he would have any written authority with him and so the officer might say my lord i am sorry but you have created an offence and i shall have to take you in <e> <s> i should not like to see that happen and so i cannot support his amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the noble viscount lord thurso <e> <s> the amendment of the noble lady lady saltoun would make the position absolutely impossible <e> <s> it would very much limit the market <e> <s> the number of licensed dealers in salmon would be very limited <e> <s> they would be entirely wholesalers <e> <s> there would be one or two in inverness and perhaps three or four in aberdeen <e> <s> they could corner the market <e> <s> if you have a netting station and you cannot sell your fish other than through one of these wholesalers the price of salmon would drop completely <e> <s> the whole thing would become completely uneconomic <e> <s> as the noble viscount has said many people have venison licences and salmon licences would be the same <e> <s> one wants to be able to sell ones fish where one can <e> <s> why on earth we should be restricted in this manner i cannot understand <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will oppose the amendment to the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords on the basis that it is favourable consideration i am happy to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to add my thanks for the little bit we have received here <e> <s> i am a little confused because clause says <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very disappointed with this evenings debate because at the committee stage i asked if there was to be a review in three years time what would one ever expect to get out of it <e> <s> after all the life cycle of a salmon is seven years <e> <s> does one have to wait until there has been very material damage done to salmon stock before one does anything about it <e>", "<cs> my lords i suppose that i must withdraw the amendment <e> <s> i would however ask my noble friend to see whether we cannot substitute something else because people do escape when they are clearly committing a crime <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought my noble friend might be sympathetic <e> <s> i have much pleasure in withdrawing the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i raised this subject in committee <e> <s> this bill has been rushed through this house and it has given us very little time <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a bare minimum of a fortnight between each stage which has given very little time to have discussions on technical matters <e>", "<cs> indeed my lords now on the last amendment the minister has not had time himself to look at a method which might save expenditure <e> <s> however i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend the minister for this amendment <e> <s> he has brought forward a number of amendments during the course of our deliberations and here we have one more

in the later stages of the bill the other night <e> <s> i commented on the rush to which we had been submitted in getting through this bill and there were some comments from the front bench <e> <s> but i think this bears out the fact that though we have gone through three stages of the bill we still do not have an answer <e> <s> but i am most grateful to the minister for having offered to look at the matter again <e> <s> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords it is most satisfactory that the minister is managing to accept all these <e>", "<cs> my lords i again thank my noble friend very much and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords in committee i proposed a similar amendment on a number of technical grounds <e> <s> i did so with great reluctance because i feel as the noble earl lord perth has said that there is a need for something like this <e> <s> however every river will be different <e> <s> one aspect not mentioned is that of the temperature <e> <s> low water certainly has an effect but the temperature of the water perhaps has an even greater control over whether or not the salmon will run <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not often that i hear that comment <e>", "<cs> my lords all i was going to do was to congratulate my noble friend on having found an amendment that was satisfactory after we had reached the third stage of this bill <e> <s> clearly this provision is required in respect of a vehicle standing at a lay-by <e> <s> after all people are not going to drive on to a field or on to someones private land they are much more likely to park at a lay-by <e> <s> therefore i should like once more as on many previous occasions this evening to thank my noble friend for having introduced this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should also like to thank my noble friend for introducing this amendment <e> <s> i have one question to put to him <e> <s> when the proposed clause refers to salmon as it does at a number of places does that include sea trout or fish of the salmon species or both <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to raise a question here because my noble friend referred to paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not entirely happy with this amendment but at least it is a move in the right direction <e> <s> it comes very near the end of the bill and i am happy to thank my noble friend and all his officials for the way in which they have helped us <e> <s> the number of amendments and improvements we have made strengthen the bill considerably and i cordially thank all concerned for what they have done <e>", "<cs> the various amendments put forward this afternoon have thrown up some very interesting points which i think will put difficulty in the way of the governments proposals <e>", "<cs> surely we are being put at an increasing disadvantage compared to our european competitors <e> <s> we are suggesting that british farmers should be saddled with an extra million expenditure for public health which seems to be unreasonable <e>", "<cs> i must declare an interest <e> <s> i am a joint tenant of a large dairy farm in england <e> <s> last tuesday i attended the scottish landowners federation council quite a large body with many farmers on it and milk quotas were discussed <e> <s> the council made a unanimous decision to oppose the proposals that landowners should pay tenants on waygoing what is currently a hypothetical sum for the quotas which cost the tenants nothing <e> <s> apart from anything else it is retrospective legislation for existing leases <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend sits down will he please say how the value has been increased <e> <s> under this arrangement the tenant cannot get any value for the quota except when he goes out <e> <s> at the moment he cannot sell that quota <e> <s> the quota has no cash value to the tenant even if he went in on a green field site <e>", "<cs> until recently in scotland landlords were at a disadvantage compared to their english neighbours <e> <s> they were allowed to revise rents only once in every five years <e> <s> thus some scottish landlords are sitting with three four or five-year-old rents <e> <s> indeed for crofters it is seven years <e> <s> i know that the conservative government have slowed down inflation but it will be appreciated that a five-year old rent is now far too low and yet the governments proposals are that tenants will benefit from these out-of-date rents <e> <s> once again this is quite unfair to the landowner <e> <s> in three years time this situation will cease to exist but the government are desperately trying to rush through this legislation <e> <s> are scottish landowners to suffer until then <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for offering to write to me particularly on the crofting point because i think we would be getting into deep water if we tried to negotiate that one <e> <s> i am relieved to say that i am not the landlord of any dairy tenant so that i do not myself have these problems <e> <s> but in the south-west of scotland i think they will be very concerned at the suggestion that the landlord of poorer ground is going to have to pay more to his tenant than somebody on better ground <e> <s> i hope i am mistaken about this but i think that will be the case <e> <s> i should be grateful if my noble friend could confirm that that is the case <e>", "<cs> my lords may i put forward one suggestion which might meet the wishes of a number of your lordships <e> <s> our scottish legislation is not at all as satisfactory as the english legislation but it does have one saving provision in it which might be acceptable to england and wales <e> <s> it is that the landlord and tenant can agree between themselves and can contract out of the government proposals <e> <s> therefore the tenant and the landlord could make an agreement and i should think that in a great many cases they would do so rather than accept what we have in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i also should like to support my noble friend lord de la warr <e> <s> i am very interested to note that it seems that he has unanimous support from all sides of the house <e> <s> since our deliber-ations on the previous stages of this bill during which endless criticisms were levelled at the governments proposals on quotas it has become clear that very few people if any are in favour of the current intentions <e> <s> it was to be hoped that the government would come forward with such an amendment <e> <s> i wonder whether these proposals would ever have come to us had this clause been debated in committee in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure which land this quota is attached to <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that my noble friend lord gray of contin will take particular note of what my noble friend lord belstead is obviously just about to say because some of us object very strongly to this special quota for scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords the only crumb of comfort that i have received from that answer is that my noble friend on the front bench will discuss the matter with the crofters commission <e> <s> the commission no doubt knows the position <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i am entitled to speak again on this matter <e> <s> however my noble friend must take great care about investigating some of these matters <e> <s> i am certain that he is wrong but i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that they do alter the situation <e> <s> the word accommodation which is one of the words mentioned here as i said earlier when i think my noble friend was not in the chamber could apply to beef cattle or sheep or anything else at the same time <e> <s> i would suggest to him that he looks carefully at this and that instead of the wording he has put down he should use the words specifically adapted for dairy cows <e> <s> this would cover the situation that he is clearly seeking to cover <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to reply to the noble lord lord john-mackie <e> <s> it is surely illegal already to have what i believe is called an animal of dangerous propensity out in a place where it is liable to affect the general public <e> <s> i am worried as to where we draw the line <e> <s> i have handled bulls including jersey bulls for a long time <e> <s> but the only animal that flattened me was a cow <e> <s> the only other that nearly caused a good deal of damage was a roebuck <e> <s> i happened however to be stronger than the roebuck <e>", "<cs> my lords i am a little worried about this <e> <s> i had a case where i received an assurance from the minister and the land court came out and said that an assurance from the minister was not what was written into the bill and therefore it was not adequate <e> <s> i am very concerned about this <e> <s> i know that we should all like to accept the assurances of the noble lord lord belstead but i am not happy that that is adequate <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down may i ask her one short question <e> <s> she talked about one man one vote <e> <s> how many other african countries have one man one vote <e>", "<cs> my lords i also should like to support my noble friend lord swansea <e> <s> i see from what my honourable friend the minister said in another place that this order is intended merely to recover the costs of issuing certificates or licences for weapons and not as some suspect to price people out of keeping weapons <e> <s> it is clear from the governments statement what their intentions are but there are those who have a sneaking suspicion that this is not what the police intend <e>", "<cs> one hears in this day and age of the scandals in the city over which the opposition never cease attacking the government <e> <s> now one hears these amendments being supported by the opposition though they could produce the biggest scandal of the lot the diversion of large sums of money from the rural community into the insurance market <e> <s> this amendment will hit not only farming but also forestry <e>", "<cs> my lords the principle of this bill is of course he who pays the piper calls the tune <e> <s> what could be more laudable than that <e> <s> when i first went into local government a councillor had to be on the local government voters role for the area and to get on to that role one had to be a ratepayer for property valued if i remember correctly at or more <e> <s> this ensured that the greatest care was taken that the authority was managed as effectively as possible <e> <s> since then i have seen a steadily increasing deterioration so that now there is rife what really amounts to attempts to bribe the electorate often by wild expenditure of other peoples money by the local authority <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord a question <e> <s> does he know how many scottish students are going to england <e> <s> will not one cancel out the other <e>", "<cs> i should like to support both noble baronesses who have just spoken <e> <s> on second reading i put a question to my noble friend on water rates <e> <s> he confirmed that those who do not require a public water supply will not have to pay a water rate or water charge <e> <s> this surely means that two registers will have to be compiled or else the register will have to be marked <e> <s> this is going to cause even more trouble with the computers because you are going to have to keep two different charges going at the same time <e>", "<cs> perhaps i might come back if the noble lord will allow me i have found the minutes of a meeting which took place on th march of the directors of finance in scotland <e> <s> they felt that the preliminary notification of the numbers registered should be provided in august to enable decisions to be made by other bodies involved and firm notification of numbers by the end of november <e> <s> that gives us months if this bill continues <e> <s> if the directors of finance are satisfied then it looks very much as though everyone else should be <e>", "<cs> unfortunately yes but it does not work very well <e>", "<cs> i do not altogether agree with the amendment <e> <s> however there is a point here which needs looking at very carefully <e> <s> for instance what happens to an empty farmworkers house <e> <s> what happens if one has a house under repair even an empty house which has not been previously rated <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will take this back and look at it very carefully <e> <s> am not satisfied that the amendment is correct <e> <s> i hope that he will consider it and give us another report at report stage <e>", "<cs> i feel we cannot accept the amendment <e> <s> i believe my house would come into this category and i do not think that the noble lord lord ross of marnock would approve if he already objects that we are getting reduced rates or thinks we are although i disagree <e> <s> if our house came under this category my wife and i would avoid our community charge <e> <s> i do not think that this would be the wish of the noble lord <e> <s> the moment this sort of amendment was included it would open the door to a great many anomalies <e>", "<cs> i point out that the amendment does not say that the house has to belong to the national trust <e> <s> it just says that it is kept for the nation <e>", "<cs> does the noble lord put these refuges in the same category as hospitals <e>", "<cs> in relation to the domestic water rate to be charged will the valuation roll not have to be kept intact <e> <s> surely the water rate will be charged on the valuation of the property i do not think it is a flat rate in which case we shall presumably need a valuation roll for all properties that will have to pay a water rate <e>", "<cs> perhaps i could reply to the noble lords lord ross of marnock and lord grimond on the question of crofters <e> <s> after all there are very few crofters who have crofting or the agricultural side of crofting as their sole occupation <e> <s> the vast majority are employed on other work <e> <s> i cannot see why they should be subsidised by their neighbour who does not happen to live in a croft and who is perhaps doing the same work alongside them on the roads or whatever it may be <e> <s> why should the crofter be subsidised as opposed to his neighbour who is not in a croft <e> <s> furthermore if the crofter is in a poor state if his finances are poor he has exactly the same rights as any other person in a like situation and he can get due remissions which will be given just as for anyone else <e> <s> there are some quite wealthy crofters and i do not see why they should be subsidised by the rest of the community <e>", "<cs> a number of noble lords from the other side are working from a wrong surmise <e> <s> surely it is not a question of the harmonisation of valuations <e> <s> it is not the valuations that make any difference it is the rate of poundage <e> <s> in scotland the rate per head of population is per person and in england it is only <e> <s> but that is not the end of the story <e> <s> in scotland we get grant of per head of population and in england the grant is only <e> <s> therefore the amount of expenditure per head of population in scotland is vastly ahead of what it is in england <e> <s> the noble lord may make noises at me but this is a fact <e>", "<cs> the position regrettably is that in scotland we have a number of professional left-wing councillors who do nothing else but council work and make their living out of council work probably because they cannot get employment anywhere else <e> <s> most of these councillors represent an electorate which is not really accountable to the rates at all <e> <s> a great many of them get rebates and they are not paying their whack and so they do not mind how much these councillors spend <e> <s> this is the curse of scotland <e>", "<cs> i cannot say that i agree with any of the amendments i am not certain that i am entirely happy with the bill either <e> <s> what happens when a local authority gets some extra power imposed upon it which is going to cause extra expenditure <e> <s> i do not think that any amendment or the bill covers that <e> <s> it may be that an authority will have something removed from it which will reduce its expenditure <e> <s> i feel that that should be looked at <e>", "<cs> i hope that my noble friend will look at this matter again before report stage <e> <s> the period of three months is far too short <e> <s> for instance during our <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble lord is being a little unkind to my noble friend on the front bench <e> <s> that was done in the s which was before my noble friends time <e>", "<cs> surely the reason for the clause is that so many councillors particularly in the urban areas have been throwing away money and that is why we have had to change the system <e>", "<cs> i felt that what my noble friend said was encouraging <e> <s> i have considerable sympathy with the amendment of the noble lord lord carmichael of kelvingrove <e> <s> i come across these refuges quite often because the people concerned come to our district council looking for money <e> <s> they have considerable difficulty financing themselves and i think that we should be careful not to burden them with any additional finance <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord withdraws his amendment i do not want to cause difficulties to my noble friend but with due deference to the noble lord lord ross of marnock we have one highland <e>", "<cs> anyone who has canvassed in the highlands will know that it would be easier if the dates of birth were there <e> <s> i have been to houses where there are three or four john macdonalds next door to each other <e> <s> i believe that the same can apply to anne macdonalds <e> <s> i cannot see why the noble lord opposite is making such a fuss about this quite simple matter <e> <s> it would be much easier the registration office has said that it would be easier <e>", "<cs> may i put this question to my noble friend the minister <e> <s> i do not necessarily want an answer now <e> <s> why cannnot the national insurance list be used in helping to compile the register <e>", "<cs> i am not sure whether i misheard or misunderstood the minister <e> <s> he referred to the registration officer not being entitled to receive information which was not already available to the person he was asking <e> <s> has it been borne in mind that the number of people occupying district council houses is not currently available to the district council <e> <s> it only knows who its tenant is it does not know who else is living in the house <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to say i think the noble lord lord ross of marnock is right <e> <s> page line states <e>", "<cs> i am disappointed to hear my noble friends reply because he has not answered my points <e> <s> there are many complications in this matter <e> <s> for example one of the reasons why there are currently payments rather than is that the local authorities have to set their budgets <e> <s> having done that and set out the amount that currently has to be charged to rates the community charge in future that has to be printed and circulated <e> <s> it will mean that all the budgets of the local authorities will have to be thought out very much earlier in the year and the whole system will be disrupted <e> <s> i cannot see the object of that <e> <s> why are central government trying to thrust this on local authorities when it does not seem to be necessary <e>", "<cs> certainly i shall study what my noble friend has said but before we come to report stage i hope that his officials will have discussions with the chief finance officers of the local authorities who will have to handle this matter <e> <s> part of my information came from some of them and they are not happy about the situation <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that although the various bodies which he has mentioned must be consulted they have very little power and there is much apprehension among fishery boards and pollution boards as well as among other people at the proliferation of salmon farming <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord ross of marnock said in committee when i was speaking dont tempt me <e> <s> i am afraid that he has tempted me <e> <s> he said that there was no one on this side who would be worse off or that we shall all be better off <e> <s> i questioned that before <e> <s> were the sums to be done now and i have not done the sum because it is not necessary at present i am quite convinced that i should be worse off if the bill were in operation <e> <s> i shall not explain the details it is a long complicated procedure <e> <s> however i am quite certain that i should be paying more to the local authority if the bill were in operation now than under the present rating system <e> <s> i therefore think that the noble lord is not right on that subject <e>", "<cs> the act <e>", "<cs> my lords the act presumably overrules that <e>", "<cs> may i briefly interrupt <e>", "<cs> my lords i should also like to add my thanks to the noble lord lord moran <e> <s> i have to declare an interest as i am chairman of the ness district fishery board <e> <s> though i could take issue on some point or other with a number of your lordships who have spoken i shall keep to four main points first fish farming secondly poaching thirdly water extraction and fourthly seals <e> <s> the first point is by far and away the most important <e> <s> although i do not have second sight i can readily predict that within a comparatively short time we shall have a major disaster concerning our fish stocks <e> <s> we are at the edge of a precipice <e> <s> i hope that the fish farmers and the highland development board in particular will not rush over the edge of this precipice like lemmings <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord lord carter <e> <s> we must be realistic <e> <s> forestry in this country is not an economic proposition but having said that there are many good reasons for growing trees <e> <s> if one looks at the national audit office report on the forestry commission of december one sees that the commission was expecting a meagre return of per cent <e> <s> on all its new planting <e> <s> that was on a heavily discounted capital input <e> <s> if the real economics of forestry are considered all costs the value of the land fencing ploughing planting cleaning vermin control management and so forth should all be given at least a notional compound interest rate <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to start with the pleasant task of congratulating my noble friends lord nelson and lord portsmouth on their maiden speeches <e> <s> it is a welcome relief to do so because what i now have to say on this legislation gives me no pleasure at all <e> <s> i feel that we have to try to get the need for firearms legislation into perspective <e> <s> in there was a panic and a green paper was produced <e> <s> fortunately that green paper came to your lordships house and was so debunked that we heard nothing more on the subject for years <e> <s> during that debate my noble friend lord swansea and i both emphasised the need for an advisory committee <e> <s> had a committee been set up we could by now have had infinitely better firearms legislation <e> <s> the problem is that this is an emotive subject on something which should be largely technical <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall be told that a gun is a lethal weapon <e> <s> however so is a car <e> <s> there are far more people killed and injured every year by cars than by guns <e> <s> i wonder how many people apart from those shot by the police have been killed or injured accidentally by guns over the past few years <e> <s> i suppose that there have been some accidents caused by people wrongfully leaving a loaded gun lying about <e> <s> there may be a few who have picked up an accidental pellet <e> <s> however i suspect that the number killed let alone injured is minuscule compared to the number killed and injured by cars <e> <s> after all there are a million licensed holders of weapons <e> <s> you can imagine the outcry if everyone who wanted a car licence had to have a good reason for owning a car <e> <s> that is what is being asked of the weapon holder <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not for me to say how this situation should be put right but i should hate to be a schoolmaster in britain under the present restrictions to which they are subjected <e> <s> perhaps the difference arises from conscription which both switzerland and israel have <e> <s> it may instil some discipline into their populations <e> <s> whatever the causes it seems that the penalties for hooliganism whether on the picket line the football field or in the city centre are not a deterrent <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very interested to hear that but i thought from what the noble earl lord balfour said that he was most concerned about that matter <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may question the noble lord on this <e> <s> he referred to shotguns <e> <s> surely he is referring to sawn-off shotguns which are already illegal <e>", "<cs> i wonder if the noble viscount lord hanworth has any idea how often illegally held firearms have been used for crime <e> <s> i should be very interested to know whether he could give us any figures on this matter <e> <s> i understand that illegally held firearms particularly rifles are used very seldom indeed if ever <e> <s> i believe that the only time that a self-loading automatic rifle has been used was in the case of michael ryan <e> <s> therefore i believe the noble viscount should be very careful and i should be interested to know if he could give us any facts <e>", "<cs> can my noble friend tell me the maximum number of rounds that ryan fired at any individual <e> <s> as i understand it in most cases he fired only one or two shots <e> <s> if that were the case the rate of fire has no bearing on the matter <e>", "<cs> i am very disturbed <e> <s> i am sorry if i was incoherent when i made my submission <e> <s> however i thought i had made it quite clear why we picked as my noble friend lord dilhorne said it was not an arbitrary date <e> <s> it was picked for a specific reason namely that the bulk of such weapons were not then in operation <e> <s> many such weapons are now in private collections and have never caused any trouble anywhere so far as i am aware <e> <s> they must be years old and during that time they have caused no trouble <e> <s> i cannot understand why my noble friend suggests that they might now do so it seems to be illogical <e> <s> a red herring was introduced about importing from america <e> <s> surely import restrictions can be imposed <e>", "<cs> i am sorry but clearly i have little option other than to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will look carefully at what has been said <e> <s> i believe that to destroy such weapons is vandalism <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the difference is that in respect of these weapons the committee in the other place agreed to the amendment <e> <s> with a three-line whip the <e>", "<cs> that still does not answer the question <e> <s> how seriously shall we have to vandalise a weapon before it is allowed to remain in private hands <e> <s> this is fundamental <e> <s> as i said some extremely valuable weapons are liable to be destroyed <e> <s> i have spoken on previous occasions about the pigeon post and not receiving answers <e> <s> perhaps my noble friend did not recieve it the first time <e> <s> i hope that this time there will be an answer because i believe it is fundamental to many parts of the bill that we must know about this <e> <s> there has been talk about marking weapons and other kinds of issues <e> <s> but it is important that we know what we are expected to do <e>", "<cs> we still do not have the answer <e> <s> weapons can be held in private hands if they arc properly immobilised or certain weapons may be <e> <s> but nothing has been said about how they are to be immobilised <e> <s> museums are already over-loaded <e> <s> there seems no reason why a fine collection of weapons if immobilised should not be allowed in a persons possession when authorised by the secretary of state <e> <s> but how seriously do we have to immobilise the weapons <e>", "<cs> we can return to this on clause <e> <s> to avoid wasting time perhaps we may then have the answer to my question what is necessary to deactify a weapon <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> on this occasion i am pleased to say that i have some sympathy with the governments views <e> <s> however we are not at all happy as has been made clear this afternoon about a good deal of the advice that the government are receiving <e> <s> that may become even more apparent when we deal with the following amendment <e> <s> at a later stage of the bill might it be advisable to include something such as subject to consultation with the advisory committee <e>", "<cs> will my noble friend have another look at the wording of aii <e> <s> when i initially looked at it i obtained the same impression as my noble friend lord swansea <e> <s> my noble and learned friend lord hailsham of saint marylebone has explained the situation <e> <s> however i think the wording could be misleading and possibly a slight revision of it might help <e>", "<cs> during committee stage in another place the minister gave a considerable undertaking that the government would not limit the number of shotguns <e> <s> i hope that on this occasion my noble friend will be as intransigent as he has been in respect of other amendments that have been tabled today <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may just add one further matter <e> <s> it has occurred to me that one may have a second pair of barrels for one gun <e> <s> how is one placed then <e>", "<cs> the noble lady has raised a point which i had very much in mind and which i shall raise later when dealing with my own amendment concerning foreigners visiting this country and what they are to do with their weapons <e>", "<cs> my noble friend is wrong again <e> <s> i totally agree with the noble lady lady saltoun <e> <s> in many parts of the country the police have been trying to impose territorial conditions on firearms <e> <s> if that is extended to shotguns there is little doubt that certain places will also try to impose them for shotguns <e> <s> a provision in the nature of what the noble lady has suggested would ensure that that did not happen <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say that if one has an ordinary double-barrelled shotgun that one can break one can fire it without a fore-end <e> <s> on the other hand one cannot eject without one <e> <s> however one can at least fire off two shots <e>", "<cs> i am rather surprised at the noble earls reply to this amendment <e> <s> for a long time now i suppose at least since but probably before we have had to make a proper record of all firearms rifles and so on on our certificate <e> <s> it seems to me that that has been a waste of time to a large extent <e> <s> i am not sure what advantage there is <e> <s> a great deal of police time apart from ones own time goes into putting such matters on record <e> <s> the only check that is made is when you come to renew your certificate and the police come to see whether you still have the same weapons <e>", "<cs> i wonder if the minister has any figures as to the extra number of personnel required to administer the documentation of firearms <e> <s> i have some figures which have been worked out from the documentation of rifles <e> <s> it is calculated as a very conservative estimate that at least extra policemen will be needed plus extra civilians <e> <s> i understood that we were already short of police <e> <s> i should have thought that if we needed extra policemen for something which is worthless we should do much better to have them on the beat <e> <s> another estimate says that the figure might go up as high as extra policemen <e>", "<cs> it is quite easily worked out from the amount of time taken which i think is given by the police anyway on administering firearms certificates at the present time <e> <s> the unknown figure is of course the number of shotguns <e> <s> that is why there is the variation between the extra policemen plus civilians and the extra policemen <e> <s> no one knows how many shotguns there are so it is difficult to work out exactly the right number <e> <s> whatever it may be it is a very large number <e> <s> i contend that it would be much better to have those policemen on the beat <e>", "<cs> i feel that this amendment is very necessary <e> <s> it must be borne in mind that a statement given by a minister in either of the houses of parliament does not stand up in a court of law <e> <s> i have suffered from this <e> <s> on two or three occasions i have been given assurances by ministers which have subsequently been found by the courts to be wrong because they were not contained in the act <e> <s> i think it is vital that in spite of the assurances given here and in the other place this is written into the act <e> <s> strongly support my noble friend <e>", "<cs> i am delighted to find something in the bill on which i agree with the noble lord lord harris of greenwich <e> <s> what he said could be a mere technicality under the bill <e> <s> it is quite wrong that one should lose ones firearm certificate for three years for <e>", "<cs> i feel that clause is very unsatisfactory in many respects <e> <s> as our debate has progressed i have become even more convinced of it <e> <s> most of the points which i intended to make have already been aired <e> <s> however the clause as a whole has caused discussion argument and disagreement <e>", "<cs> i do not think that the government have got it right <e> <s> my noble friend referred to trying to tighten up on shotguns to stop them falling into criminal hands but very few legally held weapons of any sort are used in criminal acts <e> <s> i do not know how the figures are arrived at but those who have studied the matter say they think there are at least two illegally held weapons in the illegal pool for every one legally held <e> <s> when a criminal uses a weapon it almost invariably comes from that pool <e> <s> this clause will do nothing to change the situation <e>", "<cs> there is something to be said for having a medical certificate but i am not sure that what the noble lord proposes is right <e> <s> if one is over one has to have a certificate to drive a heavy goods vehicle <e> <s> that costs and so i imagine that what he proposes will cost something in that vicinity which will not be very popular with those who want a firearms certificate <e> <s> if i thought that there ought to be a medical certificate i would include a provision relating to drink <e> <s> there is nothing in this amendment to cover alcohol which in this respect might be one of the most dangerous problems of all <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble baroness for missing her opening remarks <e> <s> i should like to make two brief points <e> <s> one is that two if not three of the noble lords opposite have mentioned the question of a nurse crop <e> <s> that is from the forestry aspect but from the conservation aspect there is also considerable advantage in having softwood trees in among the hardwood trees <e> <s> after all in the winter which is a cold time all the leaves of most types of hardwood trees are blown off and if you have some evergreens among them it makes very nice roosting for the birds and gives much more shelter <e> <s> i do not require an answer from the noble baroness on these points but i just wanted to make them <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry but perhaps i may just reply to that one point <e> <s> you will receive so much per year and that will only cover about half of your interest <e>", "<cs> that is an encouraging answer for the first amendment this evening <e> <s> i wish we could have had more on monday <e> <s> however i have one point to raise <e> <s> we need not consider it too seriously but i should like to draw attention to it <e>", "<cs> i do not think there was too much harassment in the case given to me <e> <s> there was a case in angus where a certain noble baroness in this house was questioned regarding her shotguns <e> <s> i have just been told of another case which i understand comes from bedfordshire <e> <s> mr mayhew who has given permission for his name to be used i do not know him has been somewhat harassed by the chief constable of bedfordshire <e> <s> there are other cases and all i am doing is asking that this should be investigated <e>", "<cs> i agree to some extent with the sentiments of the amendment but i am a little apprehensive as to what would happen if it went into the bill <e> <s> i totally agree with what my noble friend lord balfour said about ammunition <e> <s> i think he made a slight slip of the tongue because it is illegal to send any explosive substance through the royal mail <e> <s> but that is by the way <e> <s> it could come by carrier <e> <s> it is much more likely that ammunition would be carried in such a way probably by a firm such as securicor <e>", "<cs> i wish to reply to the noble lord lord harris <e> <s> he said that it was a new requirement to have photographs attached to ones application <e> <s> but if he refers to the act he will see that section a states that the secretary of state may <e>", "<cs> i rise wholeheartedly to support my noble friend in this amendment <e> <s> it seems to be an appropriate moment to ask my noble friend what will happen in when we join the single european market <e> <s> surely there should be nothing to restrict european visitors from coming to this country <e> <s> i believe that in another place the minister said that the government intend to ignore this order from the ec <e> <s> if they do that surely they will then become liable for an action in the european court <e> <s> i should like to know how the government intend to deal with the question of permits for visitors from europe <e> <s> my noble friend had in mind visitors from america who will not be affected but i should be interested to know how the provision will be reconciled with european law <e>", "<cs> before i came south last week i took the trouble to contact the local police and after some considerable deliberation they considered that there was a flaw in the bill <e> <s> it seems that the northern constabulary disagrees with my noble friend lord <e>", "<cs> with that assurance which i am sure will be a relief to a number of people i am happy to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord lord harris of greenwich has not been fully briefed by the chief officers of police on this subject <e> <s> i do not know what happens with shotguns but visitors cannot get a firearms certificate in this country until they produce a certificate from the police in their own area verifying that they are of good character <e> <s> i hope that that will be sufficient proof for the noble lord <e> <s> i think that things are quite secure enough already this certificate should be perfectly adequate <e>", "<cs> my noble friend is probably better briefed on this amendment than i am <e> <s> i mentioned on the previous amendment that a certificate certainly a firearms certificate had to be secured <e> <s> i am not sure of the position as regards a gun licence <e> <s> if the certificate is secured the holders permanent address is already available <e> <s> instead of a responsible person guaranteeing that information the police in the area where the visitor is staying are responsible <e> <s> i should have thought that was a better reference than that of a responsible person <e> <s> consequently i am rather doubtful whether there is any need for amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> there may be a need in the case of guns i stand to he corrected on that <e> <s> but there does not appear to be a need in the case of firearms certificates <e> <s> consequently the amendment itself would appear to be unnecessary <e>", "<cs> it may be that a northern chief constable is more on the ball than english and welsh ones as he certainly requires a certificate from the police in the area from which the visitor is coming <e>", "<cs> this seems an eminently sensible amendment <e> <s> if the persons concerned are not a security risk for six months surely they are unlikely to be so for a period of months <e> <s> this bill will cause a lot of extra work and expense and it will possibly take police off the beat <e> <s> this amendment will produce a saving in the cost of administration and i believe it is an eminently sensible suggestion <e>", "<cs> i should like to express my support for the amendment especially in regard to the fee <e> <s> after all it may be now but if the bill goes through in its present form it is likely to be substantially greater <e>", "<cs> can my noble friend give any idea of how long he considers is necessary as regards this provision <e> <s> surely these teams or groups coming over are sponsored by the team captain or the group leader <e> <s> as far as i can make out the police are not going to make a specific check on each individual <e> <s> if a reliable group is coming it is unlikely that it will bring over with it one totally unreliable person <e>", "<cs> it saves an enormous amount of administration <e> <s> the team leader or sponsor will be the person who will vouch for the people who come <e> <s> furthermore for individual applications it will be necessary to apply to the police two or three weeks beforehand <e>", "<cs> perhaps i could do the same with amendments nos <e> <s> and because i was told that if one was passed the others would fall <e> <s> my amendment is slightly different because it is not intended for anyone who will use the weapons in

hear my noble friend on the front bench say that he was confused because i am too <e> <s> i believe that the amendment of my noble friend lord dilhorne probably covers the point i was trying to make <e> <s> the worry i have about the amendment of my noble friend lord dilhorne is that i believe the noble lord lord morton of shuna was correct about sections and in which case the amendment of my noble friend lord dilhorne is defective <e>", "<cs> i am very disappointed to hear that because if this weapon never gets into the persons hands why does he have to have a certificate <e> <s> it is going straight out of the country <e> <s> all that does is to make it harder to export and is in no way causing a security difficulty <e>", "<cs> clearly this matter will be looked at before report stage and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the dealer will be handling the weapon and it will never go into the hands of the person who is purchasing until it is exported <e> <s> i hope my noble friend will take that point <e>", "<cs> it is a fairly minor point but of some importance because it deals with the export trade <e> <s> our export trade particularly in firearms is of importance <e> <s> however i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment as far as it goes <e> <s> i am afraid that there is a slight flaw in it <e> <s> it says the market value but at what date is that market value set <e> <s> after all once the weapons have become illegal the market for them is considerably less <e> <s> if the noble lord had put in a value at a date before the secretary of states announcement that would have been a fair one <e> <s> i think it would help if he were to insert a date and perhaps he will consider this <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether my noble and learned friend is entirely correct <e> <s> someone who i think is now dead had a fine collection of weapons which had been confiscated by the court <e> <s> he bought them hack from the sheriff clerk <e> <s> i know of another case where the sheriff clerk sold the weapon to the lawyer of the chap who had had it confiscated <e> <s> the lawyer handed it back to the man who had had it confiscated <e> <s> all he did was buy it back <e>", "<cs> i rather agree with the noble lord lord harris of greenwich on this occasion <e> <s> one point that has not yet been made concerns the appointment of the chairman <e> <s> i think that he certainly needs to be an independent person and one of some standing <e> <s> i would suggest that someone like a retired judge would be ideal <e>", "<cs> i can remember many years ago when noble lords set up a committee on firefighting in woodland <e> <s> i was put on that committee and found myself a lone voice with many firemen and civil servants who were quite determined that there should not be any change <e> <s> i believe that we want to be very careful that this committee is not established on the same kind of basis <e>", "<cs> i support the noble lord lord morton of shuna <e> <s> there is just one point to add <e> <s> this is a technical subject <e> <s> it is important that the technicalities are considered <e> <s> it is possible that the secretary of state and perhaps some of his advisers are not aware of those technicalities <e>", "<cs> i should like to support what my noble friend lord swansea said <e> <s> however i am a little bit worried that the amendment as it is presently worded would not in fact do what the noble lord requires <e> <s> it refers to <e>", "<cs> i agree with my noble friend lord mountgarret <e> <s> i should like my noble friend lord ferrers to consider a slight variation as regards the amendment <e> <s> a situation may arise where someone who is stalking is not very fit and his stalker may be allowed to carry a rifle but not allowed to use it <e> <s> if the person wounds a stag it is a matter of humanity that the stalker should be allowed to take the weapon and kill the animal <e> <s> as the bill currently stands he can take the weapon but he cannot use it <e> <s> i hope that when my noble friend looks at this question he will also look at that point <e>", "<cs> i think that the enormous amount of extra work that will be involved in the initial stages has not been appreciated covering as it will million shotgun certificates and a great many more weapons <e> <s> i was interested to hear my noble friend lord gisborough confirm the figures that i gave the other night which were queried by the noble lord lord greenhill of harrow and not approved by the front bench i think in view of the muttering that i noted <e> <s> the figures given by my noble friend lord gisborough of the amount of extra labour required in the initial stages are far in excess of the home office estimate <e>", "<cs> i hope that we shall get the details of the de-activation before too long and certainly before the report stage <e> <s> the other point that was raised was whether these weapons would be allowed to stay on firearms certificates <e> <s> there was a case very recently when the judge upheld the police case and a man was restricted to merely six weapons <e> <s> i hope that this will not be the case as regards antique weapons <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel that the many misapprehensions which have been expressed so far in the debate are unjustified <e> <s> there has also been an element of panic <e> <s> as the noble lady lady saltoun said the number permitted would he very small indeed how correct she is <e> <s> further those that were permitted would only be allowed with the chief officers consent <e> <s> i was somewhat confused about the remark made by my noble and learned friend lord hailsham that it would be mandatory upon him <e> <s> i cannot see that it is in any way mandatory <e> <s> the chief officer of police can refuse a permit for any number of reasons <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the close connections between the ira and the anc ought not the anc to be added to the fist of organisations <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i can cap my noble friends story about his old german mauser rifle <e> <s> i have in my possession a german mauser antitank rifle which my grandfather captured in the services <e> <s> i am much relieved to find that it is not automatic or even semi-automatic <e> <s> furthermore i understand that though i have no ammunition for it and have never tried it if it were to be fired once you would not do it again because it would probably break your shoulder <e> <s> it has been in the house for a very long time <e> <s> i believe it arrived in or along with my grandfathers uniforms and the like and it is really in a museum <e> <s> it would be a great pity if those sort of weapons had to leave the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to disagree with my noble friends in this corner <e> <s> certain chief constables are already considerably reducing the number of firearms on a certificate and if they can reduce the number of firearms on a certificate there is no reason why they should not say that one cannot own more than v number of shotguns <e> <s> therefore we are seeking to put into the bill that they may not do that <e>", "<cs> my lords this is one of the occasions when i am happy to agree with the noble lord lord harris of greenwich although i am afraid it is not often that i am able to do so in connection with the bill <e> <s> there is a need for some tightening up in this regard <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend on the front bench will look again at the matter before third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that this amendment is an improvement on the bill as it stands <e> <s> a number of noble lords are not at all happy with the present wording of this firearms bill <e> <s> there are a number of small firearms dealers who do very useful work especially in the remoter areas of northern scotland for example where i can think of some very useful ones <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend says that the law is being evaded then clearly one needs to do something to stop that evasion <e> <s> on the other hand the white paper which initiated the legislation stated categorically that this was not the case and that the evidence was that mail order sales were not being used to evade the law <e> <s> i do not know which is right but clearly it is something that should be looked at <e> <s> if there is evasion of the law then something should be done about it <e> <s> if the law is not being evaded i can see no good reason why mail order should not continue <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not intervened so far in the debate but section of the principal act provides <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend replies perhaps i may ask for clarification on exactly the same point <e> <s> first section of the principal act says that it is an offence to sell or let on hire any firearm or ammunition to any person under the age of <e> <s> i do not see how they can have a firearms certificate when the act says that they cannot have a weapon <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like strongly to support the amendment <e> <s> following the committee stage and todays debate it is quite clear that this is a highly technical and non-party political matter <e> <s> to administer this code of practice and to keep it up to date needs expert advice <e> <s> it is very important to achieve unanimity which we certainly do not have at the moment <e> <s> i have a large file of complaints of police persecution of legitimate certificate holders <e> <s> i shall not go into details tonight but a considerable number of such certificate holders have been hard done by <e> <s> the home office apparently issues directives to the chief officers of police <e> <s> i do not know exactly how it works but these presumably come from senior civil servants <e> <s> i feel that these directives should not come from civil servants <e> <s> they should come from the consultative committee <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i put it a little strongly <e> <s> i think they are called guidelines or memoranda of guidance <e> <s> as the noble lord lord mishcon said this has to go through the secretary of state and then to parliament <e> <s> i really cannot see what all the fuss and bother is about <e>", "<cs> my lords i also should like to support this amendment <e> <s> i think that the home office has grossly underestimated the amount of extra police time that this bill will require particularly in regard to the recording of shotguns <e> <s> it will take policemen off the beat <e> <s> we have all heard chief constables complain recently about the shortage of manpower <e> <s> this measure will take policemen away from what they should be doing namely trying to control criminal activities in order to oversee the activities of basically law-abiding people <e>", "<cs> my lords i sympathise with the amendment <e> <s> a great deal of the administration of the bill will be carried out by civilians who presumably will not work over the weekend <e> <s> therefore if one wants a weapon on a saturday one would not be able to notify officials on sunday because they would not be available <e> <s> it seems very reasonable that the limit should be extended to hours <e>", "<cs> my lords as one who has spent a lot of time during this bill harassing him perhaps i may also add my thanks to my noble friend on the front bench <e> <s> i cannot add to the compliments that have already been paid him but i should like to add my name to them <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the swapo democratic party in windhoek is opposed to the swapo external communist terrorists and deprecates their actions in invading namibia as armed terrorists <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not intended to speak but some points have arisen in the debate which i should like to mention as speakers have been commendably short and well within time <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend lord radnor for initiating this debate and i congratulate the noble earl lord carlisle on his maiden speech <e> <s> he has fired his first salvo and we look forward to hearing him again <e>", "<cs> i am wondering what the noble lords argument has to do with the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am a member of a river purification authority in scotland and i appreciate the ministers comment that the authorities have worked well <e> <s> i believe that he is correct and i was relieved to hear that the government do not intend to interfere with the river purification authorities in scotland in spite of some of my noble friends objections <e>", "<cs> do the figures for local authority expenditure given by the noble lord apply to the whole of the united kingdom or just to england and wales <e>", "<cs> it is like trying to make a baby carry a large weight <e> <s> therefore the person responsible for the child should be prosecuted whether or not the child is wearing a hard hat <e>", "<cs> despite the fact that my noble friend has missed out scotland i hope that my noble friend the minister will give the matter further consideration <e> <s> my noble friend seems to have a good argument <e> <s> i hope that the government will consider tabling an amendment on report <e>", "<cs> i am a little apprehensive about the proposal <e> <s> the noble lord referred mainly to urban areas <e> <s> however in the case of scattered rural areas it would be very difficult for the authorities to co-ordinate plans <e> <s> the transport costs would be <e>", "<cs> i appreciate that <e> <s> i was referring to the plan <e> <s> many of the authorities in rural areas are miles apart it is impossible for them to put together a co-ordinated plan <e> <s> it would involve a great deal of extra expense <e> <s> and the noble lord has just complained that the bill will result in extra expense <e> <s> this proposal would add even further expense <e>", "<cs> we have heard a good deal of opposition to devolution <e> <s> it is opposition not necessarily to the devolution of powers to scotland but to the area concerned <e> <s> scotland is a very large part of it about one-third of the british isles <e> <s> there was a good deal of controversy earlier concerning the powers that should or should not be devolved to europe we have been told by some people today that conservation should be an international affair <e> <s> what would have happened had it been only a european affair <e> <s> would those same people have been as happy if the italians and spaniards were looking after nature conservation in britain <e>"]
