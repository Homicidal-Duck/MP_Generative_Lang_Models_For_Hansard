["<cs> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move amendment no <e> <s> a that stands in the name of my noble friend lord sandford <e> <s> as a result of the amendments to which your lordships have just agreed reference in my noble friends amendment to subsections a and c should now read subsections a and a following the rewording of the schedule <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may speak personally i entirely agree with everything that the noble earl has said and also with what the noble lord on the next bench has had to say <e> <s> i am doing my duty putting this amendment forward because it is the wish of the association of district councils to enable their members to have this additional power but i do not personally agree with it and therefore it gives me great pleasure to ask leave to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl for putting me right on procedure <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support what the noble baroness lady david has said on this matter <e> <s> the association of district councils is very concerned about the proposals whereby the secretary of state requires the publication of indicators more frequently than annually <e> <s> local government generally is especially concerned about the indicators relating to land and housing <e> <s> i am sure the noble and learned lord the lord advocate will be telling us in a few minutes about the governments intentions which so far do not appear to be very clear in regard to the matters mentioned by the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord replies and as in a minute i shall have formally to propose amendment no <e> <s> a may i suggest that it might be convenient if he could speak to a point on it <e> <s> i understand that in principle the government are prepared to accept my noble friends amendment but that there is some technical defect in the wording <e> <s> it might save the time of your lordships house if the noble lord could do that <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the remarks of the noble lord lord bellwin i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords had my noble friend lord sandford been here i am sure he would have wished to thank the noble lord <e>", "<cs> having been involved in local government for many years may i join with other noble lords who support the series of amendments moved by the noble viscount <e> <s> all of us irrespective of political affiliation are concerned that the local authorities of this country have their accounts properly and fairly audited and in the vast majority of cases the district auditor has done this very successfully for many years <e> <s> it seems to me that if we are going to have a change we should take very great care and i am sure that your lordships committee would be the right body to insist on this that the new arrangements are fair and represent a proper balance of the audit commissions composition therefore i should like to add my small voice to those on all sides of the committee who support the noble viscount on this series of amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord trefgarne for what he has said <e> <s> he spoke of a sum of million <e> <s> that does not seem to me to be a very large sum if that is all it is going to cost <e> <s> it seems to me a pity that the government could not have conceded this point <e> <s> it would not necessarily have to come out of some other fund it could come out of central government funds and and it is not a large sum <e>", "<cs> i wish briefly to support the amendment because i have myself had close knowledge of rutland water living close to it and being at the time chairman of the local authority in whose area the reservoir was being constructed <e> <s> the noble earl lord onslow was right to say that that reservoir has now been reduced in size because the water level has run down by about feet all round <e> <s> so much water was running out of the reservoir back into the limestone that it was costing a fortune to pump water out of the river to keep the reservoir level up <e>", "<cs> i too should like to support the amendment <e> <s> i think something of this nature is absolutely essential because i do not think anybody would deny that when monetary punishments are imposed on the front men selling <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that it may not be too inconvenient if i intervene in this debate for a few minutes <e> <s> i must declare the same interest as the noble lord lord peyton of yeovil <e> <s> i should like to say as someone who uses heathrow a great deal that when this railway line is constructed it will undoubtedly be of great benefit <e> <s> as someone who also uses paddington station i very much share the views expressed by the noble baroness lady gardner of parkes because it is already pretty chaotic there at times <e> <s> given the extra number of people who will use the station the position will have to be examined carefully by the local authorities british rail and the other people concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the noble lord lord kimball who is a long-standing friend <e> <s> he represented the constituency of gainsborough which my forebears had some connection with many years ago at the time of the civil wars <e> <s> in addition i
