["<cs> my lords i am fortunate indeed that a subject as important as the finniston report has enabled me to make my maiden speech and perhaps more important still because at times the report is controversial not in a party political sense but as a result of the conflicting interests of all the organisations and institutions which at present make up the means by which we produce professional engineers <e> <s> your lordships must have heard from time to time apologies from beginners like myself for possible indiscretions and i am no exception in notifying the house of that in advance <e> <s> i also wish to declare not a pecuniary but a very vital interest in the outcome of the governments consideration of the finniston report <e>", "<cs> my lords i resist the temptation to join in the wider political issues that arose in the latter part of this debate <e> <s> i thank all noble lords who have contributed so much during our discussion <e> <s> i would be pragmatic enough to say to the noble earl lord gowrie that from all sides of the house there seems to me to have been one dominant message <e> <s> it is simply that in connection with those key factors of our industry which hopefully will be defined as a result of the review that is being undertaken the plea is do not destroy do not diminish do not break down those institutions <e> <s> i refer particularly to the training boards and to the principle of the levy which in my view and i would think from the contributions that have been made in the view of many noble lords will do much and will play a vital role in bringing about that revitalisation of those wealth-producing industries that we so much desire <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may i should like to educate your lordships in the intricacies of industrial negotiations <e> <s> it is an unwritten law that the shop steward never praises the rate fixer for if he does the employer will quickly remove him <e> <s> but i want to disobey that rule today and say how much i agree with the noble earl lord de la warr in his main contention that there should be no further legislation on industrial relations and that it should be left to what one hopes is the good sense of employers and trade unions and their respective representatives to work out a system that is suitable to the particular industry faced with its own problems <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i could intervene to ask a question and to give the reason for shaking my head <e> <s> how is it possible to marry the principle that peaceful picketing can be permitted and lawfully permitted yet at the same time if someone goes on the highway to stop a lorry driver in order peacefully to try to persuade him that person can be charged with the crime or the offence of obstructing the queens highway <e> <s> that is why i was shaking my head <e>", "<cs> my lords may i from this side of the house join with the noble lord lord vaizey in congratulating the noble lord lord tordoff on his maiden speech <e> <s> may i also say that it was made more remarkable for me knowing full well the opinions of many important employers in the industry in which he has spent most of his life <e> <s> may i couple with that appreciation for the contribution by the noble baroness lady seear whom we have much to thank for at the engineering training board for support throughout the years <e> <s> your lordships will know that i have to declare an interest as chairman of the engineering training board and i hope quite temporarily chief executive of that body <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl for his intervention <e> <s> however these are matters which must be argued out by both sides of industry rather than within the context of this bill <e> <s> i can only say i hope that this is not taken as a threat because if it is it is purely deliberate that the trade unions have made it perfectly clear that they have no interest in resolving either the type of training or the remuneration for training or the multiplicity of training if they are not part of the general set-up with authority to deal with training and i believe that they are fully justified in taking that stand <e>", "<cs> my lords before you say hear hear <e> <s> it should be much more severe consider this for a moment <e> <s> if that was the cost to the union what was the cost in lost production <e> <s> what was the cost in the souring of relationships between workers and management <e> <s> and what was the cost of the continuing aggravation that exists <e>", "<cs> my lords a combination of government policies and a deep recession has been superimposed on the longer-term structural decline of british industry <e> <s> this has driven the jobless total beyond the million mark but most importantly the number out of work for more than a year has doubled to over a million in the space of months and even <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for seeking clarification on this matter <e> <s> i readily concur with his view that what is done is done and that those industries for whom there will be no statutory board are faced with difficulties <e> <s> my plea was to utilise the expertise of people within those industries who were and to some extent still are employed by the training boards that will eventually be dismantled <e> <s> i have been present at conferences when the secretary of state has made it quite clear that he will not issue the order cancelling the existence of those training boards until he is satisfied about voluntary arrangements <e> <s> if he is satisfied in my view he could well utilise those voluntary arrangements within those industries and where the statutory board exists the expertise of the statutory board <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to intervene but i thought the noble lord was going to say what it was that i had said in criticism of the youth of this country <e>", "<cs> indeed there is my lords in order to meet the challenge of the new technology and to master it <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first take the opportunity of thanking the noble lord lord kilmarnock for the opportunity of this debate and say at <e>", "<cs> my lords i crave the indulgence of the house but must press the minister more strongly on this point of what i still think is correctly described as compulsion <e> <s> the minister has heard from every side of the house and from every speaker how they view with abhorrence the suggestion of the loss of supplementary benefits he has heard my own hope that the trade unions will co-operate but with the condition that the government accept the task group report as a whole <e> <s> we anticipated that the noble earl would say that the secretary of state was considering it but may we not press the minister to say that in view of all that is being said in this house and in view of what has been said by the all-party committee in another place at least there is some possibility that representations can be made by the noble earl as the minister responsible in the hope that this very important point will he accepted by the government so avoiding the prejudicing of the whole of the task group report <e>", "<cs> listening to debates in your lordships chamber one gains experience all the time <e> <s> i came into the chamber today believing that in general terms and in general principle retroactive and retrospective legislation was obnoxious in the extreme <e> <s> i still believe that and i do not think it has anything to do with fair play with justice or with any of the other words that have been used <e> <s> in the main it is purely punitive and it is in that spirit that i believe it is being operated in this case <e> <s> but in case my words may be misunderstood i take inspiration for i am encouraged that in future debates we shall have the support of the noble lords lord boyd-carpenter and lord houghton of sowerby when we introduce further retroactive legislation to make these people pay back this amount of million they have already received wrongly in my view <e> <s> i am sure we shall receive their support in that regard <e>", "<cs> the more i hear of this discussion the more i am convinced of the total air of unreality that exists <e> <s> if i may illustrate where i think the discussion is going it reminds me of the preacher who when he was asked the reasons for his success as a preacher said i tell them what i am going to say then i say it and then i tell them what i have said <e> <s> this is the way it appears to me we are going <e> <s> i say to the noble baroness and to the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter that i do not know of any trade union which in admitting a member does not say do you abide by the rules and constitution of the <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to have the amendment standing in my name put to the vote <e>", "<cs> my lords i suggest that this debate might prove to be something of an exercise in futility in that if there is a change of government any remarks which i may make in replying this evening to our excellent discussion will prove to have been unnecessary while if there is not a change of government my remarks will in the future be ignored with the same kind of zeal with which they have been ignored in the past <e> <s> to that extent the debate can i repeat be seen as an exercise in futility <e> <s> my noble friend lord gallacher whom i must compliment on an excellent maiden speech served a dual purpose in that besides addressing the house he no doubt much to the delight of your lordships eliminated at least two pages of the notes which i had prepared for this reply <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully agree <e> <s> but what has not been explained is why we lost those markets <e> <s> i know that it is easy to blame restrictive practices on the trade unions and so on <e> <s> the real truth i suggest is that the lack of investment in the past still continues which means that our technological advance is way behind that of our industrial competitors <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord george-brown pre-empts me <e> <s> i have never tried to argue that the trade union movement is somehow all clean on this issue and that it has not had restrictive practices <e> <s> my argument relates to the major cause of the ineptness i do not hesitate to use the word of manufacturing industry in britain <e>", "<cs> that if i may say so would be the worst of all the alternatives even worse than the present government <e> <s> the real question is are we going to develop an attitude of mind whereby government industry and trade unions work together instead of tearing each other apart <e> <s> unless we do something there will be an inevitable backlash <e> <s> my plea especially if there is a return of the conservative government is that some of the anticipated legislation should be dropped <e> <s> industrial relations are not encouraged by some of the more vitriolic remarks of secretaries of state and ministers who should know better than to poison the atmosphere as they are doing <e>", "<cs> my lords all speakers have joined in thanking the noble lord lord byers for an opportunity to debate once again this very important subject <e> <s> for reasons i hope to explain in due course i thought that his contribution hallmarked as it was by my noble friend lord mccarthy who said he was not in disagreement with one statement at all was marred by only one quite inexplicable reference to nalgo <e> <s> i will return to that point in a moment <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not within my purview to answer specific questions about a given trade union <e> <s> such a question would have to be addressed to the union itself <e> <s> i can only inform your lordships of the decision made by congress after serious debate <e> <s> so far as i know the only objection to the scheme by nalgo is the low rate of pay being offered to those who are recruited under the scheme <e> <s> i cannot be too specific but that is my impression <e>", "<cs> my lords i crave your indulgence to speak not because of any of the innuendoes or hints from the noble lord lord marsh <e> <s> the record will prove that i asked for my name to go down on the list of speakers long before he spoke and i do crave your indulgence on a number of points <e> <s> first i have an advantage over all your lordships i have been sequestrated and it is not a pleasant experience <e> <s> anyone who thinks otherwise had better go through it <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want either to impute motives or make allegations against anyone <e> <s> all i will say is that if they believe that utilising the law will help them to stay in business i believe that they are being wrongly advised <e> <s> the acrimony that will follow afterwards is far more dangerous <e>", "<cs> my lords the audacity and panache with which noble lords are today enunciating principles to be applied to others that they would themselves regard as anathema is truly breathtaking <e> <s> leaving aside for the time being ilo convention personally i have no objection whatever not only to the principle of ballots but also to the principle of postal ballots <e> <s> as one who has spent years as a full-time officer never going more than months without either fighting for my survival or seeking to go up the trade union ladder i can pay respect to those principles <e> <s> but before we praise them too highly let us look at some of the underlying facts <e>", "<cs> my lords almost without exception every speaker has claimed that the main barrier to achieving what the noble lord lord rochester set out in his motion the one and only barrier is somehow someway the malpractices that go on in the trade union movement <e> <s> i want to give the lie directly to that <e> <s> i want to go even further and say that those who utter it and even worse believe it are either expressing naivety or effrontery <e> <s> in case i am misunderstood let me say at the outset that i am completely in favour of secret ballots ballots for the political levy for the election of trade union officers on a far wider scale than anybody has referred to here and on the issue of members being consulted and giving an affirmative vote before any industrial action is taken <e> <s> i hope that those unequivocal words will allow your lordships to consider what i am saying more dispassionately than would otherwise be the case <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome this opportunity to support this order <e> <s> in doing so i should like to mention some of the achievements of the eitb <e> <s> achievements in training do not receive the banner headlines that disputes and other aspects of the engineering industry receive so i think it is right and proper that we should use this opportunity of placing before your lordships house some of those achievements <e>", "<cs> my lords having heard the noble and learned lord lord denning i am tempted to enter into an argument on the truck acts <e> <s> however in the interests of time i shall confine my remarks to the wages councils and particularly to the restrictions that will now apply to young people <e> <s> the forerunners of wages councils were set up by winston churchill in <e> <s> in saying why they were necessary winston churchill remarked <e>", "<cs> we do not have to go back to the days before the present legislation affecting the dockers was brought in <e> <s> we need only go back to when this chamber debated the governments paper on law reform <e> <s> then we saw noble lords opposite showing visible signs of apoplexy when it was suggested that their two professional organisations were trade unions <e> <s> there are some of us who view those two organisations with a mixture of envy and admiration tinged only with regret that we were never half as successful as they were <e> <s> where else can you get payment whether you do a good or a bad job <e> <s> where else can you get payment if you do not even turn up for your job <e> <s> where else can there be a situation where if there is a complaint you are judge and jury of that complaint <e> <s> yet faced with the situation where a group of workers are being denied the essentials that they have had for over years these noble lords rise up as one and condemn as wrong the workers simple attempts to preserve what they have got <e>", "<cs> i have listened with interest throughout the afternoon and i am grateful to the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter for at last coming clear on the issue <e> <s> all afternoon i have wondered whether the issue concerns time off or who pays for that time off <e> <s> we are now told that the issue concerns who pays <e> <s> have the members of the committee opposite considered for one moment that we are talking not only about trade unionists in manual occupations but also about staff workers on salaries <e> <s> if time off is given one cannot deny pay to an individual without breaching his contract of employment if he is on a salary <e> <s> the alternative therefore is to widen still further the differentials that exist between staff and non-staff <e> <s> surely that point must be taken on board by my noble friend <e>"]
