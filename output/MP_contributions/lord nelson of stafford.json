["<cs> my lords first may i add my gratitude to that already expressed to the noble lord lord gregson for introducing this very interesting subject today at a very timely moment in my opinion as i am sure that the collective wisdom of your lordships coming out of this debate will be a great value to all those who will be discussing this matter over the next few weeks <e> <s> i also wish to add my congratulations to the noble lords who have made maiden speeches <e> <s> the noble lord lord scanlon spoke in his usual vigorous fashion which was very good to hear on a subject on which he has very great knowledge and to which he has made a very considerable contribution <e> <s> i was glad that the noble earl lord ilches-ter in his speech drew our attention to the fact that all engineers are not necessarily in industry <e> <s> he referred to engineers in the services and if i may i shall return to that point a little later <e>", "<cs> my lords may i add my thanks to the noble lord lord schon for introducing this debate this afternoon <e> <s> i think it is a most valuable debate at just the right time on a desperately important issue and that has been emphasised in his usual vigorous way by the noble lord lord rhodes <e> <s> let us hope that this debate will help us all to understand this problem a little <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that i did slide over that because it is a very sensitive and difficult question <e> <s> i think the situation can be mitigated and if people understand the <e>", "<cs> my lords may i also add my congratulations to the noble lord lord kings norton for this excellent report and the study which lies behind it <e> <s> i think it is an extremely valuable contribution at the present time and obviously should be studied by many people judging by its conclusions <e> <s> i also valued very much the comments from my noble friend lord avon on the governments action so far on what appears in this report and i am glad that they are showing a full awareness of this problem <e>", "<cs> my lords in rising to speak to this debate i must first of all declare an interest as i am connected with a firm which is a major supplier of equipment to british telecom <e> <s> my noble friend lord trefgarne in opening this debate in his very clear way touched on the problems of the control of nationalised industries <e> <s> a number of other noble lords have mentioned that during the course of this debate <e> <s> we are all well aware of the problems of the maintenance and measurement of efficiency the responsibility for the direction and the appointment of chairmen and their colleagues on the board the raising of capital and the difference between capital and revenue <e> <s> these matters have been debated in your lordships house and elsewhere on many occasions and many questions have remained unanswered <e> <s> perhaps that is the reason why today there is much public support for the so-called privatisation measures which are currently being proposed <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will allow me to proceed a little further i shall clarify the position <e> <s> i am concerned about what clause really means <e> <s> there is another aspect about foreign suppliers and the reciprocal position and that is where we have the situation of a smaller country which may be very glad to give opportunities to british suppliers provided that it is able to come in here and <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely glad that my noble friend lord bess borough has raised <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i might intervene to make one point on that aspect because i think it is rather important <e> <s> the programme which is handled by a particular company such as my own for instance involvesa large number of other firms <e> <s> it is not just one company and one programme each of those companies will be contributing towards the per cent <e> <s> so there will be a wide spread of interest in industrial involvement as well as the government involvement <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my tribute to those of others to the noble lord lord sherfield for introducing this debate today which i think is extremely timely <e> <s> i should also like to pay tribute to the two authors of this report who have done an excellent job <e> <s> the government are to be congratulated on initiating this regular review for three reasons <e> <s> first i think that it is extremely good to look from time to time at what progress has been made on the recommendations of the excellent reports which are published by these bodies <e>", "<cs> my lords i add my tribute to the noble lord lord gregson for the way in which he chaired the committee on which i was privileged to serve <e> <s> we received a tremendous amount of valuable evidence as your lordships may have seen from the record <e> <s> i should also like to pay tribute to the devoted work being done by so many people in this important field <e> <s> it impressed all of us who served on the committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my thanks to the noble lord lord gregson for introducing this report this afternoon <e> <s> i have been privileged to serve on his committee and i found it extremely rewarding <e> <s> i would mention to your lordships that the weight and substance of the evidence that has been submitted to us has indeed been most impressive and the interest shown in the subject has itself been very heartening <e> <s> perhaps i may add my congratulations also to the right reverend prelate the lord bishop of durham on his maiden speech this afternoon <e> <s> i hope we shall hear him on many occasions and i am sure he will always be saying something of great interest to us <e>", "<cs> my lords we can all be grateful to the noble lord lord rhodes for introducing this debate this afternoon <e> <s> unlike a number of other noble lords i did not have the privilege of accompanying the noble lord lord rhodes on his visits to china but i have been there on many other occasions as i had the privilege of being president from of the sino-british trade council of the british overseas trade board whose chairman of that time my noble friend lord limerick will be speaking later in this debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i first apologise to the house and to my noble friend lord torrington for the fact that due to a previous engagement i cannot remain for the whole of this interesting debate <e> <s> it will i am sure be a most interesting one because of the number of speakers who have put down their names this afternoon <e> <s> i shall read with great interest in <e>", "<cs> my lords i add my warm congratulations to the noble lord lord dainton on his excellent maiden speech which reflected as one would expect his depth of experience and characteristic wisdom <e> <s> i also pay tribute to the noble lord lord sherfield for the excellent report which we have reviewed this evening and which i fully support <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank all those who have participated in this debate and who have made it a most valuable addition to the report which your committee has submitted <e> <s> i should like too to add my congratulations to the two maiden speakers my noble friends lord harlech and lord manners for their contributions to our deliberations today <e> <s> it was a pleasure to have them participating in this debate and like other speakers i look forward to hearing them on other occasions <e>", "<cs> my lords i add my congratulations to the three maiden speakers today <e> <s> it has been a pleasure to hear from them all and particularly from my noble friend lord joseph who has contributed so much original thinking to our affairs over the years <e>", "<cs> my lords i put my name down to speak in the debate for one purpose only and that was to draw attention to the lack of any mention in the white paper of the protection of research and development <e> <s> however i am delighted to note that the issue has already been touched upon by many previous speakers including my noble friend lord lauderdale in his excellent speech <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had an excellent and long debate which i think is quite right for a subject of this importance <e> <s> i shall not delay your lordships long in winding up <e> <s> however i wish first to thank all the noble lords who have taken part in the debate and who have made it such an interesting discussion <e> <s> i particularly wish to say how glad i was to hear the maiden speech of the noble lord lord johnston of rockport which was such an excellent contribution to the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i congratulate my noble friend on repeating the statement this afternoon <e> <s> as chairman of the select committee which investigated medical research i should like to record some disappointment that there has so far been no mention of research in this review as we have heard it described today <e> <s> our studies showed that there were considerable inadequacies in the national health service in relation to the provision of clinical research and health services research <e> <s> i hope very much that the minister will have something to say this afternoon or certainly during the debate on this important topic <e> <s> there is no doubt that research has a very important contribution to make to the very objectives that the minister has outlined to the house <e> <s> if it is not included it seems to me to be a lost opportunity to bring into this review the important aspect of research and the contribution that it can make to the objectives that he has outlined to us <e>", "<cs> my lords we are debating two reports this morning and it falls to me to introduce the debate on the second <e> <s> i understand that my motion is to be proposed after my noble friends motion is put <e> <s> therefore i shall do that at the end of the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply which i must say i found rather disappointing <e> <s> are the government aware that there is deep concern that research interests are not directly represented on the new national health service management executive <e> <s> is he also aware that the medical research council supports such an appointment <e> <s> in view of those facts will the secretary of state consider the early appointment of such a member to the national health service management executive <e>", "<cs> as we are dealing with this clause generally perhaps i may just welcome the statement by my noble friend lady hooper which gives support to the wider spectrum of sources of energy for our electricity supply industry for the future <e> <s> but i am a little confused and i should like to clarify one point <e>", "<cs> my lords i too support the amendment <e> <s> it fills an important gap in the duties being imposed on the secretary of state <e> <s> concerns have been expressed on all sides of the house about the need to ensure that there is an adequate long-term research programme to maintain security of supply of economic power in the years ahead <e> <s> your lordships select committee on science and technology took a keen interest in the subject and pressed strongly for the government to look at it <e>", "<cs> my lords looking at this proposal by the government it seems to me that the points raised under amendment no <e>", "<cs> my lords i add my thanks to those already expressed to the noble lord lord ezra for initiating this extremely timely debate <e> <s> many important issues have been raised by previous speakers <e> <s> i shall confine myself to one <e>", "<cs> my lords i add my thanks to the noble lord lord hunter of newington for introducing the debate <e> <s> he mentioned research and development in the nhs and the report of your lordships select committee of which i had the honour of being chairman which reported on priorities in medical research <e> <s> the noble lord lord winstanley also referred to that point and so i shall confine my remarks to that aspect of the nhs <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord glenamara referred earlier in the debate to our excellent education system in this country <e> <s> i agree with him by and large but we must accept that there are grave weaknesses in it in that it does not produce an adequate proportion of young people educated up to a satisfactory standard either in higher education or in vocational training <e> <s> i think we all agree that those are two problems which urgently need our attention <e>"]
