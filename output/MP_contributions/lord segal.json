["<cs> my lords i missed the statement of the noble baroness by the skin of my teeth and through circumstances beyond my control <e> <s> i should like to say however that i know that the statement will be studied with the utmost care and i hope that it will go a long way towards relieving the unease that at present is being felt by so many parents of handicapped children all over the country <e> <s> i should like to thank the noble baroness for having so expeditiously made the statement so soon after the second reading of the education bill <e> <s> we understand the difficulties that the warnock report has created and we welcome the opportunity of a full government statement very shortly on the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord say whether the government intend to take any active steps to discourage british visitors to moscow during the period of the games <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl say how far the building of this hospital has progressed during the interval of years <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl say when the building of this hospital is likely to be completed and what is to happen to the intended patients in the meantime <e>", "<cs> while very reluctant to speak against this amendment which i should imagine has a great deal of sympathy on both sides of the committee to insert two persons actively engaged in industry may i ask whether we ought not to be rather careful to see that both these people are not actively engaged in one side of industry <e> <s> ought we not to be precise and see that they are accurately balanced one on one side of industry and one from the other side of industry <e>", "<cs> i think it would be a very gracious act indeed if the government by way of a change would see their way to accepting this amendment <e> <s> it is so eminently reasonable and i cannot imagine anyone possibly finding sufficient grounds for refusing it <e> <s> after all the wording is so moderately expressed it is not mandatory in any way but simply asks that local authorities when appointing governors should have regard to the desirability <e> <s> could any amendment be more reasonably phrased <e> <s> i think it would be a welcome change of attitude on the part of the government if they would see their way for once to accept this amendment in the spirit in which it is phrased <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble lord lord shinwell will avoid all future reference to seneca because he was an expert on old age and that is the last subject which the noble lord is qualified to speak on <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lords have been able to hear so many intensely moving speeches from both sides of the committee that it seems scarcely necessary for any further plea to be made on behalf of this particular amendment <e> <s> but noble lords will recall that during the second reading a great deal of warmth was generated over this issue of clause <e> <s> i did not speak as a parent of a mentally-handicapped child at all <e> <s> i am very fortunate in having children who are normal in every way <e> <s> but i served for years as the predecessor of the noble lord lord renton in the capacity of chairman of the national society for mentally handicapped children <e>"]
