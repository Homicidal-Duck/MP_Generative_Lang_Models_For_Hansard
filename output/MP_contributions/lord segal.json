the minister confirm that the number of senior medical staff has fallen but the number of junior medical staff has increased <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> is he aware that stroke units offer by far the speediest and most efficient form of treatment of the condition and that no extra financial commitments need necessarily be involved <e> <s> is he further aware that several london hospitals notably the new charing cross hospital already have the full facilities for a stroke unit <e> <s> will he undertake to look into the matter in rather greater depth than he has done hitherto <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord undertake to see that arrangements are made for a hospital consultant to be available for domiciliary visits in the early stages of an attack since much research into this condition is still needed <e>", "<cs> my lords i too would like to congratulate the noble earl lord oxford and asquith on his maiden speech for which we have had to wait quite a long time <e> <s> i should also like to thank the noble lord lord chelwood for initiating this debate <e> <s> this debate is obviously opportune for the more often and more fully the middle east is discussed the more hope there is for both sides to learn to understand one another and to learn ultimately to live peacefully together <e>", "<cs> my lords in considering any salary increase will the noble lord bear in mind that for the type of work that they do in saving human life nurses can never be adequately paid <e>", "<cs> my lords are we also to see the end of greetings telegrams <e>", "<cs> my lords following the point raised by the noble lord lord soames is the minister aware that mr avnieri to whom mr yasser arafat granted the interview is the editor of the israeli equivalent of <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while i thank the noble lord for that reply i would like to ask him this question <e> <s> since the removal of st georges hospital and charing cross hospital to the suburbs is the number of beds available in the west of london able to cope with major emergencies such as the recent harrods bomb disaster and does not this emphasise the importance of retaining westminster hospital and all its departments as the utmost degree of efficiency <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not of the utmost importance where human life is at stake that a patient should be admitted to the nearest hospital whether it is public or private <e>", "<cs> my lords could not the manufacturers of proprietary medicines be encouraged to show in larger letters the generic name rather than the proprietary name instead of <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble lord the chairman of committees for that reply i should like to join with him in thanking the attendants of the house and the police for the assistance that they render to members especially those who are disabled seeking to park their cars <e> <s> as parking spaces become more and more scarce and as the abolition of this house becomes more and more remote could not parking space be created underground as has been done in the other place so that the approaches to this house may be more greatly enhanced <e>", "<cs> my lords is this small number likely to be further reduced when we have heard the noble lords reply to the second question on the order paper <e>"]
