["<cs> my lords would the noble earl the minister on further consideration and in the light of all the efficiencies of the corporation in developing the project consider that it is against the short-term long-term and national interests to carry through this sale <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that i should immediately declare what is perhaps an oblique interest in wanting a successful passage for this bill through your lordships house to give effect to a request made by the senate and by the house of commons <e>", "<cs> my lords i sincerely wish to associate myself with the congratulations extended to the noble viscount lord torrington on his able maiden speech and with so many other noble lords i look forward to hearing him address this house again <e> <s> in my view the report before us fully warrants the serious attention that previous speakers have given it <e> <s> it justifies the time and expertise that the committee has given to it throughout and together with the noble earl lord bessborough i commend detailed attention to the whole of the report <e>", "<cs> my lords i join my noble friend lord davies in assuring the house that i do not propose to make a lengthy speech at the end of the proceedings <e> <s> but i must congratulate my noble friend lord bishopston and also the noble lord lord tanlaw if i may on leaving the minister with a number of pertinent questions which i am sure he will deal with in due course <e> <s> in speaking to the motion for annulment and in support of my noble friend lord bishopston it seems to me not only appropriate but necessary to restate some key contributions made when this house in committee on th may discussed the oil and gas enterprise bill clause i entitled oil corporations power of disposal <e> <s> on that occasion lord bishopston moved amendment no <e>", "<cs> my lords in terms of academic debate one may be able to subtract economic mention from the title of our discussion this evening <e> <s> in reality i suggest that it is impossible <e> <s> even an attempt becomes ludicrous <e> <s> it is a question of priority as to how one places actuality but it is for sure that the first action of the dynamic of our title is economic <e> <s> i have no desire to pre-empt my remarks in tomorrows debate on the address in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords there may be members of your lordships house who will not like the content of the bill that is obvious from the debate which the noble lord lord jenkins presents for second reading <e> <s> it contains at least the undeniable words that <e>", "<cs> my lords the first thing that i want to do is to thank my noble friend lord wells-pestell for initiating a debate on the motion in such a robust and moving fashion <e> <s> the economic committee of the tuc met sir geoffrey howe the chancellor of the exchequer in london on th february to place before him a billion package of proposals and to urge jobs aid as contained in their economic review <e> <s> the tuc general secretary mr len murray was reported to have said afterwards <e>", "<cs> my lords in some ways it may be appropriate to pause for a moment <e> <s> i want to follow the custom and courtesy of your lordships house by congratulating the noble lord lord cameron of balhousie on his maiden speech <e> <s> i wish to take advantage with the permission of your lordships of this very thin house where every member of it is literally on duty <e> <s> i wish to take advantage in this sense <e> <s> it is almost classic after my experience of your lordships house to give advice not necessarily patronage to those who come here for the first time <e> <s> what do you do <e> <s> how do you handle the circumstance in your lordships house in which we are now a thin house at the tail end of a debate <e> <s> so much has been said with which perhaps you agree and which you do not wish to repeat <e> <s> perhaps however something has been said which you want to contest but time works against you <e> <s> how do you put it together and cover it in a contribution which will not weary your <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord mishcon in his usual able way delineated the line that participants in the debate from now on should take about utilisation and rationalisation of time <e> <s> i propose to be guided <e> <s> also i should like not as a mere formality to associate myself with the congratulations on the maiden speech made by the noble lord lord hanson both for its content and its value <e> <s> our all-party media group recently listened to representations from the radio and television safeguards committee <e> <s> these people were highly qualified and their representations fit into an indication that is emerging from the debate that we should take note of what we do not know rather than what we think we do <e> <s> we were well guided in preparing ourselves but the questions and answers underlined how much we do not know about the manifold implications of the introduction of cable broadcasting to our country <e>", "<cs> my lords i join with other noble lords in giving congratulations upon the maiden speech of the noble lord lord bruce-gardyne and i join them too in hoping that we shall hear from him again many times during the process of our business <e> <s> i particularly want to congratulate the noble earl lord kimberley i join other noble lords in doing so for the timing of this debate and i would seek the understanding of your lordships in having discarded the few notes that i had prepared to participate in this timely debate <e>", "<cs> my lords the most important note of emphasis that my noble friend lord caradon and my noble and learned friend lord elwyn-jones struck in their most valid introduction to this short debate was that the matter is of first-rate importance when one questions the future of the oceans of the world <e> <s> it is important to all the peoples of the world <e> <s> it is i feel of particular importance to the british people because i submit the united kingdom government have played a somewhat shamefaced role in the matter <e> <s> that we started off reasonably well in adopting some positive positions is obvious and it was sensible to follow certain logical paths <e> <s> my noble friend lord caradon referred to his joy at being able to indicate more than a decade of devoted and successful international negotiations <e>", "<cs> my lords i must immediately join with my noble friend lord willis in saying that investment is the key to the whole problem <e> <s> this bill before your lordships and this discussion on the second reading taken together with positive representations from all sides of the film industry with unprecedented unanimity are impressive beyond measure <e> <s> the issues are closely argued in the most positive fashion support is emphasised for the continuation of financial partnership between government and the industry <e> <s> it has been a cornerstone of the training policy of successive governments via the national film and television school but concern is expressed that the government may not get the relationship properly worked out in order to maintain the educational independence of the school to secure for it the proper level of funding and to guarantee its future funding against the changes of ownership in the private sector <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister surprised that the feeling of a number of us remains that his replies are definitely negative <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i am known among your lordships as being an advocate of brevity in speeches but i ought to find time at the outset to congratulate my noble friend lord bruce on his speech as an appropriate and robust presentation and a reminder of the real and total context of todays debate and of one of the most important select committee reports to have emerged from this house <e>", "<cs> my lords why is it such a low key presentation <e> <s> this is in absolute contrast with the speech of the french prime minister last week in which he made it quite clear that the french were enthusiastic but that they were on the side of development whereas it appears from what the minister is saying now that that does not matter much <e> <s> it depends on finance and finance itself is a matter of certainty investment and development of techniques in technology <e> <s> the whole matter is tied together <e> <s> it needs a wider presentation <e> <s> it requires the kind of <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may ask this question <e> <s> why is there that difference between this and the presentation of the german bavarian prime minister who gave a robust indication of their commitment <e> <s> that is what i should like to have heard and why not <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support the amendment proposed by the noble lord lord williams and congratulate him on his presentation <e> <s> i should like also to make one or two brief remarks in response to her majestys governments proposals for the coming session <e> <s> i wish to talk about three subjects which for our purposes can be called the big problem the big question and the big idea <e>"]
