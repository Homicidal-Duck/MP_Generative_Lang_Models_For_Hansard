["<cs> i too would like to support this amendment <e> <s> i think it may be much better in some areas but in many areas and in many areas in london where my experience is there is a lamentable divorce between those who are concerned with industry and the secondary schools in the area <e> <s> there has been some improvement but so far as i can see it is minimal <e> <s> i sat for a number of years on a quango which has unhappily now been disbanded <e> <s> it was the south east economic planning council <e> <s> this was a matter of continual concern to the industrialists on that council <e> <s> they were eminent people they were active <e> <s> they were concerned with our national welfare and they came back repeatedly to this particular subject the divorce between our secondary schools and industry for the very reason that my noble friend lord taylor of blackburn has just given <e> <s> teachers go from school to training school or university and then back into school and they therefore naturally can interest their pupils academically but cannot talk about the industrial world <e> <s> they do not know the industrial world and they do not go out into the industrial world and try to get the industrial world to liaise with the schools <e>", "<cs> the minister said that if this debate got publicity it might encourage people from industry to come forward <e> <s> is it not a fact we must recognise facts and to me from my experience it is a fact that they would have to come forward through the party political machine <e> <s> i believe that is so generally throughout the country <e> <s> the people of whom i am thinking are not <e>", "<cs> i am unable to accept the argument put forward on this amendment by lord alexander <e> <s> i believe that the governing body of a primary or secondary school should be responsible for overseeing the needs and requirements of all pupils in all aspects of the school <e> <s> if the grounds which the noble lord suggested should be maintained by the parks department were not kept in a proper state or were not up to a schools requirements surely it would be for the governing body to draw the attention of the education committee to the fact that the parks department of the local authority was in dereliction of its proper duty <e> <s> the same consideration applies to the supply of stationery or anything else required by the school <e> <s> therefore i regret that i cannot go along with lord alexanders argument <e>", "<cs> i attach particular importance to this amendment <e>"]
