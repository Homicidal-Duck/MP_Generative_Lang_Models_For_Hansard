["<cs> i too would like to support this amendment <e> <s> i think it may be much better in some areas but in many areas and in many areas in london where my experience is there is a lamentable divorce between those who are concerned with industry and the secondary schools in the area <e> <s> there has been some improvement but so far as i can see it is minimal <e> <s> i sat for a number of years on a quango which has unhappily now been disbanded <e> <s> it was the south east economic planning council <e> <s> this was a matter of continual concern to the industrialists on that council <e> <s> they were eminent people they were active <e> <s> they were concerned with our national welfare and they came back repeatedly to this particular subject the divorce between our secondary schools and industry for the very reason that my noble friend lord taylor of blackburn has just given <e> <s> teachers go from school to training school or university and then back into school and they therefore naturally can interest their pupils academically but cannot talk about the industrial world <e> <s> they do not know the industrial world and they do not go out into the industrial world and try to get the industrial world to liaise with the schools <e>", "<cs> the minister said that if this debate got publicity it might encourage people from industry to come forward <e> <s> is it not a fact we must recognise facts and to me from my experience it is a fact that they would have to come forward through the party political machine <e> <s> i believe that is so generally throughout the country <e> <s> the people of whom i am thinking are not <e>", "<cs> i am unable to accept the argument put forward on this amendment by lord alexander <e> <s> i believe that the governing body of a primary or secondary school should be responsible for overseeing the needs and requirements of all pupils in all aspects of the school <e> <s> if the grounds which the noble lord suggested should be maintained by the parks department were not kept in a proper state or were not up to a schools requirements surely it would be for the governing body to draw the attention of the education committee to the fact that the parks department of the local authority was in dereliction of its proper duty <e> <s> the same consideration applies to the supply of stationery or anything else required by the school <e> <s> therefore i regret that i cannot go along with lord alexanders argument <e>", "<cs> i attach particular importance to this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to commence my speech by expressing my thanks to the noble lord lord bellwin for the clear exposition he gave of this bill which is a very complicated one <e> <s> he was very helpful to us <e> <s> i also want to add my congratulations on his maiden speech to those already expressed to the right reverend prelate the bishop of newcastle though he is now absent <e> <s> i thought it was a very moving deeply felt and wise speech and i am sure we all look forward to hearing him again many times <e>", "<cs> i should like to make my position clear <e> <s> as has been said i have an amendment down on page of the marshalled list but i am giving my full support to this amendment <e> <s> the reason i also have an amendment is because fear alas <e> <s> that the government may not accept this amendment <e> <s> i tried very hard to put down an amendment that i hoped leaned as far as possible in the governments direction so as to enable them to accept it in the last instance <e> <s> nevertheless i give this amendment my wholehearted support <e> <s> i hope that my position is clear <e>", "<cs> may i intervene briefly <e> <s> as we all know these are areas full of grave social problems <e> <s> they are districts of mixed populations and they give councils in the areas enormous problems <e> <s> my noble friend lord pitt made the point strongly about not being able to lose one single relet <e> <s> i cannot over-emphasise that <e> <s> one single relet in that area is absolutely invaluable <e> <s> i hope the minister will give this considerable thought <e> <s> whether we have got the amendment worded right i do not know but it is a point that somehow ought to be recognised in the bill <e> <s> obviously when in time i hope not too long a time these areas can be de-designated then the situation will change it will revert to normal and the houses can be sold <e> <s> but what we are saying is that at the present time we cannot let the situation go as it is and it must be protected <e>", "<cs> i know that the minister truly believes that in these stress areas houses will be sold and then the area will be lifted up <e> <s> quite frankly if i believed that i should not be supporting this amendment <e> <s> i live on the borders of brixton and i know the problems there it is a terrible area <e> <s> i really fear that these houses will be sold by those who are now there in order to escape which they will then do and good luck to them but the persons who buy them will buy so to exploit them by renting them out and i do not like the picture <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister and i am happy to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to give the strongest possible support to every word that the noble baroness lady faithfull has said <e> <s> if these houses that have been acquired for rehabilitation are made secure tenancies they will not be used at all they will be boarded-up <e> <s> the boarding-up will be broken down because people can always break it down <e> <s> those houses will be vandalised and occupied by squatters <e> <s> however if the amendment is carried they will be used as the noble baroness has explained for short-term lettings and as soon as the authorities can get round to it financially and their plans are approved they will rehabilitate these houses instead of tearing them down <e> <s> if they are vandalised and vandalised over months they will have to be torn down because they will be finished <e> <s> we do not want all of our old houses torn down they are part of our communities <e> <s> i hope that your lordships will very strongly support the amendment <e>", "<cs> i shall speak to this amendment and then not move my own amendment <e> <s> the matter we are discussing is of great importance to the nation <e> <s> industrial inability is vital <e> <s> we are all concerned about the condition of industry in this country <e> <s> if it cannot get its workers it cannot thrive <e> <s> what we need to do is to get much more mobility <e> <s> i have no doubt that we have all read of and know of workers who have come down from the north to the south because it is in the south that there are vacancies for skilled people that cannot be filled locally <e> <s> they move down from the north <e> <s> they get a job <e> <s> they leave their families behind <e> <s> they cannot get housed <e> <s> in the end it is a tragedy <e> <s> they move north again and go back on the dole <e> <s> this is a dreadful thing for the family for their standard of living and self-respect <e> <s> it is cruel beyond words <e> <s> it is bad nationally and costly to the nation <e>", "<cs> may i give my support to the amendment moved by the noble lord lord hylton and hope that the minister will be able to help us <e> <s> no doubt we have all had information from various housing associations but some of it is absolutely alarming <e> <s> there can be rent increases up to a week which is quite phenomenal <e> <s> i have another example here that i received only today i think from an association of which i was for many years a member <e> <s> they say that the rent increases will range <e>", "<cs> i cannot miss the opportunity of saying to the committee and to my friend the minister that if only the government would give a lot of encouragement to the establishment of management co-ops in local authority dwellings there is here a vast field where they would manage their own affairs <e> <s> we are trying this now in the greater london council area on greater london council estates <e> <s> the council makes a grant to a management co-op to do their own cleaning and repairs collect their own rents and so on <e> <s> we are breaking down a very big estate into small units and making people responsible for their own affairs which includes the taps and all the other things <e> <s> i do really think this is the way forward and it would solve these niggling little problems <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for his explanation about this mysterious clause <e> <s> i must admit now that i did guess it was in order to deal with the bad boys my guess was right <e> <s> but i want something for the good boys <e> <s> i am very disappointed at the ministers attitude <e> <s> it is very fortunate that there are people in london and maybe elsewhere who at no charge whatsoever to the ratepayers are enabled to have a slightly lower mortgage rate <e> <s> i am astonished that the government should want to push up the mortgage rate of those who have managed to have some <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i think we shall want to study the ministers statement very closely <e> <s> there is a great deal of feeling particularly on the part of the charitable trusts about the possibility of having monies that have arisen through the use of their charitable endowments and <e>", "<cs> my lords it is quite obvious that in this chamber there is very great concern on this subject <e> <s> but it is not just in this chamber <e> <s> as has already been said there is deep concern over this matter generally <e> <s> despite what the noble lord lord sandford said the local authorities are extremely concerned about the loss of accommodation for aged people through the sale of bungalows which might go to anybody in the open market because they are very desirable properties <e> <s> the housing association movement is deeply concerned about it all and there is an enormous responsibility i hesitate to say this because i am sure your lordships are fully aware of it on us here this afternoon in the decision that we take in this matter <e> <s> i cannot stress enough that there really is not enough accommodation available to meet the needs of our ageing population <e> <s> the pressure on it everywhere is most acute <e>", "<cs> thank you my lords <e> <s> i shall try not to be too long <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps on this occasion the government could show us that they are flexible and not inflexible <e> <s> if this is going to apply only to a very few people why must we have this written into the bill at all <e> <s> why not leave it to the good commonsense and management experience of the local authority and other people <e> <s> why do we have to have it <e> <s> i suggest to the government that here they can prove some of us wrong and show they are flexible <e> <s> it is not only this point it is the philosophy behind this particular measure that worries me profoundly because here are the government pressing for the right to <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very happy to support this amendment fully <e> <s> i am most grateful for the statement that the noble lord lord bellwin made a few minutes ago about the protection of charitable funds because a principle that everybody in this house would want to stand by is that those funds should be protected <e> <s> but i support very strongly the point that it is a great safeguard for the future if we can have this amendment embodied in the bill <e> <s> following the ministers statement here we can trust the present government but who knows what government will follow <e> <s> one cannot be too careful on this matter <e> <s> since the government accept what we are putting forward is it necessary for us all to go trooping into the same lobby which would be lovely or will the government just accept the amendment and embody it in the bill and then we can all rejoice <e>", "<cs> my lords as one who was also concerned with an amendment on this particular matter i want to say how very happy i am at the outcome and that lady birks amendment was infinitely superior to mine <e> <s> your lordships may remember that when i spoke in the second reading debate i did support lady birk <e> <s> i am still sad that the secretary of state seems to be unduly suspicious of local authorities <e> <s> i think it would be for the good of local government if he could get over that very heavy dose of suspicion <e> <s> of course local authorities that do not share his political philosophy find some of his policies very difficult <e> <s> i suppose that basically they find them so not because of deep party antagonisms which i think is what the secretary of state believes but because those local authority members who disagree with the secretary of states policies feel that they are inimical to the interests of the citizens they represent <e> <s> that is a perfectly proper and understandable point of view for them to take <e> <s> i hope that the secretary of state will as time goes on be able to realise that his partners in government for the local authorities are his partners <e>", "<cs> i do recommend to this committee the very <e>", "<cs> it might be helpful to the committee if i made my contribution on amendment no <e> <s> now because it is all on the same theme <e> <s> the particular note i have made about this provision is that it is the tone of the whole clause that is so disturbing and thus surely unacceptable <e> <s> it is the tone of the proposal that we are trying to amend <e> <s> the ama assure me that the powers being taken in the clause are without precedent <e> <s> my experience is not wide enough to know whether that is so but the ama with their wide knowledge must know and i therefore accept that the powers being taken here by the minister are without precedent powers to close down after calling for a report which he may or may not have had or on which he has or has not made any comment a direct labour organisation <e> <s> i cannot really believe that is what the government want to do but that is what they are saying in the clause <e>", "<cs> regarding the amendment i moved my noble friend will speak for himself on the undertaking given we can look at it at report stage <e> <s> it is the tone i use that word again and the intention perhaps quite wrongly conveyed by the tone which is very offensive to local government <e> <s> if we can get the tone right and the minister is able to come back satisfactorily then we can all be happy together <e>", "<cs> i must say that is very strange because i am usually one of those people who whisper to my neighbour in a gentle voice and everybody outside in the corridor hears me <e> <s> i am rather comforted <e> <s> i understand all is well now <e> <s> i was going on to say that since there will barely be months when this bill becomes an act before the secretary of state is wanting it to come into operation <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness does not think that she can withdraw the amendment because if she does she will let the local authorities down and she is not prepared to do that <e>", "<cs> while i do not wish to detain the committee there is <e>", "<cs> i have the greatest pleasure in supporting the contention of the noble baroness lady stedman and i thank her for her excellent speech <e> <s> i support this amendment very strongly because exactly what it says and indicates may happen is happening <e> <s> what is now being required of new town corporations and the commission for new towns means that their programme of planned development is being undermined and the principles of sound financial management hitherto followed scrupulously by these bodies can no longer be adhered to <e> <s> i must give a little history of this matter and i would make it clear to your lordships that i myself was an actor on the stage through discussions that took place and a meeting with the minister as the chairman of stevenage new town <e> <s> i have been right through it <e> <s> i am no longer connected because stevenage was wound up last month having finished <e> <s> we had no grumble at being wound up <e> <s> we had got to a stage where it was wise and proper that we should be wound up and the town is now resting in the kind hands of the commission for new towns <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may detain the committee for one further moment just to clear up two points that were raised by the noble lord arising out of some remarks that i made <e> <s> for the information of the committee i should like the committee to understand that there were no discussions with individual corporations <e> <s> when we were faced with this <e>", "<cs> does that really apply <e> <s> are we not talking about the disposal of land <e> <s> i would have thought the noble lords remarks scarcely applied to the disposal of land <e> <s> land involves long-term discussions the planning of the town and all the rest of it <e> <s> i am not saying that there are not areas of land that can be disposed of <e> <s> i still find this phrase about urgency not applicable <e>", "<cs> i am so glad that the secretary of state is willing to consult at all <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to give the strongest support possible to the amendment which i am sure would be extremely helpful to the secretary of state as well as to the new towns commission <e> <s> it would mean the minister having regard to these matters in his consultations and i must say how much i welcome the fact that there are to be consultations because whereas i understand that to date in scotland and wales there have been consultations to the best of my knowledge in england the secretary of state has not directly through his <e>", "<cs> my lords at this late hour i do not seek to detain the house for long but i too should like to express my thanks to the noble lord lord digby for bringing this matter to our attention <e> <s> it is a very important matter and i agree so strongly with my noble friend lady white that it is regrettable that the association of county councils did not draw these regulations to our attention in november last year when surely they could have done so <e> <s> i think our method of disposing of hazardous waste is terribly primitive and exceedingly wasteful <e> <s> all we do is look for holes in the ground and then let the waste be dumped there without any effort at all at the reclamation of quite valuable products in the waste which were not of use to the firm which produced it and which would be costly to recover <e> <s> because of the economic controls under which we live this waste is therefore just dumped but i suppose that in the times in which we live this is not the moment to try to do something about it so we go on with our primitive practices <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to start by congratulating the noble lord lord swann on his most interesting and polished maiden speech <e> <s> i am sure we all hope that we shall hear him many times in this chamber <e> <s> i would hope that we can agree all of us that we are discussing the countrys greatest potential asset its future citizens and the educational standards that we are to offer them and the training standards that we are to provide to fit them to make their contribution to this nation in the future <e> <s> i cannot think of anything more important <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble earl lord kimberley for bringing the matter of the third london airport before your lordships again and at least the government will now be aware of how strongly some of your lordships feel on this issue of putting the airport at stansted <e> <s> those feelings are obviously very strong and in my view the suspicions that have been voiced are fully justified <e> <s> it is not good for government that such suspicions should exist in peoples minds i say that because i feel that such suspicions do not exist in the minds of noble lords alone because such a state of affairs is not good for relationships between the government and the governed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to have the correction <e> <s> my notes which i looked up said m and i interpreted it as miles and not minutes <e> <s> but that does not get over the problem of the capacity of the river crossing <e>", "<cs> it is both <e> <s> my m stands for both i will remember <e> <s> but i think it does not get over the problems of severnside <e> <s> one might hope that it did although i do not know what the people living in that region might say <e> <s> i dare say they might take another view of it <e> <s> when one went into all the alternative sites in the south-east there really was none that came up as good as stansted <e> <s> i say as good as stansted because after all it is already an airport <e> <s> it has a two-mile runway and there is the m <e> <s> whoever built that whatever boffin persuaded whatever government to build it it is built and it is now money spent <e> <s> it is not now a new expense on a new airport <e> <s> so all these things count in favour of stansted airport <e> <s> i must say that the first time my husband and i drove up the m we both laughed and said they were always determined to have stansted werent they <e> <s> because it is so unused you do not see another car on it when you drive on it <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to make one or two comments on parts iv and v of the bill but mainly because it might be helpful to your lordships and to the minister to say that i have already put in the text of a new clause which i think would go in part iv of the bill <e> <s> it might be helpful if i briefly indicated the purpose of it and its origin <e> <s> the origin of this new clause is the greater london council <e> <s> i suppose that as i was for some time chairman of its transport committee they came to me <e> <s> i believe that they have also contacted other members of the house but i have actually put in the text <e> <s> the provision would provide that <e>", "<cs> i thank noble lords for what they have said <e> <s> i naturally do not agree with the noble lord lord lucas <e> <s> he knows there is a problem and he is a bit negative about it <e> <s> i think he is in a position to help us all and ought to help us all to be a little more positive because he must recognise that there are some i use the word again very naughty people who ought really to be made to recognise the law and to be socially behaved <e> <s> he nods and i thank him for doing so <e> <s> i also thank the noble lord lord bellwin for his approach <e> <s> yes i will withdraw this amendment of course i will if i feel that it has given this matter an airing and perhaps given us a little impetus to think along lines of yes a package deal but something that must be done because i think the situation is not a good one <e>", "<cs> my lords i too welcome the noble earls reference to the m <e> <s> can the noble earl now give the house a date for the completion of the m which is not the responsibility as he is aware of the greater london council but of the ministry of transport and the government <e> <s> is the noble earl aware that the greater london council for many years irrespective of party has been pressing for this orbital road which will take the heavy traffic out of london and that until that road is completed and built which is the responsibility of the government it is not able to direct heavy lorries to suitable routes for them <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl agree that there is the utmost resistance to road-widening in london <e> <s> i think that this is perhaps a matter to which every noble lord in this house would subscribe because this is an ancient city of great character and we do not want it destroyed nor do we want houses pulled down <e> <s> but the traffic problem in london is very serious and some people just do not perhaps they are not london residents seem to care for the communal weal <e> <s> something must be done about it even if it means putting a harmless clamp on their wheels <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a rather long but very interesting and very important discussion in this chamber this afternoon <e> <s> we have heard about world economy problems and world financial problems but as i have sat here i have had the growing feeling that we have perhaps got rather far away from the day-to-day pressing problems of the poor of the third world which to me is what this matter is all about <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to your lordships for inflicting on you one more speech beyond the list which is in your hands <e> <s> i had not thought to be here today but since i am i feel i must make my contribution to this discussion <e> <s> it will be perfectly plain from all that has been said and i was fascinated to listen to the speech of the noble lord lord marsh because i was on the council at the time when he was acting in his governmental capacity and i remember the whole story as does the noble lord lord plummer that we are discussing a very difficult and to my mind national matter <e> <s> i know we are talking about london transport but london as we know is the capital city and the health of the capital city is a national matter <e> <s> i think we are talking about the health of the capital city and it is from that standpoint and not from a political standpoint at all that i want to talk <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask that the secretary of state in making the appointments of those other than educationalists should give serious thought to appointing industrialists from the various aspects of industry as it is surely essential in this day and age that we get a much closer relationship between the needs of the workplace and education <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say how many of these homes are not modern homes built post-war with modern amenities but are older homes either houses or flats which are awaiting rehabilitation or modernisation and are therefore standing empty <e> <s> as the minister will acknowledge and know full well older homes which stand empty for any length of time deteriorate rapidly and need a lot more money spent on them and are vandalised <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not going to say a word today about part i of the bill <e> <s> we have had some very interesting contributions on it and no doubt we shall be looking at it in committee <e> <s> i was not going to say a word on part ii either but i was very interested in what the noble lord lord lucas of chilworth had to say about vehicle testing <e> <s> i always listen to the noble lord lord lucas with the greatest attention because he is so exceedingly knowledgeable <e> <s> i do not always agree with him nor does he always agree with me but i value his contributions <e> <s> they are always worthwhile and one ponders on them when one goes home and thinks about the matter <e> <s> so i am not going to talk about part ii <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect the noble lord is not really right about that as he knows perfectly well <e> <s> he knows as well as i know that after the war when large areas of london were being rebuilt and new office and other accommodation were being put up the old lcc and the glc though that was much later insisted on quite high standards of parking provision underneath buildings <e> <s> as a matter of fact the glc now regrets that because it has led to the situation in which commuters at one man per car flood into london choking up the roads parking all day and then choking up the roads again when going home <e> <s> the noble lord knows that those facilities were provided at that time <e> <s> he also knows as well as i know that one cannot start excavating underneath old buildings which were there before the war nor can one park cars on top of them <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble lord lord lucas of chilworth will not press the amendment <e> <s> i understand his concern on behalf of the operators and i am sure that he is not without concern for the people <e>", "<cs> i am not unsympathetic to what is being proposed but it rather worries me because surely it goes against the whole principle of parking meters <e> <s> an authorised parking place which is not obstructive is intended to be used for only a limited period so that a number of people can park during the day and then business can be carried on and so forth <e> <s> if we are not very careful we might be so generous as to destroy the proper principle behind the use of parking meters <e>", "<cs> the noble lord the minister said a little while ago that the committee seems full of imagination tonight <e> <s> i think that the committee is getting quite carried away on this subject <e> <s> what is proposed is a limited experiment limited in area to try to do something about the people who do flagrantly bad things when they are parking their cars <e>", "<cs> with the leave of the committee i was only trying to provide a slight corrective to the idea that this should all be washed out and forgotten <e> <s> with the leave of the committee if i may say a few words it is to be an experiment <e> <s> i think that the police will go very very gingerly with it <e> <s> i do not think we are going to have a whole host of irate motorists writing to the newspapers and beseeching your lordships and people in the other house <e> <s> it is also to be tried when we come to a future amendment for a limited period <e> <s> that is all that parliament is asked for <e> <s> i suggest that something like this ought to be tried in order to deal with and help the police to deal with some of the flagrant traffic offences that happen in the inner parts of our crowded cities <e>", "<cs> i suggest that we would be wise at this stage not to press this but that we should wait for the report stage to see what the government come back with as slightly amended wording <e>", "<cs> the government have had plenty of time to think about it <e> <s> to my knowledge it has been pressed on the government for the last years and at last they have screwed up their courage to bring it forward because they know that some measures however unpopular have to be taken to try to deal with the london situation <e> <s> my noble friend lord mishcon for whom i have great respect i have known him for many years says do not vote for it <e> <s> it is an intrusion into peoples rights <e> <s> whose rights <e> <s> i am glad if it is an intrusion into the rights of those who defy the traffic regulations leave their cars in the wrong places and do not care how long they are left or what obstruction they cause <e> <s> they are not citizens whom we in this house should be supporting <e> <s> we should not be telling them that we are not concerned about their conduct and giving them a green light to go on doing it <e> <s> that is not our responsibility in this house <e> <s> our responsibility here is to face up to a serious situation <e> <s> we are talking now about london <e> <s> we are not talking about other cities in this country <e> <s> for one year we want to try this experiment in a few limited areas in our capital city <e> <s> to take the case of soho its little narrow streets are jammed up <e> <s> it is no good talking about fire brigades doctors nurses and everybody else because they just cannot get down those little narrow streets <e> <s> something has got to be done to allow the fire brigades the doctors the nurses and the other essential services to get down those streets <e> <s> those are the problems we are really talking about <e>", "<cs> my lords may i start by saying that i found that sitting on this particular select committee an absolutely fascinating and riveting experience because the issues that we were discussing were not only vitally important to lloyds which is a great national institution which brings us tremendous invisible earnings but they were of national importance certainly when we come to the question of immu <e>", "<cs> my lords as has been said by more than one speaker we are discussing a deep moral issue <e> <s> we are therefore as individuals bound to react to it differently according to our natures maybe according to our upbringing our background and experience of life and our religion <e> <s> my noble friend lord robertson wants to narrow the bill for the reasons he and others have given <e> <s> frankly i lean in the other direction <e> <s> there are many reasons for that but i have no intention of wearying your lordships by speaking for long <e> <s> the bma has pointed out in a letter to my noble friend lord houghton of which a number of us have had copies the almost inevitable consequences if we accept the bill resulting from backstreet abortions <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that under the projected legislation the charitable trusts particularly the sutton housing trust of which until recently i have been a member are profoundly disturbed at the idea that they may be required to sell any houses that have been provided under their trust deed <e> <s> in the case of sutton it flows from the will of mr sutton who died in he left his fortune to a charitable trust for <e>", "<cs> my lords it continues <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the house for looking as though i wanted to jump the gun <e> <s> i did not and i thank the noble lord for correcting me <e> <s> may i ask the minister whether he realises that housing trusts are very distressed about what looks as though it is going to be the moral requirement on them to sell houses which have been provided under the terms of the charitable trust under which they must work and do work very loyally and carefully <e> <s> this would be a requirement to sell houses that under their trusteeship have been provided by no matter what monies to rent to lower paid people who need to rent and cannot buy <e>", "<cs> my lords let me at the outset make it clear that i fully support the indignation of the noble lord lord underhill and others who have attacked the bill because the bill itself attacks local democracy and the powers of local government <e> <s> however i shall not pursue that theme <e> <s> when the secretary of state spoke in the other place when introducing this measure on th november last and the noble minister lord bellwin made the same points when he opened here this afternoon he said that <e>", "<cs> it really is necessary in my view and i hope in the view of everybody else to vote on these words in this amendment <e> <s> the trouble is that the government are absolutely blinkered by their concentration on rates <e> <s> we only ever hear about rates <e> <s> that is what concerns us on this side so very much <e> <s> i am not denying that rates which have now risen to a high level are a matter of importance <e> <s> but from all that is said and written we gather that the government think only about rates and we want to be certain when we are considering transport policies and the monies that are necessary that the government take into consideration social economic and environmental transport advantages <e>", "<cs> with great respect <e>", "<cs> may i plead with the noble lord lord lucas of chilworth not to be so adamant and so unyielding as the government have been right through this bill <e> <s> i welcome the intervention of the noble lord lord campbell of alloway <e> <s> is it not possible that the cost of such a review which the minister himself insists should be undertaken could be regarded a cost above the legal limit set for the local authority <e> <s> it is quite plain that the authority if there is money to be saved will be very hard pressed to offer the service that ought to be run <e> <s> any small extra cost and although this review would not be a vast extra cost it would be an extra cost will make the transport authoritys difficulties even greater <e> <s> can the noble lord not take this away as we are pleading with him to do to see what arrangement can be made so that the cost of the review is not a part of the legally laid down limit within which the authority must work <e>", "<cs> i speak from this bench because i normally sit on this side of the house but i am really speaking because i am presently a member of three housing associations <e> <s> two of them are what i call ordinary housing associations which house people in the same way as local authorities <e> <s> however i have spent many years as a member of two charitable housing associations <e> <s> one is the sutton housing trust which i believe is the largest charitable housing association of them all <e> <s> the other is the st pancras charitable housing association which was founded in and builds and has its property holdings east of euston station behind st pancras station and just into finsbury <e> <s> it is therefore a city centre housing association <e>", "<cs> there is great disquiet about this matter <e> <s> my noble friend lady birk has told your lordships why we shall have to come back to it <e> <s> in view of the hour i shall say no more other than that i shall say what has to be said on the next occasion <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord lord bellwin for making his position quite clear <e> <s> now we know that we have to do battle with him <e>", "<cs> i have very great pleasure in supporting the amendment <e> <s> i shall not go over the ground which the noble baroness lady birk has laid out <e> <s> the situation is very plain <e> <s> it involves unfortunate and sad human circumstances often surrounded by much emotion and sometimes regrettably fraught with bitterness <e> <s> if by legislation we can do anything to alleviate what is an unpleasant and distressing situation it is our duty to do so <e> <s> i hope that the government will look kindly at the proposed new clause or if they wish to alter the wording at some other legislation to deal with this particular problem <e>", "<cs> if i am allowed to say so yes it is all part of the same picture <e> <s> we from this side are delighted that the noble lord is going to look at it but perhaps these amendments are a little more flexible if i might put it like that than the previous ones <e>", "<cs> yes i think the wording of the amendment is very loose as it was a probing amendment and that is partly why it was so worded <e> <s> one surely cannot lay down cost limits nationally can one <e> <s> costs vary from area to area <e> <s> in london they are wildly expensive and i hope not so expensive in other places <e> <s> is it to be left to the local authorities <e> <s> there are so many questions we could go on for hours asking questions <e> <s> i suppose all this will be in regulations <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> i do not think we can take it any further today <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may pursue this point <e> <s> i should have thought that it would be enormously helpful to the government if they could get the co-operation of all the professional people involved in this exercise to agree jointly and with the approval of the government to setting up a body <e> <s> indeed the government could set up the body with the approval and co-operation of those professional people <e> <s> that one body might then have panels of inspectors with different qualifications at different levels <e> <s> perhaps at the lowest level if i may use that expression they would be competent to inspect two-storey houses and so on and at the very highest level they would be competent to inspect the building which i think is fabulous namely the new lloyds building in the city which would need an inspector with enormous experience <e> <s> if there were one body that was recognised nationally and composed of representatives from all the professions it would be a body of enormous standing giving enormous confidence <e> <s> it could have panels and as regards the very difficult question of somebody not doing his job properly it could ensure that he did not get another one <e>", "<cs> the minister pleads that part of the reason for this action is to do away with too much bureaucracy <e> <s> none of us supports a lot of bureaucratic nonsense but nevertheless we are so worried that the safeguards in this bill are being whittled away and that what is left is minimal that we would sooner preserve a little reasonable bureaucracy in the interests of safety <e> <s> that is really where we stand <e> <s> i do not know whether the government realise surely they do now having gone this far with the bill that we and a great many professional people outside are exceedingly worried about this bill and the further we go through the bill the more worried about it we become <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that all of us in this chamber and if they were able to many thousands of women outside this chamber would love to congratulate the noble baroness lady macleod and thank her deeply for raising this very special and particular issue just before the summer recess <e> <s> for it is absolutely essential and i hope that the government will listen with great sympathy that this hospital shall not close <e> <s> it is that for which we are pleading <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel particularly privileged to have the honour of congratulating the noble lord lord cornwallis on his maiden speech <e> <s> not only was it informative and wise but it had that little touch of wit at the end which was quite delightful <e> <s> the noble lord has certainly acquitted himself very well indeed this afternoon <e> <s> i am sure we all hope that we shall hear him many more times in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to start by also congratulating the noble lord lord broxbourne on his maiden speech <e> <s> as the noble earl lord selkirk said it is indeed a very happy fact that he has joined us at this particular moment <e> <s> i shall have to listen to him very carefully because i must admit that i do not like part ii of the bill one little bit <e> <s> however i will keep an open mind and i will listen to him and if i am persuaded then well and good but at the moment i am very critical <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be in the interests of the house if i were to wait until we deal with the amendments to the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i would point out to noble lords in this house that my major point was the effect on the disadvantaged on the have nots of this nation <e> <s> in all that he has said in the minutes during which he has been speaking the noble lord lord bellwin has not shown any awareness whatever that there is a submerged section of the population of this country <e>", "<cs> while we are talking about the word design i should very much like to discharge an undertaking which i gave to the noble lord the minister when he was winding up the second reading debate <e> <s> at that time he rather challenged me <e> <s> i should like to quote from the <e>", "<cs> i shall try to be brief because i notice that time is passing quickly and we have a long way to go through this bill <e> <s> however i want to quote what the noble lord lord bellwin said in his speech on second reading when he referred to the fact that we were not talking about these particular bungalows and flats sheltered housing <e> <s> that is agreed we are not <e> <s> he said <e>", "<cs> i am absolutely astonished by what i have just heard <e> <s> these amendments were never meant to work against the tenant <e> <s> they were meant to establish a flexibility between the landlord and the tenant that could help the tenant and the landlord and help the whole process <e> <s> i shall not pursue the amendments now <e> <s> i shall withdraw them but i would be glad if the noble lord would agree that we could perhaps have some conversation <e> <s> i may have worded the amendments badly but obviously their intention is not understood at all <e> <s> i think that there is nothing much between the government and ourselves <e> <s> we want a little flexibility rather than a hard-and-fast scheme in every single detail <e> <s> it is not beyond the government to bring that in without hurting anybody either the landlord or the tenant and it could make things easier <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i too give the warmest possible support to this amendment <e> <s> until recently i have been a member of a secondary housing cooperative which was originally financed by the glc and also by the boroughs <e> <s> its object has been to start up co-operatives in conjunction with london boroughs <e> <s> in one instance it was new housing a very large glc development in islington part of which was half built <e> <s> the other half was still being built and we were invited by the glc to see whether we could co-operatise if one may use that horrid word the part that was not yet built <e> <s> this was very large consisting of over houses <e> <s> we managed to split that down <e> <s> we could not alter the plans but were able to split it into four different and separate co-operatives which are still there and flourishing <e>", "<cs> i should like to answer the point raised a few minutes ago about whether the young couples who are struggling to raise the deposit on their first house could not go into the charitable houses left vacant by the people able to move out of those <e> <s> i can only speak from my knowledge of my <e>", "<cs> my lords i rose slowly because i was not quite sure of the meaning of the word this in the expression used by the noble lord lord skelmersdale when he said that he would consider inserting this in the final regulations <e> <s> can i be helped to understand what the this is <e>", "<cs> for that my lords i am grateful <e> <s> otherwise i am disappointed <e> <s> the noble baroness said that the the timescale of the model scheme indicated was not workable <e> <s> my lords it works <e> <s> it has worked for tenants for three years and i give you my assurance that it works <e> <s> i will ask the british housing association which works this scheme to send the noble baroness all the details about it <e> <s> i give the house an absolute assurance that it works <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to express my personal gratitude to the noble baroness lady vickers for putting down this amendment <e> <s> when i read it i was so pleased that i thought how very silly i had been not to have put it down myself <e> <s> i feel very strongly that what she has got down here will be an absolute blessing to i regret to say hundreds if not thousands of local authority tenants who are not able to use the procedures that until very recently i thought that they could use <e> <s> they cannot call in the environmental health officer or they could call him in but he cannot take any action <e> <s> he cannot get the case to the courts because the environmental officer and the housing department are all part of the local authority and one cannot be acting against the other <e> <s> and i regret to say how many local authorities fail in their duties <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that none of us sitting here will be surprised that the amendment has been rejected <e> <s> indeed as has been said it is the governments policy not to accept any amendments however wise or non-party political they may be <e> <s> but with regard to this amendment i wonder whether the noble lord lord bellwin will for a minute consider the following suggestion <e> <s> i remember him saying i think i am right that in the allocation to the housing corporation for this year a sum of million was specified to meet this particular need <e> <s> we do not know what will be the response from this field it is an unknown <e> <s> if it comes within million the noble lord lord bellwin can quite rightly say we have catered for it <e> <s> but if it is more than million the situation will be very serious for the housing corporation and for all the housing associations dependent on housing corporation money <e> <s> they will already have their programmes set and geared to the money that is available minus the million <e> <s> with all his experience of housing the noble lord lord bellwin knows as well as any of us in the chamber that when a contract is about to be let it is exceedingly distressing if programmes are upset due to a claw-back there are already always enough checks all along the line <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought it might be helpful if i were briefly to outline how the present position of london transport has developed from to the present time that is a birds-eye view of one who was a member of the glc a birds-eye view from inside <e> <s> in the glc was brought into being <e> <s> at that time london transport was under the control of the government through the london passenger transport board <e> <s> transport services in london were <e>", "<cs> my lords i am describing the programme we embarked on <e> <s> nobody on this earth can wave a magic wand and immediately in see all the improvements <e> <s> you are planning ahead <e> <s> that is what i am saying <e> <s> we were looking at the financial implications which would build up year by year as the programme built up and the service improved <e> <s> i cannot agree with the noble lord <e> <s> there has been some improvement although not nearly enough <e>", "<cs> my lords i might say that that is a defect of the rating system <e> <s> that is what we from this side of the house are asking to have a study about and to have it revised <e>", "<cs> my lords before i start on the point i wish to make to your lordships i should like to comment on the final remarks of the noble lord lord molson <e> <s> which secretary of state and what climate of opinion are we being asked to rely upon <e> <s> we do not <e>", "<cs> yes maturity <e> <s> i thank my noble friend for giving me that word it is very helpful <e> <s> these people number thousands and as i say they must look to the local authorities and housing associations to house them adequately <e> <s> we have not got enough of these dwellings <e> <s> although there are many thousands of them the number is still inadequate for the people who need to be in such accommodation <e> <s> if they are not in such accommodation they will age more rapidly they will suffer and then they will have to go into geriatric wards in hospitals <e> <s> i am sure that those of your lordships who <e>", "<cs> my lords i just want profoundly to disagree with the minister <e> <s> when i was chairman of the glc housing committee we built many thousands of units specially designed for elderly people and last time in this chamber i produced plans to prove that point <e>", "<cs> i find lord lucass reply exceedingly disappointing <e> <s> referring to lord plummers remarks i cannot see that it is correct to make the comparison between the coal board which he instanced and lrt <e> <s> the lte and the glc have joint responsibility for london transport <e> <s> the glc is responsible for policy and its meetings as the noble lord lord underhill said are open to the public <e> <s> the london transport board is responsible for the day-to-day workings and that meeting is not open to the public <e> <s> there is a clear distinction between that and policy matters which are open to the public to whom it is open to sit in the public gallery of the committee in county hall <e>", "<cs> if i could add to the noble baronesss comments i would agree with her that this matter is very necessary <e> <s> i went into it very deeply when i was on the glc and chairman of transport and i talked to the government about it <e> <s> they do this in hamburg and of course it saves millions of pounds <e> <s> it is the one thing that is required <e> <s> the reply i received from the government and i think it would be exactly the same from this government or any government was in this country we are absolutely opposed to having a personal identity card with a photograph for every citizen to be carried in a handbag or a pocket <e> <s> hamburg have a very small troop of inspectors for the whole city <e> <s> let me talk about the underground because that is really where money is saved <e> <s> they vary their tactics <e> <s> sometimes the authorities concentrate on two or three stations on one line and they check the passengers on the station to see that they have bought a ticket or they check on the train <e> <s> the underground is a walk-on/walk off system with no barriers or anything <e> <s> there is only one man to every station upstairs or downstairs <e> <s> the saving is enormous <e> <s> this is the answer to london transport but it cannot be done <e> <s> in hamburg the inspectors say where is your ticket <e> <s> if the reply is oh i have not got one then whether the passenger has no ticket or he is overriding the inspectors say right <e> <s> your name and address <e> <s> and the passenger must produce an identity card <e> <s> we do not have identity cards in this country <e> <s> i can say that i am sally ann and that i come from anywhere i like can i not <e> <s> who can say i am not sally ann <e> <s> that is the answer to the noble baroness <e> <s> i wish we could adopt the hamburg system and do it <e> <s> i personally think it is worth carrying an identity card <e>", "<cs> i am delighted to have what really is an identity card to enable me now as an old-age pensioner to travel free on london transport <e> <s> it also has a photograph on it <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened very carefully to what the noble lord lord lucas of chilworth has said <e> <s> he is quite right this amendment has been put down because we are most concerned that the terms of reference of london regional transport will debar it from considering the needs of london as a whole in the way that any transport authority ought to be allowed to consider those needs <e> <s> london regional transport will be a transport authority <e> <s> it will have to concentrate upon that job <e> <s> that is the purpose of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to present a petition from the greater london council sealed with the seal of the council which prays that your lordships do not proceed with the proposal to cancel the elections in london <e>", "<cs> my lords i first of all apologise for the fact that i had to leave the chamber for the past quarter of an hour <e> <s> i had to attend the meeting of the statutory instruments committee upstairs which was the fastest ever and finished in record time <e> <s> i returned to the chamber to find the house still on the same clause and i should like to say a few words about it <e> <s> i welcome the fact that some action is being taken on this matter but i think that perhaps i am alone among noble lords here in feeling that the action is much too gentle soft and tentative <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for that explanation <e> <s> i now understand <e> <s> really what i am saying is that i am glad that we are trying to do something but i personally think if we really mean business that after a period of time there will have to be a revision of the scheme to make it much tougher <e> <s> i wish that were not so but society being what it is today that is how i feel <e>", "<cs> no my lords it was not me <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to support this amendment as strongly as i can and to endorse every word that lord underhill has spoken <e> <s> i remember going round and meeting the men of london transport the drivers in particular and the people in the works <e> <s> they were always emphasising how much better were the old buses that they themselves had made than any other buses they had to use <e> <s> they had to use them they were not allowed to go on manufacturing <e> <s> there was always a search for better buses <e> <s> in the early days when i became chairman and we had such trouble trying to get more buses on the roads again the complaints came about the buses <e> <s> they brought out some of the old buses that they themselves had manufactured because they were still so much better than the modern ones they could buy <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble baroness for all the information she has given us <e> <s> i must say that i am horrified by it <e> <s> but it seems to me that there is no reason for this committee to act badly simply because one council whichever council it is has itself acted badly <e>", "<cs> my lords today in this house we are considering the thesis that the gap between the rich and the poor in this nation is widening <e> <s> for the expression rich and poor i should like to substitute the words those who can live comfortably and happily without undue worry and those whose life is one long worry because they have not enough to eat and are always looking to see from where and how cheaply they can find the next meal <e> <s> such people are short of clothing they are short of other necessities of life and they seem to be caught in a trap from which they cannot escape <e>", "<cs> my lords in the past before any changes in the local government structure have been considered and put forward a committee or commission of inquiry has always been set up <e> <s> it has heard evidence <e> <s> it has gone into the details of what might be changed and what could be improved and it has put forward proposals <e> <s> the government have received proposals and considered them <e> <s> they brought a bill before another place and there has been long deliberation there and in this house and in the end legislation has been forthcoming <e> <s> of course not everyone has been satisfied with what has been produced that is only natural but at least there has been full discussion and full consideration and the democratic processes have been properly followed <e>", "<cs> we have had some magnificent speeches <e> <s> i pay particular tribute to the speech of the noble lord lord plummer <e> <s> if anyone in this chamber knows about london government what is needed what it does so much of what it does has never reached the light of day and the services given by expert groups of officers it is the noble lord lord plummer <e> <s> he knows having been the leader of the glc <e>", "<cs> my i ask the noble lord the chairman for guidance <e> <s> looking at the clock are we trying to take a vote now before some of us go for a meal <e> <s> or are we going to adjourn and then continue later with the same amendment <e>", "<cs> i wish to speak before the minister rises because i hope that whatever he thought he was going to say he will realise that this amendment is a friendly amendment <e> <s> it is not an anti-government amendment at all and was never intended as such <e> <s> it is an amendment that has been put down entirely in order to help to save a situation that those of us like the noble lord lord plummer and others in the committee who know the situation in london very intimately can foresee <e> <s> a terrible situation could arise unless the government accept the amendment or at least accept it broadly and go along with it <e> <s> that is really what we are asking for <e> <s> i listened with great interest to lord plummers speech and i will do my utmost not to go over it <e> <s> i will try to select from the speech that i had prepared so as not to cover again the themes that he has covered <e>", "<cs> before the minister sits down perhaps i may ask him to clarify two brief points <e> <s> first on the improvement areas did i gather that he did not accept that the teams working now and involved in the middle of a scheme for tower hamlets for example would not be allowed to stay there and finish their job after abolition <e> <s> that is one question <e>", "<cs> will the minister clarify a further point <e> <s> in reading through reports in another place i have never understood it i noticed that there was to be access for londoners to the majority of the seaside and country homes <e> <s> those were the words that the minister used <e> <s> who is going to have the minority <e> <s> who is going to make nominations to those <e> <s> is it to be the minister himself <e> <s> this seems to me an extraordinary position <e> <s> why should not londoners have the majority the whole lot <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may ask the minister for further clarification on the main point <e> <s> i understood that the promise was that the boroughs would take over specialist staff temporarily on a voluntary basis <e> <s> it is really a unified team although it breaks into sub-teams to do the job now on different buildings <e> <s> but it is a team of expertise <e> <s> our point is that expertise must not be broken up <e> <s> if you break the team up and a few go to this borough some to that borough and some to another borough the whole thing will come apart and you will never get the programme finished <e> <s> that is the whole point <e> <s> is the team to be kept together or is the team to be fragmented and the programme not to run on time at all <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down will he make it clear whether the new body he is proposing will be a statutory body <e>", "<cs> my lords since more than dwellings have been transferred from the glc to the london boroughs <e> <s> some of them were accepted voluntarily by boroughs in <e> <s> a further were accepted by eight inner london boroughs under a compulsory order in <e> <s> an additional dwellings were transferred in various sweeping up orders <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say that that is not my intention at all <e> <s> i am sorry to know though i am certain of it that this bill will receive royal assent and that the glc will be abolished and its administration will no longer be there <e> <s> as i tried to make clear i am concerned with helping the boroughs which will be submerged in difficulties and the tenants <e>", "<cs> my lords as a matter of fact i do not because i know nothing about them <e> <s> i was talking about the technical officers <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down can he answer the point which i raised <e> <s> if the boroughs are to be consulted about their need to have the help of existing glc teams why cannot the <e>", "<cs> my lords i want the government to motor even faster and do the consultations before abolition and before they have set up the residuary body <e> <s> do it themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords i too express my great thanks to the noble lord lord seebohm for initiating this debate and to those who sat on the committee and produced this report <e> <s> my thanks go also to the secretary who i imagine did so much if not all in writing the report <e> <s> it is a very clear readable and direct report <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to deal with only one point raised by the noble lord that of the rights of the tenant <e> <s> i have always found the british people reasonable and understanding <e> <s> i think that is true of us as a nation <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the policy that has so far been used for housing the refugees was a policy of dispersal and that this has caused not only great misery and unhappiness for the refugees but also concern to local authorities <e> <s> there have been great problems because the extended family which is the family pattern of these people has been broken up <e> <s> they have felt isolated miserable and disorientated <e> <s> they have therefore struggled to regather their family units which has meant a great problem for the big cities of london birmingham manchester and liverpool <e> <s> they have congregated in london in four south london boroughs which have a terrible housing problem of their own <e> <s> yet the boroughs are doing their utmost to help those poor souls who now have all congregated in those areas in order to get their family units together <e>", "<cs> my lords i found the ministers statement very interesting and i shall be reading what he has said <e> <s> i wish to take up only two points <e> <s> i believe i am correct in saying that he said that the government will not give more than per cent <e> <s> grant <e> <s> is that correct <e> <s> i gather that it is not correct <e> <s> i am very glad to know it <e> <s> i am deeply involved in one <e>", "<cs> it is obvious that great concern is felt on this side about the principle we started to discuss some time ago the kind of vote that is to be taken and how it is to be taken <e> <s> the concern felt here represents the concern of hundreds of thousands of people <e> <s> there are hundreds of thousands of tenants who are as concerned as anyone in this place <e> <s> that concern is felt not only on this side of the chamber but on the other side as well <e>"]
