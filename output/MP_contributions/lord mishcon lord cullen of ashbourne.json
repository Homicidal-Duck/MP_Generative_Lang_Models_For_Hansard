["<cs> i first should like to say to the noble lord lord mishcon that i fully appreciate that he is trying to hurry things along we certainly appreciate it from this side of the committee <e> <s> this clause prohibits a company from transferring without the approval of the general meeting any substantial property to and by a director a director of its holding company or a person or company connected with a director <e> <s> the clause also provides what are to be the consequences in civil law for any transaction entered into in contravention of the clause <e>", "<cs> this is rather a different matter and in our opinion this clause amounts to an unwarrantable invasion of personal privacy <e> <s> it would for example require a director to reveal to his company the existence and identity of an illegitimate child or an estranged wife even though there might be no question of any transaction or loan between these and the company <e> <s> it is surely totally unreasonable to force every company to maintain details of their directors wives children and the rest simply on the off-chance that some of them will do business with connected persons <e> <s> what is more it is unnecessary <e> <s> the jenkins committee made proposals for improving the present rules relating to disclosure of directors interests <e> <s> in our view these recommendations offer a better route to the objective aimed at in the present clause <e> <s> we will consider further precisely how these recommendations might be adapted and adopted in the context of our more general study of the rules relating to transactions between companies and their directors <e> <s> meanwhile i hope the committee will agree that the <e>", "<cs> this amendment was one of a group debated in commons committee and later rejected on a division <e> <s> a requirement in the bill on the lines of the amendment would serve a real legal purpose only if the information to be provided by the minister were to be used at some further stage of the proceedings <e> <s> it is not however envisaged that there will be any further proceedings once the unfunded proportions have been determined <e>"]
