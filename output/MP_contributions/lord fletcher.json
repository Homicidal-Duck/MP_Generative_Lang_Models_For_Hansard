["<cs> my lords will the noble lord say whether the present government are having any discussions and if so what about with the rhodesian patriotic front <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the noble lords original answer will he agree that all the national museums take special care when they send any of their items elsewhere they take special precautions to ensure the safety of those items against loss or damage whether in transit or on arrival <e>", "<cs> my lords did i understand the minister in his original reply to say that because mr adams was a maltese subject her majestys government have no <e>", "<cs> it is most important in the public interest that we should be clear about this matter <e> <s> i am not quite clear <e> <s> it is not easy to follow this series of provisions but i wonder whether the minister can help us in this way <e> <s> in parenthesis may i say that some local authorities have been very defective in preparing quinquennial revisions <e> <s> as i understand it the object of this part of the bill is to ensure that modifications shall be made continuously as and when evidence arises which requires a modification to an existing definitive map which has been published and circulated <e> <s> presumably therefore there will be a whole series of modifications to a particular map before a new map is prepared for the public <e> <s> it will not be altogether easy for members of the public to familiarise themselves with the modifications that have been made <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord can help us on this <e>", "<cs> i am much obliged to the minister <e>", "<cs> some noble lords will agree that when the noble lord described this as a somewhat complicated provision that may have been an understatement <e> <s> i feel the committee will wish to consider very carefully what the minister said and if necessary revert to these matters at a later stage it would be difficult for me and i think for other noble lords to embark on a long discussion with the minister on the statement he has just made but there is one observation i feel i should make <e> <s> as i understand this somewhat complicated clause which provides for a series of modifications to the definitive map to be made from time to time the operative words which cover the duties of local authorities occur in subsection <e>", "<cs> i am very sympathetic to this amendment which i hope will have the support of the minister but i regret to say that it seems to me to fall short of what is desired <e> <s> if your lordships will look at the second line of amendment no <e> <s> it will be seen that if makes provision as the noble viscount lord hanworth has indicated to prohibit a local authority from dealing with evidence which could have been produced but has not been produced <e> <s> but my noble friends amendment appears to me to be limited in the second line to events under paragraph <e>", "<cs> i very much welcome what the noble lord has said <e> <s> it would be a retrograde step if he were to contemplate accepting this amendment <e> <s> it would fly in the face of what has been the established law for a long time <e> <s> if a path is shown on a definitive map it is conclusive evidence against all the world <e> <s> i am very glad that that provision of the law as it now stands is repeated and reinforced in clause of this bill <e> <s> it would make nonsense of that clause if this amendment were to be accepted by the minister <e>", "<cs> may i say a word in support of this amendment which i regard as one of the most important amendments to this part of the bill and may i give a specific example as to why i am certain that this amendment is necessary <e> <s> the minister will observe that there is some underlying contradiction between <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the minister <e> <s> my noble friend lord hanworth made one of a number of serious points to emerge on this subject but in view of the ministers assurance and in anticipation that favourable consideration will be given to the points i made i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i have listened to what the noble lord said but i am afraid that i am not satisfied with it <e> <s> his real argument in opposing this amendment is that it is unnecessary <e> <s> i do not want to debate the necessity for it <e> <s> i want to debate the desirability of this amendment being inserted in the bill whether or not it is strictly necessary <e> <s> i have listened to what the noble viscount opposite said with regard to people getting lost up in scotland something to which this bill does not apply but i wonder whether your lordships are familiar with another problem which has come to my knowledge <e>", "<cs> i appreciate what the noble lord said <e> <s> if in fact it is not a public footpath then of course it is some protection to the landlord <e> <s> but if it is a public footpath and there is an inquiry pending about the rights then it is surely wrong that pending such an inquiry and pending some modification of the definitive map the public should be deterred from using it as a public footpath <e> <s> all i am asking is that the bill should say in writing that the absence of a footpath from the definitive map is not evidence that it is not a public footpath <e>", "<cs> i am much obliged to the noble lord the minister <e> <s> i am perfectly prepared to hear what is said regarding amendments nos <e> <s> and which may conceivably when they are discussed remove the necessity of my amendment although i should have preferred mine to any alternative <e> <s> however in view of the assurance which the minister has given and the fact that we may be able to renew the matter at report i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i cannot pretend to be satisfied with the ministers reply <e> <s> whatever additional trouble it may give to the surveying authority it seems to me to be of paramount importance that the public should not only be able to go to inspect the map which may involve a long journey but should also be able to obtain at cost a copy of the definitive map <e> <s> i think that that is even more important under the new procedure because each definitive map will be subject to whatever orders have been made modifying it <e> <s> in the interests of public knowledge surely it is no hardship to the surveying authority to be required to send at the expense of the member of the public a copy of the definitive map together with such orders modifying the definitive map as have been made <e> <s> i hope i am not anticipating amendment no <e> <s> which applies to modifying orders <e> <s> i hope the minister will look at this in the interests of the public <e> <s> i am supported in what i am saying by some observations that i have recently received from the countryside commission saying that they believe it is essential that the public should be able to purchase copies of the map and the accompanying statement <e> <s> therefore will the minister be good enough to look at this again in the interests of the public <e>", "<cs> i noticed that my noble friend lord melchett did not move his amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> when i was addressing your lordships on amendment no <e> <s> i was under the impression that amendment no <e> <s> would be moved or at any rate debated <e>", "<cs> am i right in thinking that that means that some of these amendments at any rate will require <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that your lordships will not be satisfied with that reply <e> <s> it is not good enough for the minister to say that it is a question of fact <e> <s> he also said that the amendment is not necessary <e> <s> it is not a question of whether it is necessary but a question of whether it is desirable <e> <s> it may or may not be necessary but it is surely in the interests of clarity that the position be made abundantly clear <e> <s> there cannot be any valid objection to the amendment <e> <s> there may be a difference of opinion between legal advisers as to whether it is necessary or not but that does not conclude the matter <e> <s> if an amendment of this nature is put forward in the interests of clarification and if it is argued as my noble friend has argued that it is desirable to have it surely the government should have the courtesy to accept it <e> <s> it cannot do any harm to accept it and i invite your lordships to express the view that the ministers reply is thoroughly disappointing <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord opposite has raised a vital question and i can sympathise with the minister in not being able to give a reply <e> <s> i appreciate that it is not easy to give a reply but he has promised to look into it and to give a reply to his noble friend <e> <s> i think it would be very useful if that reply could be made general perhaps in writing because this is an important point <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend on the front bench said this amendment and this series of amendments raise a very vital question that of justice <e> <s> it is important that justice should not only be done but should be seen to be done <e> <s> the minister posed this question which is quite a fair question are local authorities capable of doing the job fairly and efficiently <e> <s> my answer to that is no <e> <s> some local authorities may be capable of doing it other local authorities are not capable of doing it <e> <s> i do not think that the public and the parties involved in these matters will have confidence in the complete impartiality of some local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has been very helpful and i am sure that he will not be surprised to know that i support the amendment though i do not think it goes quite far enough and i should like to explain to the minister my reservations <e> <s> i do not expect him to give an unqualified reply at the moment but i would ask him to note my reservations and to give some thought to them because i believe that in order to further the concession that he has in mind some additional revision is required <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i made the case for this amendment at the committee stage as the minister will remember and i hoped that as a result of what i and my noble friend had said the minister would see the strength and force of our contentions <e> <s> may i therefore repeat the complaint in a nutshell <e> <s> there are a number of pending objections which have yet to be brought to a final conclusion <e> <s> a number of people have made representations to local authorities and those representations have been passed on to the minister <e> <s> they are at certain stages and it is recognised in the bill that there is power to abandon all those reviews <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to amend section of the copyright act so as to make it an offence to be in possession of an infringing copy in the course of trade <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to intervene only very briefly <e> <s> my excuse for doing so is this i was a trustee of the british museum at the time when the earlier bill was being debated in and <e> <s> therefore i had something to do with that bill in my capacity as a trustee <e> <s> as the noble lord lord windlesham has said that bill did not meet with the approval of the trustees <e> <s> on the other hand this <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that in view of the present conditions on the acropolis in athens these marbles are much safer in london and are being preserved from further deterioration <e> <s> is the noble earl also aware that if we were to part with the elgin marbles it would lead to a great many demands by other countries for the return to those other countries of the invaluable collections in the british museum <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> as your lordships will observe this is a very short and simple bill and i hope one that is entirely uncontroversial <e> <s> the bill seeks to add a few words to section <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the government spokesman for what he has said and happy to think that the house will be able to proceed without a division to a second reading and further consideration of this bill <e> <s> also i am very much in sympathy with the noble lords observations on the general subject of copyright <e> <s> i should be the last to disagree with him in saying that the present law of copyright is in need of a great deal of amendment over and above the proposals in this modest bill <e> <s> but one has found in the legislative process over and over again that very often small though desirable reforms are hindered by the thought that much wider reforms are desirable only to find that those wider programmes never materialise <e> <s> therefore i am encouraged by what the noble lord has said and happy to think that this modest bill is able to go forward for future consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy with that assurance <e> <s> i can assure the noble lord now that i will avail myself of the facilities he has kindly offered <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e> <s> therefore unless any noble lord objects i beg to move that the order of commitment he discharged <e>", "<cs> before the minister replies may i say that i would not have thought it was good enough in this chamber for a minister to say that he would try to satisfy my noble friend by writing to him <e> <s> this is a matter which affects the whole committee and i am sure i am speaking for many of my noble friends when i say that your lordships are entitled to a clear answer from the minister as to what he means by the words in paragraph suggesting that an employee has to prove he has no direct interest in the dispute in question <e> <s> the question for the minister to answer is how does he think an employee can discharge that onus of proof on him <e> <s> regardless of what precedent there may have been the minister must face up to the question and in my opinion endeavour to satisfy this committee as to how the government think any employee in a case such as has been mentioned can possibly satisfy that negative proof about not having a direct interest in the trade dispute <e>", "<cs> writing to whom <e>", "<cs> i am not sure what the effect of the ministers comment is my lords but i am hoping it means he will allow the bill to proceed in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister make it clear one way or the other whether or not universities and colleges can lie in the financial provisions made in the triennial plan <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister give an assurance in case the competition is held here in that the government will take steps between now and and tell us what those steps are to ensure that there is a reduction in the unruly behaviour that now takes place in so many football grounds <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister not aware that this is generally regarded as a flagrant breach by these local authorities of their duties under the act <e> <s> is the minister not aware that the powers open to the secretary of state under section of the act are quite explicit and would enable the minister if so minded to take immediate action without incurring any delay by taking advice <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the minister for that reply <e> <s> in view of the long delay that mr adams has suffered in obtaining justice i think that the house would be grateful if the minister were to continue to press the secretary general of the european commission to ensure that this matter is brought to a satisfactory conclusion before the final date which i understand is th august <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that apart from the general question as to whether the law on charities is ripe for overhaul there is widespread concern that there is such a shortage of staff in the charity commission that they are unable effectively and efficiently to administer the present law on charities <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like very briefly to add a few words and to say how very much i welcome this measure and give it my wholehearted support <e> <s> i was not entirely happy with one phrase that fell from my noble friend lord soper <e> <s> he seemed to think that this was a domestic matter for the church of england <e> <s> i take a different view <e> <s> i am inclined to agree with the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter that this is not entirely a purely domestic matter for the church of england <e> <s> i think it concerns the establishment i think it concerns society and i think it reinforces the cherished position which the church of england enjoys in our national life <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords failing the granting of total exemption from university fees for part-time students does the noble baroness agree that there is at any rate a strong case for granting tax relief on university fees paid by part-time students <e> <s> in this connection will she bear in mind the very considerable contribution to the national economy and welfare that has been made over the years by part-time students <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister acknowledge that it is not good enough to shuffle off the governments responsibility onto either the university grants committee or any other body <e> <s> surely he should realise that it is the responsibility of government to ensure that justice is done to these hard-working part-time students <e> <s> the government can only discharge their obligation by giving them either tax relief or total exemption from university fees <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that a large number of books and rare manuscripts of considerable historical importance are housed in museums and not in university buildings <e> <s> i refer both to national such as the former british museum now the british library and to local museums <e> <s> will the minister ensure that similar financial facilities are available to those which have collections of valuable manuscripts and books <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say what steps are being taken in central london and the central areas of other big cities to improve traffic conditions <e>"]
