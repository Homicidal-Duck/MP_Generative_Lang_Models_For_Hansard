["<cs> my lords when i received a month ago an invitation from the noble lord lord annan to speak in this debate i wrote to the deans of our london medical schools to the deans of our institutes of the british postgraduate federation of the university of london to the presidents of the royal colleges and to several others <e> <s> all of them kindly replied almost at once and at length <e> <s> some were kind enough to invite me to go and speak with them <e> <s> my remarks this evening will he based on some of the points that they have made and i hope that they may be of some little use to the noble lord lord flowers and his working party on medical and dental teaching resources <e> <s> i shall not mention many names either of individual deans or hospitals or of the post-graduate institutes <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that all noble lords will agree with me when i thank the noble lord lord adrian for his splendid maiden speech <e> <s> he is the distinguished physiologist son of a distinguished physiologist father whom many of us knew <e> <s> like his father he has been elected a fellow of the royal society <e> <s> his father was awarded the order of merit and was a nobel prize winner in medicine <e> <s> we hope that our new friend will follow this splendid example and rise to those heights and that he will speak to us often <e> <s> we are proud and privileged to have him with us in our house <e> <s> we thank him once again for his speech <e> <s> it was as it should have been non-controversial <e> <s> when i had been in your lordships house for four months the chief whip came to me and said it is time you made your maiden speech <e> <s> i said what on <e> <s> he said any non-controversial subject <e> <s> i said what do you suggest <e> <s> and he said what about pay beds in national health service hospitals <e> <s> i had difficulty in making that really non-controversial <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord segal for his kind words from the <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to thank the noble baroness lady mcfarlane of llandaff for her splendid maiden speech based on so much personal experience <e>", "<cs> as a practising doctor i have been interested in seat belts for a long time and i must thank the noble lord lord nugent of guildford for the kind words he said about me at the beginning of his speech <e> <s> i have been away for five months with an illness which has prevented my attending your debates but i have had every word of them read out to me and i have been asked to make a short speech on how what has been said already fits in with the amendment we have been discussing today <e> <s> my illness has left me registered as a blind person <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble baroness for her efforts on behalf of the blind <e> <s> i have recently been registered as a blind person and i know how much has already been done to help us <e> <s> before that i was doctor for st dunstans for many years and i was on their governing body for years or more <e> <s> i knew lord fraser very well <e>", "<cs> my lords i just want to add a very few words about punch-drunkenness which is a terrible affliction <e> <s> it can come on many years after a persons boxing career is over it does not need a number of knock-outs a number of small injuries can produce it and it is a terrible affliction to have in your family <e> <s> it is a sort of pre-senile dementia you lose your memory you lose your sense <e> <s> i myself would do anything to prevent even the dozen cases of punch-drunkenness that now occur <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i might just tell a very short story against myself bearing in mind what the noble lord lord wells-pestell and others have said so well about the effect of a severe lack of sleep on almost everything one does <e> <s> some years ago i was a house surgeon in a teaching hospital in london <e> <s> i had been on duty and up for two nights without any sleep at all <e> <s> on the third morning full of coffee i felt full of beans <e> <s> i went down to the surgery where a lady was sitting on a bench with her skirts drawn up her varicose veins very prominent and with her notes on the table <e> <s> i wanted to say are these your notes <e> <s> but what i actually said after this lack of sleep was good morning madam are those your legs <e>", "<cs> my lords this bill is about how data can be collected stored and protected by many people from many different professions and in other parts of our work <e> <s> in my profession the medical profession we have relied on the hippocratic oath for more than two thousand years <e> <s> it has done us extremely well in that anything private between doctor and patient which it is important should remain strictly private cannot be divulged for any reason <e> <s> but modern civilisation has led to a breakdown of this <e> <s> as time is running short i will give just one good example <e> <s> a doctor has a patient who is the driver of a train <e> <s> he suddely discovers that this patient is developing epileptic fits <e> <s> he has for the safety of hundreds of passengers to tell the railway authorities about this <e> <s> that is a strict violation of the hippocratic oath but is essential under modern conditions <e>", "<cs> my lords as a doctor i would feel very strongly indeed about being forced to give <e>"]
