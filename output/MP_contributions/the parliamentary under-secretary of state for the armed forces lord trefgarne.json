consensus necessary to bring the madrid meeting to a close has not yet been achieved <e> <s> we prefer to await formal closure before giving a final assessment <e> <s> but the document agreed between of the participating states would stress the political significance of the helsinki final act add impulse to the csce process and record a number of useful new commitments <e>", "<cs> my lords in rising to reply to this debate i am more than usually aware of my inadequacies in the face of so much experience and expertise <e> <s> i suspect that i am one of the few noble lords on todays speakers list who has never even served in the armed forces let alone risen to the levels of distinction and gallantry of so many of your lordships <e> <s> i was therefore especially pleased that the noble and

approved the speech on the understanding that the position would be reconsidered if the demand for land exceeded the amount available <e>", "<cs> my lords with your lordships permission i will now

like to repeat a statement which has already been made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for trade and industry about the governments policy towards the aerospace

express his own well-known views <e> <s> nothing wrong in that you may say <e> <s> others have also held that view <e> <s> the late lord russell made similar predictions almost years ago and tied them to calls for unilateral disarmament by britain <e> <s> over the years since then to the present day the so called peace movement has waxed and waned but its forecast of impending doom has remained the

the republic are able to do so without excessive difficulty <e> <s> steps are being taken to improve reception in east africa which should also lead to some improvement in south africa <e>", "<cs> my lords since the soviet union has deployed over ss warheads about two-thirds of which are targeted on western europe <e> <s> although many of the older sss and sss previously deployed have been withdrawn the deployment of the ss represents a new order of capability <e> <s> in addition to having three warheads it is more accurate has a longer range and shorter reaction time and is mobile <e>

glc makes a revenue grant determination and approves a capital programme <e> <s> it cannot under the transport act make a revised determination <e> <s> so any surplus or deficit would normally be carried over by london transport and taken into account in the following years grant determination <e> <s> for example in a deficit of million was carried over into <e> <s> the same principles are proposed for lrt in <e> <s> obviously it is impossible to forecast correctly to the nearest pound the grant requirement for a year <e> <s> any surplus would be rolled forward and used to reduce the

being worked out between the treasury the foreign and commonwealth office and the bbc <e>", "<cs> my lords to discuss in advance when trident might or might not be used would be tantamount to suggesting to our adversaries the circumstances in which they could attack us with impunity <e> <s> i hope the noble lord will forgive me if i decline to do that neither our nuclear nor any other weapons will of course ever be used save in response to an attack <e>", "<cs> my lords the allies were clear and unanimous in that the longer-range land-based soviet missiles such as the ss were the
