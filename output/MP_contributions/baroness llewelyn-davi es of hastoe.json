["<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend lord lee of newton i beg to ask her majestys government a question of which he has given private notice <e> <s> the question is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords with the permission of the house may i say that it would be difficult to let this opportunity pass without pointing out that it is up to the government of the day to propose a reasonable programme of legislation and also to register that most parts of the house consider that this government have not done that and that your lordships house has found infinite difficulty in examining the very complex and controversial legislation which is always put before us in a hurry <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord thinks he can substantiate that remark about the programme which this government inherited from us not being able to be implemented may i ask whether he is aware that it was very carefully planned and was by no means extravagant <e> <s> is he not yet aware of the need for the sake of our own industry to create places abroad which can buy from us what we have to sell <e>"]
