["<cs> my lords i rise with great trepidation to follow that speech by the noble lord lord annan on medical education i am not a medical educationalist <e> <s> i have to admit my interest in this debate as the regional chairman of the only london region that has only one teaching hospital in it and therefore no doubt has less problems than some of the others <e> <s> i could have wished that lord annan had phrased his question slightly differently <e> <s> i agree with him per cent <e> <s> that co-operation between the dhss and the university grants committee on medical education is tremendously important but he left out what it is all about and that is the service we jointly give to the patient <e> <s> i wish that would have been in the question though i know it was in the back of his mind <e>"]
