["<cs> my lords after the formidable speech made by the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale <e> <s> there is no need for me to say very much <e> <s> however <e> <s> i should like to say that both he and the noble lord the minister have perhaps underrated the enormous task which will confront those who have the duty to consolidate these measures <e> <s> their very incomprehensibility will add to the burden <e> <s> i welcomed with some surprise i must say the very forthcoming speech made by the noble lord on the front bench <e> <s> there is one phrase in it which perhaps unfairly i should like to single out for notice <e> <s> at one stage the noble lord referred to bills which at first sight are not easy to follow <e> <s> that seemed to me to be such a classic of euphemism that it ought to be picked out and given special mention <e> <s> i very much hope that the noble lord has not too greatly overestimated the ease with which this difficult task will be performed but i hope that it will be performed quickly for the need is great <e>"]
