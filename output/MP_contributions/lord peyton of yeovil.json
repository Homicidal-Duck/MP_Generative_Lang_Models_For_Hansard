["<cs> my lords in asking as i most certainly do for your lordships indulgence this afternoon i cannot avoid recalling a similarly painful occasion over years ago when i made a maiden speech in another place <e> <s> it was a singularly anodyne affair which i can safely say gave no offence to anyone <e> <s> it was lit up for a brief moment with the gratification which i felt at the presence of the prime minister who was still in his place to hear this important utterance <e> <s> the prime minister at the time was the father-in-law of my noble friend lord soames <e> <s> that brief moment of gratification was soon dispelled when he turned glared and concluding that he had seen enough and heard enough departed <e> <s> the only other thing that i recall about that occasion was the speed with which the apprehension and alarm which i felt gave way subsequently to the peacefulness of anti-climax <e> <s> that left me with the conviction that a maiden speech is something one is better without and the sooner you get rid of it the better <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether he would not congratulate the noble lord lord cledwyn on the very deserving effort that he made to turn a mischievous question into a serious one <e>", "<cs> as this is the first committee stage in your lordships house which i have attended i wonder whether i could make just two observations at the conclusion of the debates <e> <s> both relate to the noble lord lord bruce of donington <e> <s> first the noble lord has told us on a number of occasions obviously with great sincerity that he has no desire whatsoever to be offensive to anybody particularly to the government and their friends <e> <s> he then slipped although i am sure he did not intend to do so into being very offensive indeed <e> <s> as a newcomer to your lordships house i take notice of that technique while i shall of course resist the temptation to try to copy so great a master of it as the noble lord i shall nevertheless note it <e>", "<cs> i should like briefly to express my agreement with what the noble lord lord marsh has just said <e> <s> i will not repeat his arguments <e> <s> however i have long been a supporter of what i am afraid is a lost cause in our times that of keeping acts of parliament to a minimum length and not seeking every opportunity unnecessarily to lengthen them <e> <s> as the noble lord lord marsh has pointed out with great eloquence to insert this amendment which was moved with customary eloquence by the noble lord lord mishcon would seem to add nothing to the bill <e> <s> therefore i hope that the noble lord the minister will check his own characteristic amiability and not accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> i would add only a word of great regret that the conversion of the noble lord lord molloy to the cause of brevity in acts of parliament should be so shortlived <e>", "<cs> i cannot conceive that when my right honourable and learned friend composes this body he will be so foolish as to set out to collect hermits and trappist monks who are the only people who in this context might perhaps be regarded as non-consumers <e> <s> there are numerous bodies in this country which set out to represent quite stridently at times the interests of those whom they identify as consumers <e>", "<cs> may i shortly observe that in these days there is no guarantee of an authority behaving in a helpful manner <e> <s> i had no intention of intervening until the last few sentences uttered by my noble friend the minister <e> <s> i hope he will consider this again carefully because there is something objectionable about the terms of a licence or a contract being altered unilaterally after they have once been settled without any warning at all <e> <s> unless i misunderstood my noble friend i conclude that he is assuming that the authority being given the general duties that it is being given will perform those duties in a helpful manner <e> <s> i believe that such an assumption is optimistic in the light of general experience today <e> <s> i therefore hope that my noble friend will again consider this point to see whether some sort of provision should not be made that additional restrictions should not be inserted into the licence unless at the time of the granting of the licence some kind of warning was given that they may be so introduced <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for his sympathetic reception up to a point of the arguments which have been put but i hope he will go a little further and look at this matter again <e> <s> when he suggested and this particularly worried me that the authority will be under a duty to submit a report and that this report will be subject to the scrutiny of the minister and could even be debated in both houses of parliament i am bound to say that my confidence was not restored enormously <e> <s> such documents are not best-sellers by any means <e> <s> i have been in another place for quite a long time and that kind of report is not debated at length by parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may remind your lordships house of the fact that some years ago my noble friend lord renton chaired a committee which looked into the murky subject of the quality of our statute law <e> <s> the hostile verdict which that committee with justification felt obliged to deliver on that occasion was endorsed by a very slender audience in another place <e> <s> that endorsement was accompanied by expressions of every kind of regret and determination to do better <e> <s> it came as no surprise i think to anyone present that such expressions of determination and good resolutions were soon jettisoned <e>", "<cs> i should like to acknowledge what the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe was kind enough to say about me just now <e> <s> let me also very briefly express my agreement with my noble friend lord thorneycroft and at the same time my perhaps naive surprise that the noble lord lord bruce of donington did not see fit to remind his noble friend that he had only recently made the voyage as i have myself from down the corridor <e> <s> what the noble lord lord stoddart said was if i may respectfully say so vintage house of commons stuff in a not very good year <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may venture to say this <e> <s> i was sorry to hear the noble lord lord ardwick passing such adverse comments on the present service offered by directory inquiries <e> <s> my recent experience has been that it has improved enormously indeed out of all recognition from the very moderate standards of only a few years ago <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i could venture a comment here <e> <s> while i understand very well what the noble lord lord spens has just said i wonder whether and this also applies to my noble friend lord mottistone he is falling into the habit which has afflicted a number of speakers in the debates on this bill of saying something twice and believing that as a result of repetition he makes it stronger <e>", "<cs> i rise briefly to express i am sure on behalf of all noble lords on this side of the committee our very great gratification that the noble lord lord lloyd should number himself among the warmer admirers of the prime minister <e> <s> while we would not challenge his wisdom in espousing and giving voice to her views nevertheless i wonder whether the prime minister herself would advocate the inclusion of hunks of speeches in statutes <e> <s> merely because she has happened from time to time to bless the word innovation does not seem to me to be an <e>", "<cs> i should like to make two short points <e> <s> the first relates to the language used by the noble lord lord bruce of donington <e> <s> i have only just arrived in this place <e> <s> one of the most acceptable and notable changes that one observes here is that noble lords do not make a habit of imputing either silly or malicious motives to others <e> <s> when the noble lord stands up and says that we on this side of the committee conduct ourselves as though the ordinary worker is of no account he descends i believe to something very near idiocy <e> <s> i want to be very careful because i realise that the noble lord lord bruce of donington has a right which is not apparently shared by others to use violent language <e> <s> i do not want to trespass on his preserve <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord stoddart has eloquently reminded me of what i said on this subject at an earlier stage of the bill <e> <s> i am bound to say that i had no idea that i had delivered myself of so cogent and eloquent an argument at least <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord orr-ewing is very knowledgeable in this complex field but at the same time i have to say with deep regret that he lost me fairly early on in his argument <e> <s> but in so far as i may have guessed aright and he is troubled about the confusion of government departments and their activities in this field then i very much hope that my noble friends on the front bench will agree to take a serious look at that because that is one of the problems which habitually plague our affairs <e> <s> beyond that i should like to say that i wish so much and of course that is why i am on my feet to enjoy the good opinion of my noble friends on the front bench <e> <s> therefore i would say to them that i very much hope they will reject amendment no <e> <s> because try as i may i cannot attribute to it any meaning whatsoever <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to address your lordships house at this hour of night but the word eyewash brought me to my feet coming as it does from the noble lord lord bruce of donington <e> <s> i know of no-one who is a greater specialist in the art <e>", "<cs> my lords i had rather hoped that my noble and learned friend the lord advocate would leap to his feet after the noble lord lord morris had concluded his remarks and say that at least in principle he would accept this amendment <e> <s> perhaps i can suggest to him a plea that he will now apply to the amendment of the noble lord lord morris the same somewhat relaxed standards which he applied to those amendments he moved earlier today <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble and learned friend sits down and i am sorry to get in between him and a more or less final resting place would he bear in mind that the swiftness to which he has been referring is not generally recognised to be a prime characteristic either of government departments or the creatures set up under statute <e> <s> there are delays and would it not be as well for my noble and learned friend now to admit that there is at least a possibility that something might go wrong that somebody might suffer damage and that an opportunity ought to be afforded under the bill for him to recover damage should it occur <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise that this is a day dedicated to the exhibition of the talent which exists on the front benches of your lordships house <e> <s> i hope that it will not be regarded as grossly indelicate if therefore i intervene very shortly on this particular amendment <e> <s> it is to say this <e> <s> i can conceive of no possible element of helpfulness which would be <e>", "<cs> my lords what strange debates we are having this afternoon <e> <s> we have just had <e>", "<cs> my lords after the formidable speech made by the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale <e> <s> there is no need for me to say very much <e> <s> however <e> <s> i should like to say that both he and the noble lord the minister have perhaps underrated the enormous task which will confront those who have the duty to consolidate these measures <e> <s> their very incomprehensibility will add to the burden <e> <s> i welcomed with some surprise i must say the very forthcoming speech made by the noble lord on the front bench <e> <s> there is one phrase in it which perhaps unfairly i should like to single out for notice <e> <s> at one stage the noble lord referred to bills which at first sight are not easy to follow <e> <s> that seemed to me to be such a classic of euphemism that it ought to be picked out and given special mention <e> <s> i very much hope that the noble lord has not too greatly overestimated the ease with which this difficult task will be performed but i hope that it will be performed quickly for the need is great <e>", "<cs> may i without troubling the committee too much briefly intervene <e> <s> my excuse for doing so is that i was once involved in transport <e> <s> this was before the days when ministers of transport achieved the dignity of being known as secretaries of state <e> <s> at one time i found myself cluttered up with the title minister for transport industries a title which ranks for cacophony at least high in the list of whitehalls crimes <e>", "<cs> i should like to express some sympathy with the view just expressed by my noble friend lord mottistone <e> <s> i welcome the remarks made by the noble lord lord ennals from the front bench opposite <e> <s> this is certainly not a party matter <e> <s> nor i think should it develop into a competition in sympathy for the disabled <e> <s> that should be taken for granted <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that my noble friend will forgive me if briefly i make one or two comments on the reply that he has just given <e> <s> the government have persuaded themselves and many of their supporters including me that because some local authorities persistently break the rules they must resort to some extraordinary measures <e> <s> i accept that <e> <s> but i also find it very difficult to disagree with the arguments of the noble lord lord northfield that this is emergency legislation in some shape or form <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether my noble friend has taken the opinion of the airlines as to whether or not british airlines as a result will enjoy an advantage comparable with that gained by klm <e> <s> i believe very much the contrary <e>", "<cs> my lords i should first like to thank those of your lordships who have taken part in this debate for the interesting and eloquent speeches which have been made <e> <s> there have been three main veins running through the debate <e> <s> first there has been an understanding and characteristic generosity by your lordships house concerning the governments inability to say very much on a wide range of topics now being covered by reviews inquiries and the rest <e> <s> at the same time there has been an expression of hope <e> <s> my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter was characteristically generous enough to express confidence that ministers would actually read mark learn and inwardly digest what has been said in your lordships house <e> <s> though i would be the first to thank my noble friend on the front bench for his very comprehensive speech i should at the same time like to express the hope that he will advise his right honourable friend the secretary of state and the parliamentary secretary to read some of the things that have been said today and even to attend to them <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend bear in mind that as is not unusual there are various versions or one version really of the civil aviation authoritys report on the future of british airways <e> <s> will my noble friend be good enough to inform his right honourable friend the secretary of state for transport that there would be considerable anxiety if the government were to take action which would have the effect of inflicting lasting damage on the competitive capacity of british airways and would also cause to that airline a considerable burden of redundancy <e> <s> may i echo the plea of the noble baroness that before any decisions are taken there should be a debate in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords did my noble friend note the way in which the noble lord lord carmichael in asking his supplementary question in no way echoed and by implication dissociated himself from the innuendoes cavilled by the noble lord lord hatch of lusby <e>", "<cs> my lords while i would not ask my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords while it is certainly not my intention to invite my noble friend to take another deep dive into the detail of this matter i should like to ask him whether he was particularly struck by the old world detachment from reality shown by the noble lord lord underhill in his long catechism of questions the underlying gist of which that all is at present well with the bus industry is something which is far from the case <e>", "<cs> my lords there are three points which i should very much like to make as the member who had the rather difficult job of presiding over this small committee <e> <s> first i should like to make it clear that the committee were not invited to consider nor did they apply themselves to the question of what allowances should be paid to members of your lordships house <e> <s> they were appointed to consider the allowances which should properly be paid to members of parliament <e> <s> they found the task exceedingly difficult and complicated to fit every kind of constituency every kind of member old and young regardless of their physical strength and <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to start by echoing the thanks tendered to my noble friend lord kinnoull for having initiated this debate <e> <s> i hope that he will not think me ungenerous in saying that i rather admired his olympian detachment <e> <s> i found it a little difficult to share with him the description of the atmosphere at westminster at this time as being one of pent-up excitement <e> <s> i should myself tend to describe it in other words <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate what my noble friend says <e> <s> but even then i think that the pent-up excitement is at least tinged with something else <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend if he would not agree that to call for public political initiatives is quite easy to define them is rather harder <e> <s> i should like to ask if he would not agree that initiatives that consist of compromising the position on the closure of pits that have become uneconomic and initiatives that give some kind of covert approval to violence of an intolerable kind would not be very valuable or useful contributions in the long run <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend agree that those responsible for the particularly intrusive medium of television frequently give the impression that they are more concerned to excite and to entertain than they are to show regard for the individual no matter how painful the circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend agree that these cracks about <e>", "<cs> my lords would not my noble friend agree that the questions of the noble lord opposite are a marvellous example of the way in which hope continues to triumph over experience in that he evidently believes that some special wisdom might emanate from a specialist committee while all experience teaches that such bodies only confuse counsel <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether my noble friend is aware how much his patience is admired even if some may feel that it is not well directed <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord ardwick was it seemed to me a little peremptory in his dismissal of the arguments contained in the amendment which the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend the leader of the house if he would accept our congratulations on a miracle of understatement when he used the words little bit tedious in relation to the noble lord lord hatch of lusby <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say whether he shares the high hopes entertained by the noble baroness for a meeting of europes consumer ministers <e> <s> further if such a meeting does take place will my noble friend do his utmost to ensure that the consequences are not limited to another cascade of paper competing for valuable space in wastepaper baskets <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like first of all to express my sympathy with the noble earl lord halsbury for the great inconvenience he has suffered and to say how sorry i am that those directing this unit lacked the kind of second sight to realise quite the outrage they were perpetrating <e> <s> i am extremely sorry to find myself at some difference with the noble lord <e> <s> lord boyd-carpenter <e>", "<cs> my lords in regard to the mail to from and within london will my noble friend and his colleagues adopt a process somewhat more robust and adequate than mere monitoring <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether i am not right in thinking that the whole purpose of publishing a green paper is to afford the opportunity for consultation and that to make a prophecy at this stage as to what it contains is probably more idle and more useless than many of the forecasts to which we are accustomed to listening some of them in this chamber <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may first join your lordships in offering very sincere congratulations to my noble friend lord zouche of haryngworth on a very distinguished and able maiden speech <e> <s> i am sure that all of your lordships will look forward to hearing him again regularly and even during the committee stage of this bill though i am bound to say that my own enjoyment of speeches during committee stages is severely limited <e> <s> nevertheless i say to my noble friend how much we all enjoyed his speech on this occasion and how much we look forward to hearing him again <e>", "<cs> my lords is it too much to hope that those with real anxieties about the possible effects of this bill may recall that many parts of the country do not have buses at all that in others services are scarce and unreliable and that in most they are too costly both for passenger and for taxpayer <e> <s> is it too much to hope that they will also reflect upon the fact that no responsible government can continue for ever to stand aside from problems just because they are <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i should have used the word incomprehensible <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble lord for his kindly correction i take it that it was meant in a kindly fashion and i am grateful to him <e> <s> the noble lord tempts me to prolong my answer <e> <s> i was saying that the right reverend prelate gave me the impression that anything he does not find comfortable acceptable and comprehensible he tends to reject <e> <s> that is an attitude which i do not share <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether he agrees that it would be quite wrong if no one on this side of the house seized the rare opportunity that arises from time to time of agreeing with the noble lord lord hatch of lusby <e> <s> it is very rare indeed <e> <s> i should like to ask my noble friend whether he agrees that the decline in the merchant navy has extended over many more years than was indicated by the noble lord who last asked a question from the other side of the house <e> <s> this is a really serious matter which has been neglected for far too long by successive governments <e> <s> neither the shipowners nor the unions involved can escape heavy responsibility <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend take note that on this issue it is possible for those of us on this side of the house to return to that state of disagreement with the noble lord opposite which is both normal and appropriate <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may very shortly congratulate my noble friend lord teviot on actually making mention of the general public and the fare-paying passenger <e> <s> as i have listened to these debates it has seemed to me that so far they have been mostly concerned with authorities owners and managers and that squeezed out of mention and out of all thought and reflection are the general public and the fare-paying passenger who very often lacks the opportunity to enjoy the status of a fare-paying passenger because the service is not there <e>", "<cs> i was not at all sure why the noble lord lord tordoff saw fit to refer to me <e> <s> it did not seem to have any particular bearing on the amendment which we are discussing <e> <s> the noble lord has said if i may say so quite a few things and i intend to say one now <e> <s> it is simply this <e> <s> i could not help noticing in passing this addiction of the modern liberal spokesman so rapidly developing for the big operator the big man <e> <s> they feel happier with the big person than with the small one <e> <s> if the noble lords speech meant anything he was saying how much easier it was to get along with and to inspect the operations of large concerns <e>", "<cs> i wish i thought the same <e>", "<cs> i put down this amendment simply as a means of indicating concern that those applying for an operators licence should be called on to prove that they have the necessary financial resources <e> <s> i am not in any way wedded to the wording of the amendment or to its general sense <e> <s> what i am really asking is for my noble friend on the front bench to take this matter away and produce an amendment which covers the points we have in mind <e>", "<cs> there is probably not much that ought to be said after those remarks from the noble and learned lord but i should like to take the opportunity to remind your lordships of the renton report of some years ago which castigated those who were responsible for incomprehensible law <e> <s> since that time the legislative habits of ministers and others have not changed much and as the noble and learned lord lord denning has said and it does not need me to repeat his words this clause is a masterpiece of obscurity <e>", "<cs> i for one hope that my noble friend will resist the amendment <e> <s> my noble friend lord de la warr in moving it conjured up a picture of an onrush of newcomers in their ancient buses <e> <s> he suggested that public safety would be endangered as a result <e> <s> i yield to no one in my desire to see the bus service of the country made safe <e> <s> i cannot think that it will be made any safer by repeating provisions in the bill which are already there <e>", "<cs> would my noble friend allow me to intervene <e>", "<cs> i lay no claim to any specialised knowledge of the pensions industry <e> <s> i concede of course to my noble friend lord gridley who moved the amendment and to the noble lord lord barnett opposite that they have such a specialised knowledge <e> <s> therefore most of my remarks will be in the interrogative seeking from my noble friend on the front bench an understanding of the position <e> <s> there can be no challenge anywhere in your lordships chamber of the need to show care to safeguard the accrued rights of pensioners <e> <s> like others of your lordships i have received many letters on this subject <e> <s> an official of the transport and general workers union kindly came to see me the other day to express the anxieties of his members and i told him that i was very ready to consider those and to repeat them here <e>", "<cs> i am so sorry but i am entitled to my opinion <e> <s> i do not interrupt other noble lords <e> <s> we have had a very great number of amendments which seem to me to be designed to undermine the working of the bill <e> <s> if all of your lordships do not agree that is my misfortune but it is my view <e> <s> what i fear is that this very sensitive aspect of the bill might well be used by others not in your lordships house in an irresponsible manner and that the very delicate subject of pensions will be treated as yet one weapon in the arsenal of those who wish to destroy this bill <e>", "<cs> i was very careful to say in the course of my remarks that nothing of what has been said in your lordships committee this afternoon was anything other than completely responsible <e> <s> i am sorry if the noble lord lord shepherd misunderstood me but he certainly did <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to detain your lordships for too long but the whole point of what i had to say was to refer to amendments which were in my view designed to undermine the bill <e> <s> i was not referring to the one which your lordships are at present discussing and which was moved very responsibly by my noble friend lord gridley and supported by the noble lord lord barnett <e>", "<cs> my lords i suspect that if i were to say anything at great length i would only be in danger of alienating support for the amendment which stands in my name <e> <s> i thank those noble lords who have been good enough to support it in their speeches and i formally beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether he would agree that it would be something of a pity if as a result of some of our more ridiculous laws people were encouraged to go elsewhere to pursue perfectly legitimate occupations <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether she would agree that this controversy which to some of us has seemed a bit unrealistic from the beginning has now lost something of its original freshness and that perhaps the noble lord lord hatch of lusby would be well advised to seek other material with which to interest your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mcintosh is indeed a kindly man <e> <s> he invited your lordships to accompany him back to a summers evening in july <e> <s> tempting as it would be to be three months or so younger than one is i am bound to say that to go back to the committee stage of this bill is to me an unwelcome prospect and even the company of the noble lord lord mcintosh does not tempt me to change my mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i am unusually indebted to my noble friend who on this occasion has refreshed my memory most usefully <e> <s> i must say to my noble friend lord teviot that during the long protracted passage of this bill he seems to me to have danced continually to the shepherds piping and i am sorry that the noble lord is not in his place to hear me say that <e> <s> my noble friend lord teviot seems to me to have achieved a good deal more footage in <e>", "<cs> my lords before we part with this amendment i should like to make a few observations <e> <s> i do so as one who had the privilege to be minister of transport at the time when approval for the tyne and wear scheme was first given <e> <s> there are few things on which i look back with greater pleasure than having had some part in launching that scheme for it replaced a really horrible sore in that part of the world <e> <s> environmentally it was vile and the fact that it so long survived was a lingering disgrace for all of us <e> <s> happily the whole broken-down filthy dirty railway line was replaced by a very attractive modern service and one in which the users and the operators visibly take great pride today <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way for a moment <e> <s> i should like to say that i have visited the area since then and enjoyed the benefit of a free ticket <e> <s> sadly it lasted for only one day <e>", "<cs> my lords even at this hour i cannot disguise my eagerness to support the amendment so cogently moved by my noble and learned friend if i may so term him lord simon of glaisdale <e> <s> i have long believed that intelligence sensitivity wisdom and all kinds of other virtues reside on the government front bench <e> <s> i had hoped that some sense of shyness or shame some doubt might have been sown in those regions by what was said about this subsection during the committee stage <e> <s> but this horrible creature is still on the pages of the bill and there is no amendment down in the names of ministers to erase the nasty little thing <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord tordoff is an expert in wrecking amendments and i do not wish to compete with him in that <e> <s> i am merely trying to delete from an otherwise useful measure a really horrible sore thumb which i rely upon my noble and learned friend lord simon of glaisdale to say is not only ugly but unnecessary <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join with my noble friend lord beloff in expressing the hope that the government will resist this amendment not that i think that there is any grave danger of their accepting it <e> <s> consultation is a process which we tend to take for granted as being a good thing without questioning either its quality or its quantity <e> <s> it is at least possible that consultation can be a vehicle for very bad advice and can take up a great deal of the time of those who would be better employed trying to run an efficient service <e> <s> i have sat on too many committees on bills in another place where i have listened to discussions on amendment after amendment such as this one seeking the inclusion of all kinds of bodies which ought to be consulted <e> <s> in the end the whole process of management and of government can be infinitely clogged up <e> <s> i hope that the government will have no hesitation in refusing the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that that part of his answer in which he stated that it is the practice of his colleagues to review the effectiveness of their policies is wholly to be welcomed <e> <s> but would it not be slightly difficult to avoid reaching the conclusion that many of our organisations and procedures are so complex and slow-moving as to be wholly ineffective <e> <s> while he is pondering on those issues i wonder whether he will go on to reflect that in a world where neither greed nor folly have entirely disappeared it is possible that self-regulation would prove wholly inadequate to protect the less well-informed against the very clever <e>", "<cs> my lords while i accept what my noble friend says about the systems being different may i ask whether he will encourage his colleagues to look very carefully to see from which system the arts might get the most benefit <e>", "<cs> my lords while i accept that my noble friend has some ground for satisfaction on the progress that has been made will he before he disappears under a wave of pleasure for what has been done please apply his mind to the immense delays which are involved in our horrible costive and congested statutory procedures <e> <s> far from just ensuring fairness to everyone too often they afford an opportunity for tedious and tiresome objectors simply to make use of procedures from which it is hard to see any benefit flowing <e>", "<cs> my lords whatever doubts there may be about the contents of the woolsack and their condition is it not absolutely clear that there can be no doubt whatsoever as to the qualities of its present occupant <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the governments decision but i should like to ask my noble friend whether he agrees that any charge of undue haste or lack of consultation is really stretching language beyond what is permissible for discussion consultation and argument have been going on for a very long time indeed <e> <s> indeed i hope my noble friend will recall that we have travelled thus far and even farther before and still the thing has been frustrated <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend not agree that those who originate such suggestions without revealing their sources must expect thereafter to have very little weight attached to anything that they say and that those who circulate such suggestions do themselves very little credit indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind the fact that millbank is not a thoroughfare of unlimited capacity does my noble friend not agree that it seems odd to the point of eccentricity to restrict the use of it in favour of a very limited number of bus routes <e> <s> does my noble friend appreciate that as often as not the space that is now ruled off whether legally or otherwise is completely empty while the rest is congested <e> <s> it seems daft <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not rather appropriate that that question should have come from the noble lord opposite who after all is no amateur when it comes to disinformation <e>", "<cs> my lords i should first like to echo with a loud hear hear <e> <s> every word that the noble lord lord houghton has just spoken <e> <s> then i should like to go on to add my congratulations to those that have already been expressed to the noble lord lord kirkwood on his admirable maiden speech <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend to take care that this excellent idea is not buried under the tombstone of cumbersome procedures and tiresome restrictions <e>", "<cs> my lords going back to my noble friends original answer will he remind himself that for many years government departments have been watching things without that

friend the leader of the house since he is in his place whether he would be kind enough on some future occasion to give your lordships house some guidance as to business questions and in particular with regard to the kind of question which has just been raised by the noble lord lord hatch of lusby at very great length and whether this kind of practice is to become a general precedent <e> <s> to put it mildly what the noble lord has said is not commanding a vibrant interest on the part of the whole of your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords in echoing the congratulations which have already been proffered to my noble friends lord beaverbrook and lord brocket i should not wish to be limited in any way by the conventional requirements of courtesy <e> <s> i should like to say to both of them how much like others in your lordships house i enjoyed those two speeches and how much i hope we shall hear from them both again frequently <e> <s> my noble friend lord beaverbrook outlined his requirements for an act of parliament that it should be viable enforceable and intelligible <e> <s> indeed he has set himself a very high target <e> <s> i shall immensely enjoy his efforts to clean up the statute book though i hope he has realised what an arduous task he will be undertaking in making that messy volume intelligible <e>", "<cs> i should like to say that like the noble lord lord grimond i am a somewhat defunct lawyer <e> <s> what worries me about this debate is that one speaker after another is able to point out with great lucidity the difficulties and objections which may arise from a clause such as this and yet i have not heard any of those who oppose this clause produce some more effective way in which those minor acts of bullying can be brought within the compass of the criminal law <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that this whole question is surrounded with an aura of uncertainty that as a nation we tend characteristically to try to ignore it and hope that it will go away and that this is not a very sensible or lasting attitude <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while i have a measure of gratitude to my noble friend for that rather cautious answer may i remind him that over bills will have received the royal assent by the end of the session and over statutory instruments most of these emanating from government sources <e> <s> may i ask him two particular questions neither of which relates to the purpose and need for legislation but simply to the intelligibility clarity and bulk <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble viscount be good enough to reflect further upon what has been said here in your lordships house today and particularly to have in his mind the fact that the government for good or ill are the major source of legislation <e> <s> i am not seeking for one moment to blame parliamentary draftsmen <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that your lordships house will be grateful to the noble lord lord harris of high cross for raising the matter earlier this afternoon <e> <s> he dealt clearly and at some length with the facts so that it is not necessary for me to take up more than a very limited amount of your lordships time <e> <s> i myself do not propose to delve into the matter of how the question was handled by the european court

minister not be a little more candid with the house <e> <s> will the minister urge his colleagues to take really serious note of what he himself has described as the timely warning which the government have received <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that in this particular instance the judgment of the noble lord in putting down his question has been rather less sound than usual <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether he is aware that when he uses the word exemplary and applies it to the language contained in parliamentary bills he is earning for his own good nature and charity more respect than for this judgment <e> <s> when he finds the time i wonder whether he will inform the house about the awards which have been given to certain government departments for their use of plain english <e> <s> one wonders what canons of judgment were employed and who were the judges <e> <s> in fact curiosity becomes quite overwhelming <e>", "<cs> i have managed to keep my enthusiasm for modern legislation under fairly strict control and that applies to the attitude with which i face this bill <e> <s> it is so easy to suggest that protection of the consumer must be a good thing and anything which can possibly be claimed to further the protection of the consumer is passed almost without question <e>", "<cs> i too should like to support the amendment <e> <s> i want to start by saying that i have never lacked admiration for my noble friend lord bruce-gardyne for his daring and courage but i never knew until this evening that he took those admirable qualities to the length of stealing the launching of someone elses fox which is a most peculiar thing to do <e> <s> obviously in achieving such a feat he has won for himself a place in history <e>", "<cs> the fact that the noble and learned lord lord denning should have changed his position in this matter as he has just said is a development which could hardly be more welcome to those who like myself see in the amendment a very great source of danger not only to british industry but also to the consumer <e> <s> i apologise to the committee if i repeat some comments which i made yesterday but when this high-sounding cause of protecting the consumer from all and every possible danger is pursued too far then there is at least the possibility that the consumer himself will suffer a in having to pay a higher cost than would otherwise be the case and b from the possibility that he may not have made available to him the goods or commodities which he seeks <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords has my noble friends attention been drawn to a sentence in the national audit commissions report which states that large parts of

further ask my noble friend whether he will take action <e>", "<cs> i am copying other examples my lords <e> <s> will my noble friend take action to curtail the number of councillors who in the name of democracy harass their officials and usurp their functions <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend finally whether he will do his utmost to ensure that the audit commission really has powers

was he who was very substantially responsible for the ditching of the whole project on a previous occasion in <e> <s> if i do the noble lord any injustice i shall immediately give way <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the noble lord but i must tell him that what he has said does not entirely rule from my mind the belief that he was at least largely responsible for ditching the previous project <e> <s> that is something which i have always regretted even though it has never done anything to undermine my respect and regard for the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i rise to my feet only in order to express briefly my gratification that a reputation for impatience which i have done absolutely nothing to earn should have restrained the noble lord lord mulley from speaking at great length on an amendment which i must say i cannot see the need for <e>", "<cs> while i understand the purpose that the noble lord lord walston has in mind in moving the amendment i have the greatest misgivings about including the second paragraph which is extremely negative and could well add to the general depression of standards all round whereas i should hope that the standard of facilities afforded for the tunnel will prove so good as to be a measure to be aimed at elsewhere <e> <s> i should not like to see any limitation put upon the facilities offered for the tunnel leading to a standard that is admittedly unsatisfactory elsewhere <e> <s> the request made by the select committee for the facilities best practicable within the resources available in preferable <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will not accept the second paragraph of the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend say what consideration the government have given to the effect of this measure on industrial costs <e> <s> secondly if the position of the government is that the electricity supply industry as at present organised is not as efficient as they would wish is it not an odd way of going about matters to increase prices now instead of putting pressure on the industry to increase efficiency without giving it such a cushion <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend bear in mind that he has a great deal of sympathy when he is called upon to answer long hypothetical questions of this kind particularly when the supplementaries are salted by the noble lord lord bruce of donington with his dislike of the prime minister which i am sure she would not bother to reciprocate <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend were to refrain altogether from responding to supplementaries which contain no element of the interrogatory he would enjoy a great deal of sympathy and even some applause <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend when we can expect a white paper on the subject because an increasing number of people are mildly interested in knowing the shape of the governments proposals and there is some mounting anxiety that those proposals might give rise to a forest of regulations which would be very difficult to understand or comply with <e>", "<cs> my lords whatever steps my noble friend may feel it is necessary to take in this matter will he take great care to ensure that they do not result in making dull books into best sellers <e>", "<cs> i agree with my noble friend <e> <s> no one would doubt or challenge the intentions of the noble lord lord graham of edmonton but

proposals when they come will be measured against their likely effect upon security of supply safety and prices <e> <s> does he not agree that in this instance competition may be even more difficult to attain than in the case of telephones and gas <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend be good enough to convey to his right honourable friend that there are considerable fears that there may be hazards in meddling with the present integrated system which has worked well and at times under great pressure particularly when the benefits from doing so are not all that obvious <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask several questions of my noble friend <e> <s> he referred first to the governments belief that the industry will achieve more on this new basis <e> <s> will he be good enough to

said by noble lords speaking in favour of this amendment <e> <s> my noble friend lord colnbrook has moved an amendment which is simple clear and easily understood <e> <s> i readily appreciate why this

other would be a singularly poor contribution on the part of this country to a very important project <e> <s> does my noble friend further agree that there is a great burden of responsibility upon the government to see that this does not happen <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that his rejection of the torrent of adjectives thrown at him by the noble lord opposite seems to some of us eminently reasonable <e>", "<cs> my lords does not my noble friend agree that the question tabled by the noble lord lord molloy is on a level with the foolish rebuke which was once administered by balaam to his very sensible ass <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend tell the house when the government expect to publish this huge complex of regulations from which so much is expected and on

arguments the noble lord lord williams has been unable despite all that is going for him to enlist my sympathy <e>", "<cs> i know that some of my noble friends have misgivings and distaste about giving ministers the power to change primary legislation by regulation <e> <s> in this instance i am not quite clear about the effect of this new clause <e> <s> am i right in thinking that the operation of subsection is governed entirely by subsection and that the freedom given to the secretary of state to add to amend or repeal provisions is not so wide as it appears if taken on its own

interest in the affairs of a company and how it is managed <e> <s> i believe that that applies with particular force to institutional shareholders who far too often are absent and detached and who take an excessively short-term interest <e> <s> they ought to take a longer-term view <e> <s> however i doubt very much whether the proposal put forward by the noble lord will achieve that end <e>",

noble friend <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord lord williams of elvel who has understood what i was trying to say <e> <s> i said that while i did not preclude the possibility of governments

that the appointee would have that experience in the supply industry or it might be that he would not <e> <s> i have to tell my noble friend that with that comment she made it much more difficult for

worry me that the only right should be representation <e> <s> committees may have a formal right of appeal anything they like anything ministers like <e> <s> in replying to the debate my noble friend said that under the present arrangement the potential for disputes has been greatly reduced if not removed altogether or words to that effect <e> <s> that phrase conveys a utopian sense and i very much doubt whether it will be brought into existence by any legislation that any of us will ever see <e>", "<cs> i am not asking my noble friend for anything now <e> <s> i am simply asking him to give further thought to the arguments which have been adduced on all sides of the chamber tonight in order to enshrine in the bill recognition of the fact that the committees which the bill is setting up will have a formal right to go to the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> i welcome what my noble friend has said <e> <s> on that basis i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the government accept in clause b the need to promote efficiency and economy in the industry <e> <s> i cannot see immediately any reason why they should resist elevating that purpose to its proper place as proposed in the amendment <e> <s> i very much hope that my noble friend will agree to do so without hesitation <e>", "<cs> i do not want to irritate my noble friend more than i can avoid but perhaps she will briefly answer the two questions that i asked her <e> <s> first have the government formed any estimate of the potential that could be achieved if energy were used more efficiently <e> <s> secondly as regards energy demand do the government believe that energy demands always and relentlessly follows economic growth <e>", "<cs> indeed i mentioned the series of amendments <e>", "<cs> my noble friend seems to have missed at least part of the point that i was seeking to make i am sure that it is my fault <e> <s> i have no strong views as to which duties should be placed on the secretary of state and which on the director general <e> <s> i am merely suggesting that the director general has a herculean task confronting him <e> <s> i do not believe that it will be made easier for him by the fact that a large number of the duties particularly those laid down in this clause are to be shared with the secretary of state <e> <s> i believe it is quite sufficient for the director general to be answerable to the secretary of state who appoints him <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord taylor for his accurate paraphrasing of my position <e> <s> i am most disappointed by this attitude which always persists <e> <s> it costs nothing for the government to say that they will have another look at something to see whether they have it wrong or whether there is something in the views which have been expressed <e> <s> in the circumstances i should like to take the opinion of the committee <e>", "<cs> if i may make this rejoinder if this modest amendment is really such as to drive a coach and horses through the whole fabric of the governments proposals they must be even more flimsy than i suspected <e> <s> it is not my intention to be churlish <e> <s> my noble friend has gone a very small step of the way but i hope that if i withdraw the amendment she will understand that there are considerable anxieties about the bill and they are not laid to rest by the reiterated statement from the front bench we are right and you are wrong <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to register my support for my noble friends amendment <e> <s> we have it on the highest authority from within the government that the environment is regarded as <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may help the committee <e> <s> i failed to refer to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s>

somehow or another i missed the important announcement of who is to be the director general of electricity supply <e> <s> my only excuse is that i was out of the country at the time <e> <s> i had confidently expected that when the government were able to identify a person of such tremendous stature and heroic character he or she would be welcomed with a blaze of publicity <e> <s> i regard it as somewhat unfortunate that that noble person was not greeted with the enthusiasm and wonder as i do not doubt his character deserves <e>", "<cs> it would be churlish in the extreme if i did not say to my noble friend that i greatly appreciate her courtesy in undertaking albeit without commitment to look at the point raised which has had some support from both sides of the committee <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i can only apologise to my noble friend for my ignorance in that it had escaped <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mulley may express the matter as he wishes <e> <s> i was about to say to the committee that these two precedents are in my view bad ones <e> <s> they have now fathered a bad habit <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will take that message back to her right honourable friend <e> <s> i hope she will say that because something bad has been done on two previous occasions it should not necessarily be regarded as a water-proof copper-bottomed excuse for perpetrating the same action again <e> <s> my acceptance of the argument of my noble friend is tinged with dismay <e> <s> in the circumstances i shall not trouble the chamber by dividing the committee on so small a point <e> <s> therefore i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i wish that i had understood a word of what my noble friend has just said <e> <s> i am afraid that the sense of it wholly escaped me <e>", "<cs> the argument is that having made a reference to the commission no director general would be so stark staring plumb crazy wholly to disregard the report when he received it <e> <s> you do not have to be very charitable to make that assumption <e>", "<cs> i too support this series of amendments <e> <s> the burden which could be placed on rural communities if their interests were not safeguarded would result in a major blot on the legislation <e> <s> i cannot entirely restrain my curiosity <e> <s> i inquire of my noble friend as to the meaning of the word undue <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> tabled by my noble friend lord stanley of alderley seeks to delete the word undue from subsection where it is attached to preference and discrimination <e> <s> i wonder whether when preference and discrimination become undue <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will be able to enlighten me <e>", "<cs> i hesitate to delay the passage of the bill further but i had not expected that my noble friends reply would bring us face to face quite so abruptly with competition <e> <s> that is one of the really divisive issues in the bill <e> <s> i know that the government sincerely and genuinely believe that one of the major benefits to flow from competition will be lower prices with great benefit to the consumer <e> <s> they feel that the amendments now proposed would somehow get in the way as undoubtedly they would if that competition were real genuine and bringing the expected benefits with it <e> <s> i do not believe that basically because it is difficult to imagine competition producing large and not very well defined benefits where there is no large surplus available to play with <e> <s> there will not be a large surplus at least in england and wales <e> <s> i fear that the government in opposing these amendments on the grounds that they would frustrate the benefits are taking a ground which seems to me to be unreal <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble lord lord mcintosh because i was not present when he moved the amendment <e> <s> however i hope he agrees that that does not prevent me from giving it my support albeit briefly <e> <s> i was encouraged to hear my noble friend lord renton say that he was confident that our noble friend on the front bench was with us in spirit <e> <s> that carries me some of the way <e> <s> it depends upon what kind of spirit is being talked of <e> <s> i hope that my noble friends spirit will be shown in tangible form this afternoon in his response to this very important amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to my noble friend that does not alter the sense of what i am saying <e> <s> i do not mind whether either or both these amendments are practicable <e> <s> if the objection is on the grounds of practicality then it would be acceptable to me because the government will obviously want to take the next step and go away and find something better <e> <s> i do not wish to dwell at length on this matter because the arguments have been made <e> <s> i think that we are all concerned and rightly so that the burdens of those living in remote areas should not be unfairly and oppressively increased <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend bear in mind the possibility that a better service might be more efficient and that an efficient service might also be better <e>", "<cs> i listened carefully to the speech of the noble lord lord hatch and i cannot help thinking that my noble friend on the front bench was perhaps a little unwise in provoking the discussion at this stage <e> <s> my noble friend should regard the speech made by the noble lord lord hatch as something of a self-inflicted wound which she encouraged in a rather careless way <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend sits down i should like to say that i was not quite clear about what she said on the mandatory issue <e> <s> clause states <e>", "<cs> i too wish to support the amendment <e> <s> it seems to me very odd that the government should have so strongly resisted the last amendment in giving no place to chp in their programme and should then deliberately turn round and go in the other direction being prepared to rely on and give due place to french imports <e>", "<cs> i really hate to interrupt my noble friend but i had hoped that by this time she and others of her noble friends might have learnt that the repetition of hideous error is in no way a defence nor is it even a palliation <e>", "<cs> in no way do i feel reassured <e> <s> perhaps i may take members of the committee back very briefly to the amendment to which my noble friend referred <e> <s> so far as i recollect what i then suggested was that the director general should be answerable to the secretary of state <e> <s> that did not mean it was the last thing that i wished to call down upon his unoffending head a stream of directions from the secretary of state indicating the order of priority in which matters were to be brought under review in the performance of his duty <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the noble lord lord williams <e> <s> he paraphrased me very fairly even though he did not completely understand the burden of my remarks <e> <s> i must say to my noble friend that his opening remarks shocked me considerably because i believed that he was on the verge of accepting my amendment <e> <s> that would of course come as a very great surprise to me as it would have done to anybody sitting behind me because such a thing happens only very rarely <e> <s> i should not readily have recovered from such a shock <e> <s> however the subsequent remarks of my noble friend made me <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful for the last words of my noble friend and almost moved by them <e> <s> perhaps i may put it this way so great is my admiration and respect for him that my imagination is defeated when i come to attempt to envisage the indignation and the noble rage with which he would have rejected the explanation that he has now offered to me had our positions been reversed and i had offered it to him <e>", "<cs> it is a horrible thought but no excuse <e>", "<cs> i am once again sadly convinced how deeply encrusted in sin governments become <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords does not my noble friend agree that we cannot take any satisfaction from the fact that the steep decline of the past years has just slowed down a little <e> <s> does he not agree that the major trouble comes not from within europe but from outside it <e>", "<cs> i should like very much to support as warmly as i can the amendment spoken to by the noble earl lord halsbury <e> <s> competition is the main thrust of the government in this bill <e> <s> i have always believed that the aims of the electricity supply industry should be and i give them no particular order security safety and cheapness <e> <s> in the disturbance which the governments proposals are bound to inflict upon the industry i fear that despite the governments declared intentions to the contrary competition may be such a primary force so far as concerns the legislation that safety and security will tend to be pushed out of the prime position which they should occupy <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to intervene but i am anxious that my noble friend should understand what i attempted to say <e> <s> i was asking whether the government regard the future ownership of the nuclear industry by the private sector as a source of advantage or as a burden <e>", "<cs> the point is that the operating company will be wholly owned by the holding company which is owned by the distributors <e> <s> it is not unnatural that the minister has appointed the first chairman and the first board but it would be very surprising if the holding company were not interested in influencing subsequent appointments when it has been set up <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank noble lords who have taken part in this brief debate whether from a sedentary position or standing up <e> <s> at the same time i should like to say that the only gratification that i feel there is only a small measure of it is that the amendment should have called forth from my noble friend on the front bench quite such a wealth of information which was not previously available to me and which like my noble friend lord lauderdale i shall need time to digest and examine <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has raised a number of wide questions on this amendment <e> <s> i seek to follow him to a certain extent though without repeating the debate we had the other day on the desirability of separating altogether the nuclear section of the industry <e> <s> in this schedule there is the clearest possible admission on the part of the government that nuclear power is indeed very different and deserves and requires very different treatment <e> <s> it requires treatment of a kind which the government would never contemplate handing out to any other section of the industry <e>", "<cs> my noble friend has not with respect answered my question <e> <s> mr baker and others within the industry must perforce in the <e>", "<cs> i want to mention a few further points about the schedule <e> <s> i would not wish it to be withdrawn from the bill but in her opening remarks on an earlier amendment my noble friend appeared to take more encouragement than i thought she should from the fact that the amendment of the noble earl lord halsbury was defeated the other day <e> <s> she can hardly be surprised that a schedule of this kind should at least attract a minimum of discussion <e> <s> self-denial is almost my middle name when it comes to making long speeches and i refrained from expanding my remarks as i think i might well have done and repeating a great many of the things that were said in that earlier debate <e> <s> after all repetition is not a phenomenon entirely strange to the committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my support very briefly to the amendment moved by my noble friend lord stanley of alderley <e> <s> like him i am much concerned that those who live in rural areas should not as a result of this bill have imposed upon them burdens which are not shared by those living in more highly populated areas <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much dislike the idea of opposing and finding myself in disagreement with the noble lord lord callaghan <e> <s> apart from anything else he is my very near neighbour and i wish to remain on peaceful terms with him <e> <s> however every time in this country that we contemplate changing a situation which in many respects is very unsatisfactory all kinds of champions leap to the defence of the indifferent <e> <s> reasons are found for perpetuating the status quo <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i certainly did not seek to suggest that the noble lord wanted by his amendment to perpetuate the present arrangements <e> <s> what i said was by way of a far more general comment to the effect that whenever changes are proposed to arrangements that have worked out their usefulness many champions immediately appear i was not referring in particular to the noble lord to defend those things which as i said have outlived their usefulness <e>", "<cs> my lords i had hoped that we should see on the marshalled list an entry in the name of my noble friend the minister at least in an attempt to meet the anxieties which were expressed very clearly during the committee stage <e> <s> it is not my intention to repeat at length the arguments in favour of giving special attention to the concerns and needs of those who live in rural areas that has already been done by others <e> <s> however i should like to call your lordships attention to the alternatives offered by my noble friends amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i must confess to some disappointment although as i said before no surprise <e> <s> however it would be churlish if i did not say that i appreciated the courteous way in which my noble friend replied to my amendments <e> <s> i have to say that i think the argument he adduced that the chairman should be appointed by the director after consultation with the secretary of state is at least a two-edged argument <e> <s> if the government are prepared to go that far it would seem to me that they are at least recognising that there is some cogency behind the demand that the secretary of state be involved <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged to my noble friend <e> <s> however i see no alternative but to beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords can hardly manage to get to my feet <e> <s> dumbfounded and stricken as i am almost helpless with surprise and amazement i am just able to force through my lips some few words albeit lame words of thanks to my noble friend for his grace in accepting the amendment <e> <s> i believe that i can modestly say that the bill is a great deal better without those rubbishy words in it <e>", "<cs> my lords it has emerged very quietly and in a very low-profile fashion during the currency of these debates that professor littlechild poor man is to be the individual saddled with the fate of being the director general of electricity supply <e>", "<cs> my lords this is the second shock <e> <s> i very much doubt whether i have the constitution required to take these shocks but i shall do my best and face them with such courage and resources as i can muster <e>", "<cs> my lords i am almost drowning in gratification <e> <s> but one good turn deserves another <e> <s> since my noble friend has taken such a gracious and generous view of this modest amendment i shall not press him to answer the three questions that i asked namely what does he want those words to mean what does he think they mean and what do they mean <e> <s> i must tell him that i shall enjoy asking those questions should that unfortunately be necessary at a later stage of the bill when he tells us of the conclusions that he has reached <e> <s> i hope very much that the outcome will be profitable and positive <e> <s> on that basis i have great pleasure in asking permission to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords at this moment i think that i should declare an interest <e> <s> i am the chairman of british alcan <e> <s> it is one of the largest generators of power which it uses largely for its own purposes <e> <s> it is only fair to add that the company stands to gain rather than to lose from the provisions made by the bill for access to the grid on fairer terms than those which are presently available <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for giving way <e> <s> she said that the directors of the operating company will be answerable to the holding company <e> <s> how far can that possibly be the case <e> <s> i am sorry to say that my noble friend will have to go into far more detail if she hopes to prove to the satisfaction of this house that that is anything like the case <e>", "<cs> my lords i am so sorry to interrupt my noble friend again <e> <s> in the presence of the leader of the house i ask her whether it would not be sensible and fair to postpone the third reading of the bill until such time as this very necessary information is available <e>", "<cs> my lords i admit that i am not all that optimistic about the prospect of my noble friend accepting this amendment <e> <s> that is not to say that i do not think that it should be included in the bill <e> <s> i can see very few possible arguments against its inclusion <e> <s> there is fairly general and widespread support for the sentiments that underlie this amendment <e> <s> i suspect that the government will say two things first that the amendment is unnecessary and that it will be implemented in any case <e> <s> if it is unecessary there are other sections of the bill that i have described as legislative garbage which could well be omitted thereby leaving space for this modest contribution <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to take the opportunity to say that i am most grateful to my noble friend for having considered the point and for having taken out one piece of inelegance from the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not enjoyed the passage of this bill <e> <s> i found myself in repeated sharp and convinced disagreement with my noble friends in the government <e> <s> but at the same time i should like to pay tribute to them and thank them for their unfailing patience and courtesy and i mean that <e> <s> i can well understand how difficult it must be to steer through your lordships house a bill of this complexity which excites as much controversy as this one <e>", "<cs> my noble friend will be first in at the kill <e> <s> i cannot pretend to have studied the document in any great detail <e> <s> however one thing is absolutely clear to me it leaves the national grid company in total command and in absolute control <e> <s> i have asked the government on many occasions to whom the national grid company is to be answerable <e> <s> i have been told that like other companies it will be answerable to its shareholders <e> <s> how much weight can we give to that answer <e> <s> it is to be answerable to its owners who it operationally commands and with whom it will compete for the business of large users as well as for contracts with generators <e>", "<cs> my lords i declare an interest in that i am the treasurer of the society and also chairman of the operating company <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that the society which is a learned one has had a presence in regents park for years that it desires nothing so much as to live at peace with its neighbours and that it asks that its proposals should be judged when they are known and not in the light of rumour <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i have never concealed my dislike of the bill <e> <s> i very much share the feelings expressed by the noble earl lord halsbury about the amendment which he moved at committee stage and which i among others supported <e> <s> it seems surprising even though welcome that the government should have listened to those arguments which have gained nothing in cogency since and proved wholly deaf to them then yet they have now given way on two-thirds of the point <e> <s> i do not want to dwell on the subject but reflecting upon it from this side of your lordships house i get no pleasure from it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> as he was good enough to mention my name i should like to ask him a question <e> <s> in the present circumstances with the time being as it is how does he expect anyone to benefit from delaying the bill <e> <s> it would mean the postponement for two or three months of any effective action <e> <s> whether or not one likes the bill injecting such damaging uncertainty can serve no ones good <e> <s> i ask the noble lord to address himself to that point <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend accept that there is a growing feeling that wheel-clamping is just another bit of tinkering with a growing problem and that sooner or later the government and others must accept that principal roads are intended for movement and not for use as parking lots or as delivery areas during rush hours <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel sure that your lordships will be grateful to the noble lord lord ezra for having given us the opportunity to look again at the problems of this important industry <e> <s> i find it impossible to disagree in any way with his concluding comment that much has changed since we debated the bill and much still remains unclear <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will consult his right honourable friend after this debate and ponder over what has been said <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps my noble friend will forgive me for intervening <e> <s> it is all very well to dismiss those allegations as alarmist <e> <s> that is exactly what the previous secretary of state did <e> <s> we are entitled to ask that if the government dismiss those figures as eyewash or rubbish they should put forward a definite figure as an alternative <e> <s> there must be some costs involved although the government are at liberty to say that there will be no cost <e> <s> let us have a clear assessment <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps my noble friend will forgive me for interrupting him <e> <s> it <e>", "<cs> my lords does not my noble friend think that it would be rather eccentric for the government to continue to lend their authority to figures in which they do not have very much confidence <e> <s> will he particularly have in mind that it is the habit of some city commentators to pore over those figures rather like a roman general of old pored over the entrails of a sacrificed chicken and perhaps arrive at equally ill-founded conclusions <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend take note of the great satisfaction that we all register and the comfort we take from the fact that part of the accounts are good and reliable in the same way as the curates egg <e> <s> does the minister agree that there is something amiss in accounts where the overall deficit is billion and there is a balancing item as large as billion <e> <s> no auditor would sign accounts like that or if he did he would go to prison <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may intervene briefly to ask three questions <e> <s> i do so as one who is no profound admirer of modern legislation and confronting this clause i find myself in a state of unusual confusion <e> <s> my first question with due respect to my noble and learned friend lord rawlinson is what on earth is the point of amending the clause at all <e> <s> my second question is what effect will the clause have <e> <s> who will it bind if we declare in the middle of a bill that the general objective of the part is what it is said to be <e> <s> what is the purpose of putting it there <e> <s> so far as i recollect it is not a regular feature of acts of parliament to inject at some middle point such a clause merely to declare what the aim of the part is <e> <s> i should like to hear my noble and learned friend give some explanation that i can understand as to what the effect of the clause is and in particular what is the point of declaring the general objective of this part of the bill <e> <s> who does it bind and in what respect <e> <s> what on earth would be the point of amending it in any way <e>", "<cs> in response to the noble baroness perhaps i may say that when one puts into a bill a declaration of ones objectives that declaration must be comprehensive <e> <s> one must leave nothing out or it will make the legislation even lengthier than it is now <e>", "<cs> i was much impressed when the noble lord lord mishcon said that he was entranced as i have always been by what my noble and learned friend lord hailsham said <e> <s> i have frequently in fact always found myself entranced by the words of the noble lord lord mishcon but every now and then there lurks in the back of my mind just a suspicion the barest suspicion that he might not always be wholly right <e>", "<cs> i am deeply indebted to the noble lord for his advice <e> <s> perhaps he would just bear with me for a moment <e> <s> it seems to me that in considering the advisory committee we are entitled to take into account the powers that it is given and the way in which it will carry out its duties <e> <s> i should hate to find myself having a difference of opinion with the noble lord but if i do i shall have to endure the pain <e>", "<cs> my noble friend is entitled to his view but i have never allowed ray respect for lawyers to carry me to the lengths of praising the drafting of any of the measures which have come before us in parliament in my recent memory <e>", "<cs> i willingly join the noble lord lord mishcon in prayers whether or not those prayers will be answered i am not certain <e> <s> however i certainly share his anxiety <e>", "<cs> i lack the learning of other noble lords who have taken part in the debate and so perhaps i may be forgiven if i ask a very simple and straightforward question <e> <s> how many of us are really convinced that it would be right to make three distinct moves in the direction of the american system and what gains would result from our doing so <e> <s> first it is proposed that we move towards the amalgamation of the two professions <e> <s> secondly we are making substantial moves in the direction of setting up in fact if not in name a department of justice <e> <s> thirdly this is the point with which we are here concerned we are for the first time giving the advocate a pecuniary interest in the outcome of the case <e>", "<cs> my lords despite the eloquent way in which the amendment was moved i very much hope that my noble friend will resist the temptation to accept it <e> <s> what is the point of giving duties to a government department and then saying that whatever the temptation may be we do not trust that government department and we shall set up another organisation to double bank it <e> <s> that seems to be a policy of despair <e> <s> how many people are likely to serve on this food safety agency <e> <s> every section of the food producing industry would have to be represented <e> <s> every section of the country would have to be represented <e> <s> by the end of the process it would be a very large body <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend pleasantly aware that no one will envy him the task of explaining the governments plan to your lordships house <e> <s> he enjoys a measure of protection both from the rules which were referred to earlier this afternoon which forbid debate now and by virtue of the complexity of the plan which is quite impossible to digest simply by hearing it once <e> <s> however i should like to ask him two questions <e> <s> first he claims that everything that has been done <e>", "<cs> my lords i intervene briefly in this debate <e> <s> i was not present in the chamber at the time when a similar amendment by my noble friend lord alexander was debated <e> <s> hence when the division was called i proceeded albeit uneasily but nevertheless obediently into the government lobby <e> <s> i have since had the advantage of reading the discussion which took place at that time and i have also had the advantage of listening to your lordships today <e> <s> i conclude that beyond any doubt the balance of the argument is with the amendment so eloquently moved by my noble friend <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may briefly tell my noble friend what his refusal to accept the amendments would do for me <e> <s> it would persuade me of one of two things either that the government have made up their mind what they want to do know how they will do it and will not tell parliament or <e> <s> alternatively that the government do not know how they will achieve the purpose that they have in mind <e> <s> in those circumstances i am bound to say that i should find it difficult to support my noble friend in rejecting what seem to me to be modest amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that there is considerable sympathy in all parts of the house with my noble friends on the front bench who fail to answer questions of detail particularly when those questions are inordinately long <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may make a few points <e> <s> first i do not fancy the idea of advisory committees at all <e> <s> secondly i dislike large ones even more <e> <s> however if there is going to be one and it would seem that we are doomed to have one then it seems to me odd that it should be put together entirely by the person whom it is intended to advise <e> <s> the last point i make is that to put together a body of that kind and then deny it just that kind of professional guidance which this amendment seeks to give seems to me to be falling far short of the wisdom which one would expect from my noble and learned friend <e>", "<cs> i wish to make clear one point arising from what my noble friend lord harmar-nicholls has just said <e> <s> i am making no judgmemt on whether it was right or not to call the division <e> <s> i voted for the government on the basis of the undertakings given by my noble friend <e> <s> i very much hope that he will not run out on it because his undertaking will be very useful <e> <s> i always find his undertakings very helpful <e> <s> without them i might <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that an offer of this kind deserves more than two cheers <e> <s> it deserves three rather enthusiastic cheers <e> <s> it is a generous offer that would result in keeping the canova here indefinitely and on exhibition to the public <e> <s> will he take the opportunity to express some appreciation in order to encourage others to do exactly what the barclay brothers are offering to do <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it unnecessary to repeat the cogent arguments adduced in favour of the amendment <e> <s> i would not think it necessary to argue it at any length were it not for ones acute awareness of the tendency of governments of all colours to show a knee-jerk reaction which leads them to reject all amendments and defend as though it were a matter of principle the integrity of their bills or what would be flatteringly described as the integrity of their bills <e> <s> in those circumstances i want only to tell my noble friend that if the government cannot see their way to accepting this very sensible and reasonable amendment my surprise would overcome my desire to support them <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that the difficulty arises chiefly because as medicine advances so the demand on resources increases beyond our capacity to meet it <e> <s> does she also agree that to ignore that basic fact and to point out everything that goes wrong in this huge service does immense disservice to both the medical profession and the health service of this country <e>", "<cs> my noble friend deserves
