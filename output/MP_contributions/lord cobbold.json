["<cs> my lords i will not detain the house for more than a minute <e> <s> i should like just to say thank you to those who have spoken <e> <s> i rather wish that except for the last two speakers there had been one or two who were not either members of the select committee or of sub-committee a it was really the home team in one guise or another speaking but still they made very helpful contributions <e> <s> it is extremely difficult to get people from outside to speak in these debates <e> <s> i made very serious attempts but the four or five distinguished characters whom i tried to persuade had very good excuses for not coming this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords we have listened to three admirable maiden speeches today and it falls to me to congratulate in particular the noble lord lord lever of manchester <e> <s> i think <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be appropriate for me to say a word or two about my experience in these matters as lord chamberlain and to recall one or two of the points that i have made in speeches in this house as long ago as and on theatre censorship and on the theatres bill <e> <s> as some noble lords may remember i was in favour at that time for a number of reasons of getting rid of the lord chamberlains powers and duties <e> <s> the late lord scarborough my predecessor also spoke in this house along the same lines <e> <s> however i expressed anxieties on certain subjects and suggested that some body might be appointed to work in close contact with the authorities in television and radio to exercise some form of supervision probably in experimental form to be reviewed from time to time <e> <s> i tried to inveigle the noble lord lord goodman into taking an interest and playing some part in that but i did not even get him to first base <e>", "<cs> my lords it is just on years since i was directly concerned with these matters and i have too much experience of the difficulties of judgment in the monetary and fiscal fields to believe that it would be wise for anybody so out-of-date to comment on the details of policies which are now being followed <e> <s> in any case i align myself very firmly with the noble lord lord thorneycroft in not knowing the answers <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for intervening unannounced at this rather late hour <e> <s> i should mention that for health reasons i was unable to attend sub-committee as discussions on this subject during july but some years ago i spent five years working for a british insurance company in an eec country and so i have a residual interest in the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord plowden has set out clearly the main conclusions of this report <e> <s> i thought it might be of interest to your lordships on this occasion to recall briefly the previous report on this subject that was made by this committee at the end of to which the noble lord lord banks referred <e> <s> it might be of interest to consider to what extent regional policy has developed in the intervening four years <e> <s> it may also be useful to draw attention to some of the criticisms and suggestions which were put forward in the earlier report and see to what extent they have been met <e>", "<cs> my lords the present report goes more deeply into the improvement of communication between all concerned and makes a number of recommendations <e> <s> both the earlier report and more specifically the present report stress the value of development programmes <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord plowden that this is an extremely important point <e> <s> the report also welcomes the introduction of the non-quota section <e>", "<cs> my lords first may i add my congratulations to the two maiden speakers today <e> <s> the noble earl lord airlie put very clearly and strongly the points which were made to us by the accepting houses committee and i am sure it was of great value to hear it from so distinguished a member of the accepting houses committee <e> <s> also the noble viscount lord chandos gave a happy fairy commendation to the bank of england <e> <s> i shall be returning towards the end of what i have to say to the bank of englands position regarding some of these matters <e> <s> may i take up one point on the speech of the noble lord who has just preceded me <e> <s> he said that because of some of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise for having unavoidably missed the opening speeches <e> <s> which i will read with care tomorrow <e> <s> the general position has been well covered by noble lords <e> <s> i find <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i ask him whether he does not agree that the best way to take an international and co-operative look at this situation i am talking about the exchange situation particularly would be to strengthen the international monetary fund both in the amounts at its disposal in one way or another and in the discipline it may be able to hold over the rest of the monetary world <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my voice to that of the noble lord lord soames when he stresses that a more stable rgime of currencies could be a great help in promoting better worldwide economic conditions <e> <s> i have little to add to what i said in the debate on this subject a few months ago <e> <s> i then stressed that todays difficulties in this field are much greater than were those in the s and earlier <e> <s> this is largely due to the enormous increase in the amount of volatile funds moving around the world looking for better interest rates and prospects of exchange profits <e>", "<cs> sat first in parliament after the death of his father <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a great honour for me to have the opportunity of addressing your lordships for the first time <e>", "<cs> in supporting the amendment i take up a point raised by the minister <e> <s> it is important to be clear that what is at issue is not the wearing of seat belts as such <e> <s> all of us agree with the minister that seat belts are an effective safety device and that they have saved many lives and reduced injury on almost all occasions when they have been put to the test <e> <s> the amendments are not concerned with the libertarian issue <e> <s> whatever may be the view of the committee on the extent to which the state would be empowered to interfere with the freedom of individuals it is one of the fundamental duties of the chamber to give the individual the benefit of the doubt we are concerned this evening that the bill contains many anomalies which will make it extremely difficult to enforce in practice <e> <s> it will be difficult for parents to decide how to operate it and it runs the risk of bringing the law into disrepute <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for that reply <e> <s> the amendment does not materially alter the bill but would enable this perfectly natural and very much used operation of taking schoolchildren to their place of education to proceed as normally <e> <s> it is sensible and will be welcomed by parents <e> <s> it will reduce the risk of children being made to walk or cycle to school and therefore being put at even greater risk <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment <e> <s> it is clear from the debates we have had on the bill that there is genuine confusion in the minds of its supporters as to how it will operate in practice <e> <s> we are left with a difference of opinion between on the one hand those who favour rushing the primary legislation through and sorting out the manifest difficulties of its implementations by subsequent and as yet unspecified regulations and on the other those who believe that clearer directions as to its implementation should be written on to the face of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support this amendment proposed by the noble lord lord bruce-gardyne and the noble lord lord monson <e> <s> this amendment is one which the government and the sponsors could perhaps accept <e> <s> it helps to get rid of a few of the anomalies in what i believe to be a potentially unsatisfactory piece of legislation <e> <s> it makes the bill more flexible and it would be of help to those parents and those of us in the community who are going to have to put this legislation into practice if it should become law <e> <s> i therefore support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i participate in this interesting debate as a representative of the banking and financial services industry <e> <s> the industry centred on the city of london looks upon the european single market as a huge and exciting challenge <e> <s> we see the community as a market of million savers and consumers generating gross savings of more than billion dollars nearly <e>", "<cs> in rising to support the amendment proposed by the noble lord lord hacking i must first declare an interest to the extent that until recently i was responsible for the money market activities of the trustee savings bank the tsb one of the banks involved in the recent events referred to by the noble lord lord hacking which lie behind the amendment <e> <s> the tsb incidentally has had a particularly close relationship with the local authorities in financial markets for a long time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy at the end of this debate to have the opportunity of supporting the amendment proposed by my noble friend lord jenkins of hillhead <e> <s> i agree with him that the role this country and this government play in the building of the single market in europe is crucial to the economic welfare of the country in the nineties <e> <s> i also agree with him that there are relatively few major european issues and that one of them is most definitely the monetary system <e> <s> it is on that subject that i wish to speak this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords there has been general agreement on all sides of your lordships house this afternoon with the first part of the motion proposed by the noble lord lord boardman <e> <s> a free market certainly as my noble friend lady seear said has the full support of those of us on these benches <e> <s> it clearly has a major role to play in creating wealth prosperity and jobs <e> <s> it is only necessary as several noble lords have pointed out to look to eastern europe and to the soviet union to see the total failure of closed centrally managed economies to deliver wealth and prosperity <e>", "<cs> my lords i have read the report in full <e> <s> indeed it is an excellent paper and i commend it to your lordships <e> <s> it is also from a first-class bank <e> <s> it gives credit where it is due but it does not hesitate to criticise <e> <s> i should like to read a couple of extracts <e> <s> i recognise that they are not representative of the whole paper the whole paper is very fair but they are nevertheless relevant to the point i am making <e> <s> mr lomax writes <e>", "<cs> i cannot support the amendment either <e> <s> as has already been stated there is a considerable difference between riding on a road and r <e>", "<cs> my lords before turning to the substance of the bill i should perhaps declare what is i suppose an interest in its outcome in that i am the holder of an annual music and dancing licence for people in respect of knebworth park which own and i am also the holder of a special variation to that licence for a maximum of people to cover an open-air charity rock concert due to take place at knebworth park at the end of next week which will probably be the largest musical event to take place in europe this summer <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to detain your lordships for long but since the second reading debate on this bill there has been an exchange of correspondence between myself and the noble viscount lord ullswater in which i sought clarification on one point which did not seem clear to me when i read the <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to echo or should i say ecu <e> <s> the welcome given by my noble friend lord ezra to the hard ecu scheme <e> <s> i believe that it represents a serious attempt by government to get back into the mainstream of the debate <e> <s> it also contains a great deal of good technical work <e> <s> however i have great difficulty in following the governments logic <e>", "<cs> my lords do the government seriously believe that the full benefits of the single market which they so fervently support can be achieved with separate individual currencies with separate interest rate differentials and if one allows for the union between the belgian and luxembourg franc with balances of payments <e> <s> it seems to me to be an impossibility <e>"]
