["<cs> i stand to support the noble lord lord renton in the moving of amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> before i do so may i express my regret at having been unable to be in the house at the second reading of this bill <e> <s> i express regret for two reasons <e> <s> first i am in the unusual position of being a member of the bar in the state of new york although i disclaim all responsibility for any anti-trust law anywhere and second particularly when in the united states i have become closely involved in the debate on the extraterritorial application ofunited states laws <e> <s> i was bold enough or unwise enough to precede the secretary of state by just over a year in addressing the international section of the los angeles county bar association on this subject <e> <s> the secretary of state addressed the british-american chamber of commerce a year later in september of last year <e> <s> at a later stage being unable to persuade the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones to speak i managed to persuade the then attorney-general mr sam silkin to speak in a debate with the head of the anti-trust division of the department of justice mr john shenefield on this topic <e> <s> that was an agreeable occasion but a less agreeable occasion was when i debated with mr john shenefield in dallas last august over the <e>", "<cs> thank you <e> <s> i thought that the compensation was on the rather low side <e> <s> that is a good example and having heard the noble lords arguments i find myself now able to support him on his first amendment <e> <s> before i came to the committee i was already in the position of wanting to support him in the second of his two extensions to clause i refer to the reference back to section <e> <s> i urge the committee to consider and encourage the noble lord lord renton to extend this other category of judgment to judgments which arise out of proceedings in which directions have been made by the secretary of state under section l of the act <e> <s> i have on a scrappy piece of paper in my hand my suggested amendment in order that we may have some record of it <e> <s> perhaps it can he considered at some later stage <e> <s> i will read it <e> <s> it follows the final words that are in my noble friends amendment <e>", "<cs> in view of that undertaking i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords since the noble and learned lord the lord advocate has addressed the committee also on amendment no <e> <s> and has introduced this topic by means of a very lucid introduction i should like with the leave of the committee to widen the discussion to include amendment no <e> <s> of the noble and learned lord the lord advocate and also my own amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> in short i should like at this stage to address the committee on all four amendments <e>", "<cs> that is a linkage which does not appear on the marshalled list <e> <s> if the noble and learned lord the lord advocate is linking the two together and stretching the words from one clause to another then we do find a sentence but certainly we do not find a sentence in the first portion of the clause in amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i am a little troubled that this amendment is being moved at this stage in view of the remarks that i have made to the committee and the difficulty of proceeding forward on this amendment when the noble and learned lord lord mackay of clashfern has down amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> he has also undertaken to deal with the assignment matter which again is something which should be incorporated in amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> in those circumstances would it not be more satisfactory if amendment no <e> <s> was not carried <e>", "<cs> if i may say so to the committee that is entirely satisfactory <e> <s> the committee has already heard me express more than once my concern as to how these clauses should be joined together the noble and learned lord the lord advocate has made his response and in those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i stand to oppose this amendment and i do so in what i hope will be a helpful stance <e> <s> i stand also to ask the noble and learned lord the lord advocate whether he would consider keeping the clause as it was originally drafted the clause which by means of this amendment he now seeks to replace by the new clause <e> <s> i do so because i am concerned that the amended clause opens the door to pre-trial discovery which is known particularly in the united states of america and which is the subject of the greatest concern in this country <e> <s> indeed us discovery procedures was a major factor in causing the government to bring this bill before parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to address the house on amendments nos <e> <s> and and in so doing express my warm thanks to the noble and learned lord the lord advocate for moving this amendment <e> <s> i also express my gratitude that he has chosen to do so at this time for he is just in time <e> <s> on th february last year in the united states eighth circuit in a case called <e>", "<cs> my lords it is my intention to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> there is nothing to be gained by dividing the house <e> <s> your lordships have heard the arguments the lord advocate has heard the arguments <e> <s> may i leave it on the pages of <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran on the amendment that he has just put before your lordships <e> <s> i will not follow him in his detailed argument on intellectual property <e> <s> may i <e>", "<cs> my lords i have intimated my intention to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> then i will indeed move it formally my lords <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords at this stage may i formally withdraw the amendent <e>", "<cs> my lords i stand to thank and support the noble and learned lord <e>", "<cs> my lords may i from the cross-benches comment for a few moments upon this bill <e> <s> having in my various activities in moving amendments at both the committee stage and the report stage put in severe jeopardy my membership of the new york bar i desire to say a few kindly words towards the united states of america which was described by the secretary of state for trade in the second reading debate in the house of commons as our most powerful and valued friend <e>", "<cs> my lords as a lawyer in private practice i desire to say a few words concerning clause <e> <s> it is perhaps appropriate that i should do so at this stage after the very strong language that the noble lord who sits beside me has just used in referring to this clause <e> <s> he has said it is the outrageous clause <e> <s> he adds that it gives lloyds a blanket immunity to a position in which lloyds may be seeking to act as he suggests above the law <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i did not mislead your lordships <e> <s> i thought i made it plain that at the wharncliffe meeting the bill as it stood in its entirety was put to the meeting and the voting was on the bill as a whole but it was a bill which contained clause or clause as the noble earl has suggested with wide application and wider immunities than the present clause contains <e>", "<cs> my lords i had just got to my feet before the noble lord sat down <e> <s> during his speech to the house the noble lord referred with concern to regulations and <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble lord could enlarge upon his point <e> <s> those regulations concern the supply of information and the conduct of internal inquiries within the lloyds community <e>", "<cs> my lords there is the provision of confidentiality if the noble lord will look at that regulation <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to express very briefly my support for this amendment <e> <s> the growing practice of enactment clauses of this complexity which are brought in by statutory instrument does present a lot of problems to all users of statutes whether they be lawyers or other persons <e> <s> it is a practice which is becoming increasingly undesirable and for that reason and for the reasons put forward by the noble lord lord renton i support his amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for the careful consideration he is giving the matter and for saying that he will give it further consideration following this short debate <e> <s> while it is my intention to seek to withdraw the amendment i would state first that i like anybody who is involved in the assessment of damages in whatever field loss has been inflicted on the plaintiff am much aware of all the complexities involved and how at the end of the day the trial judge if it is a trial judge who is assessing the damages has to take a broad view and give his award of damages on that broad view <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones wishes this bill to pass this house and to go to another place i would just like to raise one matter with the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor <e> <s> as the noble and learned lord knows i took an interest in the interest provisions and i apologise for duplicating that word in the bill which are contained in schedule <e> <s> i was urging upon the noble and learned lord that consideration should be given to compound interest <e> <s> at this stage i wish to do no more than to press that upon the noble and learned lord <e>", "<cs> my lords congratulations are so easily and generously given in your lordships house that it is hard to extend a special congratulation and special thanks without entering into language of excessive superlatives <e> <s> however this is a moment for extending special congratulation and thanks to the noble lord lord nugent and the other members of his committee <e> <s> the report of the committee is a fine piece of workmanship and in the quality of their scrutiny to adopt the good words used earlier by the noble lord lord windlesham the committee began by taking great pains to understand what is lloyds and what is the lloyds insurance market and then to consider the contentious clauses within that understanding <e> <s> if the noble lord lord foot found that in his work on the committee a large part of the task was to comprehend the lloyds market then he and every member of the committee should be congratulated on that understanding <e> <s> if indeed the committee of lloyds now that the heavy burden of this bill has almost passed from them are thinking of publishing some guide to convey understanding of the lloyds market to outsiders they would not do too badly i venture to suggest by adopting many of the passages contained in the opening paragraphs of his report <e> <s> i refer to paragraphs <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to express my thanks to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for this new provision <e>", "<cs> if i may i should like to address a few words to the committee on clause <e> <s> i do so in a sense of gratitude to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor and his department <e> <s> arbitration law has had considerable attention from your lordships house in recent years <e> <s> there was of course the arbitration bill in which became the arbitration act <e> <s> clause is another example of arbitration law reform that is being invited for consideration by the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor <e>", "<cs> my lords i have three reasons for participating in this debate <e> <s> the first two are personal <e> <s> when i was called to the bar in the noble and learned lord lord roskill had recently been elevated to the high court bench <e> <s> but thereafter there have been many occasions when he has shown kindness and interest in me as he has with so many aspiring young members of both sides of the legal profession <e> <s> now sadly for us the noble and learned lord has decided to retire from service in our judicial committee although happily not from our chamber <e> <s> he and members of the fraud trials committee have put before us a thoughtful balanced and thorough report <e> <s> i therefore readily join with others in expressing thanks and gratitude <e>", "<cs> my lords while i am looking forward on i think th march to a rather fuller discussion on government competition policy will the minister accept that there is considerable concern whether the governments present takeover policies are operating fairly in the market <e> <s> will he also accept that the consequences of their present policies were that one of the two bidders in both the distillers and imperial group takeovers and i refer in one to guinness and in the other to united biscuits were effectively put out of the bidding by the references to the monopolies and mergers commission with the further consequence that distillers and united biscuits have had to offer large divestments not because it was right after investigation to do so but just to maintain their position in the proposed mergers <e> <s> will the <e>", "<cs> minister therefore ask the secretary of state to ensure that there is parity now in the operation of the governments competition policies <e>", "<cs> my lords in rising to make his comments to your lordships house the noble lord lord mais spoke of some diffidence at speaking among so many lawyers <e> <s> i am one of those lawyers but i also speak with diffidence for i have nothing like the detailed knowledge and experience of the noble lord lord mais and other noble lords in the construction and other industries that are affected by the provisions set out in this proposed legislation <e> <s> i hope that other non-lawyer members of your lordships house whether they are representing the articulate or inarticulate and whether they are concerned about the interests of plaintiffs or defendants will participate in this debate <e>", "<cs> i hesitate to interrupt but that was not the purport of my amendment <e> <s> i am not attempting to put back the clock <e> <s> the matters that the noble and learned lord lord denning has rightly called to the attention of the committee are more than adequately dealt with in the bill <e> <s> i am not seeking to disturb those provisions <e> <s> i am simply asking for a common starting point for all accruals of action so that the anomaly of contract and tort starting at wholly different times can be put right <e> <s> i am attempting in no way to disturb the bill <e> <s> my recollection is that the noble and learned lord lord denning gave me full support when i argued the point on th february <e> <s> i should like to adopt his remarks made at that time in support of the argument that i was presenting to the house <e> <s> it is an argument that i am now presenting in the same form albeit under an amendment in this committee <e>", "<cs> i would be a very bold noble lord to press forward my amendment in the light of the comments that have been made from such powerful authority in your lordships chamber <e> <s> i am not sure that my amendment has been wholly understood <e> <s> i have a slight feeling of hurt that it has been misunderstood from all quarters of the committee <e> <s> but i am content in the circumstances to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> it is not my intention to press this amendment at this stage but jacob will certainly consult esau and ascertain whether easu has been satisfied <e> <s> i may therefore come back again at report stage either as jacob or as esau <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> at this stage of the committee i am rather looking for a friendly voice in my favour <e> <s> i thought i might get a friendly voice from the noble and learned lord lord scarman for the brevity of my amendment as opposed to the series of tests that are set out in the bill <e> <s> however with great respect to the noble and learned lords who have spoken and i am taking a bold course now in disagreeing with them the problem does not lie in the tests themselves <e> <s> in my submissions i have not suggested that any of those particular tests are difficult to understand <e> <s> i am looking at the matter from a practical point of view <e> <s> i ask the committee to look at the matter from a practical point of view <e> <s> the practical problem is that if the matter gets to the court the court must append each of these tests against the potential plaintiff <e> <s> that is the complication <e>", "<cs> i rise to oppose this amendment not because i seek on one amendment to this bill to be on the winning side clearly i am on the losing side on every other amendment but for two specific reasons <e> <s> the first is and this argument has already been partially advanced by the noble lord lord howie that the plaintiff himself is not served by pursuing a stale claim a claim that is so stale that even if he can discover the identity of the defendant he cannot find him or on tracing him finds that the defendant no longer exists <e> <s> that is the first reason why i suggest that the bill is right and that the noble and learned lords committee is right in insisting on the absoluteness of the -year long stop period or whatever period of years is eventually decided upon <e>", "<cs> it is my intention to withdraw this amendment but before doing so i should like to make two comments <e> <s> the noble and learned lord suggested that i was seeking to cut down the period proposed in the bill from to years <e> <s> that was not my intention and indeed i hope that it is not the effect of my proposed amendments <e> <s> i have left the period of years as the concept in the bill for the breach of duty period <e> <s> i have suggested a -year period from completion date for the solid and good reason which runs wholly in the interests of plaintiffs that the completion date must take place after the breach of duty and invariably takes place some time after the breach of duty <e> <s> therefore the consumers association need not tremble in any event because i shall not press this amendment to a division that i seek to reduce this year period <e>", "<cs> as with my other amendments it is my intention to withdraw this amendment but i make two points to the committee <e> <s> the noble and learned lord takes a drafting point against me <e> <s> i have no special skills in the drafting of statutes <e> <s> indeed in my experience when i have moved any amendment in committee in one way or another my amendment has had some lack in drafting texture <e>", "<cs> as with my other amendments i am not going to press this one and in a moment i shall withdraw it <e> <s> it is however a rather special moment for me in this committee which has been progressing now for over three hours because i have had a voice of support from the noble and learned lord lord wilberforce <e> <s> he could not come the whole way to support the terms of my amendment that would be asking too much but he was prepared to accept the principle of it in so far as subsection <e>", "<cs> unless anybody else has anything to say perhaps i may make two comments concerning clause <e> <s> my comments will also refer to clause if i have the committees leave also to refer to it <e> <s> i have been something of a lone voice throughout this committee <e> <s> i have had little support <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord wilberforce has just supported me as also has the noble lord lord howie <e> <s> he has been kind enough to support me in this amendment as i would have supported him in his amendments if he had moved them separately from mine <e> <s> the views that i have tried to express to the committee and it may be that i have not done it with sufficient eloquence or accuracy are views that are being expressed outside the house and views that relate to genuine concerns by a number of persons outside the house who will be directly affected by these provisions <e>", "<cs> before the noble and learned lord sits down i wonder whether he has also got a formidable list of the opposers <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer is simple <e> <s> i am speaking to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> i am sorry if i did not make that plain <e> <s> i regret that the noble lord missed the first three minutes <e> <s> i shall not however repeat what the house has already heard <e> <s> i do not intend to have a second run <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for interrupting the noble and learned lord <e> <s> it is entirely my fault <e> <s> the amendments on which i was addressing the house were amendments nos <e> <s> and which are coupled together and which are the law society amendments as the noble and learned lord detected with the voice of jacob through esau <e> <s> if i may i shall address your lordships on amendment no <e> <s> which is a separate matter in a moment <e>", "<cs> my lords in moving the amendment it was my purpose to ask the noble and learned lord whether he would be kind enough to give the matter further consideration <e> <s> i am not sure whether he has been referring to discussions which have taken place since the committee stage or whether they took place before the committee stage <e> <s> however i still seek from him the kindness of his offer to give the matter further consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to intervene <e> <s> it is not for me to decide issues between two noble lords <e> <s> however my amendment particularly directed to the construction industry is indeed amendment no <e> <s> and the collateral amendments to it <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel a little hurt that the noble and learned lord referred to my amendment in terms of spurious simplicity <e> <s> i should make it quite plain although i would be more than happy to be associated with scotland and scottish law that the drafting of my amendment does not come from scotland it comes from the bill that your lordships are considering <e> <s> it is an attempt no more and no less to extract the essential provisions out of these series of texts without inviting plaintiffs or defendants to go through these complicated journeys which were so well illustrated by the noble and learned lord when he was addressing this house on amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> my lords if your lordships wish me to continue i shall do so but if i am wanted to give way to more important matters i should wish to do that <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i wonder whether i may draw one other matter to his attention <e> <s> the reference to separate parts is taken from the defective premises act <e> <s> i should like to say that it was taken from scotland but in fact that phraseology is taken straight from the defective premises act <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to every noble lord who has participated in this debate <e> <s> the house has been considering this amendment for just over an hour and i think we have now reached the point in our discussions where it would not be fruitful to go on any further <e> <s> it would not be fruitful because i doubt whether we will be able to persuade the noble and learned lord to change his mind and it would not be fruitful because in any event we have had a most full discussion <e> <s> i again therefore thank all noble lords who have participated <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already spoken to those amendments which were of course linked with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i do not intend to move them <e>", "<cs> my lords in rising to address the house on third reading of the bill i willingly repeat the thanks that i gave to the noble and learned lord on second reading <e> <s> i willingly repeat my thanks to the noble and learned lord for bringing this bill before the house and i also willingly repeat my thanks to the noble and learned lord for the courteous conscientious and extensive consultations which were carried out by his officials <e> <s> i thank too the government for agreeing to take a short postponement of third reading to enable me to return from the united states of america to participate on third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think it would be the wish of this house for me to bellow but if i position myself in a location nearer to a microphone perhaps that will deal with the problem of the acoustics and with the problem of some noble lords at the other end of the chamber who are unable to hear me <e>", "<cs> i put my name down in support of the motion of the noble lord lord morris that this clause should not stand part of the bill out of no sense of wishing to wreck the provisions which are proposed in this bill <e> <s> i should disclose that unlike the noble lord lord morris i am a solicitor of the supreme court and i acknowledge that a number of members of my profession are very concerned about the effect on the conveyancing services they provide which is proposed to be implemented within the terms of this bill <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble and learned lord very much indeed <e> <s> i hope <e>", "<cs> i was very relieved that when the noble lord interrupted it was not because he was unable to hear me <e> <s> every other interruption i have had from the noble lord in recent times has beer for that reason <e>", "<cs> it is with some reluctance that i have reached a decision that i do not wish to press to a division the motion that has been tabled in the names of the noble lord lord morris and myself <e> <s> i too am very grateful to the noble and learned lord for giving time to the committee and for being prepared now to consider in detail the amendments that have been tabled by the noble lord lord foot <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord foot did not wish by his silence when i was moving that clause should not stand part of the bill to indicate that he was not supportive of the argument that was presented to the committee nor do i wish by my silence not to record my support of the amendments that have been moved by the noble lord lord foot <e> <s> although the noble and learned lord took a different view when he made his comments on clause i was not seeking to wreck this bill <e> <s> i was seeking to be constructive <e> <s> i am sorry that i wilted and did not press the matter to a division but i did not think it was the appropriate time to do so <e> <s> i certainly will not wilt at report if i have the same fears and worries about clause and schedule at that stage of the progress of this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i begin my few words to this house by apologising to the noble and learned lord the lord advocate who opened this debate in the latter part of the morning and also to a number of your lordships who made speeches during the course of the second reading debate which i have been unable to hear <e> <s> i much regret having been unable to come to your lordships house any earlier and i wish to extend my apologies to the noble and learned lord the lord advocate and other noble lords <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed when i read the report i thought that those were outstandingly high figures for a body which had only been in existence for a few months <e>", "<cs> my lords i am a little relieved to hear that the indebtedness is not quite so large as was recorded in <e>", "<cs> my lords for those of your lordships who did not hear the earlier performances from chapter of the book of genesis i should explain that the noble and learned lord cast himself in the role of isaac and cast me variously in the roles of esau and jacob <e> <s> without knowing whether i have been cast today in the role of esau or of jacob and without making any indelicate references to the gross infirmities of the aged isaac when he was taken in by the ruse played upon him by rebecca and jacob i <e>", "<cs> i am partly satisfied <e> <s> i say that out of no sense of ingratitude to the minister <e> <s> i am certainly satisfied to hear him say that it is not the intention of the government to deal with the one-off transaction <e> <s> that was the concern i was expressing to noble lords when making my comments upon my amendment <e> <s> however i am not entirely satisfied with the explanation given by the minister that engages carries some continuity <e> <s> perhaps when reference is made to matrimonial engagement there is some intention of continuity there <e> <s> but in the normal sense of the word if a person engages in a fight or engages in a project that engagement if it has continuity has continuity for the completion of that combat or transaction <e>", "<cs> with the assurances of the noble lord the minister that he will give this problem further consideration that he will receive further represent-ations and that the dialogue is to continue i am only too happy to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> no i was not <e> <s> i did not interrupt the minister but may i address the committee separately on amendment no

on those amendments at the same time as referring to the <e>", "<cs> that is quite right i have gone one too far <e> <s> if i may come back to my previous position my proposal is that the committee should deal with the six amendments which for the sake of clarity i shall repeat are amendments nos <e> <s> no <e> <s> is the amendment moved by the noble lord the minister and <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to noble lords who have participated in the debate and to the noble and learned lord the lord advocate <e> <s> on the undertaking given by the noble and learned lord the lord advocate kindly to reconsider the problem of a bad trustee and how he acts in the capacity of an agent i am only too happy to withdraw this amendment which i now formally do and not to move any of the other amendments to which i have drawn the committees attention <e>", "<cs> while i am grateful to the noble lord lord williams for drawing attention to the overlap problems in relation to sros my amendment was directed to a smaller frame and i am therefore grateful to the noble lord the minister for his willingness to consider it <e> <s> upon that basis i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am happy to follow the guidance of the noble lord the deputy chairman <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> before we agree that schedule shall be the first schedule to the bill perhaps i may raise one matter concerning the definition of futures which is set out in paragraph of schedule <e> <s> when the noble lord lord boardman moved the amendment of the noble viscount lord colville of culross amendment no <e> <s> concerning futures we had some discussion on this point and therefore i do not intend to invite the members of the committee to travel over that ground

extend to what is described as physicals as well as futures which clearly fall under investment business and fall under the provisions of this bill <e>", "<cs> i do not intend to press this matter to a division <e> <s> it requires further consideration <e> <s> i take the point that the noble viscount lord colville made but i would make the same point in reference to the drafting of clause because

also the grey area to which the noble viscount referred in the drafting of the clause therefore it <e>", "<cs> i have heard the committees observations including the observation of the noble and

to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> not later i hope <e>", "<cs> indeed i do <e>", "<cs> i am not at all sure whether these statutes or indeed statutes in general can ever get to the position of

to such high authority within the market as the chairman of the stock exchange it cannot be a matter that is trivial or unrealistic <e> <s> for that reason while i am willing to withdraw my amendment i hope that the minister will turn aside from the pages of his brief and try to give this further consideration <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the willingness of the government to accept an amendment of mine which is some five or six lines long is quite a triumph although the government have always been willing to be helpful <e> <s> i therefore cannot resist the invitation of the noble lord to withdraw my amendment no <e> <s> a <e> <s> however before i withdraw it i should like to draw to the committees attention and to put on record the fact that both my amendment and the governments amendment are fine for the existing stock exchange listing regulations but they are not fine for any future listing regulations that may be drafted in a different matter and they are not fine for the listing regulations under part vi of other exchanges that may be permitted to join into the market <e> <s> therefore while the amendment serves the present circumstances or the present listing arrangements of the stock exchange it may not serve either future regulations of the stock exchange or the listing regulations of other exchanges <e> <s> however having drawn that caveat to the attention of the committee i am more than happy to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> indeed i am and i am just about to withdraw amendment no <e> <s> a which is the first that i was addressing <e> <s> it will be best if i do not make any counter argument <e> <s> there are one or two points that i should care to make but i shall leave them until another day <e> <s> i am very grateful to the minister for being willing to consider favourably so many of my amendments <e> <s> i should simply like to leave on the record the comments i made on the four amendments that he did not feel able to treat so favourably as the <e>", "<cs> perhaps a manuscript amendment could be included in order to correct theprinting error <e>", "<cs> i have heard the ministers reply <e> <s> i ask the leave of the minister and the committee to give further consideration to that reply <e> <s> on that basis i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i have said my piece <e> <s> nothing will be gained in the committee at this hour of the night by repeating the argument or taking up other points made <e>", "<cs> this is an interesting amendment which i believe is worthy of some further consideration by this committee <e> <s> i say that in relation not only to sros to which this amendment is directed but also in relation to recognised professional bodies <e> <s> rpbs <e> <s> to which the amendment is not directed <e> <s> the circumstancs in which either sros or rpbs need to act fearlessly and decisively concern actions which relate to their own membership <e> <s> they need to act fearlessly and decisively because of the need to protect investors <e> <s> by acting fearlessly and decisively they protect investors <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may reply immediately to the noble earl lord limerick <e> <s> the line that the noble lord lord benson and i are seeking in tabling this amendment is that contained in the provisions of this bill <e> <s> there are three administrators to use my own terminology for the enforcement of his bill <e> <s> those three adminstrators are treated differently <e> <s> all i am seeking is that in administering the many and diverse tasks that fall upon the sib the sros and the rpbs within the framework of this bill and within their responsibilities should be treated alike and should have the same level of immunity <e> <s> with respect to the noble earl i do not think we need to consider the wide range of statutory duties that fall on a conglomerate of organisations and bodies throughout the land <e> <s> we can i believe discipline ourselves to considering what is the position under this provision as presented to the committee <e>", "<cs> i would not dare <e> <s> the second reason i am disappointed that there were no speeches from the front bench of the noble lord lord williams is because when i was giving support to an amendment moved by the noble and learned lord lord silkin which i felt should be given consideration i suggested that this limit on immunity might be considered in relation to rpbs <e> <s> it would therefore have been helpful if we could have had some response on that point <e> <s> despite the absence of that support your lordships have made it plain that there is support for this amendment from all quarters of the committee <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful for the bouquet that the noble lord lord williams has extended to me even if it had one or two thorns in it <e> <s> i am also most grateful to the minister for the response he has made to my amendment <e> <s> on the basis that he has put the position of the government i am only too happy to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord replies perhaps i may say that as a lawyer listening to a noble lord who has considerable experience of the operation of the city i certainly shall not argue with him as to whether an ecu is not correctly described as a european unit of account <e> <s> however is there not a problem here <e> <s> if the act restricts <e>", "<cs> i am more than happy to withdraw it <e> <s> since this is the last time that i intend to intervene during this committee stage perhaps i may just ask one general question of the noble lord <e> <s> the bill as it will be presented to the house has been radically changed through the many amendments that have been moved thus far and there are further matters to be considered <e> <s> i think that it would greatly assist not only members of this committee but those outside the chamber who have been giving close scrutiny to this bill in a helpful manner if the noble lord could indicate when the bill will be reprinted so that the next stage of discussions can go forward <e> <s> the position is that we are coming up to the long recess i hope that it will be a long recess before our return and there will be an appreciable gap between the completion of this committee stage and report <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may echo those views <e> <s> i have spoken rather far from my amendment <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord lord taylor for his kind remarks about myself <e> <s> i played a very small role compared with the role that has been played by the noble lord lord williams and his colleagues on the labour bench and an even smaller role compared with that played by the noble and learned lord the lord advocate who regretfully is not here today by the noble lord lord brabazon and most significantly of all by the minister the noble lord lord lucas <e> <s> i join in all those compliments and i should be very grateful before this bill leaves committee if the noble lord the minister without rolling up his sleeves and going down to wapping to make personal undertakings about the printing presses will do what he can to see that we get an early reprinting of this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> in promoting and presenting to the house this private bill which has already been passed by the other place the promoters london regional transport seek authority for an extension of the docklands light railway from tower hill to the bank of

impatience <e> <s> therefore i think the most appropriate course for me to take is to suggest that we adopt the advice of the lord chairman and send this bill as swiftly as possible to the select committee <e>", "<cs> my lords as the member of your lordships house who moved in committee the amendment which attempted to deal with this problem i am very grateful both to the government and to other noble lords for paying so much attention to it on report because the one amendment in committee has now turned into four amendments on report <e> <s> perhaps that goes some way to explain the lengthening of our process in considering this bill <e>", "<cs> moved amendment no <e> <s> a <e>", "<cs> my lords in moving this amendment i was seeking to draw attention to the problem <e> <s>

therefore i hope that the minister will listen to their comments and will accept them as further emphasising the problem to which i sought to draw attention <e>", "<cs> my lords i was hoping that the minister would respond but if the minister does not intend to respond to the comments made both by me and other noble lords i do not beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords it is my turn to express my gratitude to the minister for dealing with this amendment which i moved in committee <e> <s> the minister and the government have not dealt with the matter in the same way but the amendment tackles the problem of overlap between those paragraphs <e> <s> i am therefore grateful to the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords sometimes noble lords say that they are grateful for an interruption when they are not grateful at all but i am truly grateful for this intervention by the noble lord lord bruce-gardyne <e> <s> the answer is that under clause of the bill the immunity given to an sro is only immunity against liability in damages <e> <s> there is no immunity under the bill for bringing proceedings against an sro for judicial review and i think there would be a great deal of concern in your lordships house if there were <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought someone was saying no to me but it is hear hear <e> <s> it is an important distinction to make to know ones supporters

renton for that reason and for that reason alone <e>", "<cs> my lords although the noble and learned lord the lord advocate stated that he was only responding to comments made in committee by his noble friend lord colville of culross in fact the noble and learned lord was also kindly responding to comments i made in committee in support of my amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i have the difficulty in the argument presented by the minister that these powers are sought for all domestic schemes and for all other overseas schemes <e> <s> it is a little difficult to understand why it

is not willing to agree it on acclamation <e> <s> unless any noble lord wishes to address the house further on this i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords unless any of your lordships wishes to address the house i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no intention of pressing this matter but i should like to give careful consideration before third reading to what the noble and learned lord the lord advocate has said <e> <s> on that basis i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords having heard the ministers reply i should like to reflect on it and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has brought forward an argument that he put in committee <e> <s> it is not an argument that i find a winning or acceptable one <e> <s> but in the circumstances that i have outlined to your lordships and in view of the lateness of the hour i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise only to express my gratitude <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord lord williams replies perhaps i may say a few words <e> <s> the noble lord lord lucas concluded with the words undesirable and unnecessary and that has caused me to come to my feet <e> <s> those of us who have witnessed the work of the takeover panel during the past years of its existence have seen on the whole a panel which served largely to the public good in its decisions <e> <s> but the scenario that we are now considering the scenario that the noble lord lord williams is inviting us to consider is that of a regulated city of london <e> <s> i would venture to suggest that the principal reason why the takeover panel has been so successful during the past years is that it has operated in an unregulated city of london with the consent and support of that city of london <e> <s> the days will now be different <e> <s> that is why i believe that the amendment of the noble lord lord williams is a sensible and desirable one <e> <s> it gives power if needed in a regulated city of london to put the takeover panel into a position of greater strength <e>", "<cs> my lords unless any other noble lords wish to speak it is my intention to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> i wanted further to press the matter because it is of concern outside your lordships house <e> <s> i therefore felt it right to bring the matter again to the attention of your lordships and the noble and learned lord the lord advocate <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps we may consider the following <e> <s> apart from the real difficulty that magistrates will have in understanding subsection and apart from the real difficulties that judges at crown courts will have in directing juries as to the meaning of subsection and quite apart from the sheer temptation that the noble lord lord morton of shuna offers us in the clarity of meaning of his amendment for reasons which have been advanced by the noble and learned lord lord edmund-davies and other noble lords there is a fundamental defect in subsection <e> <s> it is that if a person is being accused of creating a false and misleading impression as to the market in or price or value of an investment and is guilty of an offence the prosecution must prove that he acted dishonestly <e>", "<cs> my lords unless any noble lord wishes to speak i shall withdraw this amendment <e> <s> this is a difficult matter and i believe that it requires further attention but the noble and learned lord has spoken and i am content at this stage to leave it here <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to all noble lords who have participated in this debate <e> <s> it is clear that i have not persuaded the government to change their minds <e> <s> it is therefore my intention to test the opinion of the house and to call for a division <e> <s> since we are approaching the dinner hour and i do not want any noble lords who may wish to vote on this matter to be prevented from doing so i shall restrain myself while thanking every noble lord who has spoken in this debate and reply to one point made by the noble and learned lord lord cameron <e>

observe in rising to speak that some of us wonder what creature of statute we have now created we nonetheless wish this bill well and we hope that it may provide assistance to the city of london on

minister also accept that at present potential sros are not only formulating their rules but are accepting members into their company <e> <s> is this not the matter which directs itself to the problem of authorisation <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a third time <e>", "<cs> my lords absolutely the contrary if i may say so <e> <s> the canary wharf consortium is

successful <e> <s> it is a matter of commercial judgment not of blackmail <e>", "<cs> my lords before the right reverend prelate sits down perhaps he can help the house <e> <s> will the noble lord

able to make my intervention at an earlier stage in the proceedings <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a fairly obvious statement to present to your lordships that we live in changing times <e> <s>

protection lies in the longer development period that is now needed by pharmaceutical companies between the original filing of the patent and the time that they can market their product <e>", "<cs> may i briefly intervene <e> <s> to move away from pharmacists for a moment article of the ec directive specifically states that the joint and several liability provision should apply notwithstanding

the argument behind my amendment <e> <s> it does not go wider than local authorities and i should be grateful if the noble lord would acknowledge that point <e>", "<cs> i for one am very happy to leave rule xiv alone <e> <s> i greatly regret that the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey has again raised this matter in circumstances which do not fairly reflect upon his fellow noble lords in

endorse the views that have already been expressed and i hope the minister will accept this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord puts the question to the house as we are

considering the amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord byron has already received the well deserved <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not delay the house by debating further at this time with the noble lord <e> <s> if noble lords did not hear his comments they can read them in the pages of <e>", "<cs> i apologise to members of the committee for my premature intervention just now in the wrongful belief that the noble and learned lord lord ackner was moving his amendment and in the mistaken belief that the question had been put <e> <s> perhaps i may now tell noble lords and the noble and learned lord somewhat belatedly that his amendment certainly had my support as indeed does that put forward by the noble lord lord mishcon <e>", "<cs> notwithstanding the very careful advice that has been given to us by the two noble and learned lords who have spoken and not forgetting that when the noble and learned lord lord donaldson was the senior judge of the commercial court his court had the reputation of being the fastest court in the land i commend this amendment to the committee and ask for its support <e>", "<cs> before the noble and learned lord sits down can he help the committee in respect of the matter of appeal <e> <s> in its report the civil justice review was careful enough to record only views that had been expressed to it on the issue <e> <s> it recorded the fact that preference was expressed for a right of appeal to the county court in such cases <e> <s> however is there not a fundamental difficulty because the appeal system is not available in respect of the decisions of a public body such as a local authority or when a homeless person is trying to remedy a decision made by a public authority <e> <s> that is where <e>", "<cs> i had hoped before the noble lords lord renton and lord boardman spoke that the advice to the noble and learned lord from the committee would be unanimous in favour of accepting the amendment or the principle <e>", "<cs> that is right <e>", "<cs> in view of the representations made by the noble and learned lord i readily agree and beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> in view of my preference for the second of these two amendments the best course for me to take now is to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> i leave it to the noble lord lord mishcon to press the matter if he wishes to do so with amendment no

at this stage to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am very happy to join with the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor in what he has just said <e>", "<cs> through no fault of the noble lord lord rippon or myself the noble and learned lord has had a very short time in which to consider this amendment as part of the bill <e> <s> it was tabled only towards the end of last week <e> <s> not only is the noble <e>", "<cs> if the noble and learned lord will bear with me i will explain more of the reasons for the amendment <e> <s> at this stage what is being sought in this amendment is that the official referees court should be in a separate division within the high court of justice though the presiding judiciary of it will remain circuit judges <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may wind up the discussion on amendment no <e> <s> and say that in view of the helpful answers of the noble and learned lord and his expressed willingness to discuss both amendments nos <e> <s> and and in view of his further kindness he has much greater access to the usual channels than i do in offering to send an appropriate message down the usual channels i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i address this chamber i hope in the steps of the noble and learned lord the master of the rolls <e> <s> on second reading i tried to represent the position of my side of the profession on advocacy rules <e> <s> i said that the same set of rules should apply to all advocates who practise in the same courts <e> <s> i went further than that and i suggested that there should be common rules of advocacy for all who practise in any court of the land <e> <s> with great respect to the noble earl lord onslow certainly my side of the profession is not seeking to suggest that that rule <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether my thunder has been taken from me <e> <s> this amendment is tabled in my name also <e> <s> i rise at this time because i wish to address the committee on the proposal that there should be also included among the candidates for the advisory committee a legal executive appointed after consultation with the institute of legal executives <e>",

noble and learned lord for joining in my concern <e>", "<cs> though i have the voice of the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor and possibly that of the noble and learned lord the master of the rolls against me i rise with some concern <e> <s> the noble and learned lord said that there is no intention in this bill to deprive any person who has existing rights of audience <e> <s> i am very grateful to hear that <e> <s> the noble and learned lord then began to alarm me by saying in the first place that he identified the right of audience before a registrar in the county court as a discretionary right resting with the individual registrar <e> <s> therefore i understood him to say that as presently advised as regards this bill he has no intention to use section of the county courts act which would enable that right to be established under his authority <e>", "<cs> it is just a technical matter <e> <s> my argument is that in the way the bill is drafted certain existing rights available to the legal executive will not exist under the terms of this bill unless they are amended in the way i suggested to the committee <e> <s> as regards the future provisions i am urging on the committee no course other than that legal executives should obtain increased rights of audience under the mechanism of this bill if they so wish them <e>", "<cs> if i have done nothing else i have here identified a problem <e> <s> on the basis of the noble and learned lord expressing a willingness to consider the matter i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> although i have been responsible for the renewed discussions during the past minutes on the rights of audience issue i suggest to the committee that that has been thoroughly over-discussed in this chamber and it is not reflecting much credit on either side of the profession by the continuation of the discussion because the only consequence is a polarisation of views and the taking of extreme examples <e> <s> both branches of the legal profession understand its traditions and duties <e> <s> when members of my side of the legal profession make a decision as to whether to conduct advocacy themselves in courts in which they have an audience or whether they instruct counsel that is made responsibly according to what is in the best interests of the client and what is in the best interests of justice <e>", "<cs>

required to make any additional payment over the standard costs in the case of a conditional fee arrangement <e>", "<cs> unless other members of the committee wish to speak to my amendment i beg leave to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble and learned lord <e> <s> it fortifies the mainstream argument that lawyers in scotland england and in northern ireland should have similar rights of audience as a result of which these problems would not arise <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for his exposition <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to interrupt the committee after the noble and learned lord has spoken but i continue to have concern about the drafting of clause <e> <s> i heard exactly what the noble and learned lord said about not intending to extend immunities <e> <s> however if one applies that practically against a member of my side of the profession in the case of a failure to issue a writ within the limitation period or of conducting a litigation so slowly that it is struck out for want of prosecution within the wording of clause both of those instances would seem to apply <e> <s> that certainly extends the immunity <e>", "<cs> before we agree that clause stand part of the bill i wish to draw attention to a difficulty which faces equally barristers and solicitors who aspire to participate in multi-national practices <e> <s> the same difficulty would face barristers and solicitors who aspire to multi-disciplinary practices <e> <s> however it seems that there are not aspirations from either side of the profession to participate in multi-disciplinary practices <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble and learned lord for his explanation <e> <s> if the noble and learned lord the master of the rolls is kind enough to continue his statutory duties i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i do not think that the noble and learned lord the master of the rolls meets the whole problem <e> <s> there are extremely experienced solicitors who may have no wish to undertake the experience in litigation which would be required under the terms of clause of this act but who nonetheless have high expertise as lawyers high intelligence and high ability and who would be wholly fit for high court appointments <e> <s> as the noble and learned lord is aware while in many ways it may be a better route on to the bench for all persons to serve on the circuit bench before going on to the high court bench it has not been possible by setting up such a regime to attract the great talent that the high court bench requires <e>", "<cs> i believe that the amendments should be supported in principle <e> <s> a horrendous delay may equally be caused by a defendant in proceedings as by a claimant <e>", "<cs> before the noble and learned lord sits down will he be kind enough to consider the international implications <e> <s> practices in london often have to serve proceedings overseas <e> <s>

consideration of service in a number of countries in south america <e> <s> we were advised that in some of those countries it would take as long as months to serve the process <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may also support the noble lord lord hutchinson on this point <e> <s> indeed i have some side notes on my copy of the bill which read law society and bar council united house to be divided <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord said after interventions by the noble and learned lord the master of the rolls and i that he would have another look at the definition of court which is to be found at the bottom of page <e>", "<cs> my lords i too was part of the delegation that the noble and learned lord so courteously saw last week <e> <s> i hope that he will judge that my intervention in support of this amendment shows no lack of gratitude for first of all his courtesy in having such a full discussion with us and secondly his willingness to table his amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble and learned lord for his progress report <e> <s> in particular i was pleased to hear that he still has hope of bringing this matter before us at report <e> <s> we have

as soon as possible <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am a solicitor of the supreme court and like the noble lord

practised as a solicitor so far as i know i have never refused a client i rarely did that anyway i was always in need of them in any circumstances which have breached the cab rank rule <e> <s> i can tell your lordships that i have appeared in relation to some pretty unpopular causes on both sides of the legal profession <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed <e> <s> if the noble lord had allowed me to finish the sentence he would have heard me say that if that trust does not exist it would be proper for members of my side of the profession to refuse to act even as an advocate in litigation <e> <s>

audience <e> <s> indeed they do <e>", "<cs> my lords the reply of the noble and learned lord will be received with some disappointment <e> <s> as i had feared the noble and learned lord would be reluctant to appoint a legal executive to the advisory committee <e> <s> when i was emphasising the word consultation i intended to refer to the amendment <e> <s> i refer to the appointment to the committee of a legal executive but appointed not on the basis of nomination by the institute of legal executives but after consultation <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps at this late hour of the evening i might get away with a little heresy <e> <s> i have always found it very difficult to justify the immunity of advocates appearing in court <e> <s> i am fully aware of the arguments about the duty toward the court and the integrity of the judicial process but i have never conceived that when an advocate is grossly negligent in court that will either disturb the concept of duty to the court or invade the integrity of the judicial process <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble and learned lords the lord chancellor and the master of the rolls for giving their observations upon this issue <e> <s> this was a probing amendment and i am delighted to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the noble lord lord morris the amendment is tabled in my name also and in doing so i should like to widen our discussions and refer your lordships also to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> the last named amendments are grouped together on the list <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to differ from the noble lord lord renton but perhaps i may develop my arguments so that your lordships may see how amendment no <e> <s> fits the same problem on which i seek to address the house <e> <s> the amendment concerns the legal executives right of audience <e> <s> your lordships may recall from the committee stage that the discussion breaks down into two parts those amendments which are designed to preserve the current rights of audience of legal executives and the one amendment amendment no <e> <s> which seeks to set up a mechanism for obtaining modest extensions of the rights of legal executives under the umbrella of the law society <e> <s> in that sense it is separate from the earlier amendments <e> <s> however all the amendments are directed toward legal executives rights of audience <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to my feet to put in a marker <e> <s> i commented on the amendment when i spoke in support of amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> in my submission it does not deal with the situation that faces solicitors clerks for the reasons that i developed namely that they do not have a right of audience in chambers in the county court <e> <s> if the issue of whether solicitors clerks should appear in chambers before county court judges and county court registrars had come before mr justice cozens-hardy in i have no doubt that mr justice cozens-hardy would have pronounced the <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly do not intend to press the amendment <e> <s> however there is a practical problem that i have tried to explain to the house <e> <s> at the moment that practical problem is not resolved <e> <s> i have made the points that i felt should be made in support of the amendment <e> <s> i have heard the noble and learned lord <e> <s> i leave the position as it is at the moment <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords then i am very happy for the matter to rest in the hands of the noble and learned lord and his fellow judges

disappointed not <e>", "<cs> my lords i was among those who spoke fairly late in the evening on this clause at committee stage <e> <s> i urged on the noble and learned lord that though he may not have intended it the drafting of the clause appeared to extend immunity concerning advocates appearing in court <e> <s> it is therefore most heartening that the noble and learned lord who politely but totally and decisively demolised my arguments in his reply has reflected on the matter and has now brought forward this amendment <e> <s> since i expect him during report stage to totally demolish the arguments that i present i live in some hope that all is not lost and that perhaps new ground will be reached at third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords in committee i moved amendment no <e> <s> za <e> <s> that amendment might be described as a parallel amendment to the amendment that the noble lord lord renton has moved <e> <s> i therefore support the noble lords amendment for the reasons that he has given to the house and indeed the reasons that i gave to the committee in support of my amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords before the government front bench spokesman puts the motion for the proceedings on the bill to be adjourned perhaps i may briefly intervene <e> <s> there is a point that i wish to raise <e> <s> i have sent a note to the noble lord the leader of the house on the subject <e> <s>

report stage after the dinner break consider whether we shall be able to deal with all the remaining amendments this evening <e> <s> if it is thought that we shall not be able to do so perhaps we can agree to a suitable cut-off point <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord lord mishcon speaks to his amendment i should say that just before the house resumed i raised my concern about the amount

ability independence integrity sound judgment temperament and so forth <e> <s> the rights of audience qualification is i concede relevant for a judge conducting trials <e> <s> i wonder whether it is necessary to have a high court advocacy qualification and i wonder whether <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support the amendment because i am a solicitor in the supreme court and i wish the noble and learned lord to know that my side of the profession is highly supportive of the amendment <e> <s> i believe that i also speak for the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> furthermore i believe that the amendment is consistent with the white paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise in support of the amendment <e> <s> it may well be that this amendment as the mover accepts is imperfect in its drafting <e> <s> however its principle is quite plain <e> <s> it proposes to replace the rather archaic system of the order in council by the new regulatory system that is set out in the amendment <e> <s> on the basis of the principle that is sought to be achieved in this amendment i wholly support it <e> <s> it is unfortunate that we still have in our statutes arrangements for the admission of overseas lawyers which are partly based on reciprocity <e> <s> if a fair deal is being given to british solicitors in the country concerned we shall in turn give a fair deal to overseas lawyers coming to this country <e> <s> however if our solicitors are receiving an unfair deal abroad we shall not give overseas solicitors a fair deal here <e> <s> i suggest that idea is quite out of date and for that and other reasons i hope the noble and learned lord will accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords as can be seen from amendment no <e> <s> i am still unhappy about clause appearing in the bill <e> <s> i shall address the house in more detail about my concern when i move amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> in dealing with amendments nos <e> <s> and i should like to express gratitude to the noble and learned lord <e> <s> not only has he kindly written a letter to the noble lord lord mishcon and given me a copy in which he said that he would deal with the problems of the short time limits but he also said in that letter that he had in mind to deal with problems arising out of actions in rem and problems arising when there is a foreign element in that action <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord has as usual given a courteous and helpful reply <e> <s> i continue to have considerable misgivings about this change <e> <s> i do not believe that the benefits of the change in a wide range of
