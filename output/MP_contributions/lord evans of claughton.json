initiative of the right reverend prelate in putting down this motion for debate on a subject which to me and i am sure to most noble lords is one of transcendent importance in the present state of this country the present high level of unemployment particularly in urban areas that we are suffering at the moment and the feeling which the right reverend prelate mentioned of dissociation among so many young people <e>", "<cs> am i right in thinking that the noble baroness is suggesting that in addition to the amendment moved by the noble baroness we should take amendments nos <e> <s> to <e>

behalf of my noble friend lord beaumont of whitley who moved the amendment in committee on my behalf how warmly we welcome and thank the noble baroness for adding this provision <e> <s> this matter has in my experience caused anomalies in the past in some areas where the governing body was not permitted for one reason or another to choose its own chairman <e> <s> the position of the chairman is very important and he or she should have the support of the governing body and i therefore very much welcome the amendment from these benches <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to spend a long time <e>", "<cs> my lords i must declare an interest as a solicitor <e> <s> i must say with deep emotion how bitterly i oppose this amendment not for the reason that i am looking for additional work for solicitors <e> <s> it would be the kind of work that would be very unremunerative <e> <s> would a parent who was a legally qualified person be excluded from appealing <e> <s> but more seriously the concept that noble lords seem to have in their minds that the presence of lawyers would make the appeal more complex and more difficult is not so in my experience and i am sure a great many other peoples <e> <s> the worst complexity comes when people appear at tribunals who are not legally qualified the long and interminable debates among people who do not understand the procedures and the

should be done well <e> <s> this proposal improves <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may interrupt the noble baroness i certainly was not implying that <e> <s> i was saying that if one advances the argument as the noble baroness did that the parents who formerly sent their children to direct grant schools and who now send them to these schools would be creamed off as the most concerned parents then it should be remembered that parents in the private sector too of course are among the most concerned parents <e>", "<cs> my lords my purpose in putting down the amendment was to open a door to enable your lordships to realise that there is this lacuna or gap facing people who have left school and who want to return to secondary education <e> <s> the reply of the noble baroness was very helpful and most sympathetic <e> <s> i see that the door is open that the government are aware of the problem and are considering it <e> <s> the problem applies in particular to a group of people who are suffering in todays society people who through no fault of their own have missed the opportunities of secondary education <e> <s> i understand that the government appreciate the problem and are sympathetic towards it and i hope they will continue to explore it <e> <s> on that basis i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i very much regret that the minister has taken this view about the amendment <e> <s> it seems to me that what is happening is that in certain parts of the country being confronted as they are by this governments proposals for cutting back on public expenditure with cash limits and every kind of restraint that the government are imposing as a matter of policy on local authorities the local authorities are understandably trying to find means whereby they may continue to provide what is a very important service to elderly people without having to put an increased burden on the rate payers <e> <s> i think most of us who have the rate demand notices coming through our letter boxes at the moment are feeling this <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like warmly to commend the noble lord lord bellwin on the way <e>", "<cs> i regret that the explanation the noble lord lord beliwin has given does not and cannot satisfy the reservation that i enshrined in the amendments i put down because the fact of the matter is i am sure i would like to think i am sure that the problem we have in merseyside applies to leeds where the noble lord comes from <e> <s> we have at present very much a ghetto situation in parts of our council estates where very few houses have been sold under the present legislation <e> <s> i can see that the kind of gulf that exists between as it were the rougher council estates the ones with more social problems where the social workers are in and out every day and the plushier council estates would become under a right to sell an even greater gulf <e>", "<cs> i should like to make it clear from these benches that we in the liberal party are in favour of the concept of the right to buy a council house or indeed any house <e> <s> i mentioned in my speech on second reading that it is a great pity certainly in some respects that the right to buy that the government are enshrining in this proposed legislation is not also enshrined for tenants in the private sector <e> <s> i understand the reasons which the noble lord lord bellwin gave namely that this is an area which is owned by the public whereas the private sector is owned by definition by private landlords <e> <s> nevertheless i should have thought that some steps could be taken in the tenants charter to make some advance as regards the opportunity for private tenants to purchase their own houses <e>", "<cs> the noble lord said in his speech if i may paraphrase what he said i am a great believer in and have a fundamental belief in the automony of local government no one is going to gainsay that but because labour governments have eroded it

this amendment is a warm one <e> <s> however the basic point that i wish to make in recommending noble friends not to vote for this amendment has been made by the noble lord lord sandford when he drew attention to amendment no <e> <s> in the names of the noble baroness lady denington and the noble lord lord greenwood of rossendale followed by amendment no <e> <s> in my own name <e> <s> it appears to me that my amendment is exactly the same and i suspect we were getting advice from the same source <e> <s> i received my advice from the association of metropolitan authorities <e>", "<cs> i support very warmly the amendment moved by the noble baroness lady birk <e> <s> as she says it is going to affect a very small number of dwellings but perhaps that small number will play a very important part in the heritage of this country <e> <s> in my own particular experience and i am sure other noble lords will have had the same experience in birkenhead where i live we have the first park built by public subscription in the world <e> <s> it was built by sir william paxton and central park new york was based upon it <e> <s> sir william paxtons plans included the building of a number of lodges each of the lodges being of a different architectural design there is a norman lodge there is an italian lodge and so on <e> <s> but they are part of the local authoritys housing stock and they are usually occupied by members of the local authoritys staff working in the parks and gardens <e> <s> but they are buildings of exceptional beauty and attraction and are a very important integral part of what is still i think one of the most attractive parks in this country but little known because it is in a little known part of the country <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment moved by the noble baroness lady birk <e> <s> i have an amendment on the marshalled list on similar lines <e> <s> i think she expressed very well the problems and the difficulties <e> <s> we must bear in mind the fact that in the kind of areas to which this amendment <e>", "<cs> i entirely agree with the noble viscount <e> <s> in fact there would be provision by private housing associations for this kind of accommodation but in many areas housing associations do not operate <e> <s> it is only the local authority that makes housing available <e>", "<cs> i was very interested in the speech made by the noble lord lord monson and very grateful for the facts and figures he was kind enough to provide <e> <s> it seems to me that if the ground rent is merely a nominal recognition of the existence of a long lease between landlord and tenant one might as well make it a peppercorn which is the usual way of doing it if it is not going to be of real monetary value one might as well recognise that and call it a peppercorn <e> <s> secondly i would like to know this <e> <s> will the cost of servicing the block of flats what would be the service charge in a private block of flats go on the housing revenue account of the local authority <e> <s> because that would cause a lot of difficulty among local authorities facing increasing burdens on housing revenue account none of which they are recovering <e>", "<cs> whether it should be five or years is a matter of judgment <e> <s> normally in the local government sales that have taken place in the past there has been a five-years pre-emption <e> <s> i must say with respect to the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls that i do not think mobility of labour is a key feature of this amendment <e> <s> the freedom of people to move <e>", "<cs> possibly to comply with the suggestion made by the noble lord lord mowbray and stourton we should have tabled an amendment giving the figure of years <e> <s> the basic point that concerns me is that there is a generous discount which we debated on the amendment tabled by the noble lord lord monson <e> <s> it is a very generous discount that purchasers of council property are given <e> <s> we think it is over-generous and we have to compare that with the position of which i have quite a lot of experience of tenants in the private sector who have lived perhaps for or years in a privately-tenanted house which they have repaired and very often improved themselves and they say now we can afford to buy this house and one gets a survey for them <e> <s> the survey comes back and the valuation is x thousand vacant possession value <e> <s> the tenant then says it is not vacant possession value <e> <s> i am buying as the sitting tenant and the surveyors in my part of the world will always say that for a sitting tenant in a privately rented property the value to him or her is almost the same as vacant possession value <e> <s> the point i am making is that the tenant of a council house is getting a special benefit <e>", "<cs> may i say on behalf of my noble friends and myself how grateful we are to the noble lord and his noble friends for putting down this amendment and the other amendments to which he referred <e> <s> although it would not have been often used as a device because it is rather complex this might well have given people an opportunity to make very considerable speculative gains to which they were not entitled <e> <s> i am extremely grateful to the minister for the amendments that he has put down <e>", "<cs> with respect i did say in my introductory remarks which may not have been as clear as perhaps your lordships would have liked that i was not so concerned as to whether there was a contra-entry where the purchase was from a local authority because as the noble lord said no cash passes from one hand to the other which i mentioned <e> <s> what i am concerned about is to discover what happens to a tenant who purchases from a housing authority or some authority other than the local authority <e> <s> from what source will the money for that be made available <e> <s> is it going to be the housing corporation

have not yet been made <e> <s> i wanted to be sure that there would not be any obstacle to a person purchasing from other than a local authority <e> <s> i think that the assurance <e>", "<cs> i am grateful and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment in my name <e>", "<cs> i see this is again going back to the question <e>", "<cs> i accept the remarks made by the noble lord lord mowbray and stourton with regard to my first amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i agree that there probably needs to be some kind of sanction to ensure that a vendor carries out his commitment <e> <s> i accept that <e> <s> it had been my intention to say that i would then prefer that the second amendment no <e> <s> should be considered <e> <s> it is not quite that the noble lord has taken me unawares but he has put me in a position where i want to reconsider the position about injunctions and specific performance <e> <s> i must reiterate with all the force i can that specific performance if it could be applied if it may be applied in some other way to this bill would be a neater and a tidier and a less messy procedure and certainly one that would not have the emotional implications of the remedies for failure to obey an injunction <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord <e> <s> like him i hope this would never have to be used or very rarely used <e>", "<cs> i have much sympathy with the point put forward by the noble viscount lord gage and i had incorporated in a later amendment which i am happy to see has been overtaken by a government amendment a provision to extend opportunities for housing associations to build because i suspect that they are the <e>", "<cs> i hope that the government will be willing <e>", "<cs> i do not make any apology for sounding once again like a greek chorus in relation to these various amendments being moved concerning the erosion of the powers of local government but this seems to me to be a very serious example of the cavalier way in which in this bill the government are treating local authorities <e> <s> i feel very strongly that as the noble lord lord gifford and the noble baroness lady birk said the least that the government should do is to consult local authorities when they are about to deprive them of part of their resources <e> <s> it seems to me that the government should remember that on the very self-same day on which they got their alleged mandate for this enormous bill and the draconian measures that they have introduced local council elections were being held in which people were elected as councillors on an entirely different mandate <e> <s> they really should consider this very seriously and should <e>", "<cs> very briefly i hope to add my support to the <e>", "<cs> i understand even at this comparatively early hour i was going to say late hour what the minister is saying although it seems he has certain double standards because he was giving a quite different answer on the previous amendment to the noble baroness lady faith-full about temporary housing accommodation in areas pending rehabilitation <e> <s> apparently he is not prepared to look in the same way in relation to student accommodation <e> <s> i was seeking to define more tightly what a hall of residence or student accommodation was <e> <s> i shall read at leisure what the noble lord said to see if i understood it and perhaps more important to see whether brighter minds than mine including the national union of students understood <e> <s> meanwhile i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am not as sanguine as the noble lord lord bellwin about paragraph on page though i am somewhat reassured by it <e> <s> i only hope that in fact it works in the way that he suggests because i feel very strongly that we must do all we can to <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the consideration given <e> <s> my basic concern is that bureaucratic convenience is coming before the basic rights of tenants <e> <s> it seems to me that if you are being done as they would say for arrears of rent you may suddenly find because perhaps you have set up a disorderly house in order to pay the rent that you are being got at on an entirely different ground of nuisance which is perhaps what is in the noble lords mind <e> <s> i should have thought that it would have been fairer to have worded it in the way that my noble friend suggests but in view of the fact that the noble lord has said that he will consider this because i think there are real points about the liberty of the individual and the liberty and rights of the disadvantaged small man against the big authorities to which i hope he will give some serious consideration i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i accept the position that the noble lord takes <e> <s> i feel extremely strongly and very deeply about this problem <e> <s> however in the circumstances i shall beg leave to withdraw the amendment at this stage but with the proviso that unless i can be very much more satisfied than i am now i shall certainly raise it at a later stage <e>", "<cs> i am rendered completely speechless <e> <s> i hope the noble lord will address us more often <e> <s> i thank him <e>", "<cs> there is a world of difference between tenants in the private and the public sector <e> <s> the tenant in the public sector can go to his councillor and complain about the quality of the amenities that he enjoys or fails to enjoy <e> <s> the private tenant has the security of tenure <e> <s> the shorthold tenant does not have security of tenure except for the limited period from one year to five years and he or she therefore might perhaps not feel quite the same courage about challenging his or her landlord as regards the quality of the tenancys amenities <e> <s> therefore there is in my opinion a considerable difference between the level of competition as it were that the tenant enjoys in relation to his landlord in a shorthold tenancy as against that which he would enjoy in a public or private tenancy <e> <s> therefore i think that the tenant of a shorthold tenancy is much less protected as regards the rights that he enjoys than is a tenant in the private or public sector <e> <s> that is the reason why i moved the amendment and i think it makes it a different proposition from that which the noble lord put before your lordships <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord will appreciate and as i am sure his noble friends will also appreciate many of us have considerable reservations about the whole concept of shortholds <e> <s> some of us think they might conceivably be worth experimenting with if there were adequate safeguards for the tenants and this is one of the safeguards that i thought might be an example of the kind of safeguards we are looking for <e> <s> the government have said that shortholds will make tenancies available say to young married couples starting out on the great journey of life <e> <s> i would have thought that young couples perhaps with a child would want a fixed bath or shower a hand washbasin and a water closet in their premises <e> <s> i would have thought therefore that because of the exposure that the shorthold tenant is in in relation to his landlord these were the kinds of protection these and many others that your lordships should be willing to impose on a landlord who is in a very advantageous position in relation to his tenants <e>", "<cs> i am delighted to be associated with the amendment moved by the noble baroness <e> <s> i said in the second reading debate and i say it again that the vast majority of landlords are good landlords i do not dispute that for one second <e> <s> as a solicitor i act for very many good landlords <e> <s> but the point of laws is not to protect us against the good but to protect us against the evil <e>", "<cs> i had not realised the extent of the problems that would arise when i moved the amendment <e> <s> from the housing administration point of view the point of view on which i am perhaps more expert than i am on the constitutional point i am not happy with the proposal to allow the secretary of state to make these orders <e> <s> however in the light of what the minister said and the helpful remarks made by noble lords in all parts of the committee about this and the undertaking the minister has given to have another look at it bearing in mind that i can always return with an amendment on report if i am not satisfied i will withdraw the amendment <e> <s> i had not realised that i said the secretary of state was taking cavalier powers to himself but on listening to my noble friend lord foot i realise how apposite those words were particularly bearing in mind the distinguished father he had who was a great expert on keeping cavaliers in their place <e> <s> on those terms i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> t have given considerable thought to the question of shorthold tenancies and believe that many of us in all parties will probably want to praise sir brandon rhys williams most warmly for the initiative that he took in the other place in introducing in season and out of season proposed legislation for the introduction of shortholds <e> <s> perhaps he was unduly idealistic in his belief that the proposal <e>", "<cs> i shall have to think more about this matter and take more advice <e> <s> the noble lord lord strabolgi has shot my fox a little in that he brought up the precise points i was going to mention and it is absolutely right that there are large areas here where there is uncertainty <e> <s> i thought that this additional paragraph would make an area which is admittedly in the mind of barristers and solicitors an uncertain area into a certain area <e> <s> i should have thought that for the protection of themselves and their shorthold legislation the government might have welcomed this <e> <s> i take the point made by the noble lord lord sandford <e> <s> with no disrespect to him the kind of problems which i envisage as a vice-president of the ama are probably more likely to crop up in metropolitan areas than in the areas of the adc <e> <s> what i will do with some reluctance and a considerable amount of reservation is to withdraw the amendment at this point but i am going to consider it again and i may well come back to your lordships house with it again <e>", "<cs> i merely wish to say that the reason why i did not move amendment no <e> <s> was that i thought first that the amendment to be moved by the noble lord lord hylton was worded slightly better than mine and secondly that he would explain it very much better than i could <e> <s> i want to say that i agree with everything he has said working from the same basis as that from which he works from a housing association basis because housing associations do as the noble lord said feel concerned about this and are looking for reassurances <e>", "<cs> i take the point that the noble lord lord gifford has made it is a very good point <e> <s> the noble lord lord bellwin made the same point it may well be that in the case of re-registrations the position is in order <e> <s> so far as first registrations are concerned the position from my point of view and that of a great number of people who have spoken to me about it is most unsatisfactory <e> <s> the remedy that the noble lord lord goodman suggests may well be the remedy but we have not an amendment to that effect before us <e> <s> no doubt it is a matter which the noble lord the minister would consider <e>", "<cs> i am willing on the whole to accept that <e> <s> it seems to me that when we get to the report stage there may be hundreds of divisions but i hope it will not come to that <e> <s> i thank the noble lord for what he has said and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> if i may very briefly speak in warm support of lord goodmans proposal i would say as other noble lords have said that very many of the landlords involved are small landlords owning two or three houses elderly people themselves with problems of their own <e> <s> but what we must not forget and this has not been mentioned yet in the discussion is that almost by definition the houses under this kind of control are houses that were built many years ago they were houses built at a very low price by todays standards perhaps an average cost of <e> <s> even if the landlord today is not getting the kind of return that will enable him to spend his holidays in the south of france he really has had either directly or indirectly his money back on the original investment <e> <s> it is only latterly that the cost of repair and so on has cost him money and there are provisions for increases for the cost of repair <e> <s> so we should not forget that we are dealing with houses that are fairly old houses that were erected at low cost in most cases and we are dealing with a position that is not quite as heartrending as the noble lord lord bellwin made it out to be from the landlords point of view <e>", "<cs> your lordships will be delighted to hear that i do not wish to go into further details on the various points <e> <s> i anticipate it would be the case that in the circumstances outlined in the paragraphs to which i have referred if the tenant had to leave in less than a year the local authority would be required under the homeless persons act to rehouse him in any event <e> <s> as i said i feel that the government are <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful indeed to the noble lord for this full reply and i have great pleasure in withdrawing the amendment on the terms which he suggests <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that the noble lord lord goodman is not in his place because he tells us that he was the father of the rent officers <e> <s> i take the point the noble lord lord bellwin has made <e> <s> i should have thought as i said that this was an ingenious and useful additional clause hut since the government do not want the advantage of useful additional clauses in sorrow rather than in anger i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> looking at my brief i see that it says government lawyers take the view that the requirement that tenants should pay the landlords costs is clearly a premium within the definition <e> <s> if the government spokesman can state this categorically i do not think we need press our points <e> <s> i think the government spokesman has stated this reasonably categorically and therefore i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> since i understand we are also considering amendment no <e> <s> i should like to support what the noble baroness lady faithfull has said <e> <s> i have been involved over the years in the abbeyfield societies and it seems that this clause proposes that the grant redemption fund is based on the calculation of rental income obtained from hostels <e> <s> at the present time hostels only have to identify the rental income proportion of the charge they make to residents at the time they apply for the grant <e> <s> it seems that under this proposal this calculation will have to be made very frequently and would involve owners of hostels such as abbeyfield in making a fairly complex calculation to divide the rental income from the proportion of the charge that is made for lighting the proportion that is for heating for services and for full or partial board which many hostels of this kind offer <e>", "<cs> i very much support and admire if that is the right word the noble lord lord strabolgi for putting down these amendments <e> <s> the service charges problem is mainly a problem in inner london as i understand it <e> <s> in spite of many attempts it has not been possible to cure it by legislation up to now <e> <s> i think that a number of conservative members of the other place have tried in various amendments that have been moved in the passage of the bill there to deal with the problem in an effective watertight way <e> <s> i think that on the admission of practically everyone who has been involved it has evaded the best attempts of the amateur draftsmen <e> <s> one would hope that the attempt made by the noble lord lord strabolgi will encourage the government draftsmen to try again to create legislation which will prevent the taking of advantage of people through the imposition of service charges which is becoming a very serious problem as i am advised in the inner london area and some other areas but not on a national basis <e>", "<cs> i think the amendment moved by the noble lord lord davies of leek is along the right lines <e> <s> i must declare my position as one of principle that i am opposed except in exceptional circumstances to the maintenance of the concept of long leases of residential property <e> <s> i should like to see them subject to compensation of course converted into freeholds <e> <s> under the legislation copyholds disappeared much to the joy of copyholders and indeed of lawyers who had to try to understand them <e> <s> i should have thought that with a bit of real will on the part of a government and this government seem to have a great will to introduce the right to buy this would be an opportune moment to consider the abolition of long leases of residential property <e> <s> i agree that there are specialist areas flats business premises and so on which are different but i think the concept of leasehold tenure with long leases of residential property is wrong in principle and therefore anything which increases the rights of the tenants to enfranchise i would support <e>", "<cs> i had no intention of dying in the last ditch in support of this particular amendment <e> <s> i think the two-stage device to which the noble lord has referred is not as widely known as it might be and if the existence of that device is better known as a result of this debate and people in fact take advantage of it it will be a good thing <e> <s> they do not do so now <e>", "<cs> there is a philosophical difference between the noble lord the minister and myself about these matters <e> <s> i have a very deeply-felt fundamental belief that it is totally inappropriate that long leases of residential property such as this should be able to produce a profit for a second and perhaps a third time to the feudal landlord which is pretty well what he is <e>", "<cs> indeed <e> <s> i am very glad the noble lord lord monson said that <e> <s> the bp pension fund is one that comes to mind <e> <s> i do not want to repeat the problems that they had in another place but they have been very much criticised for their attitudes to their lessees <e> <s> they say quite rightly <e>", "<cs> the provision as i put it in the amendment would have improved in my opinion the position of the tenant at the end of the term or the successor or the family <e>", "<cs> there is no question that this is a difficult amendment <e> <s> it involves two separate matters of principle and also the possibility of a very large number of interests <e> <s> what i am trying to do is to attack the weakness of the act of separate valuations of each superior landlord <e> <s> i could summarise the purposes of the amendment as follows <e> <s> it seeks to abolish the scheme of separate valuation and replace it with a system under which all tenants enfranchising their leases have the price fixed on the same basis and where there are superior interests that price would be divided between the holders of those various superior interests <e>", "<cs> i am perfectly happy <e> <s> it is very good of your lordships to be so kind to me but i am perfectly happy that the noble lord lord sandford should speak now <e>", "<cs> am grateful to my noble friend lord airedale and others who have been so helpful in this matter <e> <s> the position here as the noble lord lord sandford said is that one is seeking to change standards which with the different expectations that people now have have become totally outdated since <e> <s> we thought that this might be a convenient time to do this and i gather that attempts were made in another place

has said and in the light of our freedom if we wish to take some action at report i beg leave to withdraw the amendment standing in my name <e>", "<cs> my lords first may i say that i very warmly welcome the amendment which has been moved by the noble baroness <e> <s> it is well thought out and it is moderate and permissive <e> <s> it is also very tightly drawn and would set very clear

commended to us amendment no <e> <s> which we shall debate later <e> <s> i do not wish to rehearse those arguments now but my complaint against that amendment is not the right of pre-emption which the noble lord mentioned but the wording to which the noble baroness has referred your lordships substantially different from those of an ordinary dwelling-house which on a fairly objective assessment by the ama and other authorities is very difficult to define <e> <s> my own amendment sought to retain the right of pre-emption <e> <s> as i said during the committee stage i think that it is a pity that

appropriate columns in the <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say that the normal standards of politeness in your lordships house to which i have become accustomed are being strained in the extreme by the mover of this amendment <e> <s> i must declare an interest my lords i am a solicitor <e> <s> i should like to suggest to the noble lord that possibly we should also limit some of the monopolies which the accountancy profession enjoys <e> <s> i do not think that this is either the time or the occasion to discuss the monopoly which the legal profession enjoys in the conveyancing field <e> <s> it should surely be a matter for further legislation if necessary after consideration of the royal commissions report and i would remind your lordships that the royal commission no doubt the noble lord lord bruce would say whitewashed the legal profession but those of us who are lawyers thought they gave a very fair and reasoned report on the way in which the legal profession exercises its conveyancing monopoly and the not unduly expensive means that is employed to do this <e> <s> but may i point out that the legal profession and the provincial branches have agreed extra-statutory scales of remuneration for acting in this kind of transaction which as your lordships will realise is often cheaper and less onerous because of the nature of the way in which the title has been prepared by the local authority and there is a very generously calculated extra-statutory scale of charges agreed between the local authorities and the local law societies <e> <s> that is the first point <e>", "<cs> my lords with consent and in view of the noble lord lord mowbray and stourton suggesting that the grounds will be humanely interpreted and in spite of the invitation of the noble lord lord teviot to go on forever <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble baroness lady birk has said at the committee stage an amendment was put down in the names of the noble baroness lady faithfull and myself <e> <s> we did not move it on that occasion because of the amendment standing in the name of the noble lord lord goodman who wanted to exclude altogether the proposals for converting these tenancies into regulated tenancies which we had hoped might meet with the approbation of your lordships <e> <s> unfortunately that was not the case <e> <s> as the noble baroness said in all justice an assurance should be given that the tenants who are now generally speaking elderly will not have to suffer extremely bad household conditions <e> <s> these were understandable when the landlord was receiving only a very small rent <e> <s> it is right that an assurance should be given that now that these tenants will have to expect a fairly extensive boost in their rent they will not have to suffer considerably inadequate conditions <e>", "<cs> my lords i concede what the noble minister said that it may be a clumsy way of dealing with the matter but i think the noble lord ought to concede from experience and his own evidence in his department certainly this is so from my own personal experience as a lawyer that this is a device which is used from time to time by people who want to avoid the rent acts <e> <s> i suspect it will go on being used in spite of the proposals for shorthold perhaps because many people may not think the shorthold will last very long in view of what has been said in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for the trouble he and those advising him have taken to deal with what is a very complex matter indeed <e> <s> the law society say that although he has approached it in a different way from them he has come to the same answer possibly a better answer in the end and i know that the law society is very pleased <e> <s> i believe this will be helpful in a broad sense and i am delighted the government have taken this step <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so very briefly i think that once again this is an amendment about which the noble lords department has been in consultation with the law society and i have a postscript to a letter concerning the previous amendment that the noble lord lord bellwin dealt with saying <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for the amendment having been put down rather late <e> <s> it should have been put down in committee <e> <s> the fact is that in another place they thought that the amendment was appropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise that i was not in my place when the amendment was called but under the temporary arrangements it takes some time to get back to this chamber after a division <e> <s> it seems to me and to my noble friends and indeed to the association of metropolitan authorities that local authorities will have a considerable additional administrative expense in converting the existing procedures relating to service charges to those laid down in the bill <e> <s> it seems to those advising me that service charges should be arranged so that they can apply to more than one block and that is why the amendment has been moved <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the noble lord the minister appreciates that i am not trying to create difficulties i am trying to simplify matters for the future <e> <s> i am advised by the association of metropolitan authorities in this matter which suggests to me that the lines between the noble lord the minister and the ama are possibly not as clear as the noble lord thought they might be <e> <s> because they say in the last paragraph of their briefing note to me <e>", "<cs> my lords with the consent of the house i beg leave to withdraw the amendment on the understanding that the government are keeping in constant touch with the association of metropolitan authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i warmly support the amendment which has been moved by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend responds to the invitation made by the noble lord the minister may i say as a solicitor myself and as a member of a profession that uses these kinds of devices that the kind of thing which enrages me with great respect is that time and again loopholes are left which members of my profession use quite outrageously while talking about the descendants of king george v or king george vi <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say i am somewhat disappointed by the view the noble lord the minister has taken here <e> <s> as one who is very much involved in the purchase and sale of blocks of flats i find it is becoming common practice in the private sector for a landlord or a builder to build a block of flats to give to the flat purchasers leases of years and then at the end when all the leases have been granted to sell the free <e>",

newspapers perhaps those circulating more in the north of england than <e>", "<cs> my lords as one who wishes the shorthold concept goodwill and a fair wind in principle as i have said earlier in the discussions on this bill i do hope that the government will accept this amendment <e> <s> from my experience both as a lawyer and as a councillor this was the kind of loophole which was used by irresponsible and ruthless landlords under previous legislation when attempts were made to persuade fairly innocent tenants to move around and lose the protection they thought they had <e> <s> i fear there is always such an element as i feel sure your lordships on all sides will agree <e> <s> i must say again that most landlords are perfectly reasonable rational fair-minded people but there is a tiny minority of bad landlords and one passes laws to protect the public against the bad and not against the good <e>", "<cs> my lords may i speak very briefly on this amendment <e> <s> i repeat that i want short-holds to be a successful experiment <e> <s> the problem in the private rented sector is in trying to strike a balance between the advantages to the landlord and the advantages to the tenant <e> <s> from my experience i suspect that under the old rent acts the balance in regard to statutory tenancies and tenancies during the inter-war years was very much in favour of the tenant <e> <s> we have heard of and read many stories about the difficulties of landlords not only in regard to making a living from the rents that they receive but also in losing a considerable amount of money <e> <s> obviously in that respect the balance was too much on the tenants side <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not at all happy about this position <e> <s> with great respect it is all very well for the noble lord to say that this does not apply to other lettings outside the rent acts the unprotected lettings <e> <s> i concede that it does not <e> <s> but i happen to be dealing in this amendment with shorthold tenancies and not with the other types of tenancies <e> <s> had i been here at the time they were dealt with no doubt i would have been moving similar amendments possibly with greater success and support from the government benches than i am receiving now <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly would not seek to divide the house on this as the noble lord the minister said technical point <e> <s> but it can be quite important <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say very briefly that i support the amendment proposed by the noble viscount lord hanworth even though as he says that if this amendment is not passed the situation will be a lawyers paradise from the point of view of self-interest i should oppose it <e> <s> i would have <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join in the words of congratulations personally made to the noble lord the minister for the way he has conducted the bill through your lordships house and indeed for the very remarkable support and considerable devotion which his noble friend lord mowbray and stourton has given to him during the passage of the bill <e> <s> i probably ought to congratulate the noble lord lord belstead most of all because he was the noble lord who accepted one of my amendments as drawn <e> <s> my liberal colleagues on leeds city council used to tell me that lord bellwin when he was a mere councillor as leader of the conservatives there was very helpful and cooperative <e> <s> now i would not go quite that far but i think he is well on the way to being helpful and co-operative and with a few more bills of this nature he might become really helpful and cooperative <e>", "<cs> i strongly support the amendment from these benches and confess that i only wish i had thought of it myself because i have been a member of a police authority for many years and what has been said so far on behalf of the amendment is absolutely correct <e> <s> it is difficult now to get people who seek prestige without power to serve on a police authority because as a body it is virtually toothless it cannot even choose assistant chief constables deputy chief constables or chief constables from an approved list drawn up by the home office <e> <s> it can do virtually nothing <e> <s> we in the merseyside area have had a lengthy debate about the purposelessness of a police authority which has such extremely limited powers and therefore if the amendment could do something to return some powers not <e>", "<cs> i welcome the amendment moved by the noble viscount <e> <s> i think that generally most local authorities probably already provide a fair amount of information voluntarily <e> <s> there are local authorities which are obscurantist and do not do so and for that reason mainly i welcome from these benches the concept of the publication of information by local authorities <e> <s> however what worries me is the public being inundated with almost continual reports and indications of what the local authority is doing when they do not want that kind of information <e> <s> i have a letter from the wye forest district council in the midlands in which they say <e>", "<cs> may i add my support to the amendment moved by the noble baroness and so well supported by the noble baroness lady denington <e> <s> in fact i had thought to put my name down to this amendment but by the time i got round to doing it there were already four names on it so i want to stake out my claim to being a supporter of this amendment <e>", "<cs> i hope that your lordships will accept this amendment <e> <s> as the noble baroness lady fisher of rednal said it is merely bringing up to date the position brought about by inflation since <e> <s> if the government in another place at report stage were talking about which was the figure suggested in it seems to me reasonable that now would not be out of the way to cover the increase in the cost of living since then <e>", "<cs> may i say in spite of the lateness of the amendment which is unavoidable as i understand it that i do support it very much on two separate but overlapping grounds <e> <s> one is the point that the noble lord lord davies of leek made the importance of continuing apprenticeships and creating skilled craftsmen <e> <s> in my part of the world in the north of england one of the great problems related to the high unemployment we suffer is the very high incidence of unskilled labour <e> <s> many of the private sector organisations for one reason or another presumably because of the difficulties they are suffering during the recession are taking on fewer and fewer apprentices <e> <s> in local government generally i suppose again this is what we are finding in merseyside and i am sure it is true of other parts of the country with the cuts the government are imposing and which local authorities are having to make there is a problem about taking on employees <e> <s> that is one point and i think every encouragement must continue to be given in the public sector because of the difficulties the private sector is suffering to create a skilled workforce <e>", "<cs> having been given an invitation to express a liberal view unless the noble lord lord mishcon thought i had already expressed it-i shall now come to my feet and thank the noble lord lord renton for giving way because he has been trying to finish a speech which i think he is half-way through <e> <s> it is a genuine pleasure to speak in a debate initiated not by my noble friend but by my old friend lord sefton of garston <e> <s> if you had been sitting opposite him for many years in local government as i was you would know that he can be much more fierce than he has been in your lordships committee today <e>", "<cs> i also should like to give a general welcome to this clause <e> <s> whatever it does to encourage people to become councillors by financial inducement if you like will of course never but i suppose legislation can never make up for the difficulty that many people find in standing for local authorities <e> <s> however much lip service may be paid by employers in whatever sector to the fact that it makes no difference to the promotion opportunities of their employees it is a fact that many people are put off not by the lack of financial inducement and in the years i have been a councillor were unpaid and really the payment did not make much difference to me and to a lot of other people the difference is made by the knowledge that if you are a councillor and the boss wants you in his office and they say i am sorry he is at the allotments and smallholdings committee a mental note is made by the employer that chap should not be promoted <e>", "<cs> i too support the amendment <e> <s> i am sure the noble lord lord sandford would assure us that he is not thinking of the kind of occasion which occurs in local government from time to time where people claim an attendance allowance and a subsistence allowance and any other allowances that may be going for attending the mayors ball <e> <s> so long as it is in respect of a serious event i am sure the amendment would be a useful acquisition <e>", "<cs> i generally welcome the introduction of special responsibility allowances for members although i have some reservations <e> <s> i am aware that it was recommended by the robinson committee but not immediately approved by the local authority associations generally <e> <s> it does have the problem which i do not think we can afford to neglect of having two levels of councillor <e> <s> i should be very much concerned if any encouragement were given to the development which i find dreary and reprehensible of the party in control taking all the places on the policy and resources committee and having just their chairmen with no opposition members being able to take part in the discussions of the policy and resources committee <e> <s> i find that very dreary and undemocratic and generally the kind of dispensation that makes local authorities unpopular with the public at large <e> <s> i should be very unhappy indeed if it were to encourage the development of two levels of councillor the salaried special responsibility councillor and the ordinary poor old back-bencher <e> <s> so i have certain reservations about that <e>", "<cs> i support all that the noble lord has said and if i may say so he said it extremely well and succinctly and has left little to say <e> <s> all of us have reservations about the rating system which is regressive and which discourages improvement to housing and so on but because of amendments made in various pieces of legislation it is much less regressive and unfair now than it was some years ago <e> <s> but the great point about the rating system however imperfect it is is that it is a means of raising locally money which the local authorities can use as they wish and which is not dependent on central government <e> <s> we know that the conservative party have given an undertaking to abolish the rating system <e> <s> i say that because i am a keen conservative party conference watcher although they are not of the same fascination as labour conferences <e>

this debate <e> <s> it might actually help some of us who will be speaking on this side to cut down the length of our own speeches because it was so compendious and said so much that is absolutely right <e> <s> i do not think any of us would want to leave this debate thinking that all is absolutely well in the field of local government and the level of spending <e> <s> there is overspending there is waste <e> <s> i think we all know and can think of examples even in our own authorities where there is overspending and waste <e> <s> some authorities have a more responsible attitude to the ratepayers than others <e> <s> but i suspect that the method which the secretary of state has adopted to try to deal with what are a very small minority is really quite outrageous and contrary to the whole basis of democratic local government <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the generally sympathetic way in which the proposals have been received <e> <s> i would not try to pretent to your lordships otherwise i might get a reputation that i could not keep up with that this is entirely the work of my brain <e> <s> it is the work of the outer circle policy group who have been very helpful and

scotland <e>", "<cs> nor amendment no <e> <s> a <e>", "<cs> i should like to say how much i support this amendment <e> <s> i have had conversations with the bodies to which the noble baroness referred

councils <e> <s> that is slightly outside this brief but we should be encouraging them <e> <s> if central government have a role in local government i have said some very nasty things about the <e>",

the concession that had been talked about as having been made in smoke-filled rooms at the conservative party conference but i will not suggest that because it would spoil what is a very amicable evening <e> <s> i could not help wondering that because it seems from the way it is drafted to leave the matter very open-ended indeed <e> <s> i therefore prefer the restrictive nature of amendment no

up to do with historical pre-reorganisation matters <e> <s> i do not need to go into that now <e> <s> we have agreed a three-year programme looking ahead with the full approbation of the department

dereliction <e> <s> i am glad to hear that <e> <s> that was something i had not realised frankly <e>", "<cs> i am sure that <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord replies i should like to say that local authorities who have spoken to me about this matter have all unanimously and with great fervour said that to make any sensible decisions about budgeting and capital expenditure they must know if not by st november certainly by st december <e> <s> i hope that the minister will bear that in mind <e> <s> it is a universal view <e> <s> he must know himself probably better than most of us do that if they do not know by that kind of time local authorities will be in an appallingly difficult situation <e>", "<cs> i would with great pleasure <e> <s> the noble lord says that it is a very rare occurrence <e> <s> i can tell him that it happens in the armley district of leeds and in places like liverpool too <e> <s> however i am willing to do as he suggests <e> <s> i look forward to hearing from him <e>", "<cs> i rise to give general support to the concept put forward by the noble lord lord wallace of coslany <e> <s> having been a county borough councillor for a fair number of years i appreciate in the fullest sense the advantages that that <e>", "<cs> this is a terrible and bloody struggle to the death between the district councils and the county councils part of the struggle which is centred on clause <e> <s> being a county council man i take the same view as the noble viscount lord ridley <e> <s> i think that clause is a totally bad clause and that this amendment makes it a bit worse <e> <s> i therefore oppose it as the noble viscount does <e>", "<cs> one is presented here with a sort of escalating tariff of choices <e> <s> lord sandfords amendment would emasculate viscount ridleys amendment which is modest enough as it is <e> <s> in the first place i would with great respect as we say when we do not mean that at all recommend your lordships committee to reject lord sandfords amendment <e> <s> so far as the noble viscounts amendment is concerned it is a modest change in requiring that consultations should take place by the district with the counties on these matters set out in the amendment <e>", "<cs> would it not be the case if the legislation goes through as drafted without taking into account the amendment put down by the noble lord lord mottistone that administratively each district authority over the country as a whole would have to take on an average of three more <e>", "<cs> until about five minutes ago i had intended to divide your lordships committee but in view of what the noble lord the minister has said and in view of the feeling which has been widely expressed on all sides of the committee i think that the right way to approach this would be to invite the noble lord the minister to bring forward an amendment which your lordships could consider to protect the views that are widely held in the house about this area <e> <s> if the government do not bring forward such an amendment i shall reserve my right to do so at report <e> <s> on that basis i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i shall be very brief <e> <s> i did not speak during the main debate at all <e> <s> the minister has said that it is only million but what he has forgotten is that in the very recent past and i should i suppose declare an interest because i am a lawyer and am apparently going to gain out of this a developer has been confronted with in addition to the matters that the minister has mentioned a payment for byelaw consent a payment for section consents under the highways act and additional payments for gas connections <e> <s> any developer is now faced with considerable additional cost not just with this little planning charge that the minister seems to dismiss <e> <s> there is in this bill and in the conduct of recent legislation a disincentive to development <e>", "<cs> the noble lord the minister has dealt only with the first amendment <e> <s> since the minister seems keen to expedite the proceedings of this committee i moved the three amendments together and the first is the one which gives me least concern <e> <s> it is the second and the third nos <e> <s> and which i am more concerned about <e>", "<cs> may i say how delighted i am to be associated with the amendment put down by the noble lord lord duncan-sandys <e> <s> his record in the field of conservation needs no praise from me it is apparent to everyone who is the least bit concerned about this matter <e> <s> when the legislation was originally put forward i had thought that this omission was a mistake on the part of the drafters of the bill <e> <s> then i received a letter from the law society telling me as a member that i ought to oppose the amendment that i had already put my name down to support on the grounds that local shopkeepers should be given the opportunity before a public inquiry of making their feelings felt about advertising in conservation areas <e>", "<cs> the noble lord <e> <s> lord mishcon expresses my own views about discussing clauses of this importance at this time of night <e> <s> the fault lies with the managers of the governments programme in setting aside what is a comparatively short time for an enormously compendious bill which some people say is or bills <e> <s> it is certainly a large number of bills all rolled into one <e> <s> the committee is being asked to make very important decisions which will have lasting significance at an hour in the night when even with the greatest goodwill we must be finding our judgment possibly a little warped <e>", "<cs> i would not think of following the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones too far down the road of hybridity what solicitor would dare do that to a senior member of the profession <e> <s> but i had understood that the broad wording of clause in the bill as originally drawn was to avoid this danger <e> <s> i read about this in the debates in another place and i had understood from articles in learned journals that this was the reason for the broad wording <e> <s> it seems to me that the government are in the difficult position of being between the devil and the deep blue <e>", "<cs> if i may refer to something which is in a sense even more dramatic than the reference the noble lord lord mishcon has made page paragraph is headed at line with the rather sinister words displacement of persons <e> <s> i should have thought that if anything was an example of the invasion of private persons rights the right to displace tenants who are protected until the property is bought by the urban development corporation displaced without any rights of protection under the rent act was a good example and it is the subject of an amendment i hope to move <e>", "<cs> such is the arrogance of power or possibly the arrogance of the secretary of state that as a member of the merseyside county council affected very closely by the proposed urban development corporation on merseyside the kind of consultation or some of the kind of consultation which the noble lord lord ponsonby has mentioned as desirable has been taking place for some considerable number of months as if an urban development corporation was already in existence <e> <s> we have had frequent visits from regional representatives of the

expect the amendment to be accepted in the precise words in which i had put it down and indeed your lordships may even say that the words were not very precise <e> <s> it is a point that i really wanted to bring out and i thought there was a splendid irony that in the london dockland area where as the noble lord <e>", "<cs> the point the noble lord the minister makes is absolutely right <e>

done <e> <s> i would hope that that would satisfy even the most predatory of existing local authorities <e> <s> on that basis and in the hope that i guess the intentions of the local authorities correctly i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am in some difficulty in that my noble friend lord simon is not able to make the remarks that he would have liked to make resulting from

<e>", "<cs> it would save me a great deal of embarrassment if the noble lord were to look at it again and then my noble friend could explain the point at some further stage <e>", "<cs> i understand that it is contained in other provisions <e> <s> it seems a somewhat draconian measure in isolation <e> <s> i would hope that the noble lord the minister could reassure me that if at any time a certificate was obtained and consequent upon that vacant possession was obtained against a tenant who was perfectly innocent who was not in arrears with his rent and not in breach of his covenants he would not be left with no alternative accommodation at all but would be rehoused either by the urban development corporation or by one of the agencies used by the urban development corporation the local authority or whatever <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for that assurance and on that basis i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> it is a matter of profound sadness to me and if in fact the urban development corporation did set out on a course of major vandalism of the nature that i fear for instance the albert docks in liverpool are a unique example i understand of th/th century dockland architecture and i am sure there are many examples of a similar kind in the london dockland area i can only hope and believe that good sense and public opinion would prevent the urban development corporations from behaving in an irresponsible and regrettable way <e> <s> i am sure that local authorities even though they did not have the power to prevent them would make life extremely difficult and uncomfortable <e>", "<cs> it goes almost without saying in view of what i said on the whole list of amendments in my name that i agree very much with the views expressed by the noble lord lord ponsonby <e>", "<cs> as your lordships will see my name is on the list of those objecting to the inclusion of this clause <e> <s> it seems to me to be pushing things too far that the housing power should be a power of the urban development corporation for the reasons already given by the noble lords <e> <s> one cannot help feeling that it is preparing the ground for a total takeover in certain circumstances of the responsibilities of local government <e>", "<cs> so as not to detain the committee at this late hour if those with whom i have been consulting still feel strongly about the matter i can raise it again at a later date <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i would only comment that when the udc has come into existence

local authorities on the second quarter to give them an indication and to avoid the necessity to take this panic measure <e>", "<cs> my lords in general terms i should like to support the amendment moved by the noble lord lord inglewood <e> <s> i recall that during the committee stage i was willing to support the more radical amendment put down by the noble viscount lord ridley but i accept that

far <e> <s> i am a member of a police committee and i think there is a widespread feeling among members of police committees that the importance of those committees has become considerably less since the passing of the police act <e> <s> very often they are little more than paper tigers going through the motions of receiving reports and not having much to do <e> <s> to the extent that the amendment might give police authorities a little more direct responsibility it would be helpful and healthy for local democracy <e> <s> in general terms i support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords speaking in general i suppose one could say that the new amended clause we are considering is an improvement on the original clause in the bill <e> <s> i can understand why the association of county councils is satisfied with it but like the noble baroness lady david i am still far from happy that the government feel it necessary to impose compulsion on local authorities <e> <s> i should have thought it would be very much better if the voluntary codes of practice could be agreed on all the subjects <e> <s> as i mentioned on committee stage one of the things i have found is that while the provision of information is very valuable there is a point at which the public is provided with so much information that it ceases to listen to it or to take any notice of it <e> <s> i fear that so much information may have to be pushed out on a quarterly basis with the extra administrative cost involved that the government in their very commendable wish to improve the information provided by local authorities may find it being counter-productive <e>", "<cs> my lords i can thank the noble lord in person since i am here and may i say from these benches how very much we welcome the new clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i think your lordships will recall that at the committee stage of the bill the noble lord lord bellwin conceded as reported in cols <e> <s> and of volume no <e> <s> of the <e>", "<cs> my lords may i follow one point that the minister has made which was mentioned by the noble lord lord bruce of donington the right of the local authority to resort to the courts if they think that the minister has not behaved reasonably <e> <s> the words used by the minister of housing in another place were that the minister would have to show good cause <e> <s> the only way a local authority can challenge the secretary of state in this is that he has acted either in bad faith or fraudulently <e> <s> as i said in committee i do not believe that any government would be likely to act fraudulently or unreasonably <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment moved by the noble lord lord underhill <e> <s> it does not seem that there can be any political or philosophical reason why the government should not give the direct labour organisations a wide discretion to carry out new work and maintenance unless they are saying that they want to reduce direct labour organisations to mere emergency services which i gather they do not <e> <s> it seems to me for the reasons the noble lord has given that for convenience and flexibility the only way a direct labour organisation can become competitive is if they can commercially tender for a wide variety of jobs and public and various works for the list of bodies mentioned in the amendment <e> <s> i think it is a valid point that from the experience of many noble lords a road or something like that would pass in and out of two or three local authorities <e> <s> it would be more convenient and cheaper if one direct labour organisation was allowed to deal with that rather than that two three or four different bodies should deal with small pieces of the work <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a great pity that such an important matter as this should be considered at this hour <e> <s> i concede that the matter was discussed at committee <e> <s> nevertheless it is a matter of great importance to those concerned about the independence of local government <e> <s> i understand that both the association of county councils and the association of metropolitan authorities feel this clause should not <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for speaking so late at night but to me these are extremely important provisions which have a fundamental effect on local government <e> <s> the noble lord the minister in dealing with <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be for the convenience of the house if in speaking to this amendment i also speak to my amendment no <e> <s> which as your lordships will see is dramatically more radical than that moved from the labour benches and is of course by referring to st april pregnant with symbolism <e> <s> first i am grateful to the noble lord the minister for the very helpful and considerate letter which he sent me about an amendment that i moved in committee in connection with <e>", "<cs> my lords owing to the vagaries of the honours system i have not been here long enough to do that <e>", "<cs> my lords at a quarter to twelve at night suppose i am not left with very much choice <e> <s> perhaps i have acquired the contagion of the government who claim to be in favour of local independence and then produce legislation which is not that way <e> <s> i suspect that in my concern for the problems of merseyside i have departed from my principles about equality but i feel very deeply that areas with special difficulties such as merseyside has with dereliction should have special treatment <e> <s> but in the circumstance and because of the hour and the fact that i value my life and i recommend lord bellwin if he values his not to come to merseyside i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords very briefly may i support the amendment moved by the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> i understand that the department have indicated to local authorities that they are sympathetic to this concept that while only one year can be guaranteed there would be indications to the local authorities of minimum figures allocated to them in subsequent years <e> <s> i hope that this general sympathy which i understand exists in the government will not just be left hanging in the air as a general sympathy but might be translated into something along the lines of the amendment moved by the noble lord because i think it goes without saying almost that the planning of manpower and the financing of local government would thus be greatly improved and therefore a better use could be made of resources which i would have thought would have been a desirable end that the government would wish to see <e>", "<cs> my lords i assume from the way in which the noble lord lord mishcon moved the amendment to amendment no <e> <s> that we are in fact taking amendments nos <e> <s> a and b together <e> <s> on that assumption i should like to say from these benches that i very warmly support the amendment moved by the noble lord lord hill with his habitual eloquence <e> <s> the problem is that the government insist on treating investments in local authority trading undertakings as being included as prescribed expenditure <e> <s> it seems to me that it is an artificial distinction that the government choose to treat surpluses on municipal trading as revenue receipts which cannot then be used to supplement capital expenditure allocation <e>", "<cs> my lords may f speak in support of the amendment moved by the noble lord lord morris <e> <s> i agree with his amendment which was supported by other noble lords and i agree with a lot that the noble earl lord caithness said except that i did not like the dismissive way and i should declare an interest here since i am a solicitor in which he said even a solicitor was willing to speculate <e> <s> that went to the heart <e> <s> but in addition to some of the eminent bodies mentioned by the noble earl the law society itself is opposed to the imposition of planning charges <e> <s> this may seem to some a good reason to vote against the amendment <e> <s> nevertheless there is a formidable array of people who are deeply involved in the planning process who are universally condemnatory of the proposals included in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords at the risk of repeating myself i must say that i am very much opposed in principle to the whole concept of charging for planning and i was really quite shocked by the noble viscount lord ridley who unfortunately is not in his place at the moment when he said that there is nothing wrong with charging for a service <e> <s> the precise point is that this is not a service we are paying for having our rights limited <e> <s> it is wrong to pay to have ones rights limited in this way <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the problems of the noble lord the minister <e> <s> while i should have preferred my own amendment to have been carried it seems to me that the government would probably find that the average applicant would feel a little less incensed or outraged or perhaps just a little less dissatisfied if he felt that <e>", "<cs> my lords as a fellow solicitor i feel that this is a very useful amendment and i hope that the government accept it <e> <s> we can see that it comes from the law society from the archaic legal word in the third line of the amendment as printed in the marshalled list <e> <s> it is a word not often seen outside legal documents feruse <e> <s> that is probably norman french for refuse <e> <s> apart from that i support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i stand with my head bloodied but unbowed <e> <s> if i were to say to your lordships that i shall read the <e>", "<cs> my lords very briefly may i say that on this amendment i agree very strongly indeed with the views expressed by the noble lord lord bruce of donington <e> <s> i understand from telephone calls i have received just before your lordships house met today that local authorities throughout the whole spectrum and i am sure that the noble viscount lord ridley and the noble lord lord sandford can speak for the adc and the acc but as far as the ama is concerned and i understand the other two associations are very concerned and very worried and certainly the local authorities with which i personally am connected are very concerned and worried that the government is setting an impossible task if this matter is not put off as suggested at the moment <e> <s> we do hope the government will look upon this favourably <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say from these benches that we very much support the amendment moved by the noble viscount lord ridley <e> <s> we do not mind on these benches perhaps because we have fairly few friends where we find our friends whether they be the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter or the noble lord lord mishcon <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say very briefly that i fully <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish at the outset to join in the paeans of praise to the noble lord lord bellwin for the way in which he has taken the principal part in conducting this very complex bill through your lordships house <e> <s> he got so carried away that he described my noble friend lord thurso as his noble friend i am glad that he has certain friends on the liberal benches <e> <s> the ministers great experience of local government and his great patience in piloting the bill through your lordships house have made what i thought was an impossible task into one that has been only just possible <e> <s> he has been fortunate he said that himself to have had his noble and noble and learned colleagues on the front bench to help him but the principal praise for the way in which the bill has been conducted must go to lord bellwin <e>", "<cs> my lords has the minister considered the disastrous consequences to small builders of the savage cuts being made in grants and loans to housing associations <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to say how grateful we should all be to the noble lord lord gisborough for raising this subject this evening <e> <s> i am only sorry that the word privatisation which he is obliged to use is such a ghastly word and i suspect that he may have imported it from the united states <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble viscount lord watkinson will not mind if i do not follow his speech precisely because as he said he has covered the general problems of unemployment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i join the rest of the house in expressing from these benches our deep sympathy towards the noble baroness lady young in her bereavement <e> <s> i must say that she has found an excellent substitute for this debate in the noble lord the minister who put forward his case with such reasonableness that one almost feels as if one is breaking up a pleasant party in possibly disagreeing with one or two of the things that he has to say <e>", "<cs> my lords at the time of the passage of the local government planning and land bill through your lordships house i was very much opposed to the concept of the setting up of a fresh quango in the shape of an urban development <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord be kind enough to give way for one second <e> <s> the concept that the merseyside county council was proposing with the mdhc was to take a lease which would release the mdhc from having to pay a capital figure because it was merely to be a rent rather than a capital figure <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister not agree that even more unacceptable than the conduct described is that people are not employed because of political opinions <e> <s> i understand that the noble lord may have information which indicates that some people are refused employment because of their political affinities <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to congratulate the noble baroness lady birk on initiating this debate <e> <s> i should also like as i am sure your lordships would to commiserate with her on suffering the worst possible infirmity that can befall a politician <e> <s> i do not know what she has in that glass but it seemed to improve the quality of her performance as time moved on <e> <s> perhaps she will give me the recipe later on <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches we would like to thank the minister for repeating the statement made by his right honourable friend <e> <s> we also welcome the intention expressed by the government to introduce a consultation document in the autumn on alternatives to domestic rates <e> <s> that is something for which my party has been looking for many years and i hope that in the consultation document serious consideration will be given to capital and site value rating and indeed to the possible introduction of a local income tax <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the minister aware of the concern expressed in the warehousing industry and among chambers of commerce about the inclusion of warehouses in enterprise zones and is he taking any steps to reassure these organisations <e>", "<cs> may i say very briefly indeed that the amendments have support from these benches and i hope the matter will go through to a very rapid conclusion <e>", "<cs> may i add my support to the remarks made by the noble baroness <e> <s> i agree that the problem is not a frequent one or one that the vast majority of operators indulge in but the occasional maverick in certain areas particularly the north of england and i am sure in other parts of the country can do a very great deal of damage <e> <s> it is particularly important both in this field and in the field of waste land that we remember the debates during the local government act <e> <s> the noble viscount lord ridley and myself were very anxious about the problems relating from changes in the derelict land grant applications <e> <s> the whole of the subject of waste land minerals and derelict land is one of great importance <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble lord the minister for his reply and for the valuable information that he has given <e> <s> does he not agree that in the present state of public order in this country and the crisis of confidence in the police in some parts of the inner urban areas urgent attention should be given to implementing part ii of the royal commissions report to introduce a quite separate prosecuting solicitors department for each police area and that in part i the coercive powers of the police and the treatment of suspects in custody should as a matter of urgency be placed on a statutory footing <e>", "<cs> no my lords i am not saying that <e> <s> i am saying that the degree of change that takes place reflecting the degree of change in the views of the electors would not be as enormous if we had a system of stv rather than a first-past-the-post system and therefore the clash between the local authority and the central authority would not be as dramatic as it is at present <e> <s> there is a very large area in which most councillors and most governments have broad agreement <e> <s> where in a local authority an extremely large majority is created by the present system there is not merely disagreement but deliberate i was going to say bloody-minded but i must not use that expression defiance of reasonable requests from a government of whatever political hue <e> <s> when the local authority behaves in the way that i have outlined the result is that the government have to resort or choose to resort to powers and administrative procedures and devices in order to control and emasculate local government which is what we are seeing <e>", "<cs> my lords first of all may i thank your lordships for the interest that has been taken in this debate that i initiated and the contributions that have been made <e> <s> i probably ought to apologise for not spending more time on the general reforms of local government that one wants to see particularly regarding finance and structural reform <e> <s> i thought that i had made it fairly clear that we were inevitably going to debate these kinds of matters in this house at enormous length in the coming months <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to amend the leasehold reform act and make further provision for enabling the tenants of leasehold houses to enfranchise their leases and acquire the freehold to provide that grants of long leases of houses shall take effect as grants of the freehold to empower local authorities to assist tenants with the cost of enfranchisement to permit housing associations and local authorities to enfranchise leases falling within the scope of the leasehold reform act and for connected purposes <e> <s> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches may i too thank the noble lord the minister for repeating this statement <e> <s> it is a statement which one must obviously broadly welcome in the same way as the people on merseyside very much welcomed the presence of his right honourable friend the secretary of state in liverpool on an extended basis <e> <s> i very much welcome the extension small as it is to the derelict land programme and the involvement of the construction industry which in many parts of the country is at present in desperate straits <e> <s> anything that can be done to create employment in that area must be welcomed <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches we too are grateful to the noble lord lord belstead for the statement and broadly support the conclusions of mr byfords review though any such support must be provisional at this stage as the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones said because of the short time one has had to consider the very serious matters disclosed by the review <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches we welcome the bill in broad terms as a follow-up to the act of the same name and no doubt the predecessor of further miscellaneous provisions acts <e> <s> most of the clauses are precedented by local legislation <e> <s> it is largely an uncontroversial measure with the exception perhaps of part ii dealing with sex shops and cinemas and part iv which deals with the control of refreshment premises <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> the reform of leasehold tenure has been a leading political issue in this country since i believe <e> <s> it was high on the list of reforms that the liberal government wished to introduce before the first world war and it is ironic that many of that governments most controversial reforms such as those dealing with national insurance and old age pensioners are now accepted as a base of our welfare state while taxation of land values and leasehold reform are still highly controversial issues <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel that have spent the best years of my life in promoting the concept of leasehold reform and speaking on the amendment of the noble earl i should like to thank with varying degrees of warmth the noble lords who have taken part in the debate <e> <s> when some months ago i put down an unstarred question to try to rekindle interest in leasehold reform i hoped that the government might bring forward legislation of their own to modify the present leasehold position which i still believe is not satisfactory <e> <s> your lordships might not think that my scheme is the best but i still believe that in particular parts of the country not in the country as a whole which is largely held in freehold tenure there is wide acceptance that the system is unsatisfactory <e> <s> i hoped that the government might have thought of legislating but since they have not i have been greatly assisted by most gallant and hard-working people from within the leasehold campaigns and from outside them in putting this bill together <e> <s> however much various members of your lordships house might have disagreed with me i believe that without the assistance of government draftsmen those people have not done a bad job <e>", "<cs> i should like to say briefly that we very warmly support the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to say briefly that i recognise the problem and the way in which the noble baroness has tried to get round it <e> <s> i think that what the noble baroness and i and many others of your lordships would want is the introduction of some kind of control of entertainments which take place wholly or mainly in the open air as they are at present controlled in greater london <e> <s> if one did not exclude political and religious meetings and bazaars and other harmless occupations of that kind one would sweep a whole lot of perfectly commendable public entertainments into an area where they had to be licensed <e>", "<cs> briefly i should like to add my support to the plea which the noble baroness lady birk and the noble lord lord sandford have <e>", "<cs> i am not here to express views favouring a rash of sex shops in every district of the country and i think that in many respects the line that the government have taken in allowing decisions about the numbers and so on to be the decision of the local authority is a good one <e> <s> but the fact is that none of us is seeking to legislate to say that sex shops shall be illegal <e> <s> we are therefore possibly putting ourselves in a difficulty as far as natural justice is concerned if we say on the one hand in amendment no <e> <s> that nil may be an appropriate number and then later on in amendment no <e> <s> that there shall be no grounds for appeal against a decision with regard to these matters <e> <s> one is saying that while sex shops shall not be illegal we can if we feel like it make it impossible for there to be a licensed sex shop and that there is no right of appeal against such a decision <e> <s> in spite of my distaste for these places i feel that this would be contrary to natural justice <e>", "<cs> i strongly support the amendments put down by the noble lord lord robertson of oakridge <e> <s> i should have thought that the government could very readily accept them <e> <s> they accepted amendments which are far more authoritarian and even obscurantist during our earlier committee stage debate <e> <s> whatever ones views about sex shops however liberal or illiberal one may be about the subject nobody would want there to be any possible circumstances where children under the age of could be involved or seen or employed or have any part in them <e> <s> i should have thought therefore that these amendments ought to be acceptable to the government <e>", "<cs> i must say that i wholeheartedly endorse every word that the noble baroness lady birk has said <e> <s> this appears to me to be saying that local authorities might well make a decision which is totally contrary to natural justice and i promise the noble earl lord halsbury that i shall not mention the word again if he does not mention the word brothels and because of that and because it is desired in the immediate neighbourhood we shall not <e>", "<cs> in that case with the permission of the committee i shall speak to amendments nos <e> <s> a and b <e> <s> i am sure that in years to come the noble lord lord belstead will regret the hasty remark he has just made <e> <s> i have put down these amendments about the control of refreshment premises not to challenge the governments proposals to license and control the opening hours of refreshment premises i think that it is a good thing that that should be in the control of local authorities nor indeed to challenge the compromise that i understand has been reached in another place about the earliest hour to be specified for closure of premises serving take-away food <e> <s> the bill originally proposed that it should be pm and the take-away and fast food federation i feel much more at home talking about food than about <e>", "<cs> the advice which i have is that the retention of desirable which is the wording in the act has caused difficulty and that that is the experience of people who have had to deal with it <e> <s> i do not think with respect that the minister has dealt with what i think is the substantive point of the second amendment namely that the word desirable makes it much more difficult for the decision of the local authority to be reviewed <e> <s> this is what really worries me <e> <s> we are dealing here not with very big multi-organisations but with small businesses which may very often be losing their livelihoods or part of their livelihoods because they have not been able to have an adequate opportunity to put forward their views at a judicial review of the refusal of the local authority to grant them a licence let us say after midnight to i am or for whatever period they particularly want it <e>", "<cs> i do not seek to debate the matter in general <e> <s> i am trying to suggest to your lordships which perversely you refuse to see that in making a decision about whether people shall have a licence for the period between midnight and am it would be preferable that it was seen that they had it at the point in clause <e> <s> however if the noble lord the minister is assuring me as i believe he is that in fact no such position would arise with regard to the licence-holders unless all the relevant circumstances had been taken into account and i think that is the assurance he gave me <e>", "<cs> in that case i am willing to withdraw the amendment and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for his consideration <e> <s> i know that there is no commitment and on that basis i will willingly with leave withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> yes indeed <e> <s> i am glad and i know that others will be glad to hear that and that the people who will now receive notices will under the terms of the interpretation act always be a limited company if such is the owner of the premises <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> that assurance with regard to the first amendment is very valuable and i am sure will give much relief to many of the proprietors of the premises that we are discussing this evening <e> <s> however i am genuinely very concerned about the business of complaints and signatures <e> <s> i have been in local government for a quarter of a century and i know that very many of the petitions and very many of the names that one sees on the petitions very many of the signatories to petitions are not deliberately inaccurate but people will say almost anything as i am sure the noble lord lord bellwin knows <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for seeking to be as accommodating as he can <e> <s> i can assure the noble lord that there are already procedures not in this particular esoteric area of human activity where sub-committees or committees of councils meet interested or concerned parties <e> <s> one has only to think of the field of education where there are meetings night after night about the individual problems of parents <e> <s> i am the first to concede that the problems of parents and their childrens education are important but so too are the problems of peoples livelihoods <e>", "<cs> may i briefly say how much i support the initiative taken by the noble lord lord underhill <e> <s> like him i underline that it is not the take-away food shops and the fish and chip shops that cause the trouble <e> <s> i suppose they create the litter but the national organisations of these take-away food shops have gone to a lot of trouble to try to encourage the removal of litter <e> <s> they realise that one of the main arguments that people will use against them when they seek to renew licences is the nuisance caused by the deposit of litter and the damage done to peoples gardens and the general flavour that is left in an area <e> <s> people often leave these places in a disgusting state particularly at weekends <e> <s> we all have knowledge of this from the areas in which we live <e>", "<cs> this is a very interesting and useful amendment <e> <s> i find it particularly attractive as it is precedented by the open spaces act which was a fine piece of liberal legislation which has stood the test of time <e> <s> the present-day circumstances of the use of schools for community purposes is a novel situation compared with a few years ago <e> <s> extending the use of school premises for community purposes is to be very much welcomed not only in development areas but in all parts of the country <e> <s> it is a pity that the very fine work being done in community schools for adults elderly people and children is from time to time damaged by abuse of these premises <e> <s> there have been a number of fairly serious accidents involving personal injury because people insisted on riding horses across playing fields in the part of the country where i live <e> <s> that is quite apart from the damage they did to the cricket square <e> <s> as the noble viscount has said there are also people who insist on playing golf <e> <s> there are also some idiots who drive very loud motor bikes all over playing fields <e> <s> if the government can give some indication that legislation such as this might possibly be included in the bill and that there is some hope of its being enforced it would serve very much the growing need for the use of schools and similar premises on a broad community basis <e>", "<cs> may i express general support from these benches from the amendments put down by the noble lord lord houghton <e> <s> i suppose i should declare an interest as a dog-owner myself a neutered jack russell <e> <s> may i also say that as the noble lord the minister is probably as aware as i am we are now in the season of the year when people are rushing about canvassing for the local elections and the biggest single problem with which they are confronted at least in the part of the world where i come from and where i was a councillor for many years is dog fouling <e>", "<cs> briefly i should like to support the amendment proposed by the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs <e> <s> i support the principle and the concept behind it <e> <s> i suspect that it will be a little difficult to enforce in the context of this permissive legislation but in principle i still think that one should give a very clear message that the kind of graffiti to which the noble baroness refers should be regarded and i think can under existing legislation be regarded as a breach of the law <e>", "<cs> we warmly welcome the new clause <e>", "<cs> i may be a lawyer but i think that the noble viscount has a much more persuasive style with the noble lord the minister <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that the joint airports committee of local authorities of which my own local authority is much to its great expense a member it loses nearly million a year on its airport has carefully examined the model by-laws relating to lost property at airports which the department of trade has produced under the powers contained in the civil aviation acts <e> <s> it is the department of trade that has been insisting that in connection with the word disposal one cannot include a vesting of the property in the owners of the airport <e> <s> if then they seek to create by-laws to enable them to dispose of property which is not vested in them they might well find that <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to add my congratulations to the noble baroness for initiating this debate on a matter of serious concern not only for people involved in urban areas but for the country as a whole <e> <s> i think it would be agreed that if our great cities are in decline that affects the whole of our society <e> <s> i am particularly grateful to her for the fact that she did not limit the subject of the debate to inner areas alone but included middle and outer areas <e> <s> the problems of inner areas as i think we all recognise are very serious but because of the special aid which is given to them under the inner urban areas act and other legislation they are now no more serious and very often are becoming less serious than the problems arising in the outer areas where local authorities principally built in the s s and s huge dehumanised high-rise satellite towns such as kirkby outside liverpool or in the area where i live the noctorum woodchurch and ford estates in the wirral <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join the noble baroness lady birk in congratulating the noble lord the minister on the clear way in which he defended the indefensible but he did it very capably and we wish him well <e> <s> i too may conceivably if we make this debate drag on long enough have to leave before the end but i trust that that will not be the case <e>", "<cs> we entirely support the amendment which noble baroness has so ably moved <e> <s> it should be underlined that the levying of supplementary rates up to the point of this bill has been perfectly legal and has been very rarely used <e> <s> that ought to be underlined <e> <s> it is not as though local authorities have been wildly creating supplementary rates year in and year out <e> <s> it has been a very rare occurrence <e> <s> i suggest that in the future it will remain such particularly if the limited rights that the noble baroness mentioned are granted <e>", "<cs> it seems to me from discussing this bill with borough treasurers directors of finance or whatever they are now called that they regard and they are of course non-political publicly anyway the proposal enshrined in the amendment as being one of some importance because if local authorities can be subject to decisions to reduce the amount of grant after a local authority has fixed its rates it puts the director of finance quite apart from the council in a very considerable difficulty <e> <s> i know that the right honourable gentleman the secretary of state when the bill was going through another place did away

answer nearly all the complaints which were voiced in committee <e> <s> i hope that the amendments that will be moved later will be as acceptable as these have been <e>", "<cs> my lords may i join the

effective to deal with the generality of damage that the noble viscounts amendment seeks to cure damage by dogs and so on <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord the minister will be sympathetic to the amendment and to the point that the noble lord lord sandford raised <e> <s> whatever political persuasoni we hold we all recognise that the terrible problem in many parts of the country in particular in the north is the very high level of unskilled labour and i should have thought that any step which could make it easier for people to be trained for skills should be taken by

appropriate committees in local authorities dealing with insurance in the past it seems to me that <e>", "<cs> my lords that metaphysical point having been dealt with i would like to say that the noble lord the minister was kind enough to write to me and to throw a little light on what must be the rather depressing existence he has at the moment in moving these endless amendments <e> <s> i have become convinced by what the noble lord said in his letter that the matter should be left as it now is in the bill given the very convoluted history of the bill in another place and here <e>",

"<cs> may i briefly support this amendment <e> <s> perhaps when the noble lord the minister replies he can tell us whether it would be the intention that if an objector is turned down in his request for an extraordinary audit he can then go to the secretary of state and ask the secretary of state for an extraordinary audit <e> <s> if that is the case local authorities would be faced twice with the same possible danger of having an extraordinary audit imposed upon them because one door having shut one will be able to open another through the secretary of state which seems to me to be highly undesirable <e>", "<cs> my only quarrel with the noble viscount over the way in which he spoke to the question that the clause shall stand part related to the moderation of his language and the restraint with which he spoke <e> <s> i fully expect that after i have spoken on the clause the noble lord the minister will accuse me of being immoderate but it is one of those occasions to paraphrase oscar wilde when being immoderate is not just a duty but also a pleasure <e> <s> to have not only clause but also the new clause after it which is enshrined in amendment no <e> <s> h is a disgraceful interference with the independence and duties of local government <e>", "<cs> as i am sure the noble baroness realises this is a fairly modest amendment but anything that reduces a danger to the independence of local government i will support and i support this amendment for that reason <e>", "<cs> so do i <e>", "<cs> i know this is becoming a boring and otiose but nevertheless i have to say that i am totally completely and absolutely opposed to this clause too <e> <s> all i can say is that i am jolly glad that i am not in local government at the moment because it is becoming so much constrained by financial examination that it is hardly worth thinking of oneself as any kind of independent body at all <e> <s> local government is becoming more and more an agency of central government <e> <s> however throughout it all i admire the noble lord the minister who goes on in his delightful way assuring us with all sincerity that this is going to strengthen local government <e>

but it is killing the very independence of local government about which so many of us are concerned <e>", "<cs> i seem to be once again the innocent precipitant of a <e>", "<cs> because of the lateness of the hour while reserving my position i shall not move that amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i support the amendments moved by the noble baroness <e> <s> i think she indicated the position that democratically the majority of the council in bedfordshire wanted a certain kind of rate to be levied <e> <s> by an unfortunate accident at an earlier meeting of the council because of the absence of certain members for curious reasons the conservative minority managed to carry a rate which did not represent the views of the majority of the councillors namely the labour and the liberal councillors <e> <s> what they did was to restore what was the view of the minority <e> <s> therefore i think it would be inappropriate and contrary to democratic practices which i am sure the noble lord the minister himself supports if the majority of the councillors are not allowed to have the rate that they require <e> <s> this would ensure that this happened and therefore this amendment in all equity fairness and democratic practice should be carried so that the wishes of the majority of the elected members of bedfordshire should carry the day <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with great interest to what the noble lord the minister has said and while we do not approve of the penalty system if there is a penalty system one must welcome the exclusion of rioting and so on <e> <s> but what concerns people in local government is the uncertainty about what will be exempted in the future when they are making their arrangements <e> <s> they will be totally uncertain because as i understand it the secretary of state has given no indication of what his proposals will be for the present year <e> <s> he has indicated and it is very acceptable what he will be exempting or disregarding in the last year <e> <s> it is the uncertainty which concerns us <e> <s> the minister has gone some way towards reassuring me but there is a fear in local government of which the minister is probably aware that this clause will be used to manipulate the grant system in a way which might at some point be used not by the noble lord the minister or indeed by his right honourable friends but by some future government in an irresponsible divisive and selective way <e> <s> it is those two points first the uncertainty and secondly the fear of manipulation which concerns many of us about the effect of this clause <e>", "<cs> my lords may i briefly lend such support as i can to the noble viscounts <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say that i understand the reservations of the noble lord the minister and i can understand that from a ministerial point of view he has to say that this proposal would cause a great deal of bureaucracy and red tape <e> <s> i

does not come as an entire surprise to me <e> <s> i felt that i was probably tilting at a windmill but i still think that the money that has been allocated to local government expenditure should be used in local government <e> <s> i understand the ministers point and i shall not detain your lordships house any longer because i suspect that there is still quite a large number of more controversial amendments to come <e> <s> therefore i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords my heart sinks whenever i hear the noble lord the minister say i have some sympathy for the amendment that the noble lord is moving because then know that it is all up <e> <s> i should like to thank the noble baroness lady birk for reminding me that the correct word for retrospectivity is retrospection and not this new word that i invented in my speech just now but i am so overcome by emotion about this that i occasionally lose the <e>", "<cs> my lords while welcoming the increased expenditure on capital projects would not the noble earl the minister agree that one of the problems about encouraging capital expenditure is that often there are revenue implications and that many local authorities are discouraged from going in for capital expenditure because of the extremely heavy controls which central government have imposed on local authority independence <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to speak briefly in support of the amendment moved by the noble lord lord bishopston and to explain to your lordships that i am here in a fairly unfamiliar role for me speaking on mobile homes because my noble friend lord avebury is in india whether or not he is inspecting mobile homes there i do not know but i am standing in for him <e> <s> i should like to join with the noble lord lord bishopston in congratulating the noble lord the minister on his elevation <e> <s> i had intended to write to him but the newspapers which i received said that the noble lord had been promoted but did not say precisely what his promotion was <e> <s> i must say that i am very delighted and i am sure that it will be a great help to your lordships house to have the noble lord in this new more powerful and more influential role <e> <s> i hope that our influence upon him will be the greater now that he can have the self-confidence of the higher title <e>", "<cs> my lords may i from these benches once again lend my support to this amendment moved by the noble lord lord bishopston <e> <s> i think the position is that though the overwhelming majority of landlords and site owners are fair and reasonable people no one on the government benches or elsewhere would be so nave as to think that all site owners and all landlords are the very essence of every possible virtue <e> <s> the fact of the matter is as the noble lord lord bishopston has said that the difference in bargaining strength and the difference in power between the owner and the occupier is very considerable <e> <s> the owner is in a much stronger position than even the occupier with an agreement <e> <s> the occupier without an agreement reluctant as he may be to take legal advice or to think he cannot afford legal advice and indeed reluctant as he may be to do anything to anger the owner might be willing to put up <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i should like to say that we welcome the recommendation of the mediator of a per cent <e> <s> payment over months because in any terms this is a low-paid industry <e> <s> we recognise that the workers did not necessarily agree to accept the mediators recommendation <e> <s> however would not the noble lord the minister agree that as the noble baroness suggested it would be a great tragedy should the country get into grave difficulties if workers who are in a particularly strong position to put pressure on the government abuse that position <e> <s> from these benches we hope that the meeting this evening will reach an agreement that will be acceptable to both sides <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say briefly but i think with considerable strength that i believe that three months is far too short a time and that six months is more appropriate <e> <s> it is the period set up for similar kinds of action under the landlord and tenant acts <e> <s> i do not want to suggest in any way that the legal profession goes in for delays <e> <s> i can assure you it does not it does what its clients ask it to do <e> <s> very often clients ask solicitors to delay things <e> <s> for all the things that may be needed to be done before the occupier takes the matter to the courts i can say with complete certainty that three months is not a long enough period <e> <s> as the noble lord lord bishopston has said it may be shorter than six months <e> <s> from my experience of similar kinds of problems i believe that s six months period would be appropriate in this case <e> <s> i think that this should be given serious consideration by the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i suspect that one of the great success stories of the post-war world is the creation of the rent officer <e> <s> rent officers seem to be fairly well accepted by their creators by the tenants and by the landlords <e> <s> the atmosphere in which they conduct their proceedings is informal <e> <s> they act fairly rapidly and there is very little criticism of their decisions <e> <s> i wish that could be said of a lot of other organisations that have been created since the war <e> <s> they are the ideal people for the purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a very generous amendment which the government have put down although i do not feel that it is quite as generous as the noble lord lord bellwin was suggesting <e> <s> for example second cousins twice removed are excluded quite rightly but i understand that even first cousins once removed are excluded which is also quite right <e> <s> i see also that the child of a mother and reputed father is included but not the child of a father living with a woman who is not the childs mother they are excluded and the male sex suffers relative to the female sex <e> <s> again that is probably an accepted principle although it is one that i believe should be noted that there is in fact a slight lacuna there <e> <s> people who live together as husband and wife are included <e> <s> it strikes me that this is a situation which is going to cause a great deal of excitement and interest <e> <s> without being unduly delicate in your lordships house one is aware that on the northern coasts of wales and elsewhere some of these mobile homes are love nests in the old-fashioned sense of the word <e>", "<cs> my lords we congratulate the minister for agreeing to define families to simplify matters for everyone <e> <s> i beg him to accept the amendment or something similar for the same reason <e> <s> i put to the minister the kind of thing that i expect to happen from experience of other kinds of agreement in landlord and tenant relationships or <e>", "<cs> my lords this is an important amendment <e> <s> i do not know whether i am unfairly inviting the minister to speculate on what the courts would do but as the noble lord lord bishopston said perhaps the minister can assure us that the courts would say that the owner would not be entitled to terminate the agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down i would point out that that is precisely the point about which i was speculating <e> <s> if before eviction the owner goes to the court and says i want to evict this occupier for some totally trivial reason i was speculating whether the courts would not say this is totally trivial <e> <s> go away <e> <s> if that is the case we do not need this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment would and should fill a gap which now exists in the bill <e> <s> perhaps the words may not completely satisfy the government as the noble lord lord bishopston said but i should have thought that they would accept the principle of the words and introduce an amendment of their own at a later stage to give this kind of right to information to occupiers <e>", "<cs> my lords because of an accident of local government it was normally my unfortunate lot in our old days on merseyside county council for me to speak before the noble lord lord sefton and have all my delicate and carefully constructed arguments smashed to pieces in a subsequent speech <e> <s> i was rather looking forward to following the noble lord this evening and possibly getting a little of my own back but i find myself in absolutely total agreement with everything that he has had to say <e> <s> this enables me to cut down what was going to be about a -minute speech to around four minutes <e> <s> may i say that there is no one in your lordships house who is better qualified to speak on the subject of transport and local government than the noble lord lord sefton <e> <s> as he told the house he was deeply involved in the problems of merseyside <e> <s> the only quarrel that we had with him about transport was that he imposed the bilious green liverpool buses on <e>", "<cs> my lords i

extremely small mercy <e> <s> i shall be glad if the noble lord the minister will speculate as to how much housing association land or how many buildings this provision will apply to <e> <s> i should think it would be very small indeed <e> <s> having said that i follow the noble baroness in that we on these benches and i believe those of my friends in the social democratic party take the view that

associations will have been convinced by the honeyed and brave words of the noble lord lord campbell of alloway <e> <s> i find that the reasons he gives although he puts them forward courageously are not convincing certainly to me <e> <s> i should like to say that the reason why lord goodman is not here today is not because his conviction and his views expressed on second reading are any less but

elderly parent widow or widower often quite rightly feels that this is the last bastion and they would not pass the tenancy on even with the agreement of the local authority <e> <s> indeed in some cases and i can think of quite a number in my own experience when the parent gets very much older in spite of the considerable care that the daughter or son has given they become neurotically suspicious that the child living with them is involved in some deep and dark laid plot to have them removed from the house so that they can enjoy it alone <e> <s> therefore i do not think that in many cases that is likely to work <e>", "<cs> although i was out of the chamber when the discussion started i want to underline from these benches that we and i understand others are not against the concept of the right to buy <e> <s> we are concerned about the fact as the noble lord lord hylton rightly suggested that the granting of discounts is going far too far <e> <s> it is the level at which the noble lord is suggesting that discounts should be taken and the particular time at which this proposal is being made which we find unacceptable <e>", "<cs> from these benches we should like to be associated with what has been said and to thank the minister for the generous statement that he has made <e>", "<cs> the concept behind the clause is a very good one <e> <s> all of us who have been engaged in local government can think of some absurd <e>", "<cs> i think that as the noble baroness says this is a very important clause <e> <s> i think it is important that this insurance cover should be mandatory and not permissive as it appears to be under the bill as drawn <e> <s> recent decisions in the high court have imposed a very heavy burden on local authorities in the event of damage to buildings being discovered which are a result of negligent cover by the inspectors <e> <s> the provision is a very useful additional protection for house owners <e> <s> since the time for the statute of limitations only starts running from the date that the defect is discovered it is a useful form of protection which has been devised in a number of leading cases as i have said <e>", "<cs> with respect i had not intended to speak again but i must say after that remark that the point is that one is not concerned about the developers so much or the meddling it is a concern to protect purchasers whose protection will now be considerably diminished as a result of this proposal <e> <s> i think that that is a very important and serious matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with a very great deal of what the noble lord lord sandford has said and indeed what the noble viscount lord ridley has said <e> <s> i think that i have one advantage over them in that according to the prescription that the noble lord lord beloff gave us i am at least entitled to talk about the metropolitan counties because i was a metropolitan councillor for eight years <e> <s> the noble lord in

somebody who has dealt with property all his life i do not believe that to be a practical proposition <e> <s> secondly there is a certain meretricious attraction in this suggestion <e> <s> i am not suggesting that the noble lord is putting foward the idea of a pre-emption right in order to dazzle the movers of the amendment into a false sense of security but this pre-emption right will not be of much value because of the very severe limitations which her majestys government are imposing upon public expenditure in every sector <e>", "<cs> i should like briefly to support what the noble baroness has said <e> <s> she put the case i think exceptionally well and very clearly and it needs very few words of amplification <e> <s> the case is very clearly made <e> <s> it was made in and is

repairs to be carried out <e> <s> the system which the noble baroness seeks to amend is cumbersome can be very expensive and with all the inspection procedures involved would probably cost more than

including from the point of view of a tenant getting a contractor to do the repairs <e> <s> i hope the noble baroness lady denington will accept that in my practice as a solicitor i find tenants complain fairly bitterly about the landlord and local authority not turning up to do repairs for months and as she says they stay in all day long <e> <s> i do assure you they find also that they do not get very much better service from private contractors who either do not turn up or run out of money when they are half way through doing the repairs or who very often are cowboys <e> <s> i fear that the budget proposal to add vat to the cost of improvements to houses will he more of an encouragement to the kind of contractor who appears takes the cash and disappears <e> <s> there is a problem whichever way you look at it <e> <s> what the noble baroness lady denington was saying i think was that her scheme is not perfect but that it is a basis for a reconsideration of the problem <e>", "<cs> yes coercion <e> <s> we agree with the view that we do not wish to appear to coerce <e> <s> if you think about it for two seconds how can you coerce people into taking control of the management of their own homes <e> <s> by their very nature co-operatives are voluntary bodies <e> <s> their members volunteer to join them <e> <s> there is no element of coercion of the members of co-operatives <e> <s> the question is whether local authorities of the old-fashioned kind should have the right to obstruct people who wish to co-operate in this way just because they believe in centralism and in the s concept of housing socialism or just because some of them may wish as a kind of virility symbol to keep control over people in sprawling municipal estates which they see as a way of exercising political power <e> <s> as the government know there are authorities which unfortunately take that view and which want to retain as far as they can the old-fashioned municipal control of housing <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble lord lord graham of edmonton and the noble earl lord selkirk for their support <e> <s> it will hardly surprise your lordships that i am

lordships would not welcome at this hour the four-and-a-half hour speech which was commended to us in another place in the course of this bills going through the committee stage <e> <s> i shall be able to keep my remarks brief because my noble friends particularly my noble friend lady stedman have put the case from the alliances point of view extremely well <e>", "<cs> in supporting this amendment with two cheers possibly rather than with three it is on the basis that the amendment is as the noble viscount has said a damage limitation measure <e> <s> one would expect the association of county <e>", "<cs> i am very disappointed with what the minister said <e> <s> he appears to have gone back on what he said on the previous debate <e> <s> as far as i can ascertain the position it is true that the amendment does have the effect of delaying matters a year <e> <s> designation will be in year one and implementation in year three instead of designation in the year one and implementation in the year two <e> <s> i should have thought as one who has had long experience in local government and with the buffeting it has received from various governments over the years that if the expenditure of local authorities is to be controlled and reduced in some areas in the draconian way proposed it should be done efficiently with the minimum of damage to services and after very full and detailed consideration by local authorities and by parliament and of the way in which the priorities of the local authority which is being capped as it were will have to be re-ordered <e>", "<cs> it is true <e>", "<cs> this must be the longest period for which i have been standing when i have been sitting in my career <e> <s> the noble lord should not mention theology to a welshman we

parliamentary supervision at every level <e> <s> that is the reason that i seek to divide the committee <e>", "<cs> after what the minister has said i am very willing to withdraw the amendment with your lordships consent <e>", "<cs> i was aware that i was unduly restricting the basis of assessment as the noble lord lord broxbourne rightly pointed out <e> <s> so far as the latin quotation is concerned i shall paraphrase something by sergeant sullivan we talk of nothing else important <e> <s> but the fact of the matter is that the only way i could see of trying to extract from the government an assurance that a comprehensive assessment of the expenditure the history the economic problems and the social needs was taken into account was to move an amendment of this nature <e> <s> if i get an assurance of that kind from the minister i shall be reasonably though not completely happy with the outcome <e>", "<cs> it is rubbish <e> <s> but we believe that in order to get such contracts some of the private enterprise firms tender at such a low price that they cannot really meet their obligations <e> <s> there is such a keen level of tendering and there is that danger which local authorities have to watch <e>", "<cs> i know that the noble lord the minister is amazed that i have not said a word all evening <e> <s> i should like briefly to say that i strongly support the noble lord lord graham of edmonton in the moderate way that he has moved the amendment partly because we want his support <e>", "<cs> in order to save time at this hour of the night may i briefly speak in support not so much of the amendment moved by the noble lord lord stallard but rather of the following amendment amendment no <e> <s> which is grouped with amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> since the noble lord lord graham said that these three amendments nos <e> <s> and are really on the same theme it might be better if i were to speak briefly to amendment no <e> <s> in which by changing the word may to the words shall not we seek to prohibit the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> i was a member of an authority which had annual elections <e> <s> i have also been a member of authorities which had four-yearly elections <e> <s> every year when i was a member of the county council i moved that we should dispose of our balances and was always treated with the most appalling derision by either the controlling conservative or labour interest who said that i was doing so for electoral purposes and those funds were there so that the county council had a reserve <e> <s> i used to say what the noble lord the minister is now saying those reserves belong to the people <e> <s> i used to be treated with appalling derision <e> <s> i am sorry that the noble lord is now using my arguments against me and i am using their arguments against noble lords on that side of the committee <e>", "<cs> i must say that i found the speech of the noble lord lord bruce-gardyne very interesting and very stimulating <e> <s> i obviously do not agree with all that he says <e> <s> he mentioned the suggestion by the noble baroness lady birk that there should be more frequent elections <e> <s> the noble lord overlooked or perhaps chose to ignore the remarks of the noble lord lord chelwood that a different kind of election which was more sensitive to the wishes at one time or another of the electorate such as a form of proportional representation might go a long way to resolving the problems of the sensitivity of local authorities to the views of the electorate <e>", "<cs> when the proposal was made by the noble lords right honourable friend to put an amendment before this committee i think there were stifled sighs of relief from some of the honourable members on the government side <e> <s> whether they would still be relieved having seen this amendment or whether they would be scratching their heads in some bewilderment i do not know <e> <s> as i understand it within local government and even within the department itself there is quite a vigorous debate going on about the methodology by which you come to settle what shall be the guidelines the targets and the methodology to use when deciding about the gres and whether you use the gre only to settle the rate support grant or whether it is used also as a kind of limitation on expenditure and what is the relationship of the guidelines or the targets to the limitations in the bill <e>", "<cs> i put down this amendment as your lordships will realise before amendment no <e> <s> b was put down by the government <e> <s> i have listened carefully to what the minister has said and i am aware of his concern about the programme and partnership areas <e> <s> i was very glad <e> <s> as were others to see him at the international gardening exhibition which was opened by her majesty the queen last week and which has already surpassed all expected records <e> <s> so things are looking very rosy there <e>", "<cs> they are blooming <e> <s> i only hope that the noble lord has got the dust off his shoes and his suit after that <e> <s> but it is a very hopeful occasion and i trust that it will do a lot more for merseyside than many critics have been suggesting <e> <s> i should like to read me ministers speech to compare it with the amendment which he so recently moved and to consider how the matter stands <e> <s> in those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i have to declare an interest <e> <s> i am president of the national association of warehouse keepers sometimes i wonder why i am but nevertheless i am <e> <s> in supporting the amendments which the noble lord lord pennock has moved i should like to direct attention particularly to amendment no <e> <s> c which deals with warehouses <e> <s> the noble lord has dealt very well with the problem of warehouse keepers <e> <s> my association points out that while other industries may be worker intensive warehouses tend to be very highly rates intensive <e> <s> they are particularly affected by the failure of the government to include them in the exclusion from payment of rates for empty premises because <e>", "<cs> recession that the country has suffered <e> <s> i do wish that the noble lord lord graham would not make my speeches for me although they are very much better than mine <e> <s> but as the noble lord says during the recent recession induced no doubt by a conservative government as the noble lord lord graham would also say <e> <s> the rates account as the noble lord lord pennock has said for up to per cent <e> <s> of the outgoings of warehousing companies <e> <s> the rate is a much higher percentage than for the rest of industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel very strongly that this amendment and the previous one are of crucial importance even for people who broadly agree with the thrust of the legislation in trying to put it in a more acceptable form a form which will enable people in local government to have some hope that their future so far as finance is concerned will not be governed by whitehall civil servants <e> <s> that is what is happening at the moment with the fixing of gre with the fixing of targets and so on <e> <s> decisions are being made by central government in whitehall of a kind which up to now have been made and should be made by local authority councillors aided and advised by their treasurers and directors of finance <e> <s> it is significant that the local government accountants are totally opposed to this legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords with practically any explanation i would probably not proceed any further with these amendments at this hour of the night <e> <s> i must say that i think they are both important points <e> <s> what the minister said about the second amendment amendment no <e> <s> will cover the matter adequately because we can wave his ilansard speech at him in future if he tries to go back on it <e> <s> he said i hope he is right that it is already covered in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords very briefly i should like to support the amendment set down in lord mottistones name and in my own name <e> <s> in his excellent speech he has said nearly all that needs to be said <e> <s> all i need to do i suppose is to declare an interest in that i am president of the national association of warehouse keepers and they are completely per cent <e> <s> in support of this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i be associated briefly with the remarks that have been made <e> <s> the thing that pleased me most about the debates during the various stages of the bill was that i was able to go away for a holiday to ireland in the middle of it all which i could not get out of <e> <s> i am very glad that they did move the dates for the debates on part of the bill to a date on which i had already arranged to be away because one feels that this has been going on for ever and i must say with all seriousness that i have been very heavy-hearted over many parts of the bill <e> <s> i have had a very great deal of support from my noble friends here particularly from the noble baroness lady stedman who is now away and also from many other noble friends <e> <s> i think we have worked constructively with the main opposition party and with many cross-benchers <e> <s> one has felt at times that however rational and reasonable was the proposal one was making it was falling on deaf ears <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say for the avoidance of doubt following some discussions that were held in another place on this amendment that we welcome very warmly the new amendment and we congratulate the government on their generosity and on their understanding of the will of this house <e> <s> i should particularly like to congratulate the noble baroness on her assiduity and her devotion to working at week-ends and even to trying to make the government see the error of their ways <e> <s> i think she deserves our deep gratitude for the way she persisted in following this matter strengthened as i believe she admits by the knowledge that she had support from a very wide spectrum of opinion in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> may i very briefly say virtually one word to the noble earl <e> <s> i am not suggesting that he has misled the committee or <e>", "<cs> i do not think that any politician would ever admit that he did not know what was going on <e> <s> he merely pretends by speaking round the subject for ages that he knows more about it than those putting it forward <e> <s> however i am very glad that the noble baroness lady fisher of rednal made the point that this is a bill about the metropolitan counties in addition to greater london <e> <s> either consciously or unconsciously the noble lord the minister has stirred up those behind him in the belief that they can cock a snook at red ken whereas in fact there are many other councils with which this bill deals but which perhaps have less high profiles than the greater london council <e> <s> that is a very important point <e> <s> we must remember that this bill deals with six metropolitan counties in addition to greater london <e>", "<cs> as i sat listening to the minister and to the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter i was thinking that i had been far too conservative in the amendment that i had put down <e> <s> i should have been more radical and suggested all elections all costs administrative and political and that it should be retrospective for the last years <e> <s> during that period i fought elections and it would help my budget somewhat if one were to carry such an amendment <e> <s> of course i concede that the chances of carrying such an amendment would be remote <e>", "<cs> speaking as one who was a district councillor and a metropolitan county councillor at the same time and found the workload too much particularly after i came up to your lordships house i want to say this is the crux of my support for the noble baronesss amendment that the workload even on an interim closing basis that is being imposed on people who are elected as district councillors to look after all the multifarious duties which metropolitan boroughs and district councils have and at the same time to be representing huge areas on a county council which in the interim period will still have duties is requiring people who really are not elected for that purpose at all to carry out duties that are almost impossible to perform if they are to retain their efficiency as councillors <e>", "<cs> if i may interrupt what has become a dialogue i think it would be churlish of me as a liberal who has bored your lordships over many months and years in talking about proportionality which i shall go on doing so long as i have breath to do so until eventually we get proportional representation to say that this is the first attempt i know of in legislation to introduce an element of proportionality however ineffective or rough it might be <e> <s> my worry is that the proportionality will be proportionality related to the number of councillors in each london borough rather than the numbers of votes acquired by the political parties in that area <e>", "<cs> i am not suggesting and i have not suggested at any stage that i regard the proposals as grotesquely unfair <e> <s> all i am suggesting is that they could be made fairer in the way that i have suggested <e> <s> the noble lord the minister gave us a moving description of the various capacities in which he has served in local government but he has never been in the position in which i have spent most of my political life that of conservatives labour and liberals <e> <s> that is the kind of situation i am concerned about <e> <s> i am sure i could bring tears to the eyes of your lordships in considering the treatment which has been meted out to us over the years <e> <s> i would rather have the fate of a minority party in the hands of the secretary of state than in the hands of a provincial labour or <e>", "<cs> as the noble baroness said i had intended to say something on this but my notes have been mislaid and i have just been finding them <e> <s> i can only assume from the approbation that the noble baroness was receiving that she was saying what i would have said <e> <s> i do know from discussions i have had with local authorities and other parties that however the government seek to interpret what happened last week the noble lord the minister ought to give serious consideration to this because elections should proceed if abolition is undecided by may and if the elections were to go ahead the officers should remain in office until abolition <e> <s> it seems to me that this amendment regardless of what attitude the government take towards it would improve the quality of the bill and should be part of it and i should like to support the amendment as moved by the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> i should like to say briefly that i support the amendment <e> <s> we have here another example of the cart being put before the horse <e> <s> if the government had proceeded by the more conventional and well-established method of agreeing the substantial reforms first and introducing the interim provisions secondly with the substantive legislation agreed they could have gone about dealing with the status of the quorum in the usual way of allowing it to be fixed by the local authority itself <e> <s> they are now taking the step of putting the transitional provisions first demonstrating that they cannot trust local councils to behave responsibly as the noble lord lord graham has indicated <e>", "<cs> let me make it quite clear to the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls if to no one else that i have no objection to the main thrust of clause the establishment of a staff commission <e> <s> i think it has come out in the course of these discussions at one point the noble lord lord skelmersdale actually said he thought there might be something in the amendment which i had moved which made me wonder whether i had wandered into the right chamber that if you are establishing a staff commission to deal with extremely sensitive problems of redundancies retention of jobs status of jobs and so on it seems very important indeed that the people concerned the staff themselves should feel that the commission will deal with them fairly and objectively <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> yes i accept that <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> i appreciate the difficulty i have posed the committee in my attempts to save time when moving amendment no <e> <s> which would make it necessary to withdraw amendments nos <e> <s> and if it were passed <e> <s> i have become so embittered in the period i have been here that i realised amendment no <e> <s> probably would not be carried and so i spoke to amendments nos <e> <s> and at the same time <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the noble lord for pointing that out <e> <s> it is indeed very much in ones mind when looking at this matter <e> <s> however the real problem is the extent to which elected local authorities will have officials or staff imposed upon them <e>", "<cs> if i may say so that is very reassuring and one is inclined to believe that what felt like hours but probably was only a shorter period of time spent in debating this matter has been well worth while <e> <s> the noble lord has provided a very interesting and useful piece of information <e> <s> there are still some matters i am not happy about but i nevertheless beg leave to withdraw amendment no <e> <s> because i can cover them under a subsequent amendment <e>", "<cs> i approach from a different point of view fairly obviously since i am endeavouring to get the government to try to see the light <e> <s> i concede that the direction would only be used under unusual circumstances <e> <s> what i am suggesting is that if there is written into the legislation this right for the representative bodies the local authorities trade unions and so on to have a say before a direction is made then it might make the transition that is going to be a very painful one for very many people including the ministers of the government and civil servants a little easier to bear <e> <s> but since the noble lord the minister is insistent upon pursuing his draconian omniscient and all-powerful course of action all i can say when in due course he has trouble on his hands is i told you so <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord says that he recognises them <e> <s> as far as i can detect no estimate has been given of the transitional costs referred to by the noble lord the minister <e> <s> so far as i know no evidence has been adduced to support the plea that eventual savings must follow although i concede that one might expect there to be savings from the abolition of a tier of local government <e>", "<cs> whether it is my number one priority amendment or not is very difficult to say because as the committee stage goes on my priorities change <e> <s> possibly the government have made too much claim on the savings to be made without being able to substantiate them <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble minister not agree with the comment in <e>", "<cs> my lords i am presented with a difficult problem in following the noble viscount who has spoken with great persuasive powers as he always does <e> <s> before i refer to the matters about which he has spoken at some length i wish to refer briefly to the point made by the noble baroness lady birk which is of very great importance to your lordships house <e> <s> the noble baroness made the point that what the government are doing at report stage is virtually introducing a new bill <e> <s> they are putting forward some very far-reaching amendments indeed which those of us on the opposition benches have had comparatively little time to consider <e> <s> i should have thought that it was a great pity in the conciliatory atmosphere that the noble viscount has been propounding that we have not been conciliated so that we could have had the bill recommitted and then considered these entirely new points certainly about financial controls in the atmosphere of a committee stage rather than at the report stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the view expressed by the noble lord the minister about the position if the bill fails <e> <s> i have been quite rightly subjected to a certain amount of well intentioned humour about the fact that i said it might go on very much longer than people had predicted <e> <s> however i wonder what would happen if after the paving bill the main bill dragged on through another place and through your lordships house for a very long time indeed <e> <s> would the position be that the councillors given an extended term under the terms of this paving bill would then continue on almost indefinitely something like the long parliament of the th century or the rump parliament <e> <s> would it not <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened to everything that has been said during the debate on this particular amendment <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord lord sefton of garston for his support <e> <s> we have been members of the same council in opposition to each other for a number of years <e> <s> he will know that over the period when i was on the county council and he was chairman of it i was then as i still am in principle surprise <e> <s> surprise <e> <s> to the noble lord the minister opposed to the concept of metropolitan <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened to what the noble lord the minister had to say <e> <s> i think the best course at this stage will be to read through his speech and reconsider the matter <e> <s> at this stage i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say briefly that i understand the point that the officers would be protected by obeying the law but i rise only because i have been approached by quite substantial numbers of representatives of nalgo and other people engaged in local government at various levels who said to me that they understand what the provision is but that their problem is that they have local authority councillors cheek by jowel with them telling them to do this or that or the other and at the same time they have a remote shall we say <e> <s> civil servant in whitehall telling them to do something different <e>", "<cs> my lords may i briefly hope even at this late hour and with all the evidence to the contrary that the government will consider this amendment favourably <e> <s> despite all the dark portents which noble lords have indicated about the abuse of section payments overwhelmingly they are for such estimable organisations that even the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter could not find them sinister the marriage guidance councils the citizens advice bureaux <e> <s> councils voluntary services and similar bodies and organisations in the voluntary sector <e> <s> they would come under this heading of grants that have been made for the last two years and for some of the demands to be increased <e>", "<cs>

nature of how this added piece of legislation has been brought before us <e> <s> he underlines the drafting difficulties <e> <s> we on these benches here have the very serious problem of trying to understand the complexity of its proposals at very short notice indeed <e> <s> it is very sad that we should be considering such important amendments at oclock at night with so little preparation and

"<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened carefully to what the noble lord the minister has said and broadly speaking i am reasonably satisfied with the explanation he has given <e> <s> i am a little taken aback that he does not seem willing to extend the consultation procedures provided already under the local government planning and land act i <e>", "<cs> moved amendment no <e>", "<cs> my lords it is obvious from what i have said and from the support i have received from the noble lord lord sefton and my noble friend that there is a strong feeling that the special case that the merseyside conservatives have produced has some merit and is worthy of some consideration <e> <s> my only sorrow is that because of the rather frequent changes and additional clauses that have been put down during earlier stages of the bill it was not practicable to put this amendment down earlier so that one could have gone away and considered what the minister said and returned to it at a later stage if necessary <e> <s> now of course there is no later stage and the advice i have received conflicts with that of the noble lord the minister in that i am advised that this amendment would give the secretary of state the power to bring in various metropolitan counties at different times if he wished <e> <s> that is precedented i am told by section <e>", "<cs> my lords it appears to me that this would be a sensible amendment to accept and i am disappointed that the noble lord the minister cannot bring himself to accept it <e> <s> it seems to me that if the main bill falters and fails it will be a resigning matter for the government and then having resigned they will not be able to carry out their promise to repeal this bill which will go on hanging about perpetually in limbo

dilemma <e> <s> on the one hand we have as i have stated earlier the local authority that is deliberately provocative <e> <s> on the other hand we have a government that is provoked <e> <s> i was

suffer can be protected and the extravagant and wasteful causes can be weeded out <e> <s> as <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not surprised by the reaction of the minister in relation to the amendment <e>

conservative governments would allow themselves to get involved in <e>", "<cs> my lords in this attempt to be reasonable which is brought about partly by the hour and the number of important debates which are to take place i am going to ask for leave to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> i ought to point out that because of the way the government have gone about their legislative programme in this house we are putting down at third reading amendments which in the normal course of events would have been put down for the committee stage when they could have been reconsidered and looked at again

sensitive way that the noble lord lord bellwin has realised that some of us on this side of the house do not go all the way or indeed even a small part of the way with him on the legislation put forward <e> <s> i should like too to thank noble lords on my side of the house <e> <s> strangely enough the noble lords i am thanking are not the same as those whom the minister was thanking <e> <s> i

to those very serious strictures <e> <s> i hope too that the noble friends of the noble lord who has just spoken have listened to him with very great care <e>", "<cs> it might be appropriate if i were to speak now as the noble lord lord carmichael of kelvingrove has suggested on the amendment which deals with the same problem but in relation to the six metropolitan councils <e> <s> the position is in a sense a little more straightforward than that of the metropolitan counties because our proposal is that the already recognised need for a passenger transport authority taken care of in clause makes a very good and neat vehicle for taking on the highways services function and avoids the necessity which is obviously required in london of a special residuary authority <e>", "<cs> whenever we discuss local government finance whether it be at local council level or at parliamentary level always an awful feeling of bewilderment comes over me as we seem to be in an alice-in-wonderland world <e> <s> we have here an amendment moved by the labour benches supported by the conservative london boroughs association opposing the reduction of rents in the north of england which the labour party is alleged to be much in love with and the tory party is alleged much to neglect <e> <s> on the face of it we have a bizarre and perhaps ironic situation in that we are discussing local government finance and the financing of housing for council tenants in this context <e>", "<cs> i agree wholeheartedly with the remarks of the noble lord lord mcintosh <e> <s> i do not believe that he couched his remarks in any way too strongly <e> <s> it has always worried me that the conservative party seems to have an obsessive desire to pick on people who are tenants in the public sector <e> <s> when i was a councillor we used to have rows over what the housing revenue account should include for example whether payment for the cutting of borders and hedges should come from the housing revenue account <e> <s> i do not think we ever debated whether other tenants should be responsible for the arrears of those tenants who got into difficulties <e>", "<cs> i agree totally with what my noble friend lord ross and the noble lord lord dean of beswick have said <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord lord sefton will support me in saying that we have both received communications from the merseyside chamber of commerce <e> <s> i suppose other noble lords have received communications from their chambers of commerce expressing grave concern about the governments proposals for non-domestic rating <e> <s> obviously merseyside is concerned because the non-domestic reassessment seemed to suggest that merseyside having originally been given the impression that it would benefit from the new rating assessment in the north of england is now confronted with a transitional period spoken of as being per cent <e> <s> on a year to year basis against an annual inflation rate of per cent <e> <s> who can calculate how long it will take to reassess the whole of the commercial rating system of the country if one is to impose a per cent <e> <s> annual assessment for the five years to <e> <s> if that is assessed against an inflation rate of perhaps per cent <e> <s> it will take much longer than those five years to bring the systems throughout the country into consistency <e>", "<cs> i shall not make a detailed protest about all the amendments <e> <s> however i must say that in another place they have a guillotine system which we do not have here <e> <s> this amounts virtually to a guillotine system <e> <s> on this side of the chamber we have no real opportunity of checking what this vast number of technical amendments mean <e> <s> the only reason i sit here bemused letting them pass is that nobody has written in to me protesting <e>", "<cs> no no <e>", "<cs> i intervene briefly to explain first that my strangled cry of no no was nothing to do with what the noble lord was saying but was expressing agreement with the noble lord lord dean on another subject <e> <s> secondly i intervene to say that this is a very small problem and i suppose that after the heated and fetid discussions we have had i should declare an interest and say that i am a solicitor in the north of england <e> <s> i have never in my whole career come across one of these agreements <e>", "<cs> the ncc probably hates solicitors too <e> <s> the point to underline is that people entering transactions should not only be protected from their own misfortunes which is what this amendment seeks to do and i support it but in entering what is perhaps the most important transaction in their lives they should make sure that they know the law and seek protection <e>", "<cs> i am glad to hear that the noble baroness lady birk will speak later because she has reminded me if i needed reminding that she has been campaigning against the insidious attempts by the government since they came into office in through their right to buy legislation to include accommodation of this kind for the elderly <e>", "<cs> in order that the committee does not lose its way i should point out that in my groupings list it appears that amendment no <e> <s> zc will be considered at the same time as amendment no <e> <s> i na <e> <s> that does not prevent me even at this late hour from making an impassioned plea for amendment no <e> <s> zc <e> <s> may i receive advice on that point <e>", "<cs> i see it will come later <e> <s> i am much obliged <e>", "<cs> i regret the view that the minister takes although it does not surprise me <e> <s> it is in line with the view that he has taken for many hours today <e> <s> however i ask him to consider the fact that forcible entry into a persons home and seizure of that persons belongings is an intrusive harrowing and humiliating remedy which is inappropriate to the latter part of the th century <e> <s> having said that there seems no point in pursuing the matter to a division <e> <s> i believe that the government should take the opportunity of legislating and should not use the law commissions excuse for putting off what would be a humane piece of housing policy <e> <s> with those words i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i speak as a conveyancing solicitor <e> <s> i suspect that the offer that the minister has made would be sufficient <e> <s> as <e>", "<cs> i will of course accept the assurance partly because of the lateness of the hour and partly because i have no alternative <e> <s> i hope that the ministers expressed intentions will be realised in legislation early in the new session <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i shall not be pressing the amendment at this early hour but my proposal has the merit of simplicity and i hope that the government will consider it in their general consideration of the abuse by certain landlords of the tenants right of first refusal <e> <s> there is a problem and i hope that the government will legislate in due course <e> <s> in a general feeling of possible optimism or more probably light-headedness at this hour i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> that is a fairly clear expression of the views of the government <e> <s> i shall take the matter away think about it and consult those advising me <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i shall consider what the minister has said when i read it in <e>", "<cs> if the minister is going to resist the amendment i think that it is too late at night for me to confront him any further on the matter <e> <s> i hope that his optimism will not prove to be unfounded <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords declare an interest as vice-president of the ama <e> <s> i am very glad that i was not quick enough on my feet to get in sooner because the noble lord lord nugent has put the matter very well <e> <s> like him and the opposition i hope that this amendment will be resisted <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> my lords i broadly agree with the amendment <e> <s> it is a great pity that we have to comment in a vacuum as it were on a consultative document which will not come into <e>", "<cs> my lords i say briefly that the compromise incorporated in this amendment which has been so clearly moved by the noble lord lord mcintosh broadly speaking all compromises mean that someone has to make some sacrifices covers the situation far better than one had feared at the beginning of the dicussion <e> <s> my noble friend lord ross of newport who cannot be here today but who spoke on this matter during our committee proceedings has asked me to say that he is more than willing on behalf of our noble friends to support the amendment <e>", "<cs> the hour is late as we have heard a number of noble lords say very recently <e> <s> all that i need to say is that i am entirely opposed to this amendment which i believe is mischievous <e> <s> conveyancing in this country has been done for generations by solicitors and recently by solicitors and licensed conveyancers <e> <s> to exclude the nomination of people from the professional bodies dealing with those experts would be totally absurd <e> <s> quite frankly i believe that the amendment is mischievous and unhelpful <e>", "<cs> i should like to add my plea to that of the noble lord lord boardman <e> <s> i have practised as a conveyancer for nearly years not in the city of london but in the high street where conveyancing is the life-blood of the profession <e> <s> i assure members of the committee particularly those who live in the rarefied atmosphere of the high court or the city of london that there are already unfair practices brought about by the fierce competition for work to which some solicitors and licensed conveyancers are willing to reduce themselves <e>", "<cs> i moved the amendment in an attempt to be helpful and encourage openness of decision-making <e> <s> i have listened carefully to what the noble and learned lord has said and at this stage i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> in the light of what the noble and learned lord has said it gives me considerable pleasure to withdraw the amendment to enable him to reconsider the matter <e> <s> it shows that it is worth staying up late occasionally <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am very willing to accept the advice so robustly put to me by the noble and learned lord <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am not completely happy with the assurance given to me by the noble and learned lord <e> <s> however i should obviously like time to consider this matter between now and the later stages of the bill <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords it is with an understandable feeling of trepidation and diffidence that i as a welsh solicitor practising in england rise to speak in this debate <e> <s> unfortunately for reasons that i am not aware of scotland has been particularly unlucky in having solicitor peers <e> <s> today i am following such distinguished lawyers as the noble and learned lord the lord advocate and the noble lord lord macaulay <e> <s> i hope that your lordships will bear with me and not think that this is a small way for an english solicitor to get his own back on a scottish lord chancellor for what he is trying to do to our english system <e>"]
