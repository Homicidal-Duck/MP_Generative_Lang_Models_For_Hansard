["<cs> my lords would the government be willing to consider allocating money from development aid to population control projects in countries where those projects exist or are in contemplation <e>", "<cs> my lords i have had something to do with overseas students mainly african students from african commonwealth countries since i came back from ghana in and that i think is my excuse for intervening in this debate <e> <s> i am not animated by any political motive <e> <s> let me say before i go on to my very few remarks that i must apologise to the noble baroness lady young in case i am not here at the end of the debate to listen to her reply <e> <s> but i shall of course read it with the greatest interest in <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful and i am sure the house is grateful to the noble earl for his reply <e> <s> i should like to ask him whether he does not agree that there may be something to be said for the ministerial practice of the late lord halifax when he was foreign <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be very brief indeed <e> <s> this debate has been memorable if not unique because it has displayed a complete and wholehearted agreement between the noble lord lord aldington and my noble friend lord brockway <e> <s> i should like to thank the noble lord lord trefgarne for the undertaking he gave that the government would give serious consideration to the proposals of the brandt report <e> <s> i did not expect him to go further this evening <e> <s> i do not think he will be surprised if i say that i shall not leave him or the government alone until they can come back to this house and say whether or not they accept the main recommendations of the brandt report <e>", "<cs> i apologise my lords he is here <e> <s> i should like to tell him that i have listened to many maiden speeches but that i have listened to none that has shown such an extraordinary excellence in the qualities that your lordships particularly appreciate first-hand experience and balanced judgment <e> <s> i should like to thank all your lordships who have taken part in the debate for your welcome to the broad outline of the brandt report <e> <s> it is indeed impressive that this welcome has come equally from both sides of the house <e> <s> this has been an important expression of parliamentary opinion <e> <s> i hope that it will influence public opinion and the policy of the government <e> <s> my lords i beg leave to withdraw my motion for papers <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his reply and particularly for the statement that an order in council relating to northern ireland is already in draft but may i ask him why the proposals for northern ireland are not extended to england scotland and wales because the problem of sheep worrying is exactly the same in all the rural areas of the united kingdom <e> <s> may i further ask him why the government are still considering a report which was made in favour of the recommendation of a dog warden system for the united kingdom by a government committee four years ago <e>", "<cs> my lords i take a different view from that of the noble lord who has just spoken <e> <s> i should like to thank my noble friend lord houghton for introducing this bill <e> <s> i support it and i hope your lordships will give it a second reading and allow it to proceed to amendment in committee <e> <s> i shall be very brief because at this stage of the debate it is impossible to avoid repeating arguments that other noble lords have made but i think it is important to demonstrate the weight of support in your lordships house for this bill and this may justify a very limited degree of repetition <e>", "<cs> no my lords i suggested that in the case of live animals to other parts of the country and i know that it is more difficult in scotland they should be sent to the nearest convenient slaughterhouse which again from the farmers point of view is best from the standpoint of the quality of the meat <e>", "<cs> i was most anxious that your lordships should have an opportunity to express opinions about this amendment because i was not myself certain whether it was suitable or not <e> <s> but as all of those noble lords who have spoken have supported the amendment and since the noble lord lord nugent of guildford himself has been generous enough to say he would accept this amendment even though he says it makes no difference to the bill i believe it would be in accordance with your lordships wishes if i pressed my amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his full reply one that will correct <e>", "<cs> in supporting the admirable speech of my noble friend lord houghton i shall follow his good example and speak at the same time to the other amendments relating to dogs <e> <s> they hang together because they are all part of a scheme for setting up a nationwide dog warden service run by district councils for the control of stray dogs <e> <s> i wish to underline as lord houghton did the proposal to transfer responsibility for the control of stray dogs from the police to local authorities <e> <s> the main purpose is not to relieve the police although this is a responsibility with which they are often glad to part because the police already have too much on their hands they are undermanned and over-stretched for their primary functions of maintaining law and order and traffic control <e>", "<cs> my lords it might be for the convenience of the house even at this late hour if acting on behalf of my noble friend the chairman of committees i were to comment on the procedural aspects of the two instructions which will be moved if your lordships think fit to give the bill a second reading <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment and the subsequent one because i do not believe that the penalty of imprisonment is an appropriate punishment for the mere possession of cannabis whether imposed by the magistrates courts or any other court <e> <s> i should like very briefly to give my reasons for this view <e> <s> first it is a serious interference with the liberty of the individual to invoke the criminal law against someone who has done no harm and caused no damage to other people <e> <s> a private pleasure which does not result in anti-social behaviour should not be prohibited by the criminal law least of all by the sanction of imprisonment <e> <s> we do not prohibit alcohol as my noble friend lord donaldson remarked although its consumption is much more likely to result in anti-social behaviour <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend the chairman of committees i beg to move the first motion standing in his name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i have noted carefully what my noble friend lord shinwell has suggested and i will certainly draw the attention of my noble friend the chairman of committees to his observations <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the second motion standing in the name of my noble friend the chairman of committees <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his reply and the government for what they have already done <e> <s> may i ask the noble lord since this disaster involves a fellow commonwealth country whether the government will seek the support of other commonwealth countries preferably at the highest level prime minister to prime minister for a long-term resettlement programme to provide all the requirements needed to enable the refugees to become farmers and to live and work on the land near their homes or in other parts of ghana <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the procedural aspects of the instruction moved by the noble earl are concerned i would only say that the instruction is directed to provisions in the bill which are already opposed by a petition deposited by the stafford branch of the national federation of market traders <e> <s> for this reason i can see no procedural objection to its acceptance by the house <e> <s> i would add that it is usual for a select committee when there is an instruction to make a special report of their conclusions to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that my noble friend the chairman of committees will read <e>", "<cs> my lords as your lordships have shown considerable interest in this private bill both in speeches on second reading and again this afternoon it might be appropriate if i as chairman of the select committee to which the bill was referred were to say something about the report and particu-larly about the costs incurred by two of the petitioners the tower hill trust and trinity house <e> <s> i should also like to say something about consultation as that is a matter raised by speakers this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the case of my noble friend lord jenkins for the second reading of this bill and i shall venture to differ not for the first time i am afraid from the views expressed by the noble earl lord cork and orrery <e> <s> i support my noble friend because i believe that the principle of the amendment to subsection of the suicide act is right and after all we are considering the principle of his bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble earl but my hearing is not very good and i am afraid i could not follow exactly what he said <e> <s> however i am sure that he is perfectly correct <e> <s> surely the best way of indicating the circumstances under which someone would not wish life to be prolonged is by means of a written statement executed while in a normal state of health and well in advance of serious illness or extreme old age <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend the chairman of committees i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords as the first speaker from these benches to follow the right reverend prelate i should like to add my words of congratulation to those which have already been expressed to him on his maiden speech to thank him for the special contributions he made from his knowledge of the part of africa in which he worked and to say that we shall very much hope to hear him frequently on future occasions <e> <s> i should also like to say that i share in the thanks expressed by the noble lord lord banks to my noble friend lady ewart-biggs for giving us the opportunity to discuss a subject which touches the conscience of every thinking person <e>", "<cs> my lords following what the noble baroness lady seear said are the government not already giving serious consideration to the future of cassel mental hospital at richmond which is of national and international importance and not just a local hospital and in that respect like the maudsley <e> <s> is the noble baroness aware that a recommendation has been made by the riverside health authority for the closure of the hospital <e> <s> since the final decision is to be made in june should not the government already be giving some consideration to the future of the hospital after june <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the noble lord agree that one of the advantages of a dog registration scheme is that even if only a small amount of money is raised he agrees that that has happened in northern ireland more money would nevertheless be available for local authorities throughout the country generally to provide a dog warden service <e> <s> that would be a most valuable check on irresponsible ownership of dogs <e>"]
