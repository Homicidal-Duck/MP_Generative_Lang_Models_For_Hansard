["<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord lord goronwy-roberts would allow me to intervene for a brief moment <e> <s> i did not put my name down on the list following lord walston this evening because i felt it really almost improper for me as my interest in this matter is so patent to itervene however briefly <e> <s> but i feel moved to spend just two minutes expressing my own feelings on this subject <e> <s> first of all i should like to make quite clear to your lordships house the deep sense of responsibility which as chairman of the company concerned i must feel towards the company its management its shareholders and above all its employees <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord lord skelmersdale will excuse me if i like the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like straightaway to get an expression of gratitude and a declaration of interest off my chest as well as an apology <e> <s> i am afraid that as a result of a very long-standing engagement i am unable perforce to attend for the whole of this debate which is on a subject of great interest to me <e> <s> perhaps i should add the avowal that the occasion for my enforced absence happens to be the unveiling of a remarkable portrait delineating the remarkably handsome features of a member of your lordships house <e> <s> modesty compels me not to reveal his identity <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that it is some of these tibetan philosophies which have something to do with it which a noble earl spoke to your lordships about not long ago <e> <s> but they come from a desire and a desire with which i align myself to curtail so far as it is possible government expenditure <e> <s> that is the simple reason <e> <s> i greatly hope that the gravity of the situation will be matched by a response from the government <e> <s> it would be churlish not to mention small mercies like the recently announced decision to increase the science vote by million and in this context i agree with the noble lord lord sherfield in the tribute that he paid to the secretary of state for education and science <e> <s> it was deserved because it was a difficult and brave decision <e> <s> i note that million of this vote is to go towards major restructuring <e> <s> therefore may i ask my noble friend who will be replying whether this gets serc and the mrc off the levy hook next year and beyond that <e> <s> as for the future i urge the government to build these additional funds into the science vote baseline and to do all that they can to ensure stability for basic scientific research stability in real terms <e>", "<cs> my lords i am always very polite <e> <s> i find it terribly difficult to retain figures in my elderly head but i would assure noble lords that the funds which i am referring to are microscopic <e> <s> in the foreword to the latest report of the medical research council sir james gowans the deputy chairman <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend finally resumes her seat after a very able and <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i can assure my noble friend that my facts are correct <e>", "<cs> my lords i declare an interest a very real interest as chairman of the medical research council in this debate <e> <s> nevertheless my remarks reflect my personal views <e> <s> i welcome like others have this white paper <e> <s> i wish indeed that we could have had it before <e> <s> i also welcome the implication that i take to be there that the government propose to legislate soon and i would hope in the next session <e> <s> it is high time <e>", "<cs> my lords that must be the slippery slope <e>", "<cs> my lords as chairman of the medical research council i must express a deep interest in this debate <e> <s> i shall divide my remarks into two parts first substance and secondly procedure <e> <s> as regards substance as a purely amateur anglican i am not qualified to delve into deep theological waters and shall not therefore do so <e> <s> however as a purely amateur anglican i confess that i go along more willingly with the views expressed by the most reverend primate months ago in our debate in january than with the views that we have just heard so beautifully expressed by the right reverend prelate <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend clarify one point <e> <s> he referred to a contraceptive vaccination <e> <s> the purpose of any such vaccination would be to prevent fertilisation <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to welcome this bill and to express my real satisfaction that it is being introduced first in your lordships house <e> <s> secondly i must confess straight away an interest as chairman of the medical research council <e> <s> i have had the honour to be the chairman of the council for some seven years now <e> <s> in those years our council has sponsored much of the promising research which british scientists and doctors are pioneering <e> <s> i am proud that this is the case <e> <s> for these reasons your lordships will not be surprised to learn that our council has stated that it is <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt my noble friend <e> <s> i have heard what she said on reports <e> <s> it has seemed to me at least that the annual reports from what was the voluntary licensing authority and now is the ila have been very useful indeed <e> <s> that authority has worked on a shoestring and i should have thought it would not be beyond the powers of the bigger authority being set up the statutory one to be able to report to parliament or to the secretaty of state once a year <e>", "<cs> i understand very well the instinctive repugnance expressed by the noble earl lord perth and my noble friend lord home in this matter <e> <s> i heard what the noble earl lord perth said namely that this does not prejudge our decision if we take one as i hope that we shall in two days time on clause <e> <s> however in fact it does prejudge it in a rather important way <e> <s> as the noble lord lord walton said it affects important research in three major areas <e> <s> one is the study alleviation and detection of male infertility which i believe the noble lord said affects one in of fellow males <e> <s> secondly it affects the development of male contraceptive agents which are under study at the present time <e> <s> thirdly it will stop the study of the chromosomal constitution of sperm and thereby the investigation of the contribution that we mere males make to abnormalities in the human embryo <e> <s> those are three extremely important areas of research <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the noble baroness but i found what the noble lord lord walton had to say on this subject extremely persuasive <e> <s> i have not been altogether persuaded by my noble friends <e>", "<cs> i wish to endorse everything which the noble lord lord mcgregor has just said <e> <s> i find myself very sympathetic to the general approach of my noble friend the duke of norfolk and of my noble friends lord lauderdale and lord jenkin on this issue <e> <s> i hope that the government will ensure that there is the widest possible spectrum of lay representation on the authority <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to say that i am very sympathetic towards the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i can add very little to those noble lords who have spoken in support of the amendment moved by the noble lord lord ennals <e> <s> on the face of it it strikes me that the present idea will be discriminatory against the infertile as the noble lord lord ennals said <e> <s> as we know something like one in eight couples in this country at present are infertile <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to express my total agreement with what the noble lord lord dainton has just said and to support my noble friends amendment <e> <s> i am delighted that both at committee and report stages your lordships house has supported research into the early embryo but subject to strict statutory control by the proposed new authority <e> <s> that qualification has been vital to me <e> <s> it is important that when the new authority is set up it should have adequate staffing and teeth <e>", "<cs> my lords i only wish to make a few brief simple and indeed simplistic comments and i do not intend to make a second reading speech <e> <s> first i should like to associate myself with what other speakers have said in thanking the ministers responsible for their handling of this very difficult bill <e> <s> above all i thank the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor on the woolsack for his masterly piloting of it <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl resumes his seat i wish to give him this assurance he expressed the hope that if parliament in its wisdom were to decide that research on the early embryo should be continued subject to strict statutory control this would not diminish other research which is designed to improve genetic conditions <e>"]
