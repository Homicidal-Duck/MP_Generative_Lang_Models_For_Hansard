["<cs> having heard that reply i am very much more inclined to press the amendment than i was before <e> <s> the government must make up their minds <e> <s> i understood the noble lord to say just now that it is not desirable that the director should make pronouncements about anti-competitive practices but that the annual report would be the occasion on which he would make pronouncements about such practices <e> <s> i do not understand this <e> <s> what is the mystery about this <e> <s> surely the point of all this is to let people know what are the anti-competitive practices because in that way they can be discouraged from pursuing or initiating them <e> <s> therefore if we have a clause which says that the director shall address himself to the general public about certain matters why not include in that a non-comprehensive pronouncement from time to time about some practice against which people ought to be warned <e>"]
