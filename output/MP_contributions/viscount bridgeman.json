["<cs> my lords after listening to that very authoritative speech from the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones on the front bench opposite and after hearing the list of legal luminaries whom the noble lord lord wigoder says are going to support him in his action it seems to me the most appalling cheek for a mere layman to get up and intervene in this debate <e> <s> but as the noble lord lord wigoder mentioned the tucker committee and as since the noble and learned lord lord tucker is no longer alive and i am the only member of this house who was on that committee i thought i ought perhaps to come here tonight and give one or two of my recollections about it <e> <s> of course i ought not to have been on that committee at all <e> <s> the original intention of my noble friends was to appoint the late noble lord lord merthyr but he was sent to redefine the boundaries of nigeria and i was drafted in to take his place <e> <s> so there i sat trying to look at the scene from the only angle which i understood which was that of one who sat regularly as the chairman of a magistrates court in a country district doing the same sort of work i imagine as the court at barnstaple normally does <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord carver who has just sat down has done this debate a service because while so many speeches have been concerned with civil defence he simply brought us back into the wider picture which is i am sure the one that we wish to consider tonight <e> <s> talking of civil defence i should like to add my tribute to my noble friend lord murton of lindisfarne because i agreed almost entirely with every word he said <e> <s> i think we should be pleased also with the information that my noble friend lord belstead has given us about the reviewbut i am bound to say that i have still a good many doubts which i have had for the last years that the terms of reference for the review may not be widely enough drawn and the review body may not be properly constituted in order to get a complete answer which is worth while having <e> <s> we are talking now in this debate in an atmosphere showing more interest in civil defence and the wider problem of home defence than i can remember for a very long time <e> <s> that is why i hope that the government will take every opportunity to take advantage of it and will not stop short of measures which could safely be taken <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to say much about conservation because i have not had sufficient experience of it <e> <s> all i would say now is that the problem seems to be rather like the little cloud on the horizon which is the size of a mans hand <e> <s> it will grow if only because there seems to be no limit to the number of conservation societies which can claim to be consulted about the agricultural industry and therefore cause delays <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend realise how wrong some people would think it if there were any suggestion that there should be a time bar to any of these claims <e>", "<cs> my lords speaking for another part of england i should like to support what my noble friend lord ridley has said <e> <s> in my part of the welsh border for a couple of months it has been impossible to get anybody on the land <e> <s> if we had started to plough the footpaths one day we should still be waiting <e>", "<cs> my lords having at one time been concerned with the supervision of the personal services department of the war office i can well appreciate the care and the amount of detailed and thankless work that has gone into the preparation of this bill <e> <s> therefore i fully support its second reading <e> <s> but i hope that my noble friend will forgive me if instead of dealing with the details of the bill i attempt to deal with some of the problems of those who are likely to be affected by it namely manpower <e>", "<cs> my lords this is the first time i have had the honour and privilege of speaking in your lordships house <e> <s> i am most grateful for the opportuntiy to address your lordships <e> <s> may i also pay tribute to the noble lord lord terrington who i know is far from well but who has insisted on coming to the house tonight to put the question to the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend the minister aware that the council of the stock exchange now employs full-time inspectors who regularly visit all member firms and who have unrestricted access to their books and records <e> <s> is he further aware that since the stock exchange has investigated six serious cases of the misuse of suspense accounts as a result of which six of its members have been expelled eight suspended and seven censured and that the findings of all these cases have been made public <e>", "<cs> i must declare an interest i am a member of a stockbroking partnership <e> <s> the surveillance division of the stock exchange has recently been expanded and is absolutely central to the self-regulatory role <e> <s> it will totally negate its functions if for example a data subject under surveillance is able in effect to have access to his or her own files and i would very much hope that the minister will remove this anomaly between the data protection act and this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to declare an interest as a member of the stock exchange <e> <s> i understand that the chairman of the stock exchange has been in correspondence with mr michael howard to voice the stock exchanges concern over the cross-subsidisation provisions of this clause in particular <e> <s> i understand that in a recent letter mr howard has said that the answer lies in our own hands in the success of the sros and the sib in minimising the chance of default <e> <s> would that it did <e> <s> with the greatest respect to the minister this is simply not so <e> <s> the conduct and standards of other sros are out of our hands entirely as the noble lord lord ezra has said <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may intervene in the debate as an active member of the stock exchange <e> <s> i am afraid that i do not find my noble friends amendments very attractive though i note that he gives measured approval to the -day period imposed by the stock exchange <e> <s> i readily accept that the management of companies have the right to know the identity of their shareholders and that they should be able to take steps against shareholders who fail to reveal their identity <e> <s> but shareholders also have rights <e> <s> there is no fundamental conflict between these rights but where conflict occasionally arises a balance must be struck <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to be so ungrateful to my noble friend lord peyton after his generous treatment of me earlier but i am not attracted by this proposal to prevent levels in shareholdings being crossed without a -day pause for reflection <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord gibson referred to the obligations of directors of the new plcs under what is in effect an equity regime <e> <s> we can i am sure be confident that the initial managements of these plcs will be scrupulous in the discharge of their responsibilities both to the <e>", "<cs> my lords may i speak to amendment no <e> <s> f and the remarks of the noble lord lord chorley about the sale of surplus land <e> <s> i understand that the intention at present is that this will be at district valuation reflecting market values <e> <s> i am concerned that the purpose of the element of this scheme will be defeated if it proves too costly to acquire the lands <e> <s> will my noble friend the minister give an indication of any financial assistance which may be forthcoming to help mitigate this problem <e>", "<cs> as a special trustee of the hammersmith hospital i suppose i owe my office to my noble friend lord jenkin <e> <s> i add my support to the noble lord lord dainton <e> <s> there is total inter-dependence between the hammersmith hospital and the royal postgraduate medical school <e> <s> i very much hope that my noble friend will accept that there should be academic membership on this and on the other special health authorities not by regulation at the whim of successive secretaries of state but by statute incorporated in the bill <e>"]
