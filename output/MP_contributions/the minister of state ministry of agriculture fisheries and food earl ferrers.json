["<cs> my lords i am conscious that everyone who has taken part in this debate albeit a short one this afternoon has had a greater experience than i have over the question of the european parliament

nearly but not quite right <e> <s> any generosity which your lordships would give to a maiden speaker has been forfeited by me i am afraid because one of the charming idiosyncracies of this house is

bread-making over feed wheats and by government contributions to research and advisory services <e>", "<cs> my lords following the statement in another place on friday the house will know that the noble lord the leader of the house has been appointed governor of rhodesia <e> <s> i know that my noble friend lord soames very much regretted that he was unable to announce to the house personally his appointment to the post of governor of rhodesia during the interim period up to the elections <e> <s> he hopes that the house will extend its indulgence to him and will understand that the delicacy of the final negotiations concerning the ceasefire made it impossible for him to announce his appointment while the house was sitting <e> <s> i am sure that i would be expressing the feelings of your lordships from every part of the house if i were to say that we wish him every success in what can only be a difficult and formidable task <e> <s> our best wishes go with him <e>", "<cs> my

lords <e>", "<cs> my lords there are people who wish to take part in what is really the subject matter for debate this afternoon before we come on to an unstarred question <e> <s> the house might consider it appropriate that your lordships are now prepared to resume the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords the government support the broad objective of the commission to cut the communitys maximum quotas by about million tonnes but we do not accept the proposed redistribution of quotas which would unfairly penalise the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not convinced that any change in the procedure governing unstarred questions is necessary but i certainly would not wish to stand in the way of a reference of the matter to the procedure committee <e> <s> should my noble friend wish to

somewhat out of order <e> <s> the noble lord did stand up to speak and it is the usual courtesy to hear a noble lord if he wishes to speak <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> such a restraint on ownership

is a report stage and noble lords can only speak once <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships have been commendably brief on this bill and i will endeavour to do the same because fish and the hazards to which fish are subjected and fishing and the hazards and indeed the pleasure to which fishermen are subjected are always a matter of keen interest <e> <s> in seeking to demonstrate the value of the principle on which this bill is based i need not detain your lordships too long because as my noble friend said it is only two years since your lordships approved a similar bill which was enacted for scotland <e> <s> with the benefit of hindsight i suppose one might regret that that bill had not been drafted so as to cover the whole of great britain because fish like other animals are no respecters of boundaries <e> <s> but the present bill is closely modelled on the scottish act and in effect as my noble friend has said it does no more than extend its provisions to england and wales

been dealing with it for a long while <e> <s> i remind the house that this is only a statement and many noble lords have asked not one question but have taken two bites at the cherry <e> <s> therefore i think it might be appropriate for the house to move on to the next business <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether your lordships may feel that we have probably gone far enough along this road

business <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has as we would have expected of him given a good robust fighting political speech <e> <s> one of the great pleasures of this house is that you can enjoy a speech of that nature and applaud it and appreciate it even if you do not happen to agree with its contents <e> <s> the noble lord said that what the government have done was shocking and disgraceful

much obliged to the noble lord lord peart for expressing the hope that i can tell him many new things that he does not already know but i did not think that i can tell the noble lord anything <e> <s> however i agree with him i think that this has been a quite outstanding debate because it has been the distillation of a very great deal of hard work <e> <s> i think it was the noble lord lord roberthall who said that if the committees had done a lot of work we should not forget those who had testified to them because it was their work and efforts which enabled the committees to make their reports <e> <s> my noble friend lady elliot of harwood said that she had had stacks of papers to read and that that involved much hard work but i have no doubt that she will not forget the work put in by those departments that had to produce those stacks of papers <e> <s> the work of departments in providing information for such committees is considerable <e>", "<cs> my lords the annual rate of pension contribution by civil servants at st january pay rates amounted to about per cent <e> <s> of the expenditure on civil service pensions in <e> <s> the scheme is unfunded so that no employer contribution as such is paid <e> <s> on the actuarial assumptions which were used in the pay research exercise the notional employer contribution to a funded scheme would have been of the order of for

every of employee contribution <e>", "<cs> my lords the house has in the past welcomed the opportunity of a general debate on the annual defence estimates as a whole <e> <s> i am not sure that it would be right to alter what has become a well-established procedure unless there is agreement from all quarters of the house <e> <s> while i recognise the arguments behind my noble friends question the creation of two debates where one has previously sufficed would entail more speeches your lordships might not consider that to be a happy prospect <e> <s> the second of the two debates would inevitably begin at a late hour <e> <s> the house has had and will continue to have the opportunity to discuss the more specialised aspects of defence policy on separate occasions <e> <s> for these reasons i think that one general debate would be for the greater convenience of the house as a whole <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships may consider that important though this subject is it might be more appropriate if we moved on to the next business <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be helpful if the noble lord would put his observations in an interrogatory form <e>", "<cs> my lords we may not have exhausted this question but if we continue for another minutes i doubt whether we will do so <e> <s> your lordships may feel that we have given this question a good run for its money and perhaps it would be proper to move on to the next one <e>", "<cs> my lords we maintain a substantial and we believe adequate fishery protection effort within our fishery limits <e> <s> our fishery protection resources enable us normally to have at least nine surface vessels on fishery protection duties at any one time <e> <s> aerial surveillance is also provided by raf nimrods and other aircraft <e>",

without these labels i hope that she will let me know <e>", "<cs> my lords with the permission of the house i will repeat a statement which has been made by my right honourable friend the minister of agriculture in another place <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments objective is to secure a satisfactory outcome to the negotiations on the common fisheries policy which must include appropriate measures on conservation <e> <s> we are of course aware that the fishing industry has been facing very real problems because of increased costs and weak markets <e> <s> we have introduced a programme of temporary additional aid and pressed for changes in the tariffs which are applied to certain imports from outside the community <e> <s> fisheries ministers will be meeting representatives of all sectors of the industry on rd july to reassess the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords the slaughterhouses act provides that animals shall either be slaughtered instantaneously by means of a mechanically-operated instrument in proper repair or be subjected to stunning effected by means of a mechanically-operated instrument or an electrical stunning instrument in proper repair and instantaneously rendered insensible to pain until death supervenes <e> <s> the only exemptions from this requirement which have been granted by parliament concern the slaughter of animals by the jewish and moslem methods for the food of jews and moslems and this must be without the infliction of unnecessary suffering <e> <s> these exemptions have featured in our law for a very long time <e> <s> the position is similar in scotland and northern ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords her majestys government have no plans to transfer the functions of the advisory committee on pesticides to the health and safety executive <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble baroness for having explained the purpose of the amendment <e> <s> she was correct in saying that the government have taken powers in clause to do virtually what she wishes and of course the purpose of clause is to enable the secretary of state to suspend the progressive surcharge provisions by order <e> <s> the government intend using this power straight away and it is proposed that it will take effect from st april <e> <s> provision for the liability to surcharge to be reintroduced by a further order is included in the clause simply because there may be justification for it to be reintroduced by changed property market conditions in the future and of course that would not be the case if the amendment were accepted <e> <s> it seems to the government that there could be times when conditions in the commercial property market might encourage a degree of undesirable speculation especially in office building <e> <s> for that reason it is preferable to keep the surcharge powers on the statute book so they could be reintroduced by order if necessary <e> <s> i accept the conditions attached to the proposed abolition in the amendment which seek to ensure continued liability in respect of any surcharge levied before the suspension order comes into force <e> <s> i can tell the noble baroness that the government intend to include in the order the necessary provisions to achieve this effect <e> <s> i hope that will satisfy the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> we agree that the minister of agriculture and the secretary of state for wales should have the powers to increase the maximum precept which can be levied by a water authority on county councils where that proves necessary in view of the fact that the level was originally set as my noble friend said way back in <e> <s> we think this is a reasonable suggestion and i am happy to accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the closures result from the decisions of the companies operating those mills decisions which are based on their commercial judgment <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that your lordships will permit me to reply on behalf of my noble friend the leader of the house <e> <s> this is primarily a matter for the administration committee to consider and i would not think it correct for my noble friend the leader of the house to pre-empt any decision to which that committee might come <e> <s> i would suggest to my noble friend lord inglewood that the right course would be for him first to raise this question with the administration committee and to seek their considered view <e> <s> if having received that he is not satisfied then he may of course wish to have recourse to a further question on the floor of the house <e> <s> i would prefer therefore to go no further than that at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords before the house begins the report stage of the bill it is i think correct that on behalf of the leader of the house i should tell the house that i have been advised that amendment no <e> <s> in the name of the noble viscount lord thurso and others is irrelevant to the subject-matter of the bill

ewes together with the option of operating either intervention or a variable premium which is in effect a weekly deficiency payment and is on similar lines to our previous fat sheep guarantee <e> <s> member states who operate the variable premium must recover an amount equivalent to the premium on sheep or carcases which they export <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord lord campbell of croy must have had an unfortunate experience because i happened to come here fairly late too and was not so obstructed but perhaps i was lucky <e> <s> certainly if noble lords are obstructed and
