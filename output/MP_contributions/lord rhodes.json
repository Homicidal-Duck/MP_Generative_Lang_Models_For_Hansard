competent and which comment on the textile trade such as the <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the noble baroness has a case and that what she says can be substantiated <e> <s> is the minister also aware that there is grave reluctance on the part of eec officials to invoke any of the safeguard clauses provided under the treaty of rome <e> <s> one of the principal reasons for that is the shortage of staff <e> <s> whether the action is deliberate or not we do not know <e> <s> however we should be very glad if the minister could find out <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is confusing the issue <e> <s> the noble baroness is talking not about a case of dumping but about fixing the quotas <e> <s> i should like to ask the noble lord whether he will inquire in europe <e> <s> it is as regards the policing of the safeguards that labour is in short supply <e>", "<cs> my lords if i had not seen an announcement in the paper at the weekend i would not have been taking part in this debate this afternoon <e> <s> i saw this in my local paper the <e>", "<cs> my lords i used to say that a man only became mature after he had fought a parliamentary election <e> <s> i have an addendum to that a man only becomes mature in this sort of thing after he has served for several months investigating the pros and cons of something like the tokyo round <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble lord lord schon for raising this subject <e> <s> it is nearly years since he came to the board of trade when i was the minister there pleading for assistance from the government to start that wonderful enterprise that bears part of his name <e> <s> in those days he did not have quite as big an expanse of shirt and i do not think he knew anything about marks spencer <e> <s> suffice it to say that what was agreed between government and the schons has reflected not only great credit on the schon family but also on the then government who made it possible <e>", "<cs> my lords we ought not to allow this to pass without drawing attention to the fact that this is a classic instance of the necessity for government intervention in certain circumstances at the right time <e> <s> i should like to ask the minister a question <e> <s> does he think that two years to move in dealing with these shares is enough <e> <s> because i do not <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that gigantic losses are being made at present by the fibres industry in this country due to the disparity in oil prices throughout the world <e> <s> is he aware that if that is allowed to continue for many more months much of our fibres industry in this country will have to close down <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the fibres industry depends on oil as a basic raw material <e> <s> if other countries have oil at prices below those available to us we are bound to lose out and it will not be long before the fibres industry of this country is on its beams end <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister then substitute american for european <e>", "<cs> does the minister realise what he has said <e> <s> does he realise how much money other government departments are pouring into job creation schemes and all kinds of schemes for young people <e> <s> surely he would back up the virtue of what has been proposed <e> <s> does he realise how long it takes one to get a ceiling done at home because of the lack of skilled operatives <e> <s> i have been waiting for six months for a ceiling that a good plasterer could do <e>", "<cs> my lords before the lord advocate sits down may i ask him if he would examine what the italians and the japanese do in similar circumstances <e> <s> in those countries when there is a depression the unit of production is the one that is dealt with and the mothballing is commanded by the government <e> <s> it is the unit of production on which they give relief it is not the building <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister pay me the compliment of listening to what i shall have to say on this subject in todays debate since i have something constructive to say <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord lord lever of manchester sits down may i ask him whether in his wisdom he will elaborate a little on what he said at the beginning of his speech namely that we did not join the ems because of the lower rate of the pound <e> <s> what does lie think now about our joining the ems with the high value of the pound <e>", "<cs> my lords i join with other noble lords in congratulating the right reverend prelate the bishop of lincoln on his speech <e> <s> he identified himself with what is going on in the country in regard to unemployment and we were glad to hear him <e> <s> we were also glad to hear what the noble lord lord weinstock had to say <e> <s> the noble lord lord weinstock will be a tremendous asset to this house <e> <s> he has kept the flag flying for generators all over the world particularly in the far east and it has needed some doing because practically every hid has a counter-bid from japan to per cent <e> <s> lower and he has coped with it <e>", "<cs> my lords that is right <e> <s> the noble lord would not be sitting on that side of the house if it had gone through <e> <s> he would be sitting over here <e> <s> free collective bargaining without an incomes policy is like bringing on your fast bowler without a stumper <e> <s> but i am glad that the government have at last come round to acknowledging the need for guidelines at any rate by settling on per cent <e> <s> for the public sector <e>", "<cs> my lords we have done a lot of talking about small businesses <e> <s> there has been more tripe talked about small businesses than there has about the economy which is saying a lot <e> <s> but they have neglected one of the most potent parts of what would go towards establishing and developing small businesses <e> <s> do noble lords realise that

the simple condition that they did not <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware of the growing disparity between awards given in civil courts for disablement and the awards given by the government for disablement which occurs as a result of service in her majestys forces <e>", "<cs> my lords may i draw the noble lords attention to the fact that there is a growing disparity between awards given in civil courts as distinct from awards given by government for disablement in her majestys governments forces <e> <s> is that plain my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the first question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that i have in my hand a document showing mill closures over the last few months in the man-made fibre section none of which is in the clothing and the woollen section <e> <s> is he aware that the nature of these closures is causing considerable alarm to others remaining in the trade because of the imbalance which is resulting <e> <s> this document shows a preponderance of spinning firms which have closed down <e> <s> also the firms which are making industrial fabrics are in danger of having no viable organisation after these closures <e> <s> will the minister meet the industry as they want to meet him to discuss this very problem <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that it is not protection at this moment that i am asking for in my question <e> <s> what i am asking is that there should be a commonsense attitude in his department and for them to be aware of what is happening month by month so that at any rate when we emerge from this recession we shall have a viable industry <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that there are many firms which were well run and profitable when interest rates were lower which are likely to close down <e> <s> is he aware that many firms are gallantly prepared to carry on over the next few months if they could be helped by the government in some way <e> <s> is the noble viscount aware that this is not an original thought of mine for it is already happening in belgium and holland to help their industries in similar circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords may i congratulate the noble baroness lady masham of ilton on being able to introduce this subject today <e> <s> she has fought a valiant fight for the disabled over many years <e> <s> i am certain that the house is indebted to her for all that she has done <e> <s> we say to the noble viscount lord mersey who has made a maiden speech this afternoon thank you for what you have said in the contribution that you have made to the debate <e> <s> the noble viscounts father was a greatly respected member of this house <e> <s> his courtesy was well known to everybody and his mastery of the procedures of this house as chairman of committees was appreciated and known by everybody <e> <s> it is nice to come into this house after such a father but i am sure that his father would have <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that these subsidised exports from america have already destroyed two-thirds of our carpet industry <e>", "<cs> my lords it is two going on for a third <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome this debate and i congratulate the noble lord lord brockway for having initiated it <e> <s> i am only sorry on one point and that is that i never asked him to go with me to china and hong kong in or and in april this year when i am asked by the peoples republic of china to go again <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always a pleasure to listen to the noble lord lord thorneycroft whom we respected and heard so often in the house of commons <e> <s> but before i continue with what i have to say may i say to the right reverend prelate the bishop of liverpool that we liked what he had to say we liked him and that he could have done a very useful job just about now in barbados <e> <s> i was lord lieutenant in lancashire for some three years and i grew to love liverpool <e> <s> during those three years i visited liverpool times at various functions <e> <s> we hope that we shall have the pleasure of listening to the right reverend prelate on many occasions in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords when i came this morning i had no idea that i was going to make a front bench speech <e> <s> may i say that i am very pleased indeed to have the opportunity to support the noble viscount lord rochdale who was the chairman of this committee in what he has had to say about it <e> <s> it says in our report that the second proposal that we are discussing was made earlier this year as part of the preparations for the mfa negotiations <e> <s> therefore in a way it is tied into the mfa negotiations which are taking place <e> <s> they had a meeting on th october they had a meeting in geneva on th november and they had one yesterday <e> <s> i wonder whether the minister when he replies would give the house some indication as to what has happened up to date <e> <s> are they still argy-bargying or what is happening <e>", "<cs> my lords at this point may i interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> i gave prior notice of this <e> <s> would the noble lord deal with my very strong appeal to do something about cocom <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that there is very little difference between what he has said this afternoon and what he said on th may <e> <s> further is he aware that during the month of june there has been a dramatic change in the attitude of the united states of america towards this question to their advantage and to our detriment <e>", "<cs> i think this was necessary my lords particularly in view of the legislation which the reagan government put through in june of this year covering re-exports of american strategic materials although they were exported from a country other than the united states <e> <s> can the british government be sued in american courts on this matter <e> <s> i would comment that this is a long-standing worry to the department of trade i remember in the westinghouse argument on uranium when we were taken through the american courts <e> <s> i congratulate the minister on having done what he has <e>", "<cs> my lords i had the honour in the summer to introduce to this house or help to introduce my noble friend lord maclehose <e> <s> he came hard on the heels of one of the most distinguished governorships that this country has ever known <e> <s> he has a big contribution to make to it now <e> <s> but i should also like to break with tradition and mention his wife because during those years that he was the governor of hong kong she backed him up <e> <s> the number of people who arrived in hong kong suffering from jet lag and were helped by his wife are too numerous to mention and i hope he will convey to her the approval and approbation of at any rate one member of the house of lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i congratulate the noble lord polwarth on introducing this debate today knowing as i do what he has done for the arts in his native scotland <e> <s> i note that one or two of the recommendations which he made in evidence have got through to become recommendations for attention by the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to congratulate the noble lord lord greenhill on his speech this afternoon <e> <s> i have had the pleasure of sitting under his chairmanship for many months during which time this report has evolved <e> <s> i would say to those who are pessimistic arising from a perusal of the report that it is far too early to start talking about going out of the common market we have not been at the job years yet <e> <s> it takes years for anything of a major nature to have an impact on mankind <e> <s> i bear evidence from world war i and carry it round with me day after day <e> <s> when i think of world war i i think of the way that europe tore itself to bits and then leading up to world war ii much of what we have been talking about this afternoon and previously is very academic <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister to congratulate the negotiators for the excellent job they have done <e> <s> would he agree that this shows what can be achieved if europe speaks with a united voice <e>", "<cs> my lords we owe our thanks to the noble lord lord greenhill of harrow for introducing this matter this afternoon <e> <s> we who sat on the committee were privileged to sit under his chairmanship because he proved himself one of the best chairmen that ever i have sat under

of congratulating him on a very good speech and to hope that we hear him many times again <e> <s> to the noble lord lord bruce who is a lot younger man than i am i say that i am not going to rake up the subject of whether we should be in or out of the common market <e>", "<cs> my lords the house of commons select committee came to certain conclusions after a study of the arts <e> <s> to us the case for fostering the arts rests on the immediate need to stimulate the constructive and active use of leisure by the many <e> <s> arts for all <e> <s> i do not believe that enough is being done in localities to foster the arts <e> <s> i think that more could be done and will be done because of the impetus that is now set free to do more about art in the provinces <e>", "<cs> my lords whoever

who are less well able to cope with the pressures of inner city living <e> <s> we have probably more hostel accommodation in the inner city of manchester than most other cities of the same size <e>", "<cs> and in manchester which i spoke of <e>", "<cs> my lords i join in thanking the noble lord lord wells-pestell for having introduced this <e>", "<cs> my lords we are indebted to the noble lord lord fanshawe for raising this subject on an unstarred question tonight <e> <s> it is an important one <e> <s> in rising to speak i wish to make it clear that much of what i am going to say represents the views of my noble and disappointed friend lord kadoorie who has come all the way from hong kong to speak but unfortunately has not taken the oath in this parliament without which it is impossible to sit and speak in your lordships house <e> <s> much of what he had to say is being said through me <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord brimelow has been a delightful chairman of our subcommittee <e> <s> he has not spared himself or us in the compilation of this report <e> <s> if one is ideologically against the common market lom is not a good thing but if one is committed to the common market as i believe we are for all time we ought to give it a chance because it takes a long time for human behaviour to change lom is a good thing <e> <s> what we have been trying to do while we have been discussing it upstairs is to improve it <e>", "<cs> my lords i congratulate the noble lord lord jenkins on introducing this subject and i congratulate the noble viscount lord eccles on

arts association <e> <s> i think it is a pity that more time has not been given for this debate but at any rate it enables us to ask a few questions vital to our increased reponsibilities in the regions <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that during last year letters were received by the bbc overseas service from mainland china and that whatever is decided in terms of the site for this broadcasting station it is essential that we should be getting on with this new station so that we can take advantage of the friendship that is extended to us by the letters <e>", "<cs> my lords this house owes a debt of gratitude to the noble lord lord brimelow <e> <s> he has had two very difficult subjects to chair in sub-committee b and his masterly explanation this afternoon again is putting the house in his debt <e> <s> i want to ask one or two practical questions similar to those i have asked before on such occasions as this <e> <s> first how many copies of this report have been printed where have they gone and has there been any reaction from brussels to the report <e> <s> because if we cannot expect a reaction from brussels we shall soon be in the position of the petition procedure in the house of commons where a member of parliament gets thousands of signatures in his constituency and brings piles of petitions down to the house of commons and after a brief statement the custodians stuff them all into the great green bag behind the speakers chair <e> <s> honour is satisfied and nobody ever sees or hears anything of them any more <e> <s> this is an occasion when we have to consider what value there is in a report of this sort <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very fortunate to be able to follow the noble earl and to congratulate him on his maiden speech <e> <s> the majority of the house may not have realised while he was talking that he put his finger on one of the most important facets one that is not very often mentioned and that is the co-development of shenzhen alongside hong kong <e> <s> i do not suppose that the noble earl has ever been able to forget that he had a very illustrious progenitor called f e smith and neither have we in the north of england because we were always proud of him not perhaps because of his legal prowess but because he never forgot his origins which in my opinion is a virtue <e> <s> the noble earls speech was first-class and i hope that the house will have the opportunity of hearing him many times in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords may i intervene very briefly without having my name down to speak <e> <s> i have just returned from australia where i have had several weeks of discussions of all kinds <e> <s> one of the main requests to me was that for information about our progress in the common market <e>
