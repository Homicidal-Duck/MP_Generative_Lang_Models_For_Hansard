legal right to benefit <e>", "<cs> i rise to support this amendment <e> <s> briefly i should like to make three points <e> <s> first as those members of the committee who have for a long time been involved in voluntary work will agree or years ago it was quite easy to get voluntary workers who would come and give their services for nothing <e> <s> now as i have found myself all such workers insist on having their out-of-pocket expenses particularly their transport paid <e> <s> secondly today many of these voluntary workers come from long distances <e> <s> the third point i should like to make in connection with unemployed people is that many of <e>", "<cs> i too should like to support this amendment and i do so particularly in the context <e>", "<cs> with great respect to the noble lord it is extremely unlikely that such refugees would be in a position to earn quickly <e> <s> indeed it may take a year or more before their position in the country is legalised <e>", "<cs> my lords i also rise to support the amendment and in doing so i should like to ask the noble baroness whether she will bear in mind particularly the special needs of asylum-seekers and those awaiting leave to remain in this kingdom <e> <s> i think that your lordships will agree that many of those people have very special needs some of which were mentioned in committee and i feel that those needs are particularly applicable to this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl prepared to disclose to the house that of the letters received by his department in response to the governments amendment to the education bill on sex education in schools some per cent <e> <s> were in favour of the amendment <e> <s> does he agree that that represents widespread opposition in the country to the type of instruction described in the question <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for that constructive answer <e> <s> nevertheless does she agree that human rights violations in iran are on a larger and more terrible scale than anywhere else in the world including even latin america <e> <s> is she aware that according to well documented evidence some different types of torture are carried out in iran in prisons quite apart from the slaughter of thousands of boy soldiers in the war against iraq some of them as young as years <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that the present representative of the plo in london faisal awaidha belongs to the moderate mainstream element of the plo and that he has consistently shown a moderate attitude during the three and a half years he has been in charge of the office <e>", "<cs> my lords in welcoming the debate on this question and in congratulating the noble lord lord brockway for introducing it so clearly and so sincerely perhaps i may say at the outset that i am firmly opposed to the supply of arms and even of non-military material such as clothing transport and so on for countries which flagrantly and persistently violate human rights <e>", "<cs> my lords in this debate i shall don my railway hat or perhaps i should more appropriately say the cloth cap of the railway lover if railway lovers wear cloth caps <e> <s> i am still somewhat ambivalent about the bill as a whole <e> <s> i shall speak from the railway angle <e> <s> i have been swung over to general support for the bill largely by the excellent presentation that british rail have arranged at waterloo <e> <s> i looked through the visitors book and saw that the minister who will reply and myself are the only two noble lords who have visited that exhibition but i may be wrong <e>", "<cs> forgive me my lords i shall not speak about the environmental and safety aspects of this matter because they have been dealt with <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to support the noble earl lord longford in this debate not least because he supported me so gallantly when i moved my amendment to the education bill as it then was last june <e> <s> some of your lordships may remember that the essence of that amendment which was finally accepted by the government though in a somewhat emasculated form was that where sex education was given in schools it should have due respect for moral values and for the promotion of stable family life <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to enforce briefly what has been said so ably and comprehensively by the noble lords lord mishcon and lord avebury <e> <s> indeed they have covered between them so much ground in such great detail including several points i wanted to make myself that there seems little more for subsequent speakers to say <e>", "<cs> my lords i am indeed grateful to the noble baroness who has replied and to all noble lords who have taken part in this debate many of them as i said earlier at very short notice <e> <s> i think that we would all agree that the ground has been covered very fully and effectively <e> <s> there were several important points made which filled in the lacunae in my own speech <e> <s> since there is a little time in hand perhaps i may refer to one or two points that were made by noble lords and which were not picked up exactly by the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> i also strongly support this amendment and i want to deal particularly with ugandans <e> <s> various noble lords have mentioned idi amin as though he was still in power so let me remind the committee that he was overthrown in <e> <s> i know of several ugandans now living in britain who were suffering severe persecution in the amin reign <e> <s> this was in the mid-s when i was working in the foreign and commonwealth office after a spell in uganda <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not intend to make a lengthy contribution to this debate <e> <s> as in previous years i shall deal first with the area where i have spent the greater part of my life the middle east <e> <s> i am glad that the problems of the middle east are once more mentioned in the gracious speech but since i initiated a debate on that subject on th april in this house i do not intend to repeat now what i said on that occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords it gives me great pleasure to support the noble lord lord mcgregor of durris in his advocacy of family courts <e> <s> i should like to add my very warm congratulations to those expressed to the noble lord lord blyth on his splendid maiden speech <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble earl for that answer perhaps i may take the opportunity of congratulating him on his new appointment <e> <s> as one of the friends of st pauls who has been inspired by this superb building over the past years i should like to ask the minister whether he is aware that the misgivings about the proposed developments expressed recently by his royal highness the prince of wales are widely shared throughout this country <e> <s> is he further aware that many overseas visitors to london and particularly those coming from france and italy are also seriously disturbed by these proposals <e> <s> their governments would never permit similar buildings in the vicinity of st peters in rome or notre dame <e>", "<cs> my lords it gives me great pleasure to add my congratulations to the noble lord lord deedes for his memorable maiden speech which i am sure made a great impression on all of us on the basis of his wide experience <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> does he not agree that whereas in the central western and southern parts of the country there seems to he a general stability and the government are in effective control nevertheless in the northern and eastern parts instability continues and is accompanied by killings some of which are attributed to the government and some to the opposition <e> <s> is the minister satisfied that the staff of her majestys high commission in kampala have access to all parts of the country <e>", "<cs> my lords i have been asked to intervene in this debate and shall do so very briefly <e> <s> first i should like to apologise to the minister for the fact i was not in my place when he opened his speech <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will give way i think i emphasised the distinction between radical and less radical interferences <e> <s> i think that the most reverend primate would agree with me that one must make such a distinction certainly many of the proposals in this white paper are by no means radical <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that helpful reply <e> <s> can be tell the house why there appears to have been some delay in the granting of visas to the husbands of the two girls <e> <s> secondly will be accept that the yemeni ambassador in london has been consistently helpful and co-operative in this difficult and delicate matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i emphasise at the outset that the problem which we have been discussing is not confined to the united kingdom <e> <s> we know that there are large numbers of single homeless people in france where emergency provision was made for them during the cold winter last year <e> <s> we read that the pope recently gave a dinner in rome for the homeless <e> <s> in the united states i understand that in new york and other large cities the problem is perhaps even as grave as it is in britain <e> <s> i mention that because i recommend that the government study the situation in those countries as well as such remedies as may have been found <e>", "<cs> my lords i assure the house that i shall he very brief <e> <s> one point that i was unable to raise at the committee stage ought to be made and it should run through our thinking in considering all these amendments <e> <s> i hope that i may have some support from the spiritual benches in this <e> <s> in considering homosexuality in all its forms and in its various manifestations one must realise that basically it undermines family life <e>", "<cs> my lords the hour is late and i can claim no special expertise on the subject <e> <s> i should like to deal with three areas that have not yet been covered <e> <s> i should first like to fill in a few lacunae in the statistics adduced by the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs and other noble lords <e> <s> they are of some interest <e> <s> statistics show that in britain per cent <e> <s> of serious head injuries involve alcohol as do per cent <e> <s> of suicide attempts and deaths <e> <s> out of an annual admission figure of approximately to psychiatric hospitals are connected with <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to start by thanking the noble lord lord mayhew for his very revealing speech with which i entirely sympathise <e> <s> as your lordships may know i have spoken four or five times on this subject in the past four or five years the last occasion was in a debate which i myself initiated in april last year <e> <s> noble lords also know that i am sympathetic to the arab cause although of course not in any way opposed to the jews themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords it is with some diffidence that i rise to address your lordships on this difficult delicate and perhaps i might even say dangerous subject <e> <s> however i do so because like the noble duke the duke of norfolk and the noble earl lord longford i am basically opposed to abortion because i equate it with killing <e> <s> there must be many people in this country quite apart from catholics who hold this view <e> <s> i am prepared in certain circumstances to accept that abortion may be justifiable particularly to save the life of the mother but i do not feel that it is a universal panacea for coping with handicapped fetuses and i shall deal with that later <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for not having put my name on the list of speakers but i intend to be brief <e> <s> i intervene because i feel strongly that something should be said about the relationship between buildings and behaviour <e> <s> i should like to congratulate the noble lord lord st john for his brilliant and informative speech <e> <s> i should also like to congratulate other noble lords who have spoken in the debate because i have learnt a great deal from them <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support my noble friend lord somers as strongly as i can <e> <s> to a great many christians good friday is the most sacred and special day in the whole year and it is as <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support my noble friend lord hylton <e> <s> i have been in touch with individual refugees over the past nine or years <e> <s> i gave personal asylum to several of them and i think i can say without hesitation that the refugees i know who are probably typical of many in this country are gravely disturbed by the provisions of the bill <e> <s> they are particularly disturbed about the erosion of immigrants rights the disruption of family life and perhaps most important of all the terrible sword of damocles that of <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say a few words in my capacity as honorary treasurer of the christian broadcasting council of great britain about the moral standards or more appropriately the lack of moral standards set by the bbc <e> <s> there can be no doubt that many members of the public to judge by mary whitehouses listeners and viewers association which had its annual general meeting on saturday are still gravely concerned at the continuing permissive trend and particularly the emphasis on sex and violence that characterises so many of todays programmes <e> <s> and it is pointless to say that so many of these programmes are shown late at night when apart from children being allowed to stay up late the programmes can be recorded and shown to the whole family <e>", "<cs> we have heard the voice of judaism in our chamber today but we have no moslem voice <e> <s> i am not a moslem but on various occasions i have spoken on behalf of the moslem faith <e> <s> i rise briefly to endorse what the noble baroness lady cox has said namely that the moslems feel very strongly that christian education in our schools should be given a more positive image <e> <s> i have heard that from a great many of them and those that i have consulted the eminent moslem divines feel that christian teaching does not necessarily clash with islamic teaching <e> <s> both christianity and islam are monotheistic religions and moslems recognise christians as people of the book <e>", "<cs> my lords like many noble lords who have spoken this evening i warmly <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for that intervention <e> <s> we would all agree that it is a difficult and complex problem <e> <s> however those people who have studied the problem in depth perhaps the noble earl lord longford who is to speak later will confirm this point would agree that there is a good deal of information based on sound research to indicate the harm that these programmes do <e> <s> one has only to look at the correspondence of mary whitehouse and several organisations with which i am connected to see that that is the case <e> <s> however i do not think it is profitable to pursue this point in any detail at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords it gives me great pleasure to thank the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos for initiating this interesting debate because he has supported me on many occasions when we have both spoken on similar subjects <e>", "<cs> my lords i warmly welcome this opportunity to speak about africa having spent several years in uganda kenya and tanzania and having visited something like eight or nine other african countries <e> <s> in the very brief time available to me i intend to deal with four countries each for a specific reason <e> <s> first uganda because it is the country i know best secondly mozambique where famine conditions are appalling and little understood and finally botswana and kenya to illustrate ongoing aid projects <e> <s> the botswana project has only been partially successful but kenya has had a very successful series of programmes which are now continuing <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble baroness will permit me to say that i did not criticise her majestys government in the way that she indicated <e> <s> i think that the report in <e>", "<cs> my lords as a former diplomat i should like briefly to support this amendment <e> <s> all of us would agree the immense importance of languages <e> <s> i would emphasise in particular the tremendous commercial value of languages which is constantly being emphasised <e> <s> most of us those who travel abroad or who have worked abroad as diplomats or in commercial capacities would agree that we britons are probably the worst linguists in the world with the possible exception of the americans <e> <s> anything that can be done to remedy this very serious defect is obviously extremely worthwhile <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe it will be appropriate if i said a few words at this stage about the moslem attitude to religious education because hitherto it has not been mentioned in detail <e> <s> i can say with due humility that i am as close to moslem thinking as any member of your lordships house and i have heard several views on the subject <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for that answer <e> <s> nevertheless is he aware that great britain is now one of the very few countries in the world which does not allow religious advertising <e> <s> those countries which do allow it include most of the countries in british colonial africa plus australia and new zealand most of the countries in the european community especially france italy and spain and many other countries in the world <e> <s> is the noble earl further aware that there is widespread demand throughout this country for the lifting of such restrictions <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall detain your lordships only for one minute because i was unable to attend the house yesterday <e> <s> i should like to recall that the moslem population in great britain which numbers approximately / million has consistently wished to be co-operative <e> <s> however at present it is not wholly satisfied with the provisions in the bill <e> <s> it will object to collective worship and i hope that its views can be taken into account when the guidelines are drawn up <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise briefly to support the noble lord lord orr-ewing with all the strength i can on the issue of religious broadcasting as i have done on previous occasions <e> <s> it seems to me as one of the vice-presidents of the christian broadcasting council and to the noble lord lord orr-ewing as well as members of our council that it is incredible that this ban on religious advertising persists when it has been estimated that some per cent <e> <s> of the population of britain claim to be christian and that for example programmes such as songs of praise which i am sure that many noble lords look at have received an per cent <e> <s> appreciation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to all noble lords who have spoken in this interesting and wide-ranging debate <e> <s> i am especially grateful to the minister for his encouraging reply <e> <s> i did state in my little note that i should refer briefly to the soviet union <e> <s> i am glad that he picked up that point <e> <s> it was especially interesting to hear from the noble lord lord avebury and other noble lords who have first-hand experience as i have of that horrible problem <e> <s> my lords i beg leave to withdraw my motion for papers <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise with great pleasure to support the noble lord lord mayhew <e> <s> he and i have spoken together in debates on palestine on numerous occasions and we have nearly always taken the same line which is to underline and reinforce the extent of the human rights violations generally speaking the attacks on the arabs by the israelis <e> <s> as your lordships know i had a debate yesterday on human rights violations worldwide <e> <s> i deliberately refrained from mentioning palestine <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord greenhill declared himself as a former railway employee <e> <s> i declare myself and the minister has on one occasion so described me as a railway buff <e> <s> i shall try not to be too technical <e> <s> our railways have <e>", "<cs> my lords i have two other points to make <e> <s> one is a technical one <e> <s> and i hope your lordships will forgive me for making it <e> <s> it concerns electrification which was mentioned by the noble lord lord tanlaw <e> <s> many of our lines are electrified now and many more will be electrified but there is one little island on the channel tunnel journey which will remain unelectrified <e> <s> i t is the short stretch i think it is seven-and-a-half miles from <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> is he aware that amnesty international whose views on these matters are generally accepted as excellent is gravely concerned about conditions in the two countries <e> <s> is he aware that in regard to kenya it is concerned in particular about starvation in prison and in relation to turkey which was mentioned in a <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister assure us that our representatives in those countries make frequent and powerful protests to the governments concerned when violations of human rights come to their notice <e> <s> does he agree that in cases such as that of ethiopia which was raised in a recent question the most effective way of protesting is for our representatives abroad to join with their european colleagues and making joint protests to the government concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that iraqs attacks on the kurds over the past two years represent violations of human rights as terrible as any perpetrated worldwide since the end of world war ii <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness may like to know that the moslems have a saying we have created from water every living thing <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble baroness for that answer may i put to her <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble baroness whether her majestys government have considered the possibility of calling for medical volunteers to go out to that area of the calibre of dr <e> <s> cutting who did such marvellous work in and <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be one minute only but i wish strongly to support my noble kinsman lord lauderdale <e> <s> i feel strongly about this <e> <s> at the moment one marriage in three ends in divorce <e> <s> if this measure is accepted it will strengthen the all too widespread feeling in this country that divorce is acceptable <e> <s> for reasons which have been advanced by many speakers this evening i feel that we should do all we can to oppose this great landslide of divorce which is disturbing so many people in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to speak this evening as briefly as i can on various aspects of the middle east situation some of which may not be well known to your lordships <e> <s> i shall also speak on the continuing problem of human rights violations <e> <s> once more both these subjects were mentioned in the gracious speech but it is sad to relate that in striking contrast to the amazing <e>", "<cs> my lords i am indeed grateful to the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs for introducing the debate on this immensely important subject <e> <s> in fact she has to some extent pre-empted an unstarred question of mine asking the government what action they have taken to implement certain parts of the education no <e>

those a very small minority it seems who oppose the bill in its present form <e> <s> i am speaking largely on the lines enumerated by the noble lord lord ashbourne <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support the amendment <e> <s> i do so because in certain circumstances which have been mentioned several times before this bill allows abortion up to the age of birth <e> <s> my view stems from my conviction that abortion and in particular late abortion is nothing less than murder <e> <s> this was brought out most movingly by the noble and learned lord lord rawlinson and by the noble viscount
