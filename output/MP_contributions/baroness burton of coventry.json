["<cs> my lords i am very glad to support the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> i was a great nuisance to him on the airline users committee and nuisance though i was i could not have served under a chairman who was more fair or more considerate <e> <s> having him here and being able to join with him in what i will not call an onslaught but at least some requests to the government has particular value <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i did not hear what the noble lord said <e>", "<cs> the american who has made visits had to wait one hour for his baggage to arrive when he got to the carousel and this has happened on four out of trips <e>", "<cs> one hour from when he reached the carousel <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> nobody has disputed the value of the underground for people without baggage <e> <s> what we are trying very hard to get authority to see and to get both governments to see is that there are two ends of the tube <e> <s> there is the one where you get on where you have to leave your trolley and get your baggage past the barrier <e> <s> then there is not a single london tube with an exit at street level for passengers with their baggage <e>", "<cs> my lords could the minister see that publicity is given to that welcome reply <e>", "<cs> my lords in studying this report and in reaching their decision will the government make sure that in the report there are <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the noble lord two questions one concerning gatwick and the other relating to it <e> <s> in view of the fact that the noble lord lord trefgarne told the house on rd october that the government would decide whether or not a second runway was to be constructed at gatwick may i ask whether the government have yet reached that decision and would the noble lord feel able to agree that the construction of a second runway should precede the construction of a second terminal <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the ministers original reply can he help the house on a related matter <e> <s> can he tell us whether the british airports authority were acting within their powers or were within their rights in agreeing with the west sussex county council that there should be no second runway built at gatwick or was that decision not for them to take <e>", "<cs> my lords while understanding that the minister is not able to say in advance what the recommendations will be and bearing in mind that as he himself has just said he has seen all the papers concerned may i ask whether he would feel able to tell the house if the question of access is considered in the report particularly for those people with luggage who are dependent on public transport <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord spoke of the many years it had taken to reach a decision on this matter <e> <s> i take the view that if we had reached a decision a few years ago we should not have spent more money on having an airport at maplin than we have on all the little bits and pieces that we have added since <e> <s> might i ask the noble lord two questions <e> <s> i am sure he will realise why i ask him the first one <e> <s> how many passengers does he envisage would have to go through stansted to make a second runway necessary <e> <s> i do not know whether he can help the house on my second question <e> <s> i do not know <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that some of us on this side of the house are tired of this continual harping on matters which are likely to cause trouble when such progress has been made <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that that answer and old information is as unsatisfactory to the noble lord as it is to me <e> <s> may i ask him whether he recalls that in january under a conservative government the check-in service was removed from west london terminal although it was used by million passengers that in april of last year under a labour government what was left of the service at west london air terminal was also withdrawn although it was used by more than a million passengers in the preceding months <e> <s> arising from that does the noble lord not feel that with present taxi rates to and from heathrow being in the neighbourhood of from central london passengers should be given the option of paying for a viable bus service <e> <s> i am not asking for a subsidised service <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord would lose on that but the house has not time to go into all those old arguments <e> <s> may i ask the noble lord whether he remembers that on th july last year when i raised this matter with him he said this <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether the government really believe that it is both advisable and safe to bring in the number of people contemplated at gatwick on a single runway and will he accept that at no airport in the world which deals with traffic on the scale engendered for gatwick either now or in the future is it planned to operate on a single runway <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say whether there is any truth in the belief that a building is to be erected on part of the ground at gatwick where a second runway would have been laid <e> <s> the second question i wanted to ask him was really asked by the noble lord lord balfour of inchrye does the noble lord recall that when he made the statement in this house on th december he then on behalf of the government held out hope of a debate on airports policy after the christmas recess and can he ask his noble friend the chief whip whether he can expedite that matter for us <e>", "<cs> my lords i am unhappy about these regulations and as of course the house knows i have always opposed the principle that national security should be the responsibility of the individual citizen rather than that of the crown <e> <s> indeed as the house will remember on th march that battle was lost by only two votes in this house <e> <s> the then <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister to answer just one point <e> <s> if he does not have the answer i shall be content to wait for it <e> <s> does he remember that i asked him whether the british airports authority were to continue to collect the levy or whether it was to go in with other charges <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister agree that whatever may be the outcome of the public inquiry it is obviously essential that the second terminal at gatwick is built <e> <s> because is that not central to the governments policy on airports <e>", "<cs> my lords while welcoming the tone of the ministers response may i as the chairman for some four years of the international committee of the sports council ask him whether he is aware and i think his answer implies that he is that there is a strong feeling in this country i think among sporting people that the games should be moved from moscow but that they should not be boycotted because that would damage our athletes who have tried so hard <e> <s> if it is not possible to transfer them this year then would it not be feasible to hold the games next year <e> <s> because as i understand it there is no hard and fast rule that they must be every four years <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to start by echoing the tribute paid by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter to lord thomas who was always a very good friend to me <e> <s> i remember going back to the saga of <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that it is late and i have had my innings but the minister has avoided the main question <e> <s> i am not concerned with the heathrow end i am concerned with this end <e> <s> i am saying that people with baggage cannot get out to heathrow on the underground now and that is why i asked whether the bus service is going to continue <e> <s> the noble lord has not dealt with this end <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister help me on this and as i read it in a newspaper perhaps he will be able to tell me if i am <e>", "<cs> my lords leaving aside the water industry but dealing with the reply given by the noble lord am i correct in thinking that the government are contemplating forming a committee by which representation for all the nationalised industries in so far as consumers are concerned might be brought together and if that is the case does he have in mind a very large committee <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may ask one further very brief question can the noble lord say whether it is the intention of the government to publish i suppose it would be a green paper for possible discussion on the general reorganisation of consumer representation <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to come back on that at least i do not know that i am sorry but i should like to ask another question arising from it <e> <s> is the minister aware that as i gather the commercial management of british airways do not deny the use of this system because of the question of cost which would seem to be contrary to what the minister has just said but because they feel that it would take up additional time at the check-in desks <e> <s> as it is a matter for individual airlines will the minister the department of trade or the civil aviation authority ask british airways whether they would give it a trial on one or two other flights <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords believing that the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords i forgot the most important part of my supplementary question <e> <s> may i ask the minister because i have to put it in the form of a question whether he is aware that this section of the television programme said that inquiries were on foot for a new bus service to serve the west london air terminal and the surrounding area <e> <s> would he take that on board as well <e>", "<cs> i find myself in some considerable difficulty and i have been somewhat dreading our reaching the picketing provisions of the bill because i am not in agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords as the house knows the civil aviation bill has gone to ground in the commons and we are awaiting its second <e>", "<cs> my lords is it correct that the leading charter airlines have joined forces with the tour operators to look at this whole question of surcharges and the notification to passengers <e> <s> if that is the case could the minister express approval and also the hope that the scheduled airlines might get together to ensure that passengers are given advance notice of the surcharges with the details in terms that they can understand <e>", "<cs> my lords while being glad that the noble lord lord merrivale has called attention to the bottom end of the market would the minister agree that the recent offer by british airways which they have called a fire cracker scheme is likely to bring advantage to air travellers at the bottom end of the market as it is the lowest on offer <e> <s> may i ask him furthermore in congratulating british airways on that scheme whether he is aware that they say that this scheme guarantees a ticket <e> <s> does it also guarantee a seat <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i might say and it is not very easy to say it that i think the opposition is very mistaken in the line that it is taking on this question of picketing <e> <s> i believe that throughout the country quite irrespective of party there is a very strong feeling that picketing reflects the power of the bully and i think that this has caused a great deal of fear to people <e> <s> if one goes back to the various disputes that we have had and i am making no statements about the merits or demerits of any claims and to what one saw of the picketing that took place outside hadfields for example or what took place outside grunwick i believe that the presence of so many people and so many forceful people brings a fear on ordinary people which is quite undeserved and unmerited <e>", "<cs> my lords beg lave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> i am sorry my lords i was taken by surprise would the minister kindly repeat that <e>", "<cs> my lords i can <e> <s> knowing how reasonable the noble lord is and that he has connections with leeds as i had in the past may i ask him whether he is aware that what i am really after is getting recognition of the fact that people going out to heathrow airport would welcome a bus service from the central area to all three terminals one for which they would be perfectly willing to pay <e> <s> they do not <e>", "<cs> my lords without being too much of a nuisance may i ask the noble lord lord bellwin whether i could talk this over with him privately <e> <s> is he aware that i am not concerned as to who provides this service whether or not it is the local authority i presume that is the glc but that it should be paid for <e> <s> perhaps i could come and see him about it and try to soften him up on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister two questions <e> <s> he has spoken of the concern of the government for the consumer <e> <s> could i ask the minister whether the government would feel able to consider recommending cheap stamps for christmas cards <e> <s> this is a question which we have raised many times in this house <e> <s> is the minister aware that if we could have such a concession if that be the right word it would probably lead to a greater sale of christmas cards which would benefit the industry concerned <e> <s> is the minister also aware that if such a concession were made such cards could be posted well in advance it might be even in october or at the beginning of november to avoid the taking on of extra staff at christmastime <e>", "<cs> my lords i have the feeling that our report has arrived at the right moment certainly for the travelling public and probably for some airlines and i would hope as ammunition for our own government to end what really has become a scandal namely the jungle of air fares in europe <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords if the minister does not mind my asking him is he aware that that is a better answer than i had anticipated getting in view of our discussions last friday <e> <s> is he aware of the seriousness of the matter and that in the last three months i have had three different ministers answering three such questions and that we have not got anywhere on any of them <e> <s> travellers are not asking for a subsidised service but a service for which they are perfectly willing to pay <e> <s> i believe that in the past the government have not been aware that the answers we have been given have not been true <e> <s> i do not mean to say the government do not think they are true but they have not been correct <e> <s> to show good faith may i ask the minister to give a guarantee that the government will ask british airways at least to consider not withdrawing the service until there is something else to take its place <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister please give some thought to what i have said <e> <s> is he aware that we are back again to the problem of people with luggage <e> <s> he speaks of a fare of <e> <s> is he aware i apologise to the house for being personal that not long ago i took a taxi from heathrow to central london to a point near marble arch <e> <s> i had a good driver and there was no traffic <e> <s> the charge on the clock was and with a tip the total came to <e> <s> i maintain that that is quite outrageous <e> <s> is the minister aware that some of us in this house and outside are trying to find a consortium which would operate a bus service from a central area and which we could make economic <e> <s> can we have the governments assurance that they will do their best to see that the present bus service is not withdrawn anyway until after our recess when we can return to the matter once more <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that my remarks today will be able to stand up to the scrutiny of the most knowledgeable and distinguished speakers who follow me <e> <s> a long time ago in july we had the second reading of the then civil aviation bill <e> <s> in that debate i remember raising three main points the structure of international air fares charter flights the proposed civil aviation authority and consumer affairs <e> <s> obviously much has happened since then but at that time i asked for a major reappraisal by all governments of the whole balance of air transport effort <e> <s> i think that most speakers in that debate felt the same <e> <s> today governments are doing just this <e> <s> they have had to my lords <e> <s> charter flights cheaper scheduled flights particularly in europe the position of iata the attitude of iata and membership of iata have all made reappraisal necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords i have had a good innings and i will not take up the time of the house but i asked the minister about the terms of reference of the relevant committees <e> <s> i said i had put this forward in <e> <s> i wonder whether it could be considered as a short-term measure and a letter would not suffice for that <e> <s> i asked the minister something which i think is important whether the position of the air traveller could be considered in the review being conducted by his right honourable friend the minister of state for consumer affairs on which we are to have a green paper <e> <s> is it possible for him to give an answer on that <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while certainly joining in the last part of what the minister has to say may i ask him whether an exception such as special christmas stamps is hardly to be construed as the day-to-day work of the post office <e> <s> i should have thought it was an annual one <e> <s> may i move on from that and ask him whether the objection to cheaper stamps if letters are posted early obviously does not come from the users <e> <s> any such objection comes either from the government or the unions <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that i was afraid that that was the case <e> <s> it happened last year <e> <s> is he aware that it happened as long ago as in over olympic stamps <e> <s> may i ask him whether in all seriousness this matter could be looked at again because quite obviously it could mean the selling of many more stamps <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that i am delighted that at last some progress is being made to rectify the seven-year rundown of the bus service ever since this house voted in december to retain the services at the west london air terminal <e> <s> is he also aware to be fair that i appreciate the way in which british airways have kept me informed of this through the summer recess <e> <s> finally in connection with what he said today may i ask him three brief points <e> <s> will the stopping places where passengers are <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that of course we have another question down for thursday when he might be able to amplify these points <e> <s> is he also aware that i am pursuing london transport <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not want to go into the past but is the minister aware that on th august at col of <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether i misheard him <e> <s> did he say in answer to the question that the unions felt they were not adequately consulted in <e> <s> because we are now in <e> <s> was nothing done last year and have they not been consulted again this year <e>", "<cs> i should like to take the opportunity to raise two matters important to consumers and by consumers in this context i mean air travellers <e> <s> i found considerable hope in the new and present clause not least because mr nott the secretary of state for trade said during the second reading in another place at column on th november last <e>", "<cs> i have no intention of pursuing the matter and i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> may we hope that we shall get some information on both points <e> <s> i raised two one concerned the terms of reference and the remit and the other concerned the inclusion in the study being undertaken by mrs oppenheim <e>", "<cs> as we have a little longer would it be possible to let us have those letters before report stage <e> <s> because if it were not necessary to come back to it that would be splendid but if the letters were not satisfactory we might have to <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords as the minister will probably agree this had been on the way a long time i think about a year or so <e> <s> may i ask if it would be any use putting down a further question before the end of the present session or if one should wait until the next one opens <e> <s> shall we have a green paper as soon as the report is made <e> <s> finally may i ask the noble viscount whether all <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble viscount for that lengthy reply which i do not think really gets us very much further <e> <s> however while i realise that it would be no good putting down a question in the present session is he aware that i am particularly concerned with a consumer group which was set up more much recently than years ago <e> <s> can the noble viscount comment on the fact that i have been reliably informed that the civil aviation traveller is being considered at present and can he tell me whether such travellers will be included in the final report <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall support my noble friend on this amendment <e> <s> i should like to make one or two remarks concerning security charges <e> <s> i listened to what my noble friend lord ponsonby said on committee stage and again on report <e> <s> the amendment we are considering today i think is similar to that moved on report <e> <s> also i looked this morning at what the noble lord lord trefgarne had said in reply <e> <s> i do not know whether he is going to make exactly the same answer again if he is going to turn down my noble friends request but what i think i am entitled to say is that both front benches in both houses are responsible for these security charges <e> <s> i leave it at that and i think that the noble lord lord trefgarne would expect me to come back to that <e>", "<cs> my lords before the bill leaves us i should like to comment on one particular aspect that of the consumer and what has come out in this bill <e> <s> on second reading and in committee i asked the government whether they could consider two points <e> <s> the first was whether they would widen the remit of the airline users committee to include airports <e> <s> that is where most of the problems arise concerning travellers <e> <s> i was very glad at second reading to have support on this aspect from the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> the government did consider this suggestion and they wrote to me at considerable length about it <e> <s> i appreciated the care taken but they did turn down the suggestion and i venture to think that was a mistake <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask a question of the noble lord <e> <s> i am most grateful to him <e> <s> as he is aware i was hopeful that there might be something further that he could say on that matter but perhaps he can help me in this respect how would the house know the result of such consultations <e> <s> in other words can he give me any guidance either here or outside as to whether it would be useful to table a question at an appropriate moment so that the house might benefit from the result of these discussions <e>", "<cs> my lords i should prefer an oral question <e>", "<cs> my lords in order to clear up the complexity of this matter is it not correct that the airlines employ two different types of retailer one the legitimate agents who have to sell tickets at published fares and secondly the bucket shops who receive tickets from these same airlines which they then sell under the counter <e> <s> secondly if there is the surplus capacity available that we hear so much about today and discounted tickets have to be sold by the airlines to fill that capacity could these not be sold over the counter by the legitimate agents <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not correct that the air tickets must come from somewhere and would it not be a good idea to set up a select committee under the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter to get this matter sorted out and dealt with <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like very much to pay a particular tribute to the noble lord lord alport <e> <s> in case he wonders why i am paying a particular tribute to him it is because i feel that we on this side of the house are letting so much <e>", "<cs> my lords i joined in a week or so ago <e> <s> i was not after prosecutions then and i am not now <e> <s> may i ask the minister why the government will not say that they no longer accept the iata ruling that legitimate agents should not sell discounted tickets <e> <s> because that is the first step <e> <s> secondly is the minister aware that on th september last british airways said on television that they sold these tickets to the bucket shops <e> <s> as the minister will be aware other scheduled airlines do so <e> <s> why is it that the government take refuge in talking about prosecutions and the difficulty of securing convictions when it is known that these tickets are available that the public wants them and that the airlines have to sell them <e> <s> why can they not be made available at all retail outlets <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to be rude but this is a complete blockage to taking action <e> <s> the tickets are there and the minister knows that they are there <e> <s> is he aware that they are sold by the scheduled airlines to the bucket shops <e> <s> why are the government not prepared to say that they will no longer accept the ruling banning the legitimate agents from selling them <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just ask this question because the minister did not answer what i asked him is he aware that i said nothing at all about fixing fares between the two countries concerned <e> <s> i asked him why these discounted tickets cannot be made available at all outlets if the government would only say we can no longer accept the iata ruling that this is not so <e> <s> it is nothing to do with bilateral agreements between different countries <e>", "<cs> my lords will the lord president look at this matter again <e> <s> as one who does her own filing and presumably he does not may i ask whether he is aware that this really is a problem if one has shelving or boxes in which to store <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl ensure that these two points are included in the report or request being made to british rail <e> <s> is he aware that when i arrived at gatwick at around pm on a recent thursday i found that that part of the train detached and remaining in the station was under no roof and passengers were entirely exposed to the elements and not a single porter was available <e> <s> is he further aware that when i returned from gatwick to victoria at about pm on a friday there was not one porter and not one trolley on the platform <e> <s> this is disastrous for tourists apart from the poor regulars <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in spite of that reply may i first of all ask the minister whether he is aware that i am both glad and sorry that three previous speakers have stolen my thunder but that as a persistent nuisance <e> <s> i was delighted at his promotion <e> <s> i can think of nobody who deserves it more and i think the whole house agrees with me in that particular matter <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just insinuate the velvet glove a little further before we move on to other matters <e> <s> may i ask the noble lord whether he is aware that on the same date th december at col the minister did tell the house that fares had to be agreed between the two governments concerned <e> <s> in fact this is complete nonsense <e> <s> may i ask the minister whether he would suggest that the bucket shops contact these various governments before they sell the tickets <e> <s> also is he aware that these tickets are sold at a discount of up to per cent <e> <s> does he know that i have in my hand here a bucket shop price guide issued by the <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord be kind enough to repeat that <e> <s> i really did not hear what he said <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that mr hammarskjold said the other day that iata is powerless to stop the bucket shop trade in illegally discounted air tickets while britain is lax in applying the law <e> <s> arising from that may i ask the minister whether it is not true to say that abta and iata agents in this country are liable not only to the iata rules but to the law of this country <e> <s> as both iata and the government seem to be passing the buck one to the other on this will they not get together so that everybody may have the advantage of cheap tickets <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister be a little more forthcoming on the position and the proximity of the government to this particular matter <e> <s> can he give the house any information about the meeting which i believe is to be held on th february between the retail agents council and british airways to discuss the report of a working party which they set up to look into this matter <e> <s> is he further aware that i was told that both sides have previously sought the opinion of the government on the desirability of having such a meeting and as to the possible legality of what might come out of it <e> <s> could he tell us how the government arc connected with this meeting <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether he is aware that we hope that within the next few weeks we will have an opportunity of discussing this in more detail so that we can find out how much the government are concerned to act on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister is quite right i was referring to that and i gave him the date <e> <s> may i ask as it was said that he would be considering five points four of them in connection with the security levy and one in connection with air traffic control whether the noble lord would feel able to let the house have information on those points when he has considered them <e> <s> is he further aware that all the airlines i think without reservation consider <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister but might it be possible to have an oral answer if one put down a question <e>", "<cs> my lords luckily i do not want to talk about either landing charges or security charges <e> <s> i think the views of this house on both those matters are well known and have remarkable unanimity right across party lines <e> <s> i should like to move on from there and i should like to thank the noble lord lord glenkinglas for giving us this opportunity today and for drawing his motion so wide <e> <s> i should also like to thank him for his kind remarks and to emphasise that such progress as we have been able to make in this house particularly in connection with the users of air transport i think has been due to the support given by this house on these matters quite irrespective of party <e> <s> i believe we all feel that very strongly <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt <e> <s> is that the answer on bucket shops or is the noble lord going to tell us a little more <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord has finished it may i ask him whether he thinks that what he has said constitutes any answer to a case which i think has <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to make this into another debate but is the minister really saying that the sale of million tickets in a year in this country through bucket shops is something which can just be left <e> <s> i am glad the noble lord indicates that is not so <e> <s> is the noble lord telling the house then that the government intend to take this matter to iata because it is iata which is concerned also with this problem <e> <s> could he give us an assurance that that will be done <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords as the minister last week told a conference in london that the civil aviation industry was one of the last bulwarks of protectionism may i ask why the government in spite of the ministers reply are still sitting on the sidelines knowing full well that last year five million tickets were sold through the bucket shops in this country at discounts of up to per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords that is wonderful because we can deal with that tomorrow <e> <s> may i ask the minister pending tomorrow whether he would not feel able to help the legitimate agencies <e> <s> as this protectionism exists the noble lord lord trefgarne himself has said so does he not feel that the government should do something to help the legitimate agents to sell these tickets which mean the loss of so much money for them <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether her majestys governments approval would be necessary if a recommendation were accepted by iata before it was put into operation <e> <s> secondly may i ask him whether he is aware of the difficulty that whereas he told the house yesterday that the international community must break down its own bulwarks of protectionism iata has told the government that it can do nothing in this matter because this government will not use the law to deal with this particular practice <e> <s> what does the minister suggest that we should do <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether he is aware that if i am confused he is very dilatory in this particular matter <e> <s> is he aware that some major airlines deal with this matter through their own bucket shops <e> <s> and as these airlines would like the matter to be put on to a proper basis so that these tickets were available to all travellers everywhere what does this government propose to do to help to bring that about <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord recall or does he have a note of it in his brief that his noble friend lord trenchard told me on nd october that the minister expected the report by the end of the year <e> <s> his noble friend said then that it had taken rather a long time <e> <s> could the noble lord say how much longer we shall have to add to that long time <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not clear from the answer whether the paper will be published and whether we shall then have an opportunity to discuss it in parliament as well as outside <e> <s> if not what is the procedure to be <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords why do we never make any progress on this matter <e> <s> may i ask the minister whether he is so secretive because he is doing nothing about it or is he so secretive because he wishes to keep what he is doing away from the public eye <e> <s> would he not agree that really it would be for the benefit of everybody travellers agents and airlines if these tickets were available to everybody <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> but that is not really what i am on <e> <s> could the minister please let us know whether it is true that various organisations have been having discussions with either the government or highly placed civil servants on the possibility of doing something about making these tickets more available to all agents <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just ask he minister this question following on what he said he said that it was up to the airlines to sort out this matter <e> <s> am i to understand then that it would be for iata to make a recommendation that these tickets should be available to all agents <e>", "<cs> my lords as a member of the committee to which the noble lord referred may i ask him whether it would not seem that the fears of his noble friend lord balfour are perhaps exaggerated <e> <s> may i ask the noble lord whether he recalls that in the report of the select committee to this house we did say <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just follow the noble baroness lady elliot of harwood because she and i have fought for many years on behalf of the consumer although i never attained the honour that she did in being chairman of the consumer council <e> <s> but i should like very much to support what she has said <e> <s> i have talked lately to many people in various consumer organisations who are most distressed at the thought that what the government are proposing now may be carried into effect <e> <s> with great temerity i must say that i really did not agree with the noble lord lord spens who i am sure knows a lot more about accountancy than i do <e> <s> as i understood what he said it was that because something was in a chaotic condition you should not then add on something and presumably have two things in a chaotic condition <e> <s> that does not seem to me to be a very progressive outlook <e> <s> so i should like very much to support what the noble baroness lady elliot has said and i hope that the amendment proposed by the noble lord lord trefgarne will not receive the support of this house <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords why are the minister and the government being so secretive about this statement <e> <s> does the minister recall that seven months ago his noble friend told the house that he expected it to be made before the end of the year and that the minister himself on th march two months ago told me that it would be made very soon <e> <s> since i have now lost faith in what the noble lord means by the english language can he go a little further and tell us <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that if he takes much longer the matter will become more and more complex and the government will become lost in the end <e> <s> can he give us any hope that a statement will be made before the recess <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i have become so weary of this type of answer <e> <s> i wonder whether the minister realises that stonewalling consistently is not only boring but an affront to the house when every piece of evidence is treated in that manner <e> <s> may i ask lord trefgarne whether he is aware that in the current recession more and more airlines are using bucket shops for their surplus tickets and that among the most recent ones are reputable airlines such as klm air france and swissair <e> <s> finally does the noble lord recall that yesterday he told the house that it was not always wise to postpone decisions indefinitely <e> <s> may i ask him whether he has now reached a decision to do nothing at all about this <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the minister is prepared to accept an unorthodox suggestion <e> <s> does he recall that when i asked him before about the wholesaling system he did not tell us that he had seen the organisations concerned until i asked him about that in a supplementary question <e> <s> when he meets these organisations for the representations would he allow those of us who are particularly interested in this from the point of view of consumer affairs such as the noble baroness lady elliot of harwood the noble lord lord young of dartington or myself to sit in and see whether we can bring some common sense to bear on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i might ask the minister two questions arising out of his answer <e> <s> knowing of some of the evidence which has been submitted to him and how anxious to help are the people who submitted it could he tell the house whether he has informed those people <e>", "<cs> my lords in his answers to my supplementary questions did i understand the noble lord to say that there was no discernable thread running through the representations of all those who have been to see him in other words that they are not anxious for these discounted tickets to be extended to everybody <e> <s> with regard to the first point which the noble lord made may we take it that if information such as he has described is given to him he will take action <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> unfortunately my lords the minister has referred to the wrong date if he looks at the question on the order paper he will see that i have taken it from th may and it is that to which i should like an answer <e> <s> is it not a fact first that he has received from a large organisation discounted tickets which it has succeeded in purchasing <e> <s> secondly is it not a fact that in a number of the cases those tickets were issued by an airline and two photostats show the validation certificate supporting that <e> <s> additionally is it not a fact that the firm holds copies of receipts showing that they paid for those tickets and which show that the money paid is less than in the tariffs <e> <s> as the minister has seen those figures and has that evidence may i ask what he is prepared to do about it <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister actually saying that the evidence which he has and which he knows is also in my possession merely purports to prove those facts <e> <s> is he not aware that the purpose of sending that evidence to the minister was to show that tickets could be sold by an airline through a bucket shop at a discounted rate the sort of information for which the minister had asked and that they can be freely obtained in the united kingdom <e> <s> what more are people to do if evidence which they submit is just swept under the carpet by the minister who answers a question he has not been asked <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister and the department have lost all credibility on this matter by now <e> <s> may i ask the noble lord lord trefgarne whether he still maintains in this house that he does not understand that the purpose of the evidence submitted to him was to demonstrate that these tickets were being sold by the airlines and could be purchased freely at a discount in the united kingdom <e> <s> does he deny that this evidence showed that persons paid less for their tickets than the amount shown that photostat receipts for these amounts are available that validation certificates show that they were issued by the airlines and that the airlines themselves were definitely named <e> <s> finally is he aware that there is great resentment in this house and outside at the way that bureaucracy impedes any progress whatsoever in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has just given two answers i shall be glad if i could have one <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that we have the greatest admiration for his legal advisers but as million tickets were sold by the bucket shops last year and the advisers were unable to find one case among those to prosecute it does make one think <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords the variety of answers never ceases to amaze me <e> <s> i hope that it amazes the house too <e> <s> may i ask the minister whether he recalls that on th june at col in reply to his noble friend lord morris he said that he would be happy to initiate legislation to clarify the law as a matter of urgency <e> <s> as the answer today indicates as always i am sorry to say that the minister and his department have no intention of doing any such thing may we be told what he does intend to do <e> <s> in view of his last remarks may i ask him whether he would be good enough not to hide behind cheap fares to europe or to america which is not what i am dealing with and not to hide behind his international partners as iata have said that the british government are failing to legislate on their own laws <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether the government are quite adamant in insisting that there shall be only one main runway at gatwick <e> <s> may i furthermore ask him on that point whether it is not true that a second main <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that my noble friend wishes to help but either i was not clear or he did not understand so let us put the blame between both of us <e> <s> i said earlier in this debate that the tickets of which i have been speaking have got the airline stamp on them that the receipts were held by thomas cook of the amounts paid for them and that the tickets were purchased in the bucket shops by thomas cook and i do not say fellow conspirators but anyway fellow purchasers and that these details were given to the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry i thought it was very clear <e> <s> if my noble friend will let me get on of course the tickets have the correct price on them but they were sold at a reduced rate and the receipts for those reduced rates are held <e> <s> so he will have to read it later and see whether he is any clearer after that <e>", "<cs> anyway if i can get back to what i was saying <e> <s> any report whether it is produced by iata or any other body would have to take into account the fact that if the airlines did not supply the tickets to the bucket shops we should not be in the present situation <e> <s> and the most reputable of airlines do this <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down which is my only way of asking him a question may i ask whether it is the intention of his department to reply to the letter of th june from thomas cooks chief executive asking what further evidence the departments legal advisers would require in order that they themselves may initiate a prosecution <e>", "<cs> my lords i was under the impression that as we the social democrats had been given a copy of the statement after the official opposition and liberal speakers had asked questions we would come next <e> <s> i apologise to the noble lord the chief whip but i believed that to be so <e> <s> we on these benches do not agree with what the government propose to do <e> <s> i should like to ask three questions <e> <s> first we feel that the presence of the showrooms in the high streets and the service provided from them are both of real benefit to the consumer <e> <s> i should like to ask the government whether they believe that the <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister why if he has such a high regard for the british gas corporations activities he has chosen to ignore their advice in the selling of the gas showrooms to private enterprise <e>", "<cs> my lords as the government are meeting with opposition in their effort to reduce air fares in europe may i ask the minister whether they have pursued the suggestion made in the report of the select committee of this house on european air fares that we might take the initiative in trying to co-ordinate air traffic control in europe <e> <s> does the noble lord recall that the witness from the trade union side was of the opinion that the tuc would support any such initiative through the international transport federation <e> <s> finally may i ask the noble lord whether if we could secure such co-ordination it would not mean that we could cut the excessive flight distances between various points in europe cut the cost and therefore cut the air fares <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister go so far as to say that he will look at what we said in our report <e> <s> he tells us nothing new we set all that down <e> <s> surely it is better to try to do something than to accept that it is impossible <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a list of dates on a paper here but as i expect the noble lord has them in his file i shall not enumerate them <e> <s> but may i ask him whether he would agree that this has been going on for some nine months since i was told by his noble friend lord trenchard last october that the report was expected before the end of the year <e> <s> does the noble lord recall that he himself told us in march that it would not be very long and in may that he hoped it would be before the recess <e> <s> as the government now appear to have gone back even on that and in view of the concern of the consumer organisations could he be a little more helpful <e>", "<cs> my lords while being glad that the noble lord has expectations as i have and hoping that they will be better fulfilled may i ask him whether before the recess means before we rise for the summer recess or before the end of the overspill in the autumn <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the long disappointment over this matter would the noble lord be generous enough to let me know when it would be useful to put down a question so that we might spare the house further boredom on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords while being very wary of addressing the noble and learned lord on the woolsack and while believing that probably what i wish to ask is not necessarily connected with section or with secondary action it is nevertheless something which i think should be said <e> <s> might i ask the noble and learned lord as the word employment is mentioned whether there will be any opportunity of condemning the industrial action which is being taken to prevent the publishing of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords without any disrespect to the noble lord would he not agree that such an answer after months of delay and avoidance is really not worth while spending any further time on today so may i therefore ask him a related question concerning government consumers and the nationalised industries <e> <s> can the noble lord tell the house why it was not possible to repeat in this house a statement on gas and oil industries made in another place on monday <e> <s> while accepting that procedure in another place is the responsibility of another place does the minister realise that what occurred on monday was that a statement was made in the guise of answering an ordinary oral question and that as a consequence this house was prevented from hearing a statement of fundamental importance <e> <s> does the minister or the leader of the house feel able to comment on the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords in common with most speakers i wanted to thank the noble lord lord constantine for his speech and i wanted to do so for a particular reason <e> <s> that was because he talked about the consumer and i think that the consumer has been rather absent from todays debate <e> <s> i want to talk about consumer affairs and the nationalised industries and to say a few words about one nationalised industry in particular <e> <s> on consumer affairs in general i should like to discover what attitude if any the government take towards the position of the consumer and obviously this topic could have fallen within the ambit of home affairs or economic and industrial affairs <e> <s> perhaps i might explain why i chose the second grouping <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down may i ask whether he imagines he has dealt with yesterdays debate or whether those of us who asked him specific questions may hope to have an answer to them <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the minister aware that the dutch government are now supporting a wide range of low-cost fares <e> <s> is he further aware that many of these discounted fares which formerly were available only in the bucket shops are now available at all travel agents in holland <e> <s> can he finally tell the house whether the dutch government have legislation similar to ours saying that such action is illegal or whether they have not <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that is not the question i asked the noble lord <e> <s> i asked him whether the dutch government had legislation similar to ours which made such action illegal or whether they did not <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the minister aware that these very high charges whether they are justified or not of the british airports authority are one of the main reasons for the high passengers fares particularly to europe <e> <s> could he not take that into account in looking at the proposed per cent <e> <s> increase <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that i am so taken aback by a positive reply that i hardly know what to say <e> <s> may i rather unusually perhaps ask him whether he is aware that i am grateful for the affirmative answer he has managed to get from the obscurity of the department concerned but this has taken up to date months <e> <s> can he give us the exact date when we shall have the document <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a little more than i expected but not enough <e> <s> may i ask the noble lord the minister whether he is aware that this is of course the first time that discount air tickets will be available over the counter <e> <s> as these tickets are competitive with bucket shop tickets and as he has said cover british airways routes to the far east can he say whether or not the government will be able to encourage the use of these as it will bring discounted air tickets within more general availability to the public for the first time <e> <s> does the noble lord know also that british airways and the association of british travel agents have admitted that their pact is illegal but as the government have taken no action over illegal transactions in the past they expect that the government will not be taking any action over this one <e> <s> will the minister comment <e>", "<cs> my lords that is an extraordinary answer <e> <s> does the noble lord the minister know that bookings for these tickets will be accepted from th december which is monday that the tickets will be usable on st january and furthermore that the agents who will be selling them will have to undertake large and extensive advertising <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to be a nuisance and the house has been very patient but may i ask the minister because he has so often said that they cannot do anything on this matter and it is for iata whether he is aware that this particular endeavour is supported by the association of british travel agents by british airways and by iata <e> <s> and is he proposing to get it all put in order or the legislation altered by monday th december <e>", "<cs> my lords a few minutes ago it seemed to me that we might never reach this next speech but if the time taken has settled the difference between the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter and the noble lord lord jacques it probably was time well spent <e> <s> i should like to return to that point a little later but possibly with a little less erudition on actual principles <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to interrupt the noble baroness <e> <s> i do not mind being drawn on that <e> <s> i think the noble baroness may have forgotten that i said that i was copying what was said by mr harold macmillan that it was better to keep only to one plank and concentrate on that <e>", "<cs> my lords as the minister implied this is a straightforward bill containing only five clauses <e> <s> there was no real dissension from this proposition when it was put forward in another place by the minister and i think that there has been no dissension here today <e> <s> as the noble lord lord trefgarne said of course this bill does increase the borrowing power of the british airports authority and the secretary of state in another place gave valid reasons as to why that should be done <e> <s> but there was a considerable amount of discussion about the manner in which the british airports authority is financed and i should like to return to that aspect later in my remarks <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i am coming to that <e> <s> the noble lord lord trefgarne will know that there was considerable discussion on airport charges at all stages during the progress of the bill in another place <e> <s> the problem of security charges is one of particular relevance to this house <e> <s> those of us opposed to the method of raising this money by direct charge on the customer lost by only two votes at the committee stage on th march when the previous government were in power <e> <s> i remain opposed <e> <s> as the house will know these charges have been reduced from to but only for a period of six months and they will then revert to <e> <s> on this particular matter i was glad to note that the under-secretary of state in another place said that he would look again at this problem of the security levy and how it is dealt with in other countries <e> <s> i remember saying when we discussed the matter on second reading that no other country in the eec did so in this way <e> <s> therefore we were being a trend-setter in the wrong direction <e> <s> that was on th march and it now appears unfortunately that i was right <e> <s> so security charges are a user charge and i shall come on to the others later <e>", "<cs> my lords i interrupt the minister simply to say that he surely does not think that what he has said is the slightest answer to what i was trying to convey to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not detain the house for more than a minute because the points to which i referred on second reading have arisen tonight but i shall be very interested in what the noble lord lord trefgarne has to say in reply <e> <s> i felt very strongly that the users of today should not pay for the airports of tomorrow <e> <s> i was also very interested in the question asked by the noble earl lord kinnoull as to whether the government had quite definitely decided that a fifth terminal at heathrow should not be built <e> <s> that was my reading of what was said and i shall be most interested to hear what the noble lord lord trefgarne has to say in reply <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a much clearer answer than we have received before <e> <s> while wishing every success to this process may i ask the minister whether he is aware that when british airways finally filed on new years eve they filed really to get assent to be able to charge what fares they liked <e> <s> in other words the fares were anything between and the economy fare <e> <s> would the government feel able to approve such suggestions from other airlines <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister then this question with regard to the question that i have down for next week could that appear before his right honourable friend so that we might get an answer on something of which he has previous knowledge <e>", "<cs> my lords while being glad to hear the tone of the ministers reply may i ask him whether it is not true that in the past governments and airlines have co-operated to keep out competition and as a result air fares have been kept high <e> <s> as the noble lord has just said laker posed a challenge to this cartel in air travel <e> <s> would the noble lord agree that that is why there has been such an incredible response to this situation from the public from his pilots and from all the employees of laker <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble lord could tell us whether it is not right to say that established airlines will make a mistake if they think that what laker worked for has dis <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not detain the house long but there are just three points that i should like to raise before we move on to discussing the actual draft regulations before us today <e> <s> i sat down when the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter rose to speak at the same time as i did because i am never quite sure of the order of speaking in this house but i want to follow on what he has said because he and the noble lord lord hill of luton were kind enough to support me some four years ago when we raised the first point that i want to raise today <e>", "<cs> my lords could the noble lord comment on the charges made by the airlines to cover the administration of the security charge <e> <s> i gave him the figure of per passenger <e> <s> is that correct <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not being awkward but i am not asking for anything to be written on the ticket i am asking what is the additional charge that the airlines put on the ticket if you like for their own convenience before selling them to the customer <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not intend to answer the question i have asked of whether the airlines put a charge reckoned at around on the cost of the tickets that they sell to their customers <e> <s> yes or no <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that when one asks a direct question one always gets an evasion <e> <s> the question refers to what the minister said last week that he doubted whether there would be any difficulties with similar applications being granted <e> <s> may i ask him whether his answer means yes or no <e> <s> might i further move on from that to ask him this because i believe it is a serious point does he appreciate that iata abta and british airways have done a great deal of work to make these tickets more available to the general public legally over the counter rather than illegally underneath the counter <e> <s> does he furthermore appreciate that all these organisations would like a forthright mention of approval from the government which they feel are always dragging their feet in this connection <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that he is facing completely the wrong way <e> <s> i have asked him a straightforward question <e>", "<cs> my lords the house is patient and i do not know whether i am being stupid or whether the noble lord is but i really cannot understand what he is saying <e> <s> i am asking the noble lord whether if say a british airline made application to the civil aviation authority to fly on cheap tickets as has been done in this particular case and if the application has fulfilled the conditions which british airways have fulfilled it also would be granted <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether he is aware that it was the assistant secretary of the airports branch who gave this evidence <e> <s> may i ask the minister whether he has in his brief a copy of that days proceedings at the inquiry now being held over the matter of stansted <e> <s> if so is he aware that referring to the second runway the assistant secretary said <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that i resent that <e> <s> i have the whole of the evidence in front of me but i will not weary the house with it <e> <s> may i ask the minister whether he will answer my question <e> <s> is he aware that quite apart from the second runway there is real disquiet in the civil aviation industry over what i would term perhaps hesitatingly the arrogance of the british airports authority which refuses to take into consideration the views of the airlines who themselves are the users of the airport <e>", "<cs> my lords while not claiming to be a former pilot but only a nuisance may i pursue this matter <e> <s> may i ask the noble lord whether while i appreciate the interest and knowledge of the noble lord lord nugent of guildford in environmental matters there is another aspect <e> <s> is it of the slightest use people who feel differently from this trying to pursue the matter in the hope that the government might change their minds <e> <s> referring to the guarantees given previously is the minister aware that as i understand it these were given to the members of parliament whose constituencies surrounded gatwick airport <e> <s> is it not time that we had another look at it in the light of present-day conditions <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has got himself into a muddle <e> <s> is he aware that i am not referring at all to the charges expenses or financial side <e> <s> is he further aware that it was nearly three months ago on th december that mr lain sproat in another place said he had decided to look again at the ways in which other countries deal with these matters <e> <s> i am asking the minister whether we can have a statement as to the way in which other countries deal with these matters <e> <s> that is nothing at all to do with what we do or with the amounts charged <e>", "<cs> my lords i know <e> <s> however is the minister aware that his answer is considerably at variance with the question that i have asked <e> <s> this is a perfectly serious question <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that many of us in this house are interested as to the methods which other countries use to finance the security charges <e> <s> i am asking him whether he will make a general statement on that <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister this question and could he give me a straight answer <e> <s> have the government not yet found out how other countries deal with this matter of security charges <e> <s> if not when does he expect that he will be able to make a general statement <e> <s> i am not asking for a final report <e>", "<cs> has there been any consultation with the people who use the seats inside taxis my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect the minister did not answer my question <e> <s> is he aware that i was glad to hear about the robustness and the safety of the new vehicles <e> <s> were the passengers consulted at all on the design of the new taxi <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a much better answer than i have ever known <e> <s> the minister has implied this but may i ask him whether as at this particular time british airways are going through a very difficult period he will confirm that the government will give every support to british airways in their efforts to persuade other carriers to co-operate with them in this worthwhile venture which is after all an attempt to bring discounted tickets within the reach of a much wider general public <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister hasten the process of digestion <e> <s> is he aware that the consumer organisations were hoping for action in the next session of parliament and that the consultative document contains two sets of proposals one requiring legislation and one not <e> <s> will he therefore feel able to agree that it would be helpful to all concerned if we could have a debate based on a green paper which takes into account the suggestions and the comments that have come in <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister in case he got it wrong whether he is aware that i know there is no green paper <e> <s> i am asking for one <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree that it is indeed a pleasant change when the travelling public is considered in these matters <e> <s> would he further agree that in disputes such as these it is always the person in the middle wherever the dispute may be who suffers <e> <s> finally would he feel able to congratulate those people in british airways who have contributed to this action and who have done it either instead of their own jobs or in their own free time <e> <s> in addition as i understand it british airways did not offer any payment for this until after the volunteers themselves had begun their work <e>", "<cs> my lords i am looking at subsection of section and doubtless the minister will have a copy in front of him <e> <s> so while wishing him many happy returns of the day <e>", "<cs> may i ask him whether giving to the authority directions of a <e>", "<cs> my lords while i accept regretfully that obviously that is a correct answer is the minister aware if i may have his attention that he is really very good at finding excuses for never being able to give me a proper answer <e> <s> does he think that perhaps together with the noble earl lord kimberley we might be able to have a case and create a precedent <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in my question i did say <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously i accept what the noble lord says but it seems most extraordinary <e> <s> obviously the files of the department are quite inadequate <e> <s> may i ask him whether he is aware that in our <e>", "<cs> my lords but i never get anywhere from any of the answers either written or spoken <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware how much i am hoping that the new minister will be a good thing so far as i am concerned in the questions that i have been pursuing <e> <s> i should like to follow that by thanking him for his answer and asking him whether he is aware how glad british airways will be at the support which is now given publicly by the government to what they are trying to do <e> <s> i should like to ask him one further question <e> <s> if british airways should feel that they would wish to extend this experiment in lower price tickets to europe would the government feel able to give them any help in that direction <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that the bill seems to be receiving such wholehearted support <e> <s> i began on this matter very early <e> <s> towards the end of october which seems a long time ago now i was looking at various aspects of consumer affairs and i was studying in detail a report which was mentioned by the noble lord lord mishcon and that was of course the report published by the national consumer council called service please with a subtitle <e>", "<cs> my lords old habits die hard even if we have moved benches <e> <s> the bill will cover goods that are provided under work and materials contracts <e> <s> mr willey gave as an example that if a plumber provides and fits taps the protection will be the same as though the taps were bought in a shop <e>

the statement when the time gets a little nearer <e>", "<cs> my lords while the minister probably would not wish to give an answer may i ask him whether the views recently put before the government by both iata and the british civil aviation standing conference on the method of charging for air security are receiving their unbiased consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while being glad of getting a more positive response may i ask the noble lord whether it is correct that he has answered the first part of my question and not the last <e> <s> if i heard him aright did he say that the government hoped to make a statement before the summer recess <e> <s> can the noble lord enlarge on that and say whether we may have a debate in this house on that statement <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the noble baroness and i will both be glad when the head of steam finally has effect <e>

felt that it was a bold english member who <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to take rather a different approach and since i am the twentieth speaker on the list that might be a relief to the house <e> <s> probably like other noble lords in considering whether i should speak tonight i wondered whether i had anything to say that would interest the house and i hope that as my approach is a different one your lordships will bear with me <e> <s> i want to talk about some of the things that were mentioned by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter and my noble friend lord aylestone and if those two noble lords think that they form an odd mixture perhaps they will see what i am getting at as i move on <e> <s> i should like also to take up some points that were made by the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby who it is always a joy to hear and from whom we <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords without intending any discourtesy to the minister is he aware how much i appreciated the note from the secretary of state explaining that he could not be here today <e> <s> reverting to what the minister has said does he realise that it is generally agreed that the deviation in mileage in europe is some per cent <e> <s> and that knowledgeable people in the industry believe that this could well be reduced by per cent <e> <s> with a very large saving thereby of aviation spirit <e> <s> may i ask him secondly and i am aware of what he has told me whether it would be possible to ask iata to pursue this matter so that a world body would be in a position of asking air pilots associations if the air pilots themselves in europe could give indications of the traffic control in their own particular airports <e>", "<cs> my lords while being grateful perhaps we may return to the matter on another occasion <e> <s> but is the minister aware that what i said was that it was generally agreed that the excess mileage in europe was in the order of per cent <e> <s> and that people knowledgeable in the industry believe that this could be reduced by per cent <e> <s> bringing it to per cent <e> <s> with the consequent saving of fuel <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister use his best endeavours to bring home to the protagonists whoever are in the right the very gross inconvenience to million passengers who use london transport who are suffering very much from day to day and who furthermore in my opinion have had enough of it <e>", "<cs> my lords while taking on board what the minister has said about not exacerbating and speaking for myself so as not to embarrass my noble friends on this bench is the minister aware that something should be said on behalf of the passengers <e> <s> is the minister aware that i have nothing to put in hyde park however many places they make available being entirely dependent on london transport <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall merely say this <e> <s> is the minister aware that i and the travelling public are grateful to the minister if to nobody else <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be equally brief and everything i have to say with one small exception is congratulatory <e> <s> first i should like to join with the noble lord lord mishcon in saying that i think all sides of the house are agreed that this is a good bill and that we are very pleased that it has made such quick progress <e> <s> i should like first to congratulate mr fred willey in the other place both on his very good fortune in securing the first place on the ballot and in choosing this bill and if i may i should like to congratulate my noble friend lord mishcon on the way in which he has taken this bill through the house <e> <s> i think we all enjoyed what he had to say <e> <s> he has one great gift if he will allow me to say it and that is that it is a great art to say no to amendments that are put forward but to say it so nicely that nobody minds <e> <s> i can say that quite unbiasedly because i did not put any forward but i was lost in admiration at one or two of the legal points which arose and which the noble lord lord mishcon dealt with so pleasantly and so firmly <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say whether this change was discussed in <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry but i was not referring to that <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that i was referring to the change and i was not criticising that in which telegrams are abolished arid the telephone service is to be used instead <e> <s> i wondered whether this change had been communicated in advance to pounc for its opinion <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister although i think he has already answered it in commenting on the supplementary question put by the noble lord lord underhill whether on the question of alternative flexible rostering i am not right in remembering that this proposal was put forward by british rail that it was totally ignored by aslef for a period of i believe six days and aslef then replied with a national strike <e> <s> we are now told by mr ray buckton on television that aslef wished to undertake flexible rostering and that it is the railways board who are being obdurate <e> <s> would the minister agree that if that is correct we might have it underlined and got over to the general public <e>", "<cs> i never know how wise it is to appear to be ignorant but i am completely ignorant on this matter <e> <s> however it may be that when i sit down having exhibited my ignorance i shall get an answer <e> <s> in listening to i was going to say to my noble friend lord underhill whom i have always regarded as a moderate i came to the conclusion that we were obviously not looking at the same amendment <e> <s> i should be very grateful if somebody could explain it to me afterwards <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mccarthy has not translated my very simple question in the very simple terms in which i asked it <e> <s> i said nothing about the public recognising trade unions <e> <s> i did ask whether i had understood from what the noble lord lord underhill had said and he confirmed it that what was suggested from the opposition side of the committee was that contracts should not be given to firms whatever standards they offered if they did not recognise trade unions in their establishment <e> <s> that is quite different <e> <s> would the noble lord care to correct that <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to be persistent and be a nuisance but i am going to have this right because one gets tied with it for ever if one does not put it right <e>

conditions than trade unions should not have a contract and he agreed with me <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble earl two questions arising from that <e> <s> am i correct in my understanding

my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord the minister will not take it amiss i was expecting the secretary of state to answer my question and so perhaps the noble lord opposite will pass on to him what i was going to ask <e>", "<cs> i am not being offensive my lords and the minister will see where <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that this morning i have received from iata details of routes within the european economic community which could produce considerable savings to the airlines <e> <s> as the annual amount estimated to be saved on fuel alone is million dollars i wanted to know whether the minister would feel able to refer this matter to the council of ministers if i gave him full information so that the whole question could be expedited <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that i would not wish him to think me rude <e> <s> it was only yesterday afternoon when i had discussions with his noble friend who i expected to see here today and in view of what i wanted to say the noble lords appearance rather threw me <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the minister is aware that i wish to be helpful and i realise there are difficulties <e> <s> does he recall that as long ago as th may i said that i was glad to receive a more positive response on this matter <e> <s> today my reply would seem to have been rather over-optimistic <e> <s> may i ask the noble lord if he realises that those of us who are concerned with consumer affairs in this country are finding it extremely difficult to retain our enthusiasm in view of these constant setbacks <e> <s> may i ask him finally if having said what he has said today as secretary of state he really and truly does mean business this time <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware in the first place that it is really refreshing to receive an affirmative reply <e> <s> however if i may pursue the matter a little further presumably in accordance with what has been said in the past the statement will be made in both houses <e> <s> will it as we expect in both houses be an oral statement on which we shall have an opportunity of questioning the government <e>", "<cs> my lords not being able to argue with the minister on the precedents i expect that he has the details of what is done regarding this type of reply may i ask whether he is aware that <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister suggesting that i put down for tomorrow a question for written answer <e> <s> because as yet i have certainly not done so <e> <s> is he further aware that i had no idea that a matter which we have been pursuing for so long and which the airlines have been pursuing would be shuffled out of by means of a written answer to which people cannot reply <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble baroness the leader of the house whether she can help because perhaps i misheard what the noble lord said and we have got rather lost with all these exchanges <e> <s> i thought i heard the noble lord say that it would not be helpful to make a statement tomorrow in this house because that would be to the detriment of the business in another place <e> <s> i do not think that has anything to do with it but that is certainly what i understood him to say <e> <s> i do not know whether the leader of the house could help us in view of the contributions we have had from all sides of the house <e> <s> it may be a most excellent statement but we have not seen it <e> <s> could she possibly use her influence to see whether we could have an oral statement tomorrow <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously i must thank the minister for giving us much more information than he did yesterday but without reopening old wounds may i ask him whether he is aware that we all feel it would have been better if the statement which he has prepared for today could have been given orally today <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to prolong this issue because the house has been very kind but is the noble lord aware that i cannot resist the invitation although he did not intend it as such in his opening remarks <e> <s> concerning when the previous government were in power a government of which i was then a back-bench member does he recall that we almost defeated that government on this issue <e> <s> we lost by only two votes and the votes i collected were mostly from the conservative party among whom i had some most distinguished supporters <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to make a learned intervention but i should like to say something about the broader aspect of this matter and about the public interest <e> <s> i certainly am not anti-union but i am very pro-general public <e> <s> i think that the general public has had a very raw deal over the matter of strikes whether or not the strikes have been justified <e> <s> in listening to what has been said today i have been very pleased by the number of members who have spoken about the principle of this amendment <e> <s> if the general public were to be asked and however the question were to be phrased whether or not they thought members of unions should be consulted before a strike was called i believe that they would say yes <e> <s> anybody who does not accept that is completely out of touch with the general public who have suffered from those strikes <e>", "<cs> yes certainly <e>", "<cs> i apologise <e> <s> i thought the noble noble lord asked what would happen if the ballot went against the leaders <e> <s> i withdraw my remarks <e> <s> i think we are agreed that the leaders would not call a strike if the ballot had gone against them <e> <s> i listened also to what the noble lord lord oram had to say <e> <s> i thought it was so extraordinary of him to say that it was a matter of common sense not to ask members of a union what they felt about something <e> <s> i am not quibbling about whether the method suggested here is the right one <e> <s> but surely it cannot be a matter of non-common sense to suggest that people should be asked whether not or they wish to strike which is certainly what i understood the noble lord lord oram to say <e> <s> later in his remarks he went on to say that if a decision were reached i do not know whether he said the probability or the possibility was that the people concerned would not abide by that decision <e> <s> i do not think there would be any use in having a vote if people did not abide by it <e>", "<cs> my lords if we just leave it at the impracticability i understand what the noble lord means but i think he went on to say that if a whole membership were asked to vote there would be the difficulty of the smaller group a point which was taken up by the noble lord lord howie of troon <e> <s> i was very pleased to hear what he had to say <e> <s> that the whole membership is a problem i quite accept <e> <s> what i hope will come out of todays discussions is that this principle should be put forward <e> <s> the general public has had enough of this <e> <s> i very much hope that when the government come to reply they will say that they can at least accept the principle of our amendment even if they cannot accept it as it stands at present namely the principle that members of a union should be asked before a strike is called <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that it is very good to receive an answer like that and to know that at last progress is being made <e> <s> may i ask the minister whether he will comment on the new resolution adopted by iata namely the tariff integrity resolution which is an attempt to curtail illegal practices <e> <s> that resolution calls for the active support of governments <e> <s> will the minister comment on that <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to draw too much encouragement from what the minister says because i could hardly hear what he said though that was not his fault <e> <s> may i ask whether it is not correct that his department have been asked <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble lord the minister for that reply may i ask whether he is aware how indebted i am to the director of the national air traffic services and his colleagues for the time that they gave me during the recess and from whom i learned a great deal <e> <s> is he aware also that i appreciated the details sent to me by the secretary of state only this week following the action taken by him when he requested his officials at the department of trade to look into the whole question of air traffic control aspects of fuel saving <e> <s> finally may i ask the noble lord whether as he has already indicated the house will not be glad to learn from the noble lord lord cockfield and i quote <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the minister would convey to his noble friend lord cockfield the appreciation of all of us interested in civil aviation at what has been done <e>", "<cs> my lords following that catalogue of acknowledgements may i ask the minister whether he is aware that the secretary of state did say that he would continue to press this matter <e> <s> could the minister give an indication when the time seems suitable for putting down a follow-up question <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say how frequently permits come up for renewal <e> <s> is this a regular period or not <e> <s> secondly can he say whether such clauses are now inserted in the operating permits of most european airlines and all the united states carriers <e>", "<cs> i would be most grateful my lords <e> <s> may i ask the minister if these permits come up roughly once every months what is the reason for a clause not being inserted <e> <s> is it because the government do not wish to do so or because the airline concerned is in a position not to accept it <e> <s> i have one further question <e> <s> if this clause has been in the permits until now has the department of trade taken no action against airlines which have broken the clause <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i am being stupid but can the minister clarify the point for me <e> <s> did i understand him to say in effect to the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter that if an airline breaks the clause in its agreement it is not possible for the civil aviation authority to withdraw the agreement it has given to the airline and that presumably it is up to the airline itself to go the caa and say that it does not want the agreement any longer <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords on wednesday last in another place the prime minister was asked why a certain item had not been included in the queens speech <e> <s> mrs thatcher replied <e>", "<cs> my lords apart from the financial problems which i do realise will the government do their utmost to keep concorde flying <e> <s> because would the noble lord not agree that it is a very great tribute to british engineering and that it would be most unfortunate if supersonic flights over the atlantic had to be abandoned <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has not answered the last part of my question but perhaps i may return to that in a second <e> <s> may i ask him first whether he does not think that i have been very patient in waiting since nd july to ask this question <e> <s> does he recall that on that date he gave me exactly the same answer at least that he hoped to publish the proposals as soon as possible after the recess <e> <s> can he say whether there will be a statement in parliament when these proposals are actually made public <e>", "<cs> my lords while giving full credit to the minister for consistency as i am sure we shall may i ask him this as it seems doubtful that we are to get a statement in parliament can he use his influence through the usual channels to ensure that there is a debate on these matters which are of great concern both to the nationalised industries and to consumers everywhere <e>", "<cs> my lords while not rising on a legal point may i ask the noble earl whether the government still adhere quite firmly to their statement that million passengers per annum will be the maximum permitted at gatwick <e> <s> additionally can he give the house any indication as to when the work at gatwick will be completed and/or actually when the new extension of the terminal will be in use <e> <s> because the two might not be the same date <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister be kind enough to write and confirm the figure of million passengers being the maximum per annum to be permitted <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the minister aware that on the day he mentioned i did ask in this house whether it was not true that mr sproat had asked for this review to be conducted <e> <s> perhaps the minister will refer to the <e>", "<cs> my lords while being grateful for half a loaf in that at least the conclusions will be published may i ask the noble lord whether he feels that as a result of this he will be able to look at the problem which arises when the department of trade and the civil aviation authority both have representatives at international meetings <e> <s> is he aware that whereas the department deals with political and bilateral matters the civil aviation authority deals with fares and this causes a considerable grey area which many people would like to see cleared up <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords do i understand from that reply that other permits will not be coming up for renewal and that these permits do not include the clause referred to <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that little more encouraging reply <e> <s> does he recall that at our last exchanges on th october at column the house was told that it was primarily a matter for the airlines themselves whether or not this clause was adhered to <e> <s> is he aware that since then i have seen representatives of several of the airlines concerned who maintain that this is complete nonsense and that it would be perfectly possible for the department of trade to check adherence to these licences <e> <s> will the minister ask the secretary of state for trade to have a further look at the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the minister to clear up one point which i am sorry i forgot to raise earlier <e> <s> as to the new clause which will be inserted into the permits when they are applied for will the airlines have to file in their application for a permit a list of the scheduled fares which they themselves then guarantee to keep <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that he has completely misunderstood the question <e> <s> is he further aware that it really reduces one to despair in pursuing the government in these matters <e> <s> may i ask him whether he recalls that in the letter which he sent to me this week he said <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether the minister is being obtuse or whether i am but we do not seem to be making any progress at all <e> <s> may i ask him whether he is aware that what he has said so far as supporting the airlines is concerned is not worth the time that he has given to it <e> <s> i am asking him whether as iata has asked the government if these permits are given to airlines the government will check that they are abided by <e>", "<cs> my lords if the house will permit me is the minister aware that i am not wanting anything brought to the courts <e> <s> i am simply asking him whether when these permits are given to airlines and they have a clause in them saying that the fares must be observed the government will take steps to see that the fares are observed and if not whether they will withdraw the

willing to receive some information that i have on these matters <e> <s> is he further aware that i am sure we do not wish to be at variance and perhaps i might put down a question when we have sorted

standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while being glad that this three-year dispute has at last been brought to an end may i ask the minister whether what has been agreed

inform me whether that has now gone the way of other consumer proposals and whether this does not support the fear of many of us that consumer affairs have been demoted from the previous high status

about consumer representation in the nationalised industries and about their prices it is important that we have a debate as soon as possible and can he say whether this might be at all likely before the christmas recess <e>", "<cs> my lords may we feel that the minister will be able to give his blessing to what he is going to say to the chief whip <e> <s> does he realise that on th june the

considering taking up the matter of the cork recommendation for the introduction of civil liability in these matters <e> <s> finally bearing that background in mind might i ask the noble lord whether

government <e> <s> if the government wished to give time they could <e> <s> and why are they so resolutely refusing to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords might i ask the minister while accepting that we have to get the guidelines right whether he is aware that the consumer organisations would like a chance of discussing these guidelines when they are put forward by the government <e> <s> does it mean that

brief that some months ago i asked whether the under-secretary of state mr fletcher and this is not intended as derogating him could be upgraded to a minister of state in order that consumer affairs

gone bankrupt but for the taxpayer standing behind them <e> <s> i ask this question because in the statement we have just heard the minister said and this is a point to which the noble lord lord

standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while knowing that the minister wishes to be helpful i wonder whether we can make further progress <e> <s> can he say whether or not the draft directives on misleading advertising and doorstep selling were agreed <e> <s> because consumer organisations feel that these will be really helpful to consumers <e> <s> arising from that if the draft directive on doorstep selling was not approved was it because the danes are against doorstep selling in any form whatsoever and are therefore not able to accept a directive which would seem to permit it <e> <s> furthermore is it true that any decision reached by the eec consumer council ministers must be unanimous and that if there is any disagreement the directive in question must fall

<e> <s> does the minister recall that on th april at col he told the house that planning consent had been granted to the british airports authority to upgrade the northern taxiway at gatwick in order to make it into an emergency runway <e> <s> in view of that statement would the noble lord comment upon information that i have been given namely that this runway could not even then be used as an emergency runway and furthermore that any possible uses for the runway even after the upgrading would be severely limited and would certainly prohibit most public transport aircraft from taking off <e>", "<cs> my lords that is not good enough <e> <s> would the minister please look into the information which i have given to him <e> <s> i have not manufactured it <e> <s> is he aware that i have been told that it would not be possible to use this runway as an emergency runway even after the upgrading <e> <s> would <e>", "<cs> my lords we are getting several revelations this afternoon <e> <s> will the house allow me to ask the noble lord one further question <e> <s> do i understand from his original reply that if the government of the day should ever wish to lay down a second runway at gatwick or if the new owners after privatisation of gatwick airport wish to lay down a second runway they would be able to do so and would not be prohibited by the agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords reverting to what the noble lord lord beswick said about the taxiway being more readily available may i ask the minister whether he is aware that an airline told me recently that in one year it had cost them half a million pounds for delayed landings when the main runway was in use <e> <s> secondly may i ask him whether he recalls that on rd may he told the house that the taxiway and mention is made of facilities in the question could not be used in adverse weather conditions and neither could it take fully laden public transport <e> <s> therefore does he understand that we are not impressed with the facilities that he talks about <e>", "<cs> my lords as the minister is being good enough to write to me further about the adverse weather conditions would he be able to have inquiries made as to the costs and the delays which are occurring to airlines because there is only this one single runway at gatwick or does he think that might be too dangerous a course to pursue <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply which is much better than i had expected <e> <s> however would he agree that there is particular concern about the enforcement of codes of practice <e> <s> moreover would it not be helpful in general if there was an extension of such codes of practice negotiated with trade associations <e> <s> would not that then lead to a more general consideration of the concern felt about traders who are not members of trade associations <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords that seems a most satisfactory answer and we are all glad to note the improvement and that this country has led the way <e> <s> may i ask the minister two points arising from that answer <e> <s> has the noble lord any idea as to when the council of the international civil aviation organisation will be able to decide on these <e>", "<cs> my lords following that encouraging reply perhaps it might be possible to put down a question before the end of the year to find out whether progress has finally been achieved <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i hope that the minister feels very had about that answer <e> <s> does he recall that going hack to nd february he told us that the under-secretary of state was in earnest about getting on with this particular matter <e> <s> we then waited three months until th may when i asked the noble lord whether he was aware that the people concerned had said that no discussions had taken place <e> <s> the noble lord informed the house that guidelines would be sent out within the next few days <e> <s> moving on from there and waiting another four weeks does the noble lord realise that i made further inquiries and was told that contrary to having been received within the next few days nothing at all had been received and that i then decided that the only course to take in order to ensure that the papers would be received was to put down a question <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that he wrote to me on th june which was five weeks from th may with no apology or regret for the delay <e> <s> he said that the guidelines had now been sent <e> <s> does the noble lord really and truly think that that is good enough especially when on th may at col he did not say merely that the papers would be sent within the next few days but <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not going to have my heart softened by the affection in which we all hold the noble lord <e> <s> first is he aware that the papers were not sent until th june according to his letter and not th june <e> <s> is he aware that the letters were not received until th june <e> <s> in view of this does he wonder at the fact that consumer organisations of whichever political party have complete scepticism about the governments concern for consumers of the products of nationalised industries <e> <s> will be please do something about this matter <e>", "<cs> but my lords they have had to wait five weeks for those discussions <e>", "<cs> my lords the house is very kind it is sometimes difficult to put points in the form of a question but perhaps i might ask one further question <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that in the letter he sent to me no urgency is expressed that there is no sense of urgency hidden away in a single word of that letter <e> <s> have the government given any date by which the two councils must reply to them <e> <s> can the minister give any indication of when he will be in a position to make a further statement to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords does the ministers reply to the original question mean that we shall know only of those recommendations which are accepted by the governments <e> <s> if that is the case is it not unfortunate and would it not be better if we knew also of those which were unacceptable and the reasons for that <e>", "<cs> my lords every one of us speaking today will i am sure be very grateful to the noble lord lord peyton of yeovil for giving us the opportunity to debate this important matter <e> <s> it seems to me that it would have been most unfortunate when the other place had had an opportunity to debate this issue if we had not had a debate <e> <s> i believe that there is a wealth of experience in this house <e> <s> i hope very much that what we say today will contribute to a solution of the problems <e>", "<cs> my lords if imay say so i never mentioned the word tariffs <e> <s> i merely asked whether it was true that klm would have the right to fly to any airport in the united kingdom that they did not already serve and would be able to take passengers from there through amsterdam to their other routes <e> <s> i never mentioned the word tariffs <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister realise how difficult it is not only for him but also for me when we have answers that seem to be continually unsatisfactory <e> <s> is he aware that my information is that the last meeting of the council of ministers made no progress at all on the three matters outstanding despite the fact that they have been up for discussion on the three occasions that the council of <e>", "<cs> my lords it was difficult to hear <e> <s> did the minister say that the next meeting of the council of ministers would be in september <e> <s> or december <e> <s> following from that does he think that it would he more helpful if instead of taking up the time of the house i were to put down a question for written answer inquiring as to the progress that has been made in various meetings this year <e> <s> does the noble lord feel that that report which could be circulated in <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister may not know it but i am appreciative of the way in which he tries to help <e> <s> it is not his fault <e> <s> i lay the fault at other doors <e>", "<cs> my lords going back further than that would the minister agree that the real deterioration in post office deliveries was when we had the introduction of the second tier letter service <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that i was most disturbed to find out that the department knew nothing at all about either of these guides until i put down my question <e> <s> would he not agree that surely it is the responsibility of the department concerned with civil aviation for such publications to be received automatically by that department <e> <s> they are incidentally quite excellent <e> <s> may i ask the minister a separate question <e> <s> as it is illegal to sell these cut-price tickets but not to buy them and as the government obviously do not have the slightest intention of doing anything about it would it not be useful for the industry for the traveller and for all agents if these tickets were made available freely to the general public at all outlets <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the agreement with the dutch has got nothing whatever to do with this matter <e> <s> is the minister further aware that the regulations or the laws established by the government are not adhered to by the government themselves that they do not have the slightest intention of seeing that they are adhered to and that many of us feel that it would be better if these laws were swept away altogether <e> <s> finally may i ask <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister contemplates the dreadful possibility put to him by the noble lord lord bruce of donington may i try to pin him down on one particular point which <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister as he was asked this question in the debate on th june and did not give an answer whether he is able to say that following the publication of the civil aviation authoritys report there will be a debate in both houses of parliament <e> <s> may i also ask him whether that debate will take place before the government announce a decision <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister in case i misheard him whether he is aware that it does not seem to me anyway to be a matter of what is contained in the report as to whether or not we have a debate <e> <s> does he not agree that on a matter so important as this the house should have a debate irrespective of what the report contains <e>", "<cs> i am sorry my lords but the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that like the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter in a recent debate i am taking no sides in this issue until i have seen the report <e> <s> but i will press him on what he said <e> <s> does the noble lord recall that he said a minute or two ago that it would depend on what was in the report as to whether or not it will be necessary to have a debate in this house <e> <s> that is surely not the case <e> <s> if the house wishes to debate that report then surely the contents are not a matter of concern at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor who we do not usually see here dealing with consumer matters whether he is aware that on the less rarified heights what consumers really want is to buy merchandise which will work and will fulfil the promise on <e>", "<cs> my lords can i chance my arm on another point <e> <s> i have not forgotten the legislation to which the noble and learned lord referred <e> <s> i wonder if i might ask him about what is a very real consumer feeling <e> <s> this relates to a consumer sales act which consumers would like to see more accessible <e> <s> as the report says and i agree with it consumers really do feel that it is inappropriate that consumer transactions should be governed by a law that is primarily concerned with and interpreted according to commercial practice <e> <s> can the noble and <e>", "<cs> my lords before the house agrees to the motion might i ask the lord president whether he feels able to express an opinion on an aspect which seems to me to be unfortunate in so far as this house is concerned particularly in view of his well-known and well-recognised attitude concerning the position held by your lordships house in parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that i am delighted that we are at last making progress <e> <s> does he also realise that it has taken us nine months to reach this actual state having started on th october last <e> <s> does he not agree that we would have been saved much time much expenditure and the time of the house if departments would only give answers at the beginning that they have to give at the end <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister something else <e> <s> being aware of the actual process which is envisaged in the near future as is the noble lord might i ask him if i am being unreasonable in assuming that the information should be back to the government departments at least by the end of september and that we might then give him the pleasure of answering some more questions in the spill-over period in october <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister something else if nobody else is going to ask a question <e> <s> this is not the immediate concern of the minister but he has been most helpful <e> <s> does he think that eventually we might be able to ensure a debate in this house on the consumer councils in the nationalised industries which i have had down for more than months and which the government studiously avoid <e> <s> that is if there are any nationalised industries left in the near future <e> <s> does he think that we might possibly have a debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like first to thank the noble earl lord kinnoull very much indeed not only for his speech but for giving us the chance tonight of having what i would call a half bite at the cherry <e> <s> i feel and i am quite sure from what he said that the noble earl felt this too that neither a debate on the consolidated fund bill nor an unstarred question can replace a full-scale debate <e> <s> i hope that the government recognising the importance of this subject will give both houses the opportunity of a full debate in the autumn i think that they must do so <e> <s> i noted what the noble earl said <e> <s> he said he hoped that this half bite tonight would not be the only chance we should have of discussing the many vital matters arising from this report <e> <s> i imagine that every speaker tonight will echo that thought <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister recall that on lth july i asked him whether it was true that the caa had expressed some reluctance to deal with this matter and whether he would press them <e> <s> does he not feel that as all the tickets in the bucket shops are supplied by airlines themselves it is indeed necessary that the civil aviation authority should concern themselves with that matter <e> <s> secondly does the noble lord have any comment to make on the report that the foreign office is to reduce the cost of sending diplomats abroad by making use of promotional air fares <e> <s> can he say something about these promotional air fares and from where they will be obtained <e>", "<cs> i am sorry my lords but the minister is not correct <e> <s> is he aware that i am not referring to any documents or any publications but to the fact that the caa should concern themselves with the availability of cheaper tickets for all travellers at all agencies <e> <s> secondly as time is running out and the recess is due tomorrow can the noble lord enlighten the house as to when we may expect the governments consultative document on air traffic movements <e>", "<cs> my lords as there are varying views about the white paper published by the government and as the leader of the house has admitted the legitimate interest of the house in these matters may i ask the minister without his referring me to the usual channels to say whether it is the governments intention to give the house time to discuss its own white paper in view of the immense importance of the subject <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the minister can comment on something concerning british telecom and the fact that increased telephone charges are to come into effect next month <e> <s> my information is that prior consultation with users did not take place and that the very short notice before the charges come into effect has greatly been deplored <e> <s> secondly can the noble lord tell the house what were the profits of british telecom as at st march this year <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the first part of his reply is really disgraceful in that the consumer associations were not consulted at all on this matter <e> <s> may i ask him whether he is aware that the public statement issued by british telecom stated that the telephone increases were to achieve and i quote a sounder financial footing <e> <s> to most of us a figure of million profit is a pretty sound financial footing <e> <s> how much more would the minister suggest is needed before that is reached <e> <s> finally before he answers me on this matter of the nationalised industries i should like to ask him whether he is aware that british gas had an operating profit at st march this year of million and that the electricity industry had an operating profit of million <e> <s> are consumers to go on paying however enormous these profits are <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that all these facts and i call them facts that he quotes really cut no ice at all with the ordinary consumer who is absolutely convinced that these enormous profits should in some way mitigate the charges to consumers <e> <s> does the noble lord recall although he himself did not answer the question that we raised this matter as regards the electricity charges earlier this year and is he aware that we shall be returning to the matter next week when i hope he will have a better reply <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister recall that the central point at issue in all this was that the electricity industry was being required to make a separate grant to the treasury in of million over and above the million which would have been consistent with the financial target for that year <e> <s> does he also recall that the chairman of the electricity council mr jones said that the million was necessary neither on economic pricing grounds nor in order to meet the industrys current financial target <e> <s> furthermore would the minister accept that this was not an agreed figure but one imposed without any consultation at all <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that i should like to know where he disgrees with me <e> <s> it may be in the past it relates to last february but certainly what i stated is correct <e> <s> i wonder if i might ask him whether he is denying that mr jones the chairman of the electricity council did say that the charges were imposed without consultation and that the council gave way afterwards <e>", "<cs> my lords is it in order before asking another supplementary question to ask the noble earl to repeat the beginning of the last remark of his because i did not catch it <e>", "<cs> so my lords not waiting for <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that after what must seem interminable questions it is rather nice to end the session in thanking the noble lord for the help that he has given on this matter <e> <s> but having said that would the minister not agree that it seems an interminable time since this matter was referred to the international civil aviation organisation <e> <s> if i am correct i believe it was referred in may and does the noble lord recall that in june he told me that they had still not had time to discuss the matter <e> <s> i understand that they are meeting in montreal at the present moment <e> <s> can the noble lord say whether waiting until next year means that the routes affected will not be in a cost-saving position as it has not actually become law <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord will be kind enough to let me know next year when this has finally been settled so that we might have a question down and end the matter once and for all <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while i am glad that no changes are contemplated may i ask the minister two questions on his reply <e> <s> does he recall that relatively recently we have had examples of non-consultation <e> <s> can he tell the house what redress is possible for a consumer council when those statutory obligations are not carried out <e> <s> does a consumer council have direct access to the minister concerned <e> <s> the second point that i should like to ask him is this <e> <s> can he say whether it is true that gas consumers will be asked to pay a larger percentage increase than electricity consumers in the new charges on the grounds that gas should not absorb a larger part of the energy market <e> <s> if so will the gas consumers council be consulted on the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords while being grateful to the minister for the sympathetic reply he gave which if i may say so i feel is more sympathetic than is usually the case from the government benches on this matter may i ask him whether he could possibly answer the second supplementary that i asked him <e> <s> that was not on the actual amount but whether it was true that gas consumers are to be asked to face a higher percentage increase in the new charges than electricity consumers simply on the grounds that gas should not be allowed to make further inroads into the energy market <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that that is no answer to my question <e> <s> but i shall leave that for the moment because there are two other points which i wish to raise <e> <s> does the minister recall that last week his noble friend lord gray of contin who is himself a minister of state at the scottish office told us in what high repute the government hold consumers and about which opinion i felt a certain amount of scepticism <e> <s> but does he recall that during those remarks his noble friend mentioned the great importance which the government attach to the views of consumers <e> <s> if we are to believe that does the minister not agree that consumers should have been consulted on everyday matters like these because surely shoppers know better than whitehall what effects this will have on them <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister think that continually to repeat wrong information makes it right <e> <s> the minister has not answered the question that i asked him <e> <s> from what he has said am i correct in assuming that no consumer organisations were consulted immediately prior to the decision to withdraw the note <e> <s> the fact that they were consulted when the coin was issued is nothing whatever to do with the matter <e> <s> can the minister please look at his answer again and see what else he can say <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not think that it would be nice if somebody paid tribute to the prime minister for having got back this money <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that some of us and i certainly speak for myself are sick and tired of this constant nibbling away at a job of work which i for one think has been well done <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware from his file that when the noble lord lord belstead dealt with these matters he told me that he hoped that the incoming president who was the irish minister would be able to fix a meeting for december that we have now practically reached december and we are no further on <e> <s> might i ask the minister arising from that whether he realises from the file that this is an interminable process on which we have made no progress at all <e> <s> can he give me as a supporter of the eec any indication as to what we could do to hasten these matters <e> <s> would it not seem at present that our consumer affairs minister is simply wasting time when he goes there and that in between for several months he gets no response at all <e>", "<cs> my lords if the minister would allow me to ask this question does he recall that these three directives which he has just mentioned are still outstanding <e> <s> i am not saying whether or not progress has been made <e> <s> does he further realise that they have been outstanding since the mid-s <e> <s> can he please tell the house when he expects that the next meeting of the ministers for consumer affairs is likely to be held <e>", "<cs> my lords reverting to my original question on nd november when the noble lord told the house that the government had <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister as disappointed as i am that it seems to have taken as long to get a reply from the councils as it took us to get the government to send the councils these relevant guidelines <e> <s> does the minister feel that he could hurry matters along or is he just prepared to wait <e> <s> secondly may i ask whether these guidelines were sent to consumer councils other than those for the electricity and gas industries and if so which they were <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister one further question <e> <s> it concerns the announcement to be made tomorrow by british gas about the per cent <e> <s> increase in tariffs from next february <e> <s> can the noble lord say whether the national gas consumers council was consulted on this increase in charges as is its statutory right <e>", "<cs> my lords on a simple matter may i ask the noble lord it may have been that i misheard him i might have been in error but i do not think i made a mistake

consultative committees on thursday last when his noble friend lord skelmersdale i think agreed that these committees should be able to consider fundamental questions including general charging and financial policies <e> <s> as that was accepted and is in the secretary of states guidelines does the ministers reply to the noble earl lord kinnoull mean that the matter he has referred to could in

whether the rights of objection that ratepayers may exercise as specified by the noble earl lord kinnoull could be taken up by the consumer consultative committees <e> <s> i did not ask whether the consultative committees could have this information i asked whether they could act on it <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my

will look at <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to rise for a third time <e> <s> is the minister not aware that he has not answered the question on the order paper <e> <s> may we have some elucidation of

also agree that it was disturbing to read in the statement dealing with this meeting on th february <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while i am glad that the international civil aviation organisation has approved those routes and while i thank the minister for the amount of detail in his answer i should like to ask him whether he can tell us how many of the routes were not approved by the european air navigation group itself for submission to icao <e> <s> secondly can he give us any estimate of the cost saving in this exercise <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister feel that it can now be left to iata to monitor progress and try to hurry up those dilatory countries and does he feel that it is not necessary to bother him with any more questions on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask one further brief question for elucidation <e> <s> am i right in assuming that none of the routes which have not yet been approved were included in the original group submitted by iata which had indeed caused it the most concern <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister <e> <s> i am aware of the last part of what he said <e> <s> but may i ask him whether the comments made by the chairmen of the nationalised industries on the future of their consumer councils will be discussed between themselves the consumer councils and the departments concerned before the government finalise any proposals <e> <s> secondly may i ask him is it not correct that the chairmen of the nationalised industries have attacked most strongly the consultation proposals sent to them by the treasury <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl answer the second part of my supplementary question <e> <s> is it not correct that the chairmen of the nationalised industries have attacked most strongly the consultation proposals submitted to them by her majestys treasury <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords knowing the minister as i do i wonder whether his brief gives him the background to this matter <e> <s> is he aware that the government slipped this through on th december by means of a written answer in another place that members in another place knew nothing about it until mr jeff rooker spotted it in the library and raised the matter by means of a question for written answer on th february <e> <s> does the minister realise that the chairmen of the consumer councils knew nothing about it until mr rooker raised the matter and that they then asked for the consultation proposals to be sent to them <e> <s> would it not have been better if they had been sent to them in the first place <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister not agree that matters affecting the consumer councils are not confined to another place and that we in this house are also interested <e> <s> can he persuade the government to recognise that it is very difficult for us to believe that they really wish to give authority to the consumer councils if they persist in ignoring them in this way <e> <s> finally i should like to ask the noble earl <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while we all hope that these discussions will be finalised in the not too distant future may i ask the minister whether the comments sent in by the consumer councils and those still being discussed cover the original guidelines which were sent out in june last year the treasury consultation proposals which were sent on demand and not upon presentation and the letter dated nd february sent by his department <e>", "<cs> in that case my lords could the minister help us with one further piece of information on a matter which has caused some concern among the consumer councils of nationalised industry <e> <s>

chairmen of nationalised industries covered this matter and that the letter from the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my

exactly answered my question <e> <s> is he aware that the eurocontrol charges have doubled between and <e> <s> does he feel that the government as they have helped on competition policy and as the

the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while i realise that it is not the ministers fault i should like to ask him whether he appreciates that it seems almost impossible to obtain a clear picture of what if anything is happening in this area of consumer affairs <e> <s> looking at the four points mentioned in the question today in spite of the detail that the noble lord has given does he accept that a satisfactory answer has not been given to any one of these <e> <s> finally may i ask him on the point that i think he made that ministers of consumer affairs would meet as and when it was considered necessary is it not true that some eight or nine items are awaiting decision and that some have been waiting for years <e> <s> would this not seem a good time to deal with them <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that while he has tried to paint a picture it is a picture of non-progress <e> <s> that is the point i am trying to make <e> <s> does he feel that on the question set down for th june he will be able to give the house the information for which i asked <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i express to the minister my appreciation of the fact that he has come here today to answer the question at some inconvenience to other arrangements and of what he has said <e> <s> is he aware that those of us who have been working with these consumer councils have been afraid that the helpful and constructive proposals put forward by the department of industry might be lost in the catastrophe of the treasury consultation proposals which have been universally condemned <e> <s> may i ask him also whether he is aware and i think that he is from what he said today that all of us interested in the matter would very much welcome the opportunity to work with his department in salvaging constructive proposals put forward by it in the hope that they might come forward in the next session <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble viscount agree that perhaps the one good thing to come out of the dreadful happenings at brussels is that the problem what we call at the moment soccer violence can perhaps be dealt with <e> <s> does he not agree that really violence at soccer grounds has gone on for some or years <e> <s> i am sure that many people in common with myself who have seen this everywhere have said why dont they do something about it <e> <s> it has steadily got worse and nothing has been done <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the

five times as long <e> <s> why could we not have a better quality paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the minister for repeating the statement may i say that i hope to remember that this is a statement and not a debate which doubtless we shall have at a later date <e> <s> i am looking at one phrase with which we all entirely agree that <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps for the benefit of the house and to save the noble lord trouble he will give the answers now and not write <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister two questions arising from his answer <e> <s> can he tell the house what obstacles remain to agreement by the council on the draft directive on doorstep selling <e> <s> secondly can he tell us what progress was made on the draft directive on consumer credit <e>", "<cs> my lords while still believing that the noble lord wishes to help and to get a move on with these general matters is he able to tell the house when he expects a further meeting to take place <e> <s> are the working groups that have been set up due to report before any further meeting takes place and can he give us any more details <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that most acceptable reply <e> <s> perhaps i may ask him as it would be useful to have legal options in the background and known to be there especially as a number of countries do seem to favour restrictive practices whether the government could increase the excellent efforts they are making to secure bilateral agreements between countries both in the ec and outside <e> <s> if that could be done might it not spur the european commission to more speedy action <e>", "<cs> my lords am i correct in thinking that the council of transport ministers is to meet here in the near future <e> <s> if so can the minister give us the date <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while i am glad that the government welcome the analysis can the noble lord answer

about what is to happen to them when those nationalised industries are privatised <e> <s> who will speak for the consumer then <e> <s> the noble lord mentioned the gas consumers <e> <s> can he tell the house whether the national gas consumers council will continue when gas has been privatised or will some other organisation take over <e>", "<cs> my lords did my hopes mislead me or did the minister give a guarantee that the consumer councils would be continued after privatisation <e> <s> is he aware that i have had a motion on the order paper for two years at the top of the list and we still have not achieved a debate <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that this is the first time we have heard from the government side of the house that there will be any chance of discussion on matters affecting consumers particularly consumer councils and the nationalised industries <e> <s> can the noble lord say whether the discussions to which he refers will apply only to gas or whether they will apply to other industries where the councils are concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord use his influence to endeavour to persuade his noble friend the chief whip

lords is the minister as regretful as i am that he has not been able to give a more positive reply to todays question especially in view of the high expectations engendered <e> <s> can he tell the

years not to have the benefit of what i had hoped would be a satisfactory answer <e> <s> arising from that may i further ask the minister whether i am correct in assuming that a decision whether it is a good one or a bad one will obviously be reached this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i am being very amenable and i realise that after years if <e>", "<cs> my lords if i could revert to the original

why the government should not request all the boards to do so <e> <s> is he really saying that that runs counter to all the departments which might be involved in primary legislation <e>", "<cs> my

these benches thank the minister for making this statement and also the government for finding time to do so <e> <s> i personally should like to thank the noble lord lord bruce for his kind remarks and i should also like to thank the house for its patience over a very long period <e> <s> without that patience we would not have got anywhere <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister following the answers he has just given the noble lord lord bethell whether we are to understand that in this agreement concluded between the two governments revenue pooling will be permitted <e> <s> arising from that may i ask him whether it is not the case that in europe where there is a considerable amount of revenue pooling the advocates of such a course say that it enables airlines to operate which would not otherwise be able to take part <e> <s> arising from that is the minister telling the house that british airways or the belgian airlines are in need of such help and does he not feel that revenue pooling certainly should not be allowed in agreements of this nature <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister was selective in what he replied to in my supplementary questions and i was not surprised at that <e> <s> may i ask him whether it is the case that pooling arrangements do not lead to lower fares <e> <s> that is the first thing <e> <s> secondly is he saying that the airlines involved in this agreement are really those which would not be able to take part unless there were pooling arrangements <e>", "<cs> my lords it was quite brief <e> <s> it was whether pooling arrangements did not in fact lead to lower fares <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords from rd october until today th october is a long time <e>

government now propose to take <e> <s> may i ask the minister whether he recalls on th june last at col of <e>", "<cs> my lords for clarification did i understand the minister to say that the consumer councils had a voice concerning prices and value for money <e> <s> does he recall that in the water industry the thames water authority last year was forced by parliamentary decree to raise prices by a great deal more than they themselves thought necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether he is aware that it is not true or to put it more politely it is not correct to say as i think he did that the question of raising charges such as these was the responsibility of the industry concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister is far too experienced to expect the house never mind me to take that answer <e> <s> that is not what i said <e> <s> i was not referring to the amounts <e> <s> i was saying that prices were raised by government <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may reply to the ministers last statement while i may be wrong on occasions i was not wrong on that one <e> <s> may i ask the minister whether he remembers i revert to the water industry and leave gas and electricity that mr roy watts fought for weeks and i asked question after question in this house about the raising of the rates by the thames water authority <e> <s> mr roy watts refused to do that and said it was far too much <e> <s> it was only when the government decided to steamroller his suggestions and force the increase through parliament that that was done <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while welcoming the statement of the noble earl lord caithness which seems to indicate real progress and welcoming the fact that mr ridley himself is attending the meeting on th november may i ask the noble earl the minister whether in future meetings are likely to be held more frequently <e> <s> the last one was on th june <e>

question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that though that answer is a little better than the one i had expected it has taken four months to reach this stage <e> <s> as no question of legislation is entailed and as the government themselves have expressed a desire that this should be done can the minister say what is holding matters up <e>", "<cs> my lords while i remember that the minister said that the last time does he realise that the house found no credence at all in the fact that giving a little greater publicity cut across all the other departments involved and if the department itself wished to go ahead it would do so <e> <s> why does the department not take steps to help those tenants who are most in need and who are overcharged by a minority of fraudulent landlords <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister realise the near despair that is felt by people who are trying to do a job who continually get that type of answer from him <e> <s> it is nothing but stonewalling and it gets us nowhere <e> <s> it takes months to get a proper answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i drew considerable comfort from a remark made by the noble lord lord

the government just do not wish to know <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls has it wrong <e> <s> the minister has referred to the director general of oftel <e> <s> is it not correct that far from being satisfied with what has been done by british telecom he has expressed the opinion that he hopes there will be a more proportionate distribution of profits at a later stage <e> <s> do the government really approve of what british telecom is doing in other words charging domestic subscribers far more than it really is allowed to which is being hidden by a lesser increase in the rates for business users <e> <s> when one divides the two it comes out at less than the increase in the cost of living but really and truly is it not an abuse of what it is supposed to be doing <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the frankness of the ministers reply the total content of which i imagine would be unacceptable to both of us <e> <s> may i ask him whether the patience of the council of transport ministers has now become exhausted and whether the commission has stated that it will now refer the whole matter to the european court of justice <e> <s> if that is correct could he say when the commission proposes to take action <e>", "<cs> my lords could the minister give the house any information about future meetings of the council of transport ministers and may i ask him in case i heard him incorrectly whether he said that the commission was prepared to wait until the end of next year before doing anything <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl the minister understand that the latter part of that reply is totally acceptable and that we shall all look forward to hearing

excellent timing of the debate and further to congratulate him on the first-class speech with which he opened it <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord leaves that point and as we have a little time in hand i have to say that that is a quite monstrous reply from the noble lord <e> <s> i said that they had made those charges arithmetically correct that they had added them together and then

abuses by british telecom continue for five years until there is a new assessment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while regretting that unhelpful answer may i ask the minister whether he is aware that i have here a copy of a government press notice dated th september a copy of which i hope is also in his brief in which the commission put forward five suggestions supported by the government <e> <s> can the minister tell the house what progress has been made with those five suggestions and with the discussions with

question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not correct that a more modest scheme is now being considered by the government whereas the inspector stated in his report

he implied that the passenger throughput at stansted was million whereas the number is half that to be exact the figure is does he appreciate that i am extremely wary about answers given me concerning stansted <e> <s> with regard to what the minister has said today although we have a certain grain of information can he say why the government are so reluctant to give us information concerning this airport <e> <s> does this mean that the government are aware of the poverty of its position in that the inevitable subsidisation of stansted in the years to come must inevitably be to the financial disadvantage and detriment of the development of regional airports <e>", "<cs> my lords if the minister refers to the exchange on th january i think that he will find he is mistaken <e> <s> however referring to the written answer on th february when the department had had plenty of time to study the position is he aware that the word capacity was introduced as a face-saver <e> <s> it was not

think that it is a disgrace <e> <s> will the noble viscount be good enough to look at the matter to help all suffering back-benchers <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister will probably rule my question as not arising out of the question on the order paper but am i correct in thinking that the present range of new stamps issued to celebrate energy year commenced at p <e> <s> if that is so does he not think that it should start at p at the bottom <e> <s> is it not mean to isolate a large sector of the community and will he take up the matter with the post office <e>", "<cs> my lords if i have it wrong i am sure that the minister will correct me but his answer to this question does seem to imply a curious reluctance to develop european co-operation in aircraft <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister realise that the government white paper on <e>", "<cs> my lords referring to that answer and arising from his letter may i ask the minister if he does not find that an attempted explanation of the discrepancy in our figures is that and i quote from the ministers letter <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has done his best and that i appreciate <e> <s> but this matter first arose over the abuse by some landlords of the resale of electricity <e> <s> does the minister recall that i brought to the attention of the department on whose behalf he has to answer today the statement made by the minister of state for energy in standing committee f when dealing with the gas bill at col of <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a question <e> <s> i am asking whether he recalls it <e>", "<cs> may i ask the minister whether the government stand by that statement and whether he anticipates that the house can be told whether action will be taken soon <e> <s> no delay was mentioned by the minister of state <e>",

dealt with <e> <s> moreover this matter affects some of the poorer sections of our community <e> <s> could not the minister persuade the department to get a move on <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i have had a long courteous detailed and entirely negative letter from the chairman of the post office <e> <s> as the minister has not answered the question on the order paper which asks whether her majestys government would take certain action perhaps i may ask the minister this question <e> <s> as we have a christmas issue of second class stamps because so many people want a special stamp does he not think that many people would equally like a special stamp for the queens th birthday anniversary <e> <s> does he feel that the attention of the chairman of the post office could be drawn to that <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that we cannot always dwell in the past on this matter any more

who use first class stamps <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the minister will be a little more specific

"<cs> my lords having paid tribute on many occasions to what the government are trying to do in all this may i ask whether the minister is able to elaborate at all on what he told us on rd january as to the progress the commission had made in what the minister described to us as the detailed preparation of possible court cases against member states <e> <s> does the minister recall that he himself said that such cases might be useful if the council continued to block progress <e> <s> could he comment on that <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the fact that mr spicer said last week that it was outrageous that competition in aviation matters in europe was still so severely restricted and in view of the opposition that our country is meeting in our european colleagues could the minister say whether we have been able to do anything additionally by way of bilateral agreements to hurry these matters up <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not more than an option <e> <s> am i not correct in remembering that we have always been told that as the british government would be in the chair for the last six months of this year they would quite definitely deal with this matter if the council were not able to deal with it beforehand <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not true that birmingham has a unique combination of facilities to offer with its national exhibition centre sited next to the birmingham international airport and adjacent to a london-linked railway station <e> <s> is it not obvious that if the government will continue to give the support that has been mentioned it will

not there should be an additional runway at gatwick <e> <s> it was definitely stated and i have it here if the noble earl wants it that mr eyre was conducting that inquiry on the assumption that the government had decided that there should be no second runway at gatwick <e> <s> it was not within the remit of mr eyre <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble earl refers to the debate that he has just mentioned he will find that i gave him a column number and the date so he need not do any more than just look up that speech <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that i have to rise again but i am receiving quite a lot of education <e> <s> i was under the impression that if something was put down by the government for discusssion it was up to the government to have that discussion and not to

link <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that that reply is quite disgraceful and if his brief is no better it is unbelievable <e> <s> will the minister please explain to the house why if the british government still wish to have a rail link to stansted which i doubt and if british rail still wishes to supply that link why it has not pursued its application <e> <s> will the minister further explain to the house why the debate which was adjourned until th march because it was talked out has since then been deferred to th march th march th march th april th april and today <e> <s> will the minister tell the house whether the government as they have obviously run into trouble are afraid of not getting their business through in another place or have they plucked up their courage to take the matter forward tonight in the commons <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware first that i am not amused and secondly that i thought his reply the other night was a disgrace <e> <s> will he please understand that those of us who have worked for months on this matter resent this type of reply <e>

with and <e>", "<cs> my lords the house is very kind but do noble lords realise that i am being tried beyond endurance <e> <s> will the minister please address himself to one particular point <e> <s> why does british rail not proceed with the application which it made to the house on th february <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl allow me to ask him on a point of fact whether he is aware

scheme that was put forward by british rail as being financially viable <e> <s> if it was financially viable then why is it not financially viable now <e> <s> but the minister gave a very lukewarm

should be strong and should contain within it tough and consumer-minded members <e> <s> i was very glad when this amendment was proposed today by my noble friends lord diamond and lord ezra because i think we must all realise that at the moment the position of consumers which this amendment would hope to modify or improve is really quite serious <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble earl can find out the answer to this question because probably he does not know it <e> <s> while the rail line from gatwick to victoria is excellent one of the problems has been that there are no porters at victoria station <e> <s> i am aware that one can get trolleys there but it is not easy <e> <s> nor is it easy for elderly passengers <e> <s> i understand that in the past british rail has not had the finances to take on porters <e> <s> will the minister be kind enough to inquire whether or not that position has improved <e>", "<cs> i should like to add a few minutes to this point <e> <s> i was glad to hear what the noble lord lord stoddart said and i fully support it <e> <s> in our debate on thursday when i supported the amendment moved by my noble friends lord diamond and lord ezra which the committee was not able to accept i tried to explain that i was worried about the domestic consumer in this legislation <e> <s> i also said that one of my chief worries was not so much what professor carsberg had not done in the case of domestic consumers and british telecom but over the fact that i thought primarily that the legislation was to blame rather than professor carsberg <e>

was not sure who would be answering the question today <e> <s> it was the department of trade and industry which requested the report whereas the responsibility for civil aviation rests with the department of transport <e> <s> is he further aware that i say that knowing that the request was made in october and that may have been the reason <e>", "<cs> may i ask the minister without being referred to the usual channels and as the leader of the house is here whether it would be courteous to the national consumer council which has produced this enormous report after great research if we had time for a debate not necessarily on what the government will do but on what the national consumer council has reported to the government <e> <s> does the minister think that he could recommend to his noble friend the leader of the house that we might have government time to debate the report <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the very moderate amendment moved by my noble friend lord diamond <e> <s> as the noble lord lord gray of contin knows i am by no means convinced that this regulatory authority will be anything like strong enough or have the force or numbers to deal with the problems that arise <e> <s> i cannot see that accepting the suggestion put forward by my noble friend that we merely leave out the word numbers will do any harm to the bill <e> <s> he has left in the words with the approval of the treasury <e>", "<cs> in a way i find myself in the same difficulty as the noble baroness lady macleod with these two amendments <e> <s> i wish they could have been taken together <e> <s> i wonder whether i may try to explain to the minister what i think is the background problem to all this <e> <s> i have an interest to declare which goes back to which is a very long

tell the committee that i am worried and have grave misgivings about stansted <e> <s> as i said on second reading i am not against the development of stansted but i am against the size of the development now projected and i emphasise the word now <e> <s> fundamentally i believe that the government will subsidise stansted to any amount that they consider is essential to push through this too hasty amount of development <e> <s> furthermore i believe that if that financially damages regional airports it will be just too bad the development will still go ahead <e>", "<cs> this is a belated interruption because i was chasing through my notes <e> <s> the noble lord said that i spoke about the too hasty development of stansted <e> <s> that was not a happy choice of words <e> <s> i have just been looking at my notes <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that i spoke of the too big development of stansted and that capital expenditure of million at present is far too much for stansted

phrase that the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter heard <e> <s> an important part was left out <e> <s> i referred to too hasty an amount of development at stansted now <e> <s> the amount of development was left out <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that i left this question on the order paper because although i knew the answer i wanted to have the opportunity of thanking the chairman of the post office for having done this <e> <s> may i hope that the government will also thank the chairman of the post office <e> <s> i also express the hope that for other special issues penny stamps will also be included <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a pity that the government cannot just be generous and thank the chairman of the post office for having done this <e>", "<cs> i feel more strongly about the amendment upon which we have just voted when the opposition was defeated than i do about this amendment <e> <s> however i am worried about the attitude of the government towards consumers which does not seem to have made the progress that the government believe that it has <e> <s> the noble lord lord belstead in replying to the previous amendment stated that before authorisation was given various things would be done <e> <s> i thought at the time that surely and this is what the noble lord lord bruce has just been saying discussions should take place before the authorisation or whatever it is is made <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment particularly from the viewpoint of elderly people <e> <s> we have heard a great deal during the past terrible winter about elderly people and their problems <e> <s> i am sure that the minister will know that elderly people use less gas than most of us because of its cost <e> <s> the standing charges form therefore a high proportion of what they have to pay <e> <s> i wonder however whether the minister is aware that there are real fears among elderly people and among the organisations that cater for them that under a privatised british gas standing charges may increase disproportionately in future years <e> <s> many elderly people will therefore have greater difficulty still in paying their bills <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that the minister wishes to help and i do not doubt the good faith of the government on this matter <e> <s> however concerning the answer that he has just given is he aware that i have a question down for th june and that perhaps with that question we may get a definition of the decision referred to <e> <s> referring to the question on the order paper today does the minister realise that i asked him whether any further progress had been made in the detailed preparation of possible court cases of which we were told originally on rd january <e> <s> can the minister enlighten us on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the minister for his reply <e> <s> it shows what one can do by a little co-operation <e> <s> may i ask the noble viscount whether he is aware that mr spicer at a recent conference in manchester said that if real competition in european air services could not be achieved by negotiation the united kingdom would be compelled to take the matter to the european court <e>

clearly and simply about this and so the fault must be mine one question <e> <s> when he was talking about this i thought he said it would be up to the consumer to make what arrangements he or she thought necessary in the event of the gas supply failing or escaping <e> <s> does his answer mean that the consumer will have to pay for that <e>", "<cs> i was asking why the consumers should have to pay anything <e> <s> it is nothing to do with them it is either the equipment or the supply that is wrong so why should the consumer be expected to foot any part of the subsequent bill <e>", "<cs> all of us who are householders and who have people coming to make <e>", "<cs> am i to understand from what the minister has said that if the fault is in the appliance which is owned by the consumer then the consumer may have to pay <e> <s> if that is so i quite understand <e> <s> but what i want to know is whether if the fault arises from something other than the actual appliance the consumer is still liable to have to pay <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for his patience and i hope mutual self-help will make progress later on <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment proposed by my noble friend lord diamond <e> <s> i hope the minister realises that the high charges which have to be made to bring out skilled men to do a job are a real deterrent to householders <e> <s> i fully appreciate that the skill has to be paid for but in such cases it may well deter the less well-off sections of the community from sending for a skilled worker when necessary <e> <s> with those few words i hope that the minister will consider the matter further <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that many years ago we always said that a woman had to be a great deal better than a man to get equal consideration <e> <s> is he further aware that those of us who term ourselves progressive women hope that those times have passed <e> <s> will the government do something about it <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> i repeat straightaway that i am not opposed to the development of stansted airport but i am opposed to the amount of development that is being undertaken now and i am opposed to the way in which the government have been carrying out this procedure from the very commencement of the plan <e>", "<cs> my lords i think there can be no better introduction to this amendment than the advice submitted by the civil aviation authority to the secretary of state for transport entitled measures for the distribution of traffic among the london area airports cap <e> <s> equally i would suggest there can be no doubt that on almost every available forecast london will need additional runway capacity by the turn of the century or if some forecasts

the runways <e> <s> i wanted to ask him whether he is rejecting the opinion of the civil aviation authority that london will need additional runway capacity before the end of the century <e> <s> it takes at least years to lay down such a runway <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like briefly to support the amendment <e> <s> if the government were to say that of course the united kingdom means all

particular matter <e>", "<cs> my lords while i believe the minister would wish to help may i ask him whether he is aware that the house never thinks a great deal of the phrase matters are being kept under review because that never leads to any action <e> <s> as it is not advisable to accept defeat when wishing to make progress does he feel that the occasional question to him on this matter in future might induce some action on the part of the authorities concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that i have been given a figure of passengers per annum using the helicopter link

these nationalised organisations the customer still has to pay increased prices <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble viscount a question that i put some time ago <e> <s> are the government considering any possibility of solving these serious problems by other means than these very lengthy and expensive inquiries <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while regretting this decision as the airlines have been preparing themselves ever since the <e>", "<cs> my lords in order to get the background quite right on this may i ask the minister whether it is not correct that the commission can take action independently of the council and that the british government also can take action independently through article of the treaty of rome <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while believing that the government wish to make progress on the matter of european air fares and realising that the secretary of state for transport finds himself entrenched between opposing factions i should like to ask whether the minister realises that if the british presidency is not to be discredited some firm and definite action must be taken <e> <s> in view of the generalised answer the minister gave to me can he assure the house that the government stand by their previously stated intention of achieving a first credible step in this campaign during the term of their presidency <e>", "<cs> my lords i too have read that article but it does not concern the question that i have asked today <e> <s> perhaps i may ask the minister whether or not in his notes of the meeting on rd october there is any reference to the question of the airlines replying to the letter from the commission which was sent to them on july th being raised by the president <e>", "<cs> my lords if nobody else wishes to speak perhaps i may ask the minister whether he is aware that although we get all these protestations there is no lack of words there is lack of action <e> <s> can the minister tell the house whether or not at the forthcoming meeting on th and th november we shall at least see some action or are we again to be told merely of the difficulties that arise in trying to achieve it <e>", "<cs> my lords in any debate which covers home affairs and the environment it is obvious that we must touch on a great many subjects some seemingly of much greater importance than others <e> <s> having listened today to the speeches on the criminal justice bill on penal reform and on law and order i realise that what i want to talk about although i shall be brief may seem not as important to the public as those particular matters <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down is he aware that each time he referred to a noble baroness i hoped that he would reach me <e> <s> i made a short speech in which i asked him two questions <e> <s> they were very definite <e> <s> i gave him previous notice <e> <s> will he please give me an answer <e>", "<cs> my lords why did the minister not give me that information when it was there <e> <s> why has he had to have it dragged out of him-because if i had not asked him a question we should not have had the answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while realising that the government wish to make progress and that the minister himself wants to be helpful may i ask is the noble lord aware that there has been a watering down of the original package which was proposed by britain <e> <s> secondly his reply mentioned capacity <e> <s> is the noble lord lord brabazon aware that the capacity sharing on main routes proposed now by britain is considerably more protectionist than that which was advanced by the commission itself <e> <s> finally may i ask the noble lord this question if the government themselves are not prepared to take independent action as they are fully entitled to do will they at least press the commission to act promptly on legal matters in the courts <e>", "<cs> my lords arising out of that reply may i ask the minister whether he is aware that i regard the suggestion for the capacity sharing as being very weak indeed <e> <s> am i not correct in saying that what the commission proposed was bringing it down to per cent <e> <s> lastly can the minister tell us which are the countries who are opposing progress in europe <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i congratulate the government on the uk initiative which produced the resolution and thereby salvaged quite a lot from the wreckage of the commission paper <e> <s> may i ask the minister with regard to the commisssion being asked to report back in a years time whether he is aware that the paper prepared by the commission was not what the council asked for <e> <s> is he further aware that no definite recommendations were made in it <e> <s> finally is he aware that the section dealing with the consumers consultative committee ignored entirely the report of your lordships house on ec consumer policy <e> <s> therefore will it be possible for the minister to bring to the attention of ministers the points i have made and perhaps we may return to the matter on a future occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the house appreciates as i do the way in which he has coped with this question <e> <s> but will he ask the ministers to realise that unless their initiative is followed up we shall get nowhere <e> <s> these matters drag on in the commission year after year <e> <s> will he stress the necessity for enforcing a follow-up <e>", "<cs> my lords i too had noticed in the statement <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble and learned lord the lord advocate for taking us so clearly and concisely through the bill <e> <s> in my remarks i shall be dealing with some of the points he made <e> <s> as the noble lord would expect we on these benches agree with some of those points and disagree with others we shall take that further in committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish that i were as optimistic as the minister in his reply <e> <s> will he not agree that responsibilities of the presidency extend to the whole of the community <e> <s> i am asking whether the minister considers that at the end of this year on st december we as president should issue a statement on what we have tried to do on this matter where we have failed and what we think the step-by-step advance towards this achievement should be <e> <s> that would surely be a legacy to leave behind as president and a necessary one <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to niggle <e> <s> is the minister aware that i think mr moore and the government have done their best <e> <s> however it is not enough <e> <s> is he aware that there is no sense of urgency in the community on these matters <e> <s> everything we read in the paper speaks of developments in three or four years and when the commission has taken further decisions <e> <s> can the minister urge on his right honourable friend and the prime minister that we would welcome a statement on st december along the lines i have suggested <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but that does not deal with the question on the order paper which asks what happened at the meeting of transport ministers on th december <e> <s> however perhaps when the noble lord replies to my supplementary questions he can remedy that <e>", "<cs> my lords that has not advanced us at all <e> <s> first may i thank the minister for sending me a copy of the report to which he referred <e> <s> however surely he should know whether the commission has taken any action <e> <s> that is what is <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no wish to be rude to the minister but i think that he should know when questions are put down on the order paper <e> <s> i am not at all amused and i am getting rather tired of it <e> <s> is it not right that whoever provides the brief for the minister should take the trouble to see what replies are likely to be necessary <e> <s> as he has just told the house that he does not know about british caledonian does not know the reason and does not know the action which the commission has taken we have gleaned no information at all <e> <s> is he further aware that a letter to me on that subject will not satisfy me and that i proposed to put down the same question a few weeks hence when he will perhaps know the answer <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell the house from where the objections have come <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister elucidate which other airlines please <e>", "<cs> we have had a long debate and it is not my intention to inflict myself on the committee for more than a few moments <e> <s> first with regard to a matter about which great play has been made by the noble lords lord lucas lord peyton and others namely the innovation and the innovative nature of british industry i really cannot see why this question should keep coming up time and again

such a thing will happen to us if we have the same rule as they have on the risks defence <e> <s> that is the first point i should like to make and i think it is a matter of common sense <e>", "<cs>

<e> <s> i hope very much that the government will give consideration to the points put forward by the noble baroness lady nicol <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment put forward by the noble baroness lady nicol <e> <s> as she said the gas consumers council is concerned at the omission of all secondhand goods from the general duty to supply safe consumer goods <e> <s> i think we are all concerned <e> <s> i hope the committee is concerned and i know that the noble lord lord lucas of chilworth is anyway not unsympathetic to the point of view <e> <s> we are concerned that the exclusion of secondhand goods could diminish vital safeguards for consumers provided under the safety provisions of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords do i take it from that that no progress on this matter can be made <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry but the minister forgot to tell me the date of the next meeting of the council <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the minister has omitted to answer the last part of my question <e> <s> will he be good enough to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that it seems impossible to discover what is going on in this matter of air transport in the community <e> <s> the minister does not know and we members do not have a chance of asking anybody who seems to be aware of the position <e> <s> is he telling the house that there is no co-operation at all between the commission and the council of transport ministers on matters of mutual concern <e> <s> will he please tell me whether all replies have been received from the airlines by the commission or does he not know <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not say i am sorry to pursue this matter <e> <s> but does the minister realise that the best way to get rid of me is to give me a decent answer <e> <s> does he appreciate first that i really am interested and i think the house is interested in this matter <e> <s> secondly does he realise the impossibility of asking him a question because he says he does not know the answer <e> <s> when we ask him about the commission he does not know about it because it acts by itself and when we ask him about the council of ministers and joint co-operation he says that there is none at all <e> <s> does the house wonder that we get nowhere on this matter of liberalising air transport <e>", "<cs> as the amendments selected deal with clauses and i should like to

the status of the code of practice <e>", "<cs> i should like to raise two separate matters on clause <e> <s> at the moment i am merely seeking information so i have not put down an amendment on these two points but i gave notice to the noble lord lord lucas that i would be raising them <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the minister and i should like to study what he has said <e> <s> i think however that paragraph in the <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has mentioned those measures and the wide spectrum covered <e> <s> can he tell the house whether those measures included one for the liberalisation of air transport within the european community <e> <s> specifically can he tell us whether there has been any adoption of the aviation competition regulation under article of the treaty of rome <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords does that reply mean that the government are contemplating no action at all <e>

south of england <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that the immediate past president of the caa sir john dent and the present one mr christopher tugendhat have both said that there will be a necessity for this <e> <s> do the government take no account of chairmen of the civil aviation authority in matters affecting civil aviation <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that i am most grateful for that last grain of comfort <e> <s> we might at least move a little further <e> <s> but may i ask the minister one further question <e> <s> does he recall that some time ago the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter asked the government and here i refer to gatwick whether they knew of any airport in the world which put through million people on a single runway and do the government still think that that is a safe and advisable thing to do <e>", "<cs> my lords on a point of clarification of what the minister has said because it is important did i understand him correctly to tell the house that in connection with the laying down of any runways anywhere in the country and not just in the south-east of england though i mentioned the south the primary condition would be environmental <e> <s> are we to understand from that that the environmental lobby has precedence over that of the aviation industry or anything else in connection with civil aviation <e>", "<cs> i am sorry my lords <e> <s> is

to the european commissioner for consumer affairs on reform of the consumer consultative committee <e> <s> is he aware following the remarks made by his noble friend lord harmar-nicholls and from my questions that the commission and the people in brussels are unlikely to be overburdened by the decisions that they take <e>", "<cs> my lords my intervention will be very brief <e> <s> we have a long list of speakers but i should like to say just one thing before starting my main remark <e> <s> i regret that the government were not able to put this bill down for discussion as first business on one day <e> <s> i think it is very unfortunate that we had to start as late as we did today <e> <s> following on from that i should like to thank the noble lord lord brabazon for recognising that fact and not only for the succinct way in which he moved the bill but also for the brevity of his speech <e> <s> other speakers have tried to be equally brief as i certainly shall <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that reply <e> <s> i am rather stuck because i wanted to ask if the judgment was as she has given whether the irish government are now free to deposit their instrument of ratification of the single european act if they so wish <e> <s> does the ministers answer mean that the ratification may now be indefinitely delayed and can she give any indication of how long that delay might be <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for what she has been able to say <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not happy about the commission and qualified majority voting <e> <s> is it not correct that matters can only be decided in that way if the commission approve or are content with what the qualified majority on the council wish to put forward <e> <s> as the matter is rather complex and as the minister seems to want to help will he feel able to publish in the <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask just one further question <e> <s> are the government really content and do they believe that the commission will stand firm on the liberalisation of air transport as we understand it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the minister for what he has said <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say why his noble friend lord bruce-gardyne is so prejudiced against british aerospace <e> <s> is he aware that the noble lord always stresses as he has today the cost to the taxpayer without mentioning that loans and interest are being repaid <e>", "<cs> my lords on a point of information may i ask the minister whether i am correct <e> <s> is not this application for million over <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened very carefully to what the noble lord lord lucas had to say <e> <s> i tried very hard not to be side-tracked from the main objective by listening to the various points that he made because he really shifts his ground on whatever amendment is before the house or committee which i suppose is to be expected <e>", "<cs> my lords during the committee stage the noble baroness lady nicol moved an amendment that we should leave out lines and on page which of course would have deleted one of the defences against offences under the general safety requirements by removing the defence of goods intended for export <e> <s> those of us who supported the amendment regretted that it was not acceptable to the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister to clear up one matter <e> <s> i asked him whether consultations had actually started <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while hoping that the commissioners will take note of that suggestion and that advice what i had in mind was the informal meeting of the transport ministers on th february <e> <s> can the minister tell the house whether or not anything useful emerged from that meeting and whether it is true that the commission was unhappy at the rate of progress made <e> <s> if that is the case could the minister tell the house whether he feels that the commissioners mentioned in his original answer will really take some active steps in the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the minister for that reply is it not correct that the community is coming under increasing pressure from the consumer movement for some definite advance in the liberalisation of air transport <e> <s> do the government feel that they could co-operate by joining with the consumer movement in these matters so that some real progress is made <e>", "<cs> my lords the discussion that we are now having gives me the opportunity of making a point on the control of problems caused by the resale of electricity and presumably of gas <e> <s> as the minister will recall we have had many discussions over past months and indeed over past years and we have made a certain amount of progress <e> <s> but the electricity consumers council has become worried about a particular aspect <e> <s> i should like on behalf of it and of all consumers to ask the minister for clarification <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to have that assurance <e> <s> may i take it from that that all the people whom i have mentioned i did not give the noble lord notice of this will be included in the clause amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords it is difficult to avoid repeating what was put forward at the committee stage <e> <s> at that stage in my opinion we got exactly nowhere <e> <s> there was general agreement that the control of misleading price claims is a difficult area <e> <s> i asked the minister whether the government would pay particular attention to a point on which felt strongly and which was supported by the consumers association and by the national consumer council <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down will he be kind enough because i have raised these matters several times to look through the remarks that i made and write to me on the points that he has not been able to answer today <e> <s> do i take it that the noble lord will do that <e> <s> i see he indicates his assent for which i thank him <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for what he has just said <e> <s> i think it will be very reassuring to the organisations i have mentioned <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that helpful list of dates <e> <s> can he tell us what the commission is doing to implement the resolution which was agreed at the october meeting of the consumer council and which stated that consumer interests should be more fully reflected in community legislation <e> <s> does he recall that that same proposal urged that early measures should be taken <e> <s> in view of that can the minister say whether on any of the dates he has mentioned this matter will now be on the agenda <e>", "<cs> my lords while being somewhat encouraged by the information that has been given this afternoon and while believing that the government are aware that the consumers consultative committee is frequently neither <e>", "<cs> my lords while very much appreciating the way the minister has answered these questions today may i ask him whether he is aware that if i have the information as to what has taken place in that committee i think it not unlikely that he will have it <e> <s> may i further be so bold as to ask him whether he will inquire within his own <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to comment briefly before we part with the bill <e> <s> this consumer protection bill contains provisions that are welcomed by consumer organisations and we in the house have been able to carry certain measures which add to that welcome <e> <s> i very much regret that we were unsuccessful in deleting the development risks defence <e> <s> i believe that in future it will be seen as a grave error and a misjudgment <e> <s> obviously this is not the occasion to reopen the matter but i still feel that the argument that the individual should not suffer unduly compared with the rest of us is a just one <e> <s> four member states of the community accept that responsibility namely france belgium luxembourg

henderson has said <e> <s> we all recognise the noble lords great constitutional <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while hoping that real progress has been made may i ask the minister this question <e> <s> is he aware that consumer organisations both in europe and in the united kingdom concerned particularly with the liberalisation of air transport believe that the original proposals have been watered down <e> <s> can the minister tell the house whether or not it is correct that the agreement reached on the th march is subject to several qualifications including a clause that any fares proposed by an ec airline may be challenged by another ec airline <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not correct that the agreement reached on march th depends also on a total package covering capacity sharing and market access being reached by the end of june <e> <s> if that is correct can the minister tell the house what action is proposed by the commission if agreement is not reached by th june <e>", "<cs> my lords fortified by that comment may i ask the minister a question on a point of clarification <e> <s> i think in his answer he referred to pressure being brought by the commission on the council of ministers <e> <s> may i ask him whether he is aware that my information is that mr peter sutherland the commissioner responsible for competition wished to take action against three national airlines alitalia olympic airways and lufthansa but that on th march his fellow commissioners ruled that this was not to be done at that stage and asked for three weeks further grace <e> <s> the three weeks further grace will be up next week <e> <s> can the minister tell the house whether it is the case that if those airlines have not by then conformed with what they were asked action will be taken or will there have to be further discussions in the commission <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his patience <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not correct that delay has already cost the consortium <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no wish to oppose the passing of this bill but i should like to make a number of brief comments before the house sends it on its way <e> <s> in november british rail submitted to the government a proposal to construct a rail link to stansted airport <e> <s> on th february the british railways stansted bill came before another place <e> <s> despite government support the bill was talked out and failed to secure a second reading <e> <s> as noble lords will recall from questions asked repeatedly in this house dates for resuming the adjournment debate kept appearing and disappearing on the order paper of another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while i am glad that the commission has made some progress may i ask this question <e> <s> does this mean that we shall have to wait until all these agreements have been deemed compatible with the competition rules of the treaty of rome before any further step forward can be taken <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that helpful comment but can he deal with one further point <e> <s> is it correct that all the airlines had agreed to set up a tribunal to settle disputes on air fares but that this would fall unless agreement on a general package is arrived at by th june <e> <s> further to that if there is a general election on llth june would that mean that our responsible minister would be unable to add his signature to any agreement reached <e>", "<cs> my lords as the minister mentioned birmingham is he aware that many people in and around birmingham feel that if the airport could be granted gateway status it would greatly help the development of international flights <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that comprehensive reply but is it not correct that mr spicer has stressed the importance of the european market being treated as a single entity <e> <s> is it not true that the british airways plan as supported by the caa would have been an important step in that direction <e> <s> can the minister say whether the government or the caa are contemplating any further action in respect of the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister help a little further <e> <s> is he aware that my information is that five european governments in addition to america were also attacking the british airways plan because they were afraid that it would damage their pooling arrangements which we all should like to see abolished <e> <s> will the minister further agree that so long as european governments support their own national airlines in this matter we shall <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards that last point i should like to ask the minister this because i have information to the contrary that those five governments have done so if i give him the names outside this chamber will he have the matter inquired into and write to me <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome very much the million launch aid although it is considerably less than the million asked for by british aerospace <e> <s> however in spite of the most helpful letter that the minister sent me in reply to my query on the delay and while i am glad that our delay is less than that of other governments i still feel that there has been a considerable delay in this matter <e> <s> i am glad that the imminence of the general election has rather hastened a decision on it <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret very much the action of the government in the matter of this particular amendment <e> <s> even more than that i regret the manner in which it has been done <e> <s> i should like to say straight away that that is not a criticism of the noble lord lord lucas <e> <s> i am referring to matters outside this chamber altogether <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister will remember that during our discussions on this point i took strong exception to the fact that this house was not able to discuss the matters which had been referred to the concordat particularly in view of the fact that i think the government have twice refused to accept the views put forward by the concordat which they could have discussed in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down perhaps i may ask him a question on the matter of the status of the code of practice <e> <s> does the noble lord think that there will be any opportunity if we so desired to discuss this in your lordships house i was going to say in the forthcoming session but when we return so that we really could have the opportunity which i think was

his publicly designated position as aviation minister although i have always regarded him as such in this house may i ask him whether he is aware how very much i regret the position in europe where at

order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell the house whether we may take it that the liberalisation of air transport and the necessity for some urgent action will be included in the discussions on those dates <e> <s> can the noble lord also clear up a point from last week <e> <s> does the minister recall that on nd april he told the house that the commission had decided that if the council of ministers had not reached agreement by th june it would withdraw the exemptions from the competition rules <e> <s> has this been done <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret that on the last point i became rather muddled halfway through <e> <s> is the minister telling the house that the commission has done what it said it would do and withdrawn the exemptions from the competition clause

three months away so that we might hope for some action then <e> <s> may i return to what the minister has just said <e> <s> is he aware that i find it quite unbelievable and i hope the house finds it unbelievable too that apart from making no progress in brussels we now apparently have the commission reneging on what it said before <e>", "<cs> my lords the house is very patient but what is one to do <e> <s> somebody has to go on <e> <s> is the minister aware that it is no use saying that the council of ministers reached agreement because they did not reach agreement <e> <s> i am not concerned

commission proposal for a child safety campaign <e> <s> if that is correct can the minister tell the house what steps the government are taking in advance of the commissions proposals to make their own contribution to the ec child safety campaign in and whether the government will be discussing those proposals with the voluntary organisations to see what they can do together <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask the minister one further question <e> <s> is he aware as i feel he probably is that there was considerable anxiety among the consumer organisations and the relevant select committee of your lordships house about the ineffectiveness of the consumer consultative committee <e> <s> on th february the government told me in an answer in <e>", "<cs> my lords i in my ignorance had thought that we would be told what the private notice question that had been asked was instead of which we only got the answer <e> <s> but i should like to ask the minister i am probably echoing what the noble lord lord williams of elvel has just said whether this matter came as a complete surprise to the director general of fair trading as <e>", "<cs> my lords i made two points with which the minister did not deal first competition and the likely effect of this merger and secondly the international repercussions <e> <s> i also asked him whether the government would refrain from taking a decision until the house had had an opportunity to debate the matter <e> <s> reverting to what the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter said can the minister give us a definite assurance that if it was proposed to alter the arrangements under which air transport has been working in this country through the caa at least that would not be done until the matter had been debated in parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords can we take it from the reply that the minister has just given and referring to an answer he gave the house on th july that the commission and the european parliament have completed the new procedures required for the single european act <e> <s> if they have not when do they expect to do so <e> <s> can he tell the house whether the commission has withdrawn its list of exemptions to the competition rules of the treaty <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister help further on that <e> <s> not knowing the date when the european parliament returns to its work does he anticipate as he still cannot give an answer that these matters will be discussed on th october at the meeting of the air transport ministers council <e>", "<cs> my lords if i can remember what the minister said and phrase my questions succinctly is he aware that i did not ask him for an opinion <e> <s> i asked him for a simple answer to two simple questions <e> <s> is he aware that he told the <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while it is not the fault of the minister is he aware that i shall believe that real action has taken place on the european front when i see it especially as some two years ago on st november the government informed this house that their patience on this matter would run out by the end of <e> <s> in view of <e>", "<cs> my lords might i reply to that and the matter of the short-term benefits which the minister raised <e> <s> is he aware that british airways by ending the commercial agreements that it has with other european airlines by the end of march will be able to do away with what i would call the iniquitous pooling arrangements which subsidise inefficient airlines and give customers no choice <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that i should be glad if we got somewhere on one matter never mind several <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords as the minister said last week that the most important thing to do was to get the aviation package on the council agenda as soon as possible does he agree that the cancellation of meetings is hardly the best way of bringing this about <e> <s> does he realise that the house will hear with astonishment that the council did not have enough matters to discuss to hold the meeting on the th <e> <s> may we expect as we are certainly entitled to do some definite action on th december <e>", "<cs> my lords as it is my amendment that is being discussed i wonder whether i might ask the minister a question <e> <s> the noble lord lord young was not the minister when this was done on th may <e> <s> i believe he has just said that he is aware of all the arguments <e> <s> but i wonder whether he would have a word with the leader of the house who is aware of the background to all this and who was good enough to discuss it with me at the time <e> <s> perhaps subsequently after speaking to the leader of the house the noble lord lord young might feel able to look at the matter again <e> <s> finally does he realise that this decision of your lordships house was set aside neither by argument nor by vote but by private arrangement which i thought was quite disgraceful <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether he is aware that i did not ask him about the opinions of his predecessors which we know and which do not impress us <e> <s> what i asked him was whether he would have a word with the leader of the house who had discussed all this with me about the background of this matter <e> <s> finally is he aware that i am not on a technical matter but on something which is much more difficult a simple answer to a simple question <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret the cancellation of the consumer affairs council and the failure of the commission to bring forward papers in good time for it <e> <s> am i correct in assuming that two items down for definite discussion on the agenda were toy safety and unit pricing <e> <s> i should like to ask the minister whether he has in his brief a notice to the effect that on th july the minister told the house that he would look into the ineffectiveness of consumer consultation in the community and whether he has been able to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the date of the next meeting i should like to ask the minister whether it is not now the custom to hold a consumer affairs council under each presidency <e> <s> if that is so and as the danish presidency ends on st december will the minister ask the secretary of state whether he can bring pressure on the commission to get on with its business and fix a date before the end of the year <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that on th may at col of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret that we had to have this information by means of a private notice question <e> <s> in my ignorance i thought that as the secretary of state for trade and industry was a member of your lordships house we would have benefited to the extent that he would have made a statement in that capacity to the house <e>", "<cs> i am on a question <e> <s> i am on my first point <e> <s> i think we should have preferred for the noble lord lord young as a minister to have had that right <e> <s> secondly i had hoped <e>", "<cs> i can make my four points each in the form of a question if that will satisfy the chief whip <e> <s> is the minister aware that i had hoped that the government would announce a fresh review of airline policy and the structure of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of that reply can the minister say whether market access and air capacity will be on the agenda for the next meeting of the transport ministers council <e> <s> if so will they be able to be decided by qualified majority voting <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister did not answer my question about majority voting <e> <s> does he realise that this is a very complicated subject for us laymen <e> <s> can he tell me whether it is correct that despite ratification of the act should the council of ministers wish a matter to be decided by qualified majority voting this can be done only if the commission agrees with what the ministers wish to put forward <e> <s> if that is true does it not mean that it is the commission which decides these matters and not the council of ministers whatever the ministers may wish to propose <e>", "<cs> my lords while i am sure that the minister is correct perhaps i may ask whether i correctly understood what he said <e> <s> if the council of ministers wishes a matter to be decided by qualified majority voting and if the commission does not approve of the proposal that the ministers are wishing to put forward can the council of ministers do that and not be overriden by the commission demanding a unanimous decision <e>", "<cs> my lords i am talking about matters proposed not by the commission but by the council <e> <s> i am sorry i was not clear <e> <s> if the council of ministers wishes to put up a matter to be decided by majority voting and if the commission does not approve of what the council of ministers is putting forward is it correct that the commission can overrule the council and decide that the matter must be decided by unanimity and not by qualified majority voting <e>", "<cs> my lords returning to the question on the order paper will the noble lord take every opportunity to try to get into the heads of british telecom that the ordinary public does not relish the thought of being telephoned by people who are a nuisance and who when they telephone have no intention of keeping within specified hours or a short period of time <e> <s> people can be rung up at any hour at all of the night <e> <s> will the noble lord guarantee to bring those facts to the attention of british telecom <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know who made the recommendation that if people did not wish to receive such telephone calls they could apply to go ex-directory but does the noble lord not agree that anybody who makes a suggestion like that has really no idea why we are protesting <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that that satisfactory answer will give much encouragement to consumers and consumer organisations and that we shall wait with some hope <e>", "<cs> my lords concerning the european child safety campaign in can the minister say what the planned contribution of the government will be <e> <s> am i not correct in assuming that this matter may arise at the forthcoming meeting of the council on th december <e>", "<cs> my lords i have become rather lost what with the brevity of the ministers statement for which i must thank him and the length of the supplementary questions asked by the noble lord lord underhill <e> <s> i do not know quite what to put a supplementary to <e> <s> did i understand the minister to say that the government were adhering to the policy that they had declared in <e>", "<cs> my lords i did understand that <e> <s> as i understand it government policy in was that we should establish a strong second-force airline in our aviation industry <e> <s> at least that was the caas intention which the government did not take up <e> <s> secondly quite apart from the merits of any bids is it not right that the shareholders of british caledonian should decide with whom they want to fly <e> <s> surely it is a matter for them to decide <e>", "<cs> my lords it is so difficult to conduct this matter by question and answer <e> <s> this is a matter of great importance <e>

laid before us to see which of the several bids the house is in favour of <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister must have known that i would come back on that reply <e> <s> is he aware that i am not suggesting the shareholders should not have the last word <e> <s> however i think the shareholders would be interested in what this house has to say as we represent all sides of the political spectrum

effort to bring about the signing of this agreement but is the minister aware that regretfully i have reservations <e> <s> i believe that the original proposals have been watered down significantly because of strong opposition from member states of the community <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that i hope my reservations will prove groundless but i doubt it <e> <s> if i put down a question for written answer will he have the details of this agreement printed in <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords if i am correct in saying that formal adoption of both these drafts depends upon approval by the european parliament can the minister tell us what is the earliest date on which this can be expected <e> <s> does his answer indicate that he anticipates no further problems concerning such approval <e>", "<cs> my lords reverting to the answer that the minister gave to my second supplementary question is he aware that on the th december the commission apologised for the short notice given about these submissions <e> <s> is he also aware that no discussion at all took place on them that the actual council meeting itself did not commence until after lunch on the friday before christmas and that i think that this is just not good enough <e> <s> in commenting on those proposals will the minister tell the house whether it is true that the next meeting of the council is to be on rd may <e> <s> if it is to be delayed until then believing that the government and the minister wish to help will the minister tell the house whether in the meantime the house will pursue consideration of the two submissions which were ignored on th december <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords why do we need a list of exemptions at all <e> <s> does the minister not agree that having a list of block exemptions attached to the competition rules of the treaty of rome means that the commission will be able to challenge only on a much narrower basis any allegedly anti-competitive packaging or fare-fixing deals <e>", "<cs> my lords that may well be the case but i am not much further on with that matter <e> <s> does the minister feel able to tell the house now or to publish an answer in the <e>", "<cs> my lords if i table a written question will the minister give the house the benefit of that information in <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister realise that this is a matter of considerable importance both to airlines and passengers alike <e> <s> does he additionally realise that it seems not only strange but regrettable that the government have not even discussed the problem with their european counterparts <e> <s> can the minister enlighten the house on the following point <e> <s> is it correct that the council of ministers cannot discuss suggestions or proposals on this whole matter until the european commission itself puts down an item on the agenda of the council of ministers <e>", "<cs> my lords that is not what i asked the minister <e> <s> i asked him a very simple straightforward question and it seems very difficult to get a simple straightforward answer <e> <s> does he recall that i asked him whether it was not possible for the council of ministers to discuss this whole affair until <e>", "<cs> my lords i think this is insufferable <e> <s> the minister will not answer the question i have put to him <e> <s> does he recall that on th december he gave me a long written answer of several paragraphs which i could paraphrase in one word yes <e> <s> it was this particular point that i raised <e> <s> may i ask him for the third time whether it is correct that the council of ministers cannot discuss the matter about which i have asked him today until the european commission itself puts down such an item on the agenda of the council of ministers <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to rise again but does the minister realise that constant evasion only means that my question is correct and that the <e> <s> minister does not wish to say yes <e> <s> whether the competition commissioner or the transport commissioner is responsible is it not <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while believing that had the minister been able to announce speedy and effective action he would have done so may i ask him whether it is correct that a number of small airlines have formally asked the community to look into the merger because they believe it to be anti-competitive and against provisions in the treaty of rome <e> <s> if that is the case can the minister tell the house whether such queries will be referred to the commission leaving the council of ministers with no say in the matter at all <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure it is me and not the minister but may i ask him whether in answer to what i just asked him it is the case that such queries concerning requests from smaller airlines that these matters be looked into would be referred to the commission and that the council of transport ministers would have no say in the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister in respect of his reply which i did not think took us any further whether he is aware that the chairman of the caa mr christopher tugendhat said last month that additional capacity was necessary in the s and beyond while the chairman of british airports authority plc sir norman payne said that it was not necessary to consider the matter now <e> <s> can he tell the house with whom ultimately the decision rests and if it is with the government when will they do something about it <e>", "<cs> my lords could i remind the minister of an unpleasant fact <e> <s> does he remember that the last time the caa put forward a proposition in connection with the development of civil aviation in this country the government totally ignored it <e> <s> does he expect us to believe that when the <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may congratulate the minister on his recent appointment as president of the permanent <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that amount of detail which will be appreciated as there are several issues at stake <e> <s> does the minister agree that the chief issue is that air europe is endeavouring to make its fares cost-related rather than cartel-related which can only benefit air travellers <e> <s> secondly can the minister tell the house the present position has air europe filed an application for the fare <e>", "<cs> my lords it is so nice to make some progress <e> <s> perhaps i may ask the minister this question <e> <s> if the british and french governments disagree on this matter will it be referred to arbitration <e> <s> if that is the case perhaps i may ask if the minister recalls that on th january in a written answer to me at col of the <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that it seems quite incredible that air matters were not discussed at this meeting <e> <s> is he further aware that it is difficult to comprehend that no time however inadequate it might be was found to discuss competition rules fares capacity or access <e> <s> can he tell the house whether these matters will be raised at the informal meeting of the council on th and th april or do we have to wait until th and st june <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that the minister mentioned the word package <e> <s> is he aware that the four items i mentioned that were not discussed are all included in and indeed are the main part of that package <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords i am on the continuation of my second point <e> <s> perhaps i may ask the minister this <e> <s> in connection with the last part of his remarks today which stated that two secondary items were not discussed why would it have been longer to say that two items x and y were not discussed <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that it will be within the recollection of the house that a great many ministerial answers i am sure for most excellent reasons are considerably longer than words <e> <s> is he further aware that although i ask a lot of questions they are concise and call for only a concise answer <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that we shoud congratulate both mr sutherland the commissioner for competition on the work that he has done and british airways on the good grace it displayed in accepting those recommendations <e> <s> will he tell the house whether the recommendations are for a period of four years which would give independent united kingdom airlines a chance to consolidate any new routes <e> <s> finally if i table a written question will the minister set down in the <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister forgot one small point <e> <s> if i table a written question will he set down the details in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i am in order in wishing to thank mr grey who is leaving us <e> <s> in my experience he has certainly been most helpful and kind to members who have <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a most disappointing answer and i hope the minister agrees <e> <s> am i correct in saying that in general the government have approved and supported this campaign but have always maintained that activities connected with it should be run by the member states themselves <e> <s> if that is true would it not be possible for the department for enterprise to use its initiative to get something going in this respect especially as the campaign itself should have been launched this month <e>", "<cs> my lords believing that the minister must be as weary of waiting for some progress as all of us perhaps i may ask whether it is possible to make some progress with setting up a committee as referred to in the question <e> <s> is he aware that the voluntary organisations do not believe that progress is being made and are looking to the department for enterprise which has a very good title to get on with the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that his reply is most surprising <e> <s> is he further aware that it in no way conforms with what <e>", "<cs> my lords in keeping exactly to the question on the order paper i can only assume that the minister did not hear my question <e> <s> i know what john hatch said but i asked the minister whether he could give the house the names of those organisations which had written to him either in favour of the proposition or against it <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want a letter <e> <s> is the minister aware that it is a long way round to have to wait for letters <e> <s> i have asked him a simple question <e> <s> the question on the order paper from the noble lord lord orr-ewing asks him about the response <e> <s> i am elaborating on that <e>", "<cs> my lords that is the disappointing answer we have had for two weeks running <e> <s> we never seem to make progress <e> <s> is the minister aware that his own department considers the report a disappointing document with no proposals at all for specific action <e> <s> does he realise that it was condemned by his department in another place on th february when the minister concerned by means of a written reply said <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister recall that last week his noble friend the secretary of state told me that his department stood for enterprise <e> <s> if that is the case does he feel that it would be possible for the noble lord lord young before the next meeting of the council to ask that a different report be produced for consideration <e> <s> it seems a complete waste of time to discuss something which consumer organisations both here and in europe consider to be worthless <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask a related question <e> <s> the illegal seizure of aircraft is facilitated greatly by inadequate security at airports <e> <s> would the government feel able to take the initiative in securing a worldwide survey of security at airports subsequently to be made public for the benefit of travellers and airlines throughout the world <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to be rude but that type of answer is the reason we never get anywhere <e> <s> someone has to take the initiative <e> <s> i repeat my question <e> <s> will the government take the initiative and ask icao or anyone else to undertake and publish a worldwide survey of security at airports <e> <s> will they please bring that to the notice of icao at its next meeting <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister is right about not having preconceptions and not taking them for granted <e> <s> is he aware that on th february the house was told that the initiative on capacity would now rest quite definitely with the caa and that government would not ignore it as they did in <e> <s> is he further aware that the committee recommended that this was a matter of extreme urgency <e>", "<cs> my lords even the government must be aware of the criticism emanating from all quarters from airlines and tour operators alike of the one runway policy at gatwick <e> <s> perhaps i may ask the minister a question that i consider is very serious <e> <s> are the government convinced that it is safe to rely on the emergency runway at gatwick as the only one in use every night while the main runway is being repaired <e> <s> am i right to wonder whether only a disaster will move the government and the baa to do something about the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that on several occasions in the house we have been told that the government do not hold themselves responsible for the agreement that was reached without their knowledge and without their consent <e> <s> will he please answer my question which was a most serious one <e> <s> do the government believe that it is safe at gatwick at an airport that size to rely on an emergency runway in use every night while the main runway is being repaired <e> <s> do they consider that that is safe for passengers <e>", "<cs> my lords arising from the ministers reply do the government feel able to push a little further with icao in suggesting that a report on security at all airports throughout the world could usefully be published for the benefit of travellers and airlines alike <e> <s> does he feel that the government could put this forward at the next meeting of icao <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the council resolution and the decision to improve consumer involvement in the standardisation process <e> <s> as the committees involved have many voluntary workers are the government willing to provide the extra resources necessary to make this a success <e> <s> in regard to the child safety campaign about which i have asked the minister before can he tell the house the steps the government intend to take to initiate this campaign and whether it will involve the voluntary workers and the media as well as the statutory services <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite clear what the minister said about the child safety campaign <e> <s> does he recall telling me not so long ago that the government could not take any steps in this respect and that it was a matter for the commission <e> <s> am i not correct in saying that the commission has now decided that each country should be responsible for initiating its own campaign <e> <s> if that is correct what do the government propose to do about it <e>", "<cs> my lords if the house will bear with me am i not correct in saying that the commission tabled a letter which said that the child safety campaign would definitely be introduced in september or october of this year <e> <s> if that is the case do the consultations about which the minister has just told us put that further off or will the matter be taken forward very soon <e>", "<cs> my lords believing that the most effective and radical solution to the problems of european aviation in the s must be an effective co-ordination between the european community and those european states not in the community will the minister tell the house whether that answer in general covers the possibility of such discussions <e> <s> does he agree with me that the present civil aviation package is only transitory and that we must expect further liberalisation <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell the house whether he knows the date of the next meeting of the transport ministers council <e> <s> while being gratified at the part affirmative if not wholly affirmative answer to the first question did i understand the minister to say that what i had asked about the co-operation between the two different groups of countries would be under discussion <e>", "<cs> my lords i congratulate the minister on being able to believe <e>", "<cs> my lords has the minister any idea at all and i imagine that as minister for civil aviation he must have of the damage which has been done to the civil aviation industry by the bigoted attitude of the british airports authority on this matter of the second runway and by the weakness of the government in refusing to do anything about it for purely political reasons <e>", "<cs> my lords some two and a half years ago i formed the impression that the government would have helped in this matter had they been able to do so <e> <s> does the minister recall that the decision of the monopolies and mergers commission was reached only on the casting vote of the chairman and that the general public including many members of this house believe that the practices of the bbc and itv in this matter were indeed anti-competitive <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcomed the ministers reply but do i take it from that that in the forthcoming white paper there is the possibility that the copyright of both the bbc and itv may be freed so that we might eventually have one publication which will include all programmes both radio and television <e> <s> i was not quite clear about what he said in answer to my question about the european commission <e> <s> did he say that he did not know or that he would find out and write to me <e> <s> lastly concerning the interruption of the noble lord lord williams of elvel and his correction may i ask the noble earl <e> <s> whether or not one uses the term casting if it is correct that the monopolies and mergers commission divided equally on this question and that the chairmans vote was either the casting or the deciding vote <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not agree that we need a whole new dimension of co-operation in europe on matters of civil aviation <e> <s> is it not true that when those unfortunate happenings occur airlines airports and governments in the different countries blame each other and put forward <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister feel that he could give the house any detail on progress made towards the revision of the interregional air services directive <e> <s> secondly as chairman of the permanent commission of eurocontrol does he believe that the commission is making a firm and definite contribution towards the co-ordination of air traffic in europe <e> <s> finally does he feel that some countries are not being as helpful as they might be in that respect seeming to believe that nationalism is more important than co-operation <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister inform the house as to whether the government have reached any decision about the desire of the british airports authority to take over air traffic control at many of our airports <e> <s> however if they have not yet reached such a decision can he say when they expect to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry but i am not in washington <e> <s> i have asked a question to which i should like an answer and i venture to think that the house would also <e> <s> does the minister feel that he can ask his noble friend lord brabazon to write to me on his return from washington and give me the answer <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that that is a most disappointing and unsatisfactory answer <e> <s> i hope that he thinks so too <e> <s> as the air traffic control system in europe and the united kingdom has come close to breaking point and as there is growing recognition of the inadequacy of capacity both in the air and on land does the minister not think that air transport should have been discussed on th october <e> <s> does he agree that this is a european problem and that a europe-wide air traffic control system is now a matter of the most urgent necessity <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the reply which the minister gave me on th october and in view of his disappointing reply today can he tell me whether the transport ministers are hoping that for their next meeting on th and th december the commission will have tabled as it indicated in advance that it would its proposals on air traffic control and its amendment to the directive on the inter-regional air services agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords surely the minister is not telling the house that it is a sideline to consider the matter of air traffic control in view of what happened this summer <e> <s> is he not aware that on the th he told me that this matter would be discussed on the th <e> <s> i realise that the minister is not responsible for the fact that the commission has not tabled that report but surely he is not now suggesting that their proposals for air traffic control should not be available by th december is he <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a most disappointing answer which i expected but for which the government are not to blame <e> <s> as the minister will be aware from his brief we have now been on this matter for some two and a half years <e> <s> as the commission has fallen down so badly on what it said it would do can the government do anything both to spur indignation and stir up initiative among the organisations concerned in this country <e> <s> would it be possible to get on with our plans <e> <s> will the government support such an endeavour <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that airlines are dismayed and angered by the constant reiteration by sir norman payne that no new runways are necessary in the south-east of england before the next century <e>", "<cs> my lords is it impossible to instill any sense of urgency into this government <e> <s> is the minister aware that i know that the caa has been asked to report next july <e> <s> i am long ahead of next july i am dealing with now <e> <s> i have asked the minister whether he will consult

country <e> <s> what noble lords on all sides are saying about the regional airports is correct <e> <s> will the minister take steps to have a look at the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords believing that the government themselves wish for renewal of the system referred to in the question perhaps i may ask whether the house can be told whether the deadlock is being caused by spain and if so whether other countries support spain in its objections <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that consumer organisations speak very highly of the work done by his department in this connection and that they feel it is much better than what is being done by the commission <e> <s> however after that compliment may i ask the minister whether if the deadlock being put up by spain at the moment is resolved in the near future it will be necessary to wait until april for the matter to be settled <e>", "<cs> my lords if the minister does not have the information on my question perhaps he will write to me <e> <s> is he aware that many of us who use the circle line and have used it for years consider that it is almost dropping to pieces <e> <s> is he further aware that in all that i have read about the alterations and reforms on the underground system i have not read one thing about the circle line <e> <s> perhaps the minister would be good enough to refer that to broadway where he will find that they know what i have been trying to do <e> <s> will he write to me about that matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the new trains would be compatible with the present rails on the circle line <e>", "<cs> my lords replies to questions dealing with the commission and air services appear to be getting worse and more disappointing <e> <s> even the minister had hoped that the inter-regional air services agreement would be discussed <e> <s> can he tell the house what has happened to the previous interest shown by the commission in air matters <e> <s> as regards the reply to todays question can we be informed about the discussion which took place in respect of the air traffic control <e> <s> does it mean that in the future this area will be controlled mainly by eurocontrol and the ecac with the commission in the background so that all european states can be included <e>", "<cs> my lords i declare an interest in that i am glad about the prominence being given to the report of the auc but i should like to ask the minister about an issue which concerns him <e> <s> has any date been fixed for a future meeting of the council of ministers in europe <e> <s> can he also help me about a matter which can never sort out <e> <s> at their meetings can the transport ministers raise matters concerning aviation in general <e> <s> or can they do so only if the commission is kind enough to place an item on the agenda <e>", "<cs> my lords can one then take it that the council of ministers asked the commission to discussion the inter-regional air services agreement at its last meeting or was the matter not raised beforehand <e>", "<cs> my lords i gather that the short answer is no <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a joy to follow the noble baroness lady elles and i shall be glad to return to some of the points she made later <e>", "<cs> my lords i too would like to support the bill and to thank the minister for introducing it to us in such a clear way <e> <s> i also wish to thank the noble lord lord brabazon as everyone else has done for the helpful remarks that he sent to most of us concerning the bill <e> <s> i was aware that the united kingdom was one of the european countries to have entrusted to eurocontrol as the minister told us the detailed task of calculating billing and collecting en route charges <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister spoke of exceptional measures <e> <s> is she aware that during the or so years in both houses that i have been fighting the consumers battle i have never heard of people who caused the trouble being <e>", "<cs> my lords while i am sure that the noble baroness had to say all that may i ask whether she is aware that it had nothing whatever to do with what i asked her <e> <s> i am sorry to put her on the spot but i asked her she did not hear the end of my question whether she could tell me of any other example where people who caused the trouble or the pain had been compensated while those who suffered from it had not <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a somewhat lukewarm response but i should like to thank the minister for having gone to the trouble to give us even that amount of information <e> <s> i hope he is aware that my being troublesome and persistent in this matter gives him the excuse for being the same <e>", "<cs> my lords in this happy atmosphere perhaps i may ask the minister whether he is aware that i think i am in complete agreement with him about whether or not the commission should have a hand in air traffic control <e> <s> however i am still somewhat puzzled by his answer because i think he told the house that it was anticipated that air traffic control would be discussed on th february <e> <s> what i am not clear about is whether that is likely to be discussed on the th without the commission having tabled its proposals <e> <s> if that is so it seems a very odd position <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minster aware that i am glad that no agreement has yet been reached on the transfer of these services to the british airports authority as that will give time for further consideration <e> <s> the minister indicated in his reply that there is local anxiety <e> <s> is he aware that i raised this matter because of fears expressed both by the caa and by the atc staff at glasgow airport <e> <s> does he realise that the main anxiety seems to be that the british airports authority has no trained air traffic control engineering staff while the caa wishes to retain its own skilled manpower <e> <s> if that is so where does the british airports authority propose to obtain its staff to run these services <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate what the minister said <e> <s> i realise that it is true that he himself has no responsibility and it is for the baa and the caa <e> <s> may the house take it in view of the comments that have been made this afternoon that the minister will see that he is kept informed of what happens and perhaps we may <e>", "<cs> my lords i noted in the press that this bill is fiercely opposed by the football authorities the clubs the fans the police the opposition and many conservative members of parliament <e> <s> however i am not convinced that the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that the commissions proposals on air traffic control have at least officially even if informally reached the transport ministers <e> <s> can the house be told whether the proposals indicated agreement that icao and eurocontrol should remain in the lead rather than the commission itself being involved <e> <s> as the march transport ministers council is not an informal meeting can we hope that some decisions will be reached <e>", "<cs> my lords am sure that the minister does his best but is he aware that there seems to be no sense of urgency either on the part of the commission or the community and that the replies which he has to give reflect that lack of urgency <e> <s> can the noble lord do anything to instil urgency into the commission or do ministers just sit still and wait for the next meeting <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister lobby extensively on the basis that air traffic control is one of the most serious matters affecting the entire community <e> <s> will he do his best to ensure that we receive an answer instead of the interminable meetings which go on and on <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i am seeking information <e> <s> i am prepared to admit that i am probably slow on the uptake <e> <s> if the noble lords amendment is carried can he tell me whether it will mean that no bill shall come into force unless it is first tried out in segments and that it will not apply to the country as a whole <e>", "<cs> pehaps i may just say a word or two at this point <e> <s> we have heard a great deal of discussion this afternoon and i do not think with respect that it has addressed the point which i thought the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls was making <e> <s> in my view we are not discussing whether this is a good bill or a bad bill in this regard we are discussing something which i think is a wrecking amendment and which if it were carried would wreck the bill <e> <s> it would do that simply because as i understand it the proposal is that whatever scheme is ultimately decided upon it should be carried out in sections <e>", "<cs> my lords that means an increase of some per cent <e> <s> in the number reported to government departments alone <e> <s> last year some million people went on package holidays <e> <s> as a recent abta survey revealed per cent <e> <s> of dissatisfied customers does the minister agree that if that figure were applied to the million who went on package holidays there would be approximately dissatisfied holidaymakers <e> <s> that is nothing to do with the abta report <e> <s> can the minister say whether the government are still against accepting article of the ec directive on package holidays <e> <s> if that is so are they prepared to accept the recommendation of our own select committee that liability for each element of the package should be separately examined <e> <s> if not what are the government doing about that <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister but he did not answer my question <e> <s> i asked whether the government are in favour of accepting the recommendation of our select committee <e> <s> it was that liability for each element of the package should be separately examined <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house does the minister recall that in a debate on th december he told the house that the commission had been told to go away and think of a better proposal after consultations with experts <e> <s> does he not believe that it would have been a useful idea to include consumers in those consultations <e> <s> is the minister aware that consumers believe that the acceptance of article is essential to the package <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to rise again but i have been trying to sort out the ministers reply <e> <s> did the minister tell the house that the government were not considering article at the moment <e> <s> did he include in that answer the fact that they were not considering the resolution from the select committee of your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the underground can the minister give the house any information about the circle line <e> <s> is he aware that each of us knows the line we use and that i have used that line for many years <e> <s> the circle line is a disgrace <e> <s> some time ago i asked i believe the present minister whether i could have more information <e> <s> if i did not do so i apologise <e> <s> may i have the information <e>", "<cs> my lords although the secretary of state was not the minister responsible at the time does he recall that we are discussing an amendment of mine which was passed by this house two years ago on th march <e> <s> it was subseqently removed by the government <e> <s> i protested strongly at the time along similar lines to those on which the ec commission is now protesting <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister tell the house whether any of these proposed charges have been implemented already and if not whether they are likely to be implemented before the office of fair trading makes its report <e> <s> if i were to give the minister details of the charges proposed to these captive customers i hope that he would be as horrified as i am <e> <s> does he know any of the figures involved <e>", "<cs> my lords with reference to the ministers answer do the government approve of the way in which the british airports authority exploits its monopoly position especially since privatisation <e> <s> arising from that does he know that the franchise charges at heathrow and gatwick are so high that duty free shopping there is among the most expensive in the world <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister guide me <e> <s> is there any way in which we can find out when the office of fair trading is likely to make this report to avoid our having continually to put down questions to the minister asking for the same information <e>", "<cs> my lords on th february we were told that the government would welcome a sense of urgency on the part of the commission particularly in the aviation field <e> <s> does the minister recall telling us that at the informal meeting of the transport ministers on th february no decisions were reached and today he has told us that at the full meeting on th march aviation matters were not even on the agenda <e> <s> does the minister realise that it seems to most of us that aviation matters are very low priority not only on the part of the commission but also on the part of the ministers <e> <s> does he propose to do anything about that <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister realise that while we accept what he said <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister realise how wonderful it would be if we could hear our ministers at the commission saying that we are not getting on fast enough <e> <s> can he give us the dates of the june meeting so that we can ask him for that good news <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel sure that the minister will agree that the answer supplied to him today hardly provides the amplification asked for in the question <e> <s> can he tell the house whether i am correct in believing that a decision is imminent <e> <s> if so can he say whether it will include not only the bus charges matter but also whether a reference should be made to the monopolies and mergers commission as mentioned by the noble lord lord brabazon on th march at col of the <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister and the house are very kind but not half as pleased as i shall be when i receive a good answer <e> <s> can the minister ensure that the british airports authority looks at what has been said today <e> <s> perhaps i may repeat a question which i asked on th <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted that at last the minister has some good news to report <e> <s> however perhaps i may refer to one of the measures mentioned in his reply and one which i suggest is the most important <e> <s> it concerns the resolution dealing with air traffic capacity and congestion <e> <s> can the minister say whether the resolution is not as strongly worded as some ministers had hoped <e> <s> further can he say whether the government agree that a unified air traffic control system in europe is now of the utmost urgency <e> <s> can he also say what is being done to persuade other european governments to give their support to this measure <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may refer to the answer which the minister gave to my supplementary question <e> <s> first do i understand that the resolution dealing with air traffic capacity and so on was worded strongly enough for the british government <e> <s> secondly i do not know whether it is a matter of semantics but am i correct in thinking that the minister said that co-operation in air traffic control was the next best thing to a unified air traffic control system <e> <s> thirdly as i understand that all the airlines are asking for a unified air traffic control system in europe can he enlarge upon the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not correct that the airlines have asked for a unified air traffic control system in europe <e> <s> further can the minister clarify the matter with the airlines or perhaps by means of a written answer to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords as i listened to the noble lord lord graham i realised more than ever the unbridgeable gulf between those who think that action should be taken today in this house and those who believe that it should be further <e>", "<cs> my lords i am pleased to note that progress is being made <e> <s> may i return to the last part of my question which deals with future priorities for relaunching consumer protection policy <e> <s> we have had many exchanges in the house on this going back some three years <e> <s> does the minister recall that on th june last year at col the government expressed disappointment at the inconclusive proposals put forward by the commission and hoped that it would lead to a more constructive way forward ready for june <e> <s> it is now june and we are almost into july <e> <s> can the minister tell the house whether we have succeeded in getting consumer affairs more closely involved with other policies in the ec and whether the commission has brought forward its report due in june <e> <s> finally believing that the government wish to help on this matter could they tell the house what they have been able to do about that <e>", "<cs> my lords repeating the compliment that i believe that the government wish to help is there anything they can do to hasten some action by the commission in publishing this report have they any idea when that might be done and could they tell us when the next meeting of consumer ministers may be held <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not hear the minister say whether he has the slightest idea when the commission will make its report and can he do anything to hasten that if it is in the far distance <e>", "<cs> my lords am i correct in saying that details of these costs and various charges have been made public from time to time <e> <s> is it the case that the minister is unable to repeat them or that he does not wish to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that the answer to the first part of the question is yes even though it happened only yesterday <e> <s> i am sure that the whole house will have noted with pleasure what the minister said <e> <s> however may i ask him about two matters concerned with the second part of the question which were not dealt with in the statement that he gave <e> <s> do the government accept that the problem of air traffic congestion must be dealt with urgently and enthusiastically if airlines and passengers alike are to have a better deal <e> <s> after last weekend i should think that the answer is yes <e> <s> secondly does he agree that along with the problem of congestion must go that of providing adequate runway and terminal capacity <e> <s> if so what can the government do to hasten along the solution to those two matters <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the kindness and generosity of the remarks made <e> <s> however does the minister realise that we shall have many opportunities of returning <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say when the ministers hope to discuss these matters <e> <s> am i right in assuming that it will be in october and can he give definite dates <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister assist us further <e> <s> it was my understanding that last july the secretary of state wrote to the civil aviation authority asking for this information <e> <s> am i not correct in saying that the secretary of state asked for the advice by july <e> <s> can the minister now say why we are faced with another -month delay before this advice is tendered <e> <s> does he not feel that a period of two years in preparing advice is disgraceful <e> <s> the minister should not have accepted such a delay <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister does not need to tell me that <e> <s> i am well aware of it <e> <s> i am sorry that the minister looks harassed but does he not realise that there is no feeling of urgency about this matter <e> <s> until the ministry of transport if it is the responsible department realises that the need is urgent we shall just go on and on waiting <e> <s> why did the minister accept a further delay of months from what was originally stated <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that i am asking about the question of delay <e> <s> someone has to keep on about the matter <e> <s> i ask the minister whether he has on file in his office a copy of the letter which the chairman of the caa wrote to <e>", "<cs> my lords i realise that the minister has just been handed that answer and it is not his fault that it is entirely unsatisfactory <e> <s> if i might come to the last part of my question to which the minister did not even attempt to reply may i ask him if he knows that mr christopher tugendhat when presenting his report said that additional terminal facilities must be provided at heathrow and stansted immediately and a new runway before the year <e> <s> is he further aware that mr tugendhat said that if those new terminals were not provided quickly the new runway would be necessary before the year <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that he was incorrect in his reply <e> <s> if he looks at the reply given to me on monday i think he will find that i did not mention what mr tugendhat said <e> <s> may i ask him whether he is aware that mr tugendhat has said that a new runway must be in use by the year and that if the additional terminal facilities are not provided quickly at heathrow and stansted the new runway will be needed before then <e> <s> will the minister take that on board and consider the last part of my question <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that i too have read the press release from the caa <e> <s> i wonder whether he can help us a little further in the matter <e> <s> does he recall that a year ago the chairman of the caa wrote to <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has not gone anywhere at all never mind making any progress in the matter <e> <s> is he aware that i am asking him for specific information <e> <s> is it not possible for the government who asked for the report to be produced in the first place to request that it be made available early in july so that the house may have an opportunity to look at it before the long summer recess and before a delay of some four months takes place <e>", "<cs> my lords i should tell the minister that i have read a summary of the report <e> <s> is he able to tell the noble lord lord underhill that it is not the slightest use always recommending a delay until something else is done <e> <s> is he aware that the last time i asked this question the noble lord again recommended a delay until some other action was taken <e> <s> finally do the government not understand that most people believe that there is no real desire in the governments mind to make progress on these matters and that nothing he says will change that opinion <e>", "<cs> my lords i have much respect for the director general of fair trading and understand the reason why he decided not to recommend referral to the monopolies and mergers commission <e> <s> however many well-informed people regret that decision <e> <s> is the minister aware that sir gordon borrie spoke of the wide-ranging complaints that he had received and said that a monopoly investigation would have been timely <e> <s> do the government realise that the central complaint is that the british airports authority is pursuing monopoly profits at the expense of its customer airlines and their passengers <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble viscount for the information that he has given us already <e> <s> can he go a little further <e> <s> can he tell the house whether any statement will be made publicly during the progress of that inquiry <e> <s> if it is to start at the end of this year am i correct in thinking that it may take two or three years to complete <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish i could he more enthusiastic with regard to the uk initiative <e> <s> will the minister say why the government have set their face so resolutely against a unified air traffic control system in europe which is what the airlines want and instead agreed to the staggered system of reforms <e> <s> is the minister aware that if we wait until for harmonisation which the government and the noble viscount described as the next best thing to a unified system it will be a triumph for bureaucratic advisers and the loss of a great opportunity <e>", "<cs> my lords among all the information that the noble viscount has within his files can he tell the house whether it is true that air traffic control in europe will still be handled by different centres in instead of the six or eight which will be needed <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a lot of information but will the noble viscount answer the question that i put to him <e> <s> can he tell the house whether it is correct that by air traffic control in europe will still be handled by different centres instead of by the six or eight that will be needed <e> <s> if the noble viscount does not have that information in his papers will he write to me and put a copy in the library <e>", "<cs> my lords i realise that the minister will not agree that unified air traffic control is the best way of dealing with this matter <e> <s> however does he accept that the reason it has not been dealt with in the past is the inefficiency of a system which deals with and relies on far too many centres <e> <s> does he recall that i asked him last week <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not hear the minister say anything on the matter of the centres <e> <s> is it not correct that he and i were both hopeful that i might receive a reply today to a question i asked a week ago <e> <s> is that reply still delayed <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government be more specific <e> <s> i believe the minister mentioned greater scope and effective safeguards in the reply he has just given to the house <e> <s> is it correct that the european commission has stated that it is seeking powers for prompt action against big airlines which use predatory practices to exclude or squeeze out smaller airlines from the european market <e> <s> if that is the case do the government support the commission in its aims and will they endorse the action the commission seeks when the matter arises at the council of ministers <e> <s> further is it the hope of the government that the effective safeguards will prevent the dominance of the major airlines in the landing slots as has happened in the united states <e> <s> that process has blighted the deregulation there <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister hope to come back to the house one day to say not only that the government will look at what has been put forward but also that they have taken action and supported it <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the minister feels some regret at having to read that answer today which reflects credit on neither the caa nor the government <e> <s> does he understand in view of the complacency of the answer that he has given today that i find it difficult to accept the government statement that they fully recognise the importance of the subject <e> <s> yet he made that statement in the house on th april <e> <s> what redress has a member when an organisation takes that attitude which i regard as being one either of contempt or of arrogance <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the matter of urgency does the ministers brief contain the information that on th july last year i asked his noble friend lord brabazon of tara who was then the minister concerned whether he realised that there appeared to be no feeling of urgency about the matter and that until there was such a feeling we should simply go on waiting <e> <s> can the minister do anything to impress that upon the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that we can agree on the matter or urgency <e> <s> however do i understand that in a reply given today the minister said that if we receive the report before the end of july such and such an action might be taken <e> <s> does one assume that it is possible that we may not receive the report before the end of july <e>", "<cs> my lords having listened carefully to that reply i still believe that the answer to the first part of my question is yes <e> <s> the minister has not even attempted to answer the second part <e> <s> concerning the second part do the government support the attitude of sir leon brittan our senior commissioner in brussels and the commissioner responsible for competition affairs when he said on th may that one of the changes that he is particularly keen to introduce involves making it easier for new entrants to obtain slots at congested airports <e> <s> if the government support that attitude will they now make it clear publicly <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount has still not answered the second part of my question <e> <s> i have now asked him both on the order paper and orally in the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that there is much for us to study in that most helpful reply which indicates action rather than procrastination <e> <s> i believe that the government have worked hard to bring about this change <e> <s> can the house be sure that they will continue to keep up the pressure in europe so that the interim measures in the autumn and the more radical general measures post- will bring wider competition and cheaper air fares <e> <s> that is what people expect <e>", "<cs> my lords i forgot to ask the minister this question <e> <s> can she give us the date of the next council meeting <e> <s> i believe that she said a statement will be made by the commission in september <e> <s> will that be before at or after the council meeting <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards product safety does the minister recall that a year ago at the council meeting held on st june the commissions proposal on product safety was discussed and referred back <e> <s> am i not correct in thinking that at the meeting on th june the same procedure was adopted namely that the directive was again discussed and again referred back to the same committee <e> <s> has the minister read the excellent report of our own select committee on product safety which states <e>", "<cs> my lords that does not get us very far <e> <s> does the minister not agree that months has been enough time to look at the report <e> <s> can he give us any hope that when it is considered again it will not be referred back again <e> <s> can he also say when the next meeting of the council will be <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister give me the date of the next council meeting <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to raise another matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to ask the minister about consumer integration <e> <s> on th june the government told the house that they fully approved and supported consumer interests being taken fully into account in other community policies <e> <s> can the minister tell me what specific proposals were put forward on th june <e>", "<cs> my lords if the house will allow me <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that i agree with his description of the three-year plan <e> <s> i was not muddling the two <e> <s> consumer integration was discussed on th june <e> <s> can the minister say whether any specific proposals were put forward <e>", "<cs> my lords as the minister will be aware in the report of the post office users national council published this month mention is made of agreed service improvements <e> <s> is the minister also aware that on the same page of the report the council says that those agreed service improvements are not now to be put into effect although the money was found for them in the tariff increase <e>", "<cs> my lords if money was given to the post office to carry out improvements which have not been carried out and the government have agreed to further increases why should the money not be spent on the improvements which have already been agreed <e>", "<cs> my lords may i take the term shortly to mean any day now even tomorrow <e> <s> as the house will shortly be going into the long recess may i have an assurance that the government not take any decision on the report before parliament has had an opportunity of debating it <e>", "<cs> my lords that repeats the answer i received some time ago <e> <s> as the government share in the disappointment of the consumer organisations that this threeyear plan lacks specific proposals will the government press for action to promote consumer integration in community policies <e> <s> as regards the package travel directive can the minister say how swiftly the government hope to be able to implement that so that holidaymakers may benefit at the earliest opportunity <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that it is very pleasant to see him back at the dispatch box answering questions on this particular matter <e> <s> will he let me have any dates for future meetings of the council of ministers <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister realise that a widespread belief exists that this group was announced so that the government would not have to take any decision on the matter before a general election <e> <s> therefore the delay of about weeks in naming the personnel does not greatly matter <e> <s> can the minister inform the house whether i am correct in thinking that when the original announcement was made of the groups to be consulted no mention of the consumer was made <e> <s> i shall be grateful if the minister can answer my question today but if not perhaps he will write to me <e> <s> can the minister tell the house the names of the groups which are being consulted <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not a candidate but i am interested in the consumer aspect of this matter <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that i believe the original statement contained no reference to consumer groups <e> <s> will he let me know which groups are to be consulted <e> <s> will he write to me with the answer or alternatively publish it in the <e>", "<cs> my lords surely air travellers are consumers <e> <s> does the minister not agree that they should have been mentioned with reference to the group <e> <s> that is the point i am making <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad about the decision that was taken on the european home and leisure accident surveillance system <e> <s> i congratulate the government on the support they have consistently given to this project right from the beginning <e> <s> however i hope the minister can help the house on the matter of the draft product safety directive <e> <s> as he is aware the council of ministers has discussed this directive four times <e> <s> what are the main areas of disagreement <e> <s> do we ourselves have any disagreement on the matter <e> <s> what can the government do to hasten matters <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope i may ask the minister again i am sure he forgot these points what steps the government propose to take to get some movement on this whole affair <e> <s> when is the date of the next council meeting <e> <s> which countries support particular disagreements or must it remain a collective disagreement <e>"]
