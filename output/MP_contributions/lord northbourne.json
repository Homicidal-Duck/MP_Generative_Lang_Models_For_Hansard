["<cs> my lords i must ask your lordships indulgence for my maiden speech <e> <s> i should like to thank you for the kind welcome which you have already given me and i should particularly like to thank the noble lord lord john-mackie for the very kind remarks that he made about my father <e> <s> as the son of a distinguished farming father i am rather proud to be able to make my first speech in your lordships house on an agricultural subject <e> <s> i have to declare an interest in that i am the managing director of a substantial farming business and our most important activity is growing packing and marketing vegetables <e>", "<cs> my lords it is sometimes said that your lordships house is out of touch with the modern world and it is therefore with some trepidation that i take as my theme for this evening an extract from a letter written by a provincial governor to the emperor of china in the year <e> <s> he said <e>", "<cs> my lords we have a long list of speakers and i shall be brief <e> <s> like the noble earl lord caithness i am a chartered surveyor <e> <s> i have grown up with the landlord and tenant system <e> <s> i agree that it has served agriculture well <e> <s> i am afraid that if clauses and are allowed to go through in their present form not only will they do nothing to stimulate lettings but they will do precisely the opposite <e> <s> i should like to examine these two clauses <e>", "<cs> yes my lords it instructs the arbitrator to consider a market without scarcity <e> <s> what is a market without scarcity <e> <s> it is an impossible concept <e> <s> what i hope that clause may mean is that the arbitrator should ignore the very high key money bids which are made for certain new tenancies <e> <s> but if that is what the clause means surely we should make it say so <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord stanley of alderley declared his interest as a tenant <e> <s> if i were to declare my interests they would be rather better balanced <e> <s> i am a landlord a tenant a farmer a chartered surveyor a member of the cla and a member of the nfu <e> <s> i hope that i can speak impartially <e>", "<cs> i intend to withdraw the amendment but i would like first to say that i still contend that the word suitable is very unsure in this context and i do not think that the noble earl lord swinton has done anything to allay my fears in this context <e> <s> there are often several suitable systems of farming for a holding and some are more profitable than others <e> <s> i very much hope that the government will take this fact into account when they are redrafting the legislation <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord walston has just succeeded in saying everything that i intended to say and therefore i shall not weary you for more than a moment <e> <s> i rise only to say how much i endorse what has been said by all those who have congratulated the noble lord lord belstead <e> <s> i would add our thanks not only for his industry and the care that has been taken in the preparation of this bill but also his success in re-wording it <e> <s> i shall support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it the object of this bill is to make more tenancies available <e> <s> if we are to achieve this objective we have to be absolutely satisfied that the legislation to which we contribute and which eventually goes on the statute book is fair to both parties and is clear and unambiguous <e> <s> the noble lord lord belstead has done an enormous amount to clarify the intention of clause by the introduction of amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> however there is still one major area which lacks clarity and i refer to the words appreciable scarcity <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may just explain to the noble lord lord john-mackie the reason for many landowners fears of the hereditary provisions of the act by telling a little story <e> <s> let us suppose that i let a farm which has fallen vacant <e> <s> i go home to lunch with my son who happens to be sitting on the steps to the throne listening to me and i say charles i have just given away half your birthright <e> <s> he asks what do you mean <e> <s> and i reply well ive just signed a tenancy which reduces by half the value of the land that you are going to inherit <e> <s> he then says i suppose youve let it to some worthy charitable cause and i have so say no i have let it to that nice guy down the road with a range rover and two daughters at benenden <e> <s> so he replies but i wanted to farm and i have to say the only answer is that you will have to marry the eldest daughter <e> <s> she will inherit the farm <e> <s> it is the value of a farm that you give away when you sign a tenancy agreement today <e>", "<cs> my lords i may be able to be helpful with a few figures which i found on this subject <e> <s> i am pleased to be able to agree with the noble lord lord john-mackie <e> <s> my figures are based on a tenant aged going into a new tenancy and planning to retire at <e> <s> i took a slightly larger farm of acres with a net rent of after repairs and insurance <e> <s> i considered reviews every three years a per cent <e> <s> increase in rent <e> <s> if the landlord and the tenant each contributed per cent <e> <s> of the rent during the period of the tenancy years at age the tenant would have a cash sum of equivalent to at todays value <e> <s> in addition he would have a life pension of per annum equivalent at todays values to <e>", "<cs> unlike the noble earl lord caithness i am a farmer and not ashamed of being one <e> <s> i think that it is absolute arrant nonsense to say that there is not a difference between the burning of unbaled straw and the burning of stubble <e> <s> undoubtedly there is <e> <s> whereas the burning of unbaled straw is a hazard and has caused pollution to which people can reasonably object and all of us would like to see straw put to a better use although there are considerable difficulties in doing so in the case of stubble it is an important agricultural operation <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to apologise for the fact that when i put my name down for this debate it was the first item on the agenda if i may put it that way and i undertook commitments which will not permit me to stay until the end of this debate <e> <s> i apologise for that and i will be brief <e>", "<cs> from a perusal of the bill it is quite evident that it does not give the government power to forbid exports in the circumstances <e> <s> i should like to agree with the noble lord lord melchett because i think an answer is required to that question either now or later <e>", "<cs> that involves the electrodyne distributor i am delighted to hear it <e>", "<cs> we have had a most useful discussion <e> <s> i personally am happy with the assurances that the noble lord lord belstead has given <e> <s> i think that i marginally disagree with the noble lord lord melchett <e> <s> i think that a great deal of responsibility will <e>", "<cs> the present network of rights of way across farmland in this country was designed for a system of farming which is very different from the system we follow today <e> <s> if the ramblers association were prepared to be more flexible than they have been historically in agreeing to divert footpaths onto equally good and equally long routes more suited to public rambling and more suited also to the use of the land for modern farming then i am sure that it would be easier for the farming community to avoid any contact by the rambling public with spray <e>", "<cs> i am delighted to hear the assurances that have been given <e> <s> i would only say that i do not feel that the controls that have been applied and the systems of screening applied heretofore have been sufficiently stringent <e> <s> the evidence exists i think to show that this is the case <e> <s> with that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble lord lord stanley has amply covered the subject <e> <s> i added my name to the amendment because i believed that he ought to nudge the minister towards committing himself to a time limit <e> <s> whether the one that we have put down is the right one i do not know but i should be glad of an assurance that a time limit will be set for the clearance of chemicals under these circumstances <e>", "<cs> it seems that we are also dealing with amendment no <e> <s> and it may perhaps be convenient to take that amendment now <e>", "<cs> i support the suggestion that there should be training and some form of licensing but i should like to draw attention to the fact that on the smaller farming unit this might produce almost intractable practical problems <e> <s> if you have two or perhaps three tractor drivers on the farm and one of them is licensed but happens to fall ill does this mean that you cannot spray anything on your farm until he gets better again <e> <s> it may be that the solution is somewhere on the lines of a licensed manager rather in the way that you have to have a manager for heavy transport of goods rather than simply a licensed operator <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord lord belstead for his assurances and subject to the point which the noble lord lord stanley has just made i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> on the basis of the assurance that the minister has given i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to welcome the amendment which the minister has set down <e> <s> some of your lordships will remember that in committee i spoke at some length on the subject of soil and the importance of the soil in the context of the environment and the control of pesticides and residues <e> <s> i want once more to urge the minister to consider the possibility of specifically including the soil in the designation of the areas which he and his successors should protect under the auspices of this act <e> <s> i suggest that if the words <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am particularly glad to see this amendment being brought forward <e> <s> i think that it is reasonable to take the view that most farmers are not bad guys <e> <s> how can they be expected to respect the interests of the environment and indeed of their neighbours if they do not know as fully as possible the facts about the products which they are using <e> <s> therefore i believe that adequate information will probably be even more important than the more restrictive aspects of this act <e> <s> i was for that reason particularly pleased to see this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i was delighted when i found on the marshalled list the government amendment proposing a committee <e> <s> i had not realised that it would be the advisory committee on pesticides <e> <s> it is none the worse for that <e> <s> i was disappointed that the terms of reference of the committee related only to regulations and approvals of conditions <e> <s> i feel that an opportunity would be missed if the minister were not to consider the possibility of extending the remit of the committee to looking at some of the more creative things that need to be done in the control of pests and diseases if we are effectively to take care of both the farming community and the environmental interest <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is necessary to say that most of your lordships who have spoken this evening on the subject of this amendment are at the receiving end of the advice of adas on these subjects <e> <s> it is possibly reasonable to assume that if we were all entirely satisfied with the advice that we received and the extent of the research which is being carried out we would not have spoken as we have <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to my noble friend lord stanley i thought that we had dealt with amendment no <e> <s> when we discussed amendment no <e> <s> and that is why i did not move it <e> <s> i think that my noble friend has moved this amendment in the most eloquent terms <e> <s> it seemed to me that the minister gave us extremely satisfactory assurances at the committee stage and i too was intending to ask whether any progress had been made in determining the kind of methodology by which clearance could be given for minor crops <e> <s> i appreciate that there is a very grave problem because of the cost of clearance and the question is who will pay <e> <s> if any further guidance can be given to us it would indeed be words of comfort <e> <s> if not we must rely on the ministers assurances given during the committee stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i speak in support of these amendments <e> <s> during the report stage the noble lord the minister referred to the work being carried out by adas to develop and encourage methods of pesticide and fungicide application which are less damaging to the environment <e> <s> i am sorry to say that since the report stage i have received some evidence that that programme is not being wholly effectively implemented <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord lord renton for bringing forward this important subject <e> <s> i should like to say a few words on the subject of food and agriculture in relation to civil defence <e> <s> although my waistcoat is not of such a gallant hue as that of the noble lord lord jenkins of putney i incline to agree with him that probably one of these days the human race will blow itself to bits <e> <s> all traditional cosmology tends to this view <e> <s> indeed it may be a fitting end to the selfish and greedy society we live in <e> <s> if in the immortal words of that poet and philosopher tom lehrer we all go together when we go there is no problem <e> <s> but civil defence is i think concerned with a different scenario <e> <s> the object of civil defence is to minimise human suffering and to save lives in a lesser disaster <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should very much like to thank and congratulate the noble lord lord plowden on his sensitive and charming chairing of the committee <e> <s> i should like to touch on one or two aspects of the report <e> <s> the first is debt <e> <s> i am very worried about the question of debt which the noble earl lord ferrers touched on a little <e> <s> if the price restraint policy which we are advocating is indeed applied there will be a very serious problem of debt for <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join in thanking the noble lord lord gallacher for the way in which he has chaired our committee and for the skill with which he has presented our report this evening <e> <s> unlike the noble earl lord ferrers and the noble lord <e> <s> lord walston i am in broad agreement with the conclusions of the report <e> <s> if i may say so the noble lord lord walston was a little unkind to us in saying that we suggested only price cuts or price restraint <e> <s> perhaps the most important point which the report of the committee stresses is the need for consistency in the policy with which the commission applies whatever sanctions or rules it decides <e>", "<cs> i should like briefly but strongly to support the noble lord lord middleton in his amendment <e> <s> i think that everybody in the committee is agreed that the bill as proposed is thoroughly unsatisfactory <e> <s> there is an old adage that hard cases make bad law <e> <s> i suspect that the converse also is true and that bad law makes hard cases <e> <s> i listened with fascination to the noble lord lord <e>", "<cs> i would question that the cases that the noble lord brought forward represent the majority but that is perhaps another question <e> <s> i should like to think that any profession that has been able over the years to cope with the agricultural holdings act without civil disobedience has the confidence of both sides of the agricultural industry and could also with an amendment roughly in the form of the amendment proposed by the noble lord lord middleton and some interesting and valid points have been made by the noble lord lord mackie of benshie and others provide a much more satisfactory solution than the solution proposed at the moment by the government <e> <s> i shall certainly march behind the noble lord lord middleton into the lobby if it comes to that <e>", "<cs> i would make the same point <e> <s> i support the insertion of the words and maintenance but i am not happy about the proposal in amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it selects a partisan interest considerably to the detriment of others <e> <s> many groups want access to the countryside for various purposes quite apart from the farming and forestry communities <e> <s> the constant emphasis of one interest tends to antagonise the farming community <e> <s> i hope that the objectives to which the noble lord so keenly adheres and to which i would claim even as a farmer to be an equally ardent adherent can best be achieved by co-operation and co-operation is not helped by one interest constantly being pressed particularly that of a group which has shown itself consistently to be against an inherent revision of the provisions for access to the countryside by the public <e>", "<cs> perhaps i did not explain sufficiently clearly that the problem to which i allude is the resistance by the ramblers association to any variation of rights of way <e> <s> there is room for variation in the interests of all parties including the walkers <e>", "<cs> while i am delighted to hear that the situation in norfolk is as described by the noble lord lord melchettt it is not so alas in kent <e> <s> a scheme promulgated by the local authority with the approval of all the local councils and amenity societies is at the moment being blocked by the ramblers association <e>", "<cs> and the scheme provides a greater length of public footpaths <e>", "<cs> the points made by the noble lord lord melchett emphasise a point i was making earlier this evening that there is a real need for an overall consideration of the problems of access to the countryside and in particular for the re-routing of rights of way to give the same or greater lengths of walk walks more attractive to all the people who want to have access to the countryside and at the same time be more convenient to farmers <e> <s> the reason walks currently go across fields is that they were designed for specific purposes associated with the life of the countryside many of which no longer exist <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl lord kinnoull is unable to be in his place because he is in some remote outpost of the world i am not sure where <e> <s> he has therefore asked me to do my best to speak to this amendment <e> <s> having looked at the amendment tabled by the government i feel that it very amply covers the point that we were trying to make and i should therefore be very happy to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble earl lord de la warr has raised an important point in relation to the nature of the value of quotas <e> <s> to speak briefly on this subject it seems to me that the nature of the value of quotas is associated with the value of land <e> <s> the creation of quotas has in fact creamed off some of the value of the land and made it transferable <e> <s> quotas have made land a negotiable asset <e> <s> land which has less quota will be less valuable and land which acquires more quota will become more valuable <e> <s> the nature of quota is intimately associated with the value of land <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord the minister for those assurances and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i find it hard to accept the objection raised by the minister that it would be difficult to value the rent retrospectively <e> <s> this kind of thing is being done quite frequently by valuers <e> <s> this proposal has been put forward by the very organisation that would have to do the valuation <e> <s> it is therefore reasonable to suppose that it conceived of it as being reasonable and not too difficult <e> <s> in the circumstances and having heard the ministers assurance it would be wrong at this time of the night to press the matter further <e> <s> i would ask him however to consider seriously the points that have been made <e> <s> on that note i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to reiterate what i said at committee stage <e> <s> there is a solution to the problem <e> <s> it is progressively to divert footpaths on a permanent basis so that that they run along headlands and along routes that are more attractive to walkers and more practical for farmers <e>", "<cs> my lords like many of your lordships i am in favour of the proposed tunnel <e> <s> it could be a great and exciting project <e> <s> i cannot however agree with the noble lord lord orr-ewing who said that it would be good for every part of britain <e> <s> there is a small corner of kent where i live which will be severely disadvantaged <e> <s> if i may i should like to take a few moments of your lordships time to outline one or two of the problems and issues which concern us in north-east kent <e> <s> i refer to the districts of dover and thanet <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the noble lord lord mackie of benshie in the view that the committee has produced a very good report <e> <s> i am not going to rehearse the problems of the cap as they are all well known to your lordships vast stocks overhanging the market and the prospect of continued overproduction due partly to technological advance and partly to farmers desperate attempts to maintain their income <e>", "<cs> with great respect to the minister i do not feel that he has addressed himself to the problem of timing about which the harbour board and the ferries have been extremely anxious <e> <s> it is a fact that a matter of months if not a year or so could be quite long enough to cause great financial distress and possible bankruptcy <e> <s> i cannot see why it is not possible to accept the principle of subsection which suggests that any pricing policy could obtain the whitewashing the approval of the director general of fair trading before it was put into action so as to avoid the necessity of legal action at a later date <e>", "<cs> i am not entirely convinced by this assurance <e> <s> i shall make further inquiries and i reserve the right to bring this back at report stage <e> <s> with that in mind i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise for the fact that i was not in my place at the appropriate time <e> <s> my train was held up by a serious fire <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be brief <e> <s> this is an important bill and in general i welcome its proposals <e> <s> there are many points on which i should perhaps have liked to comment <e> <s> at this late hour i shall only touch briefly on three <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may ask the noble baroness to explain how the rigidities which will be imposed by the national curriculum can be reconciled with the present immobility of teaching staff <e> <s> i know that in kent at least we have a policy of no redundancy other than voluntary redundancy <e> <s> in the secondary school with which i am personally connected due to reducing rolls we have a situation in which we have two and a half teachers over establishment yet we are short of a maths teacher <e> <s> what are the government going to do to increase the mobility of teachers to meet the requirements of the new curriculum <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very conscious of the fact that at committee stage there was a colourful list of subjects to be added to the core curriculum and foundation curriculum but they got very short shrift from the noble baroness <e> <s> i put my name to this amendment because i feel the subject is of such importance that if we can get any further assurances we should try to do so <e> <s> my particular concern is that which has been expressed so well by noble lords who spoke earlier namely the problem of home and family building personal relations home care and the care of children among them <e> <s> these are the kinds of skills that used to be passed on from parents to their children <e> <s> but with broken homes in the inner cities constituting perhaps between per cent <e> <s> and per cent <e> <s> of the family units these skills have to be taught at school <e>", "<cs> my lords if in the main the interpretation placed on the words by the noble lord lord elton is indeed the correct interpretation would it be possible to ask the right reverend prelate to consider introducing an amendment which would express this intention on the face of the bill rather than in these words which are not entirely clear <e>", "<cs> my lords most of the points that i had intended to make have already been made <e> <s> i too give a qualified welcome to these proposals <e> <s> i must agree with earlier speakers that the amount of compensation that is being offered is probably totally inadequate <e> <s> i should like in particular to support those noble lords who have advocated the grazed fallow option or deplored the fact that grazed fallow is not included in the provisions <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to congratulate the noble lord lord gallacher on his firm but tender chairmanship of our committee and on the excellent distillation of our discussions which constitute the report under discussion <e> <s> i shall restrict my comments to one issue fairness to the british producer and british consumer <e> <s> in his evidence henry fell wrote <e>", "<cs> my lords i take this opportunity as the noble lord lord gallacher this morning chaired sub-committee d for the last time of thanking him and again paying tribute to the wonderful way and to the good humour with which he led us through the complexities of the cap <e>", "<cs> my lords there are two omissions from the bill which cause me great concern <e> <s> the first is the issue referred to by the noble lady lady kinloss and the noble lord lord pitt of hampstead <e> <s> i refer to the problem of provision of accommodation and support for young people leaving care and going into the world at the age of without a family to go to <e> <s> i have not brought with me today examples of the problems which such young people are now having in our society but i shall have no difficulty whatever in doing so at later stages of the proceedings on the bill if as i hope amendments are laid down on this subject <e> <s> i shall certainly be supporting the noble lady if she does so <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord stanley has put the case very well <e> <s> i want to take up only a couple of minutes of your lordships time because i am myself involved in a scheme of this nature with the samuel lewis housing trust and a group of landlords including the church commissioners in the eastern part of kent <e> <s> the problem with this scheme is that you cannot make the figures stack unless you have free or virtually <e>", "<cs> my lords i join with the noble lord lord carter in congratulating the noble lord lord middleton on the admirable way in which he chaired this interesting inquiry <e> <s> i also congratulate him on the great clarity with which he presented the case this afternoon <e> <s> it has been one of the most interesting of the many inquiries in which i have participated with sub-committee d <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sympathetic to the general intentions of the bill <e> <s> all of us are against evil and all of us in the same way must be against pouring quantities of noxious chemicals into the atmosphere or polluting the water supplies <e> <s> i hope that i can express to your lordships this evening the reasons for the profound disquiet i have about the bill as drafted <e> <s> in my view it is drafted very widely and will give the commission and the government very wide powers <e>", "<cs> my lords we should all be grateful to the noble lord lord mcintosh for introducing this very important subject this afternoon and for giving us the opportunity to debate it <e> <s> in spending a good deal of time on the subject of housing he was targeting well an important aspect of the subject <e> <s> i am not going to talk about housing except to say that in the borough of which i have some knowledge the problem is not so much a total lack of housing as a mismatch between the housing needs and the housing supply <e> <s> nearly all the accommodation consists of one- or two-bedroomed flats and houses <e> <s> however the character of the borough has changed and larger families have moved in which is leading to appalling problems such as brothers and sisters having to sleep together long beyond the age when they should <e> <s> i believe that this is one of the causes of child abuse and other problems which are occurring in some of the inner areas of london <e>", "<cs> the figures are not that difficult to work out <e> <s> if there are people in this category and we suggest that they should receive another a year i make that <e> <s> if they should have another a year the figure is <e> <s> it is not difficult to work out <e> <s> the noble earl lord russell made his speech in his sleep <e> <s> i hope that he will continue to make it in this chamber until something is done <e> <s> the situation is a blot on the escutcheon of this country <e> <s> i urge the government to respond positively <e>", "<cs> i must apologise for my slip of the tongue <e> <s> i said when i meant million <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord inform the house whether the arrangements for limiting unwanted mailing extends to mail sent over fax machines <e>", "<cs> my lords i intend to speak briefly to lay down markers in relation to certain amendments that will be tabled to clauses and which relate to compensation <e> <s> i apologise to the house in advance because i may have to leave before the end of the debate <e> <s> i shall read the noble baronesss summing-up with care if i have to leave <e>"]
