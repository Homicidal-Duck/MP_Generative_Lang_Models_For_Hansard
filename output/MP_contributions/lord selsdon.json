["<cs> my lords i think one of the nice things about a debate of this kind is that it gives those of us on the back-benches here and opposite a chance to give advice to the government knowing full well that the government being a wise government will inevitably accept it <e> <s> we have today a consensus of opinion <e> <s> i would have been equally happy sitting on the benches opposite because i agree with every single word noble lords opposite have said <e> <s> we are very grateful to the noble lord lord parry for having once again raised the issue of service industries but i think we are in danger of a bit of overkill <e> <s> a few years ago nobody knew what invisible exports were <e> <s> now because of the excellent work of the committee on invisible exports and others we are almost too well aware of what they are <e> <s> they are brilliant they are always in surplus <e> <s> there has been a danger of decline <e> <s> the point is made that when our restrictions on overseas investment were there we could forecast a decline in invisible earnings <e> <s> but the government have wisely relaxed the exchange control and hopefully that problem will be overcome <e>", "<cs> my lords i have just realised that if the pattern of previous speakers were repeated i would be in the very privileged position of congratulating the noble lord lord jacques upon a maiden speech <e> <s> it has indeed been a great pleasure to listen to maiden speeches of this sort and to have the assurance that the house of lords has i suppose a peerless or a glorious future <e> <s> but in speaking today i recall advice that lloyd george once gave to harold macmillan after harold macmillans maiden speech <e> <s> he called him up to his room and he said when you speak from the back-benches make one point and make it as many times as you like <e> <s> it is only when you are prime minister that you may have the luxury of making two <e>", "<cs> my lords at the risk of being accused of nit-picking i have put this amendment down because subsection of amendment no <e> <s> is intended to permit a company to make a loan to one of its directors or a director of its holding company for the purpose of purchasing a house among other things <e> <s> the figure of which is the upper limit permitted for such loans was first mentioned in a white paper dated november since which time we have enjoyed a substantial level of inflation and an escalation in the price of houses to such an extent that a figure of in is equivalent to today <e> <s> i should therefore like to ask my noble friends if they are unwilling to accept this amendment and i would not propose to press it first of all whether they will say it was their deliberate intention to reduce effectively the purchasing power of the maximum amount which could be permitted for a loan by about to per cent <e> <s> or whether they would perhaps make the statement that as one <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> i understand why he is unwilling to comment on the level of inflation in the united kingdom over the next few years <e> <s> i would ask as we have a government of action why cannot they act now rather than in the future <e> <s> since he shows his reluctance to act then in withdrawing the amendment may i remind my noble friend that there are many employees in companies who have beneficial loans fro m their employers which would in effect <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend lord lyell is like me an hereditary peer i hope that we are not superfluous <e> <s> my advisers disagree with his advisers but in view of the respect i have for my noble friend and the way in which he has conducted this bill today i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords like my noble friends and noble lords opposite i too am grateful to my noble friend lord drumalbyn for introducing this debate and also to the select committee for their report <e> <s> i find the comments in the report and the tokyo round as a whole quite encouraging <e> <s> i will try and explain why <e> <s> we had some countries present there <e> <s> i do not know how many countries there are in the world perhaps the noble lord lord greenhill will remind us but it is something of the order of thus two-thirds of the countries attended <e> <s> something like actually signed something and therefore roughly per cent <e> <s> of the countries in the world signed something <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to noble lords for their comments and particularly for the unheralded support from noble lords opposite <e> <s> i have two brief points to make because if the noble lord lord mishcon and i can take credit for shortening this session tonight i am sure that noble lords will be most grateful to us <e> <s> i am grateful for these comments made by my noble friend and his reassurance that nobody would suffer because the government would be bound to stand behind british rail is much appreciated because as he knows at the moment there <e>", "<cs> my lords my own contribution this afternoon will be more economic in character than political for i like others in your lordships house prefer to rely upon the excellent skills of my right honourable friend the foreign secretary <e> <s> also having as i do many spanish cousins if our discussions privately in our homes on the subject of gibraltar bear any resemblance to those which take place at the conference table i would prefer to be well out of them <e>", "<cs> my lords i begin my intervention today by expressing a profound regret that the united kingdom has failed as a whole to play a major role in the implementation of the lom policies <e> <s> my noble friend lord kissin has pointed out that not only have we failed to secure contracts but perhaps more significantly we have on numerous occasions failed even to attempt to make a contribution <e> <s> i am not quite sure where the fault lies in the united kingdom as a whole <e> <s> i think it lies somewhere between the public and the private sectors <e> <s> we are faced with a situation today where if i interpret properly the rumblings in relation to british aid policy we say that with cash limits we can afford to contribute no more <e> <s> yet perhaps we of all nations should recognise that we are more dependent upon international trade than any other developed nation in the world <e>", "<cs> my lords as a banker i am aware of that <e> <s> it has a certain relevance <e> <s> but money is often an unnecessary means of communication that was invented when all other forms of communication broke down <e> <s> what i am saying is that the united kingdom at this time needs orders contracts and jobs <e> <s> a third of our economy depends upon international aspects <e> <s> i should like to feel that we could allocate more of our domestic resources to increase bilateral aid but in perhaps a more pragmatic way than has been done in the past <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not be human if i did not express some doubt about the policies of this government <e> <s> when they came to power i must admit i supported wholeheartedly the theory behind their policies <e> <s> but i wondered after a while as to whether it would be practical for the government to implement everything they sought to do <e> <s> as i recall it there was a trident of policies <e> <s> the first was to reduce or control inflation and all sides of this house agreed that inflation was the greatest priority then it was to remove restrictions and control government spending <e> <s> that was the second part <e> <s> the third was to restore initiative and enterprise by reduced taxation and new incentives <e>", "<cs> my lords i have very considerable sympathy with the motion of the noble lord lord jacques <e> <s> also i have had a high regard over some time in this house for his integrity and sense of purpose <e> <s> however during the past few years in various economic debates particularly since this government have been in power i have not found one straw to clutch at which leads me to believe that noble lords opposite or their friends in another place have a credible alternative policy when the priority agreed by all concerned prior to the last election was fighting inflation <e> <s> that does not mean that in any way i wish to criticise or that i shall fail to listen to the views expressed by noble lords on the benches opposite <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord lord obrien for introducing this debate and to the noble lord lord plowden for the initiatives that were taken <e> <s> these have led to probably the most authoritative document currently available on the borrowing and lending of the community and its institutions <e> <s> although i am a banker and i declare an interest in that i have arranged the provision of finance for the community and have arranged <e>", "<cs> my lords after some years in your lordships house i am hesitant to suggest that i have come of age but over these past years i have participated in various economic debates and various select committees <e> <s> now for the first time i see some form of hope <e> <s> this particular select committee has been one of the most enjoyable and interesting with which i have been involved <e> <s> it has been full of logic political cunning and strange emotional activities <e> <s> my noble friend lord aldington whose reputation as a wet or a dry is known by others has a certain political skill no doubt because of his helicopter background in dropping things from a great height <e> <s> at the moment underneath one finds the government which in the guise of two members of the cabinet panicked perhaps like latter-day oozlum oozlum birds <e> <s> they flew around in circles and returned in the form of my noble friend lord young to say yes we have received the report yes we accept the information but there are certain recommendations we do not agree with <e>", "<cs> my lords i have often wondered in your lordships house why we continue to draw this division between the words private and public <e> <s> to me it seems to be a question of either something being in public ownership or owned by the public <e> <s> personally i would prefer the latter which some people define as privatisation <e> <s> i would not wish in my contribution today to enter into this form of argument or debate <e> <s> i want to talk about the water industry as a whole and to say by way of declaration of interest that i have always had a great affection for this industry because it gave me my first job <e> <s> in those days of advanced technology i was in a drawing office taking quantities off for sewerage systems <e> <s> we were <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the noble baroness raised this matter <e> <s> it is difficult for me to deal with it in the saudi arabia context <e> <s> i have reason to believe that it would be more effectively achieved within the private sector <e> <s> perhaps we may discuss this at a later date <e> <s> i am not saying that it is because saudi arabia prefers to deal with the private sector but in dealing with some of these countries there is need for a certain elasticity of mind which is often denied to the public sector because of the words public accountability and certain restrictions <e>", "<cs> my lords after that powerful tripod if i may so describe it of church law and parliament i am afraid i stand before you as a complete amateur <e> <s> i would say that i represent the voluntary sector and for a period of six years i was fortunate enough to hold two appointments first from a conservative secretary of state for the environment michael heseltine and secondly from a socialst secretary of state for the environment peter shore <e> <s> however in the appointment i had there did not seem to be any political differences at all <e> <s> it was to chair a body which we affectionately called an ango in order that we might have some form of self-perpetuation <e> <s> it was called the greater london and south-east council for sport and recreation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend lord boardman for initiating this debate and demonstrating so amply and well how my noble friends in this house and my right honourable friends in another place have captured the high ground of political and economic thinking and held it for so long <e> <s> i admire the efforts of the noble lord lord bruce who like the best of british terriers seeks to dislodge us from those starry heights and again and again raises these same issues <e> <s> i am also most grateful to my noble friend and impressed by his remarkable speech <e> <s> he demonstrates once more that we have admirable talent on these benches <e>", "<cs> my lords i am probably the least qualified member of your lordships house to intervene on the subject of music <e> <s> it was by accident rather than design that for a brief moment i strayed into the world of concerts and concert promotion to find that all my prejudices were turned upside down <e> <s> i do not understand why at this time my noble friend lord ferrers is seeking to define something so obviously indefinable <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the great privileges of being a member of your lordships house is the relatively free ability which one has to go on learning <e> <s> today i have learnt more in a few short hours than i have for many a month not least from our two maiden speeches <e>", "<cs> my lords i stand before you in a slightly more pragmatic way as a trader <e> <s> for almost all my working life i have been involved in trade and the financing of trade the financing of british trade in yen and of foreign trade in ecus <e> <s> i have been dragged around the conferences in europe discussing <e>"]
