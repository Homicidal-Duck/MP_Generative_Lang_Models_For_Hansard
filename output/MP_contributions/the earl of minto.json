["<cs> i apologise to the committee for the fact that i was not present at the second reading of this bill and perhaps i should declare an interest in it in so far as i happen to be a deputy traffic commissioner for the traffic area of scotland <e> <s> i have not had the advantage enjoyed by certain noble lords today of having placed before me the information that has obviously been of great use to them so i may be speaking marginally out of place <e> <s> however i should like to say this to your lordships if i have read the amendments correctly we are in a position where the education authority will be able to use the school buses to all intents and purposes as stage carriages and although they have road service licences and that provides a certain defence mechanism the vehicle would not need to comply with psv standards <e> <s> as a traffic commissioner that concerns me very much indeed <e>", "<cs> in answer to that point i should make clear that the reason why this amendment did not appear in relation to clause is that in that clause we were referring essentially to special responsibility allowances <e> <s> this is what we in scotland would call in the terms of a pure expenses allowance for his duties as vice-convenor as we would say vice-chairman as i have said in scotland <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank the noble earl the minister of state for his comments and also other noble lords for their support of my amendment <e> <s> there is one point that i might make at this moment and that is the fact that of course the heart of the object of the amendment is the actual appointment and the power of appointment of a vice-chairman which does not come within the act <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble earl for his response and for kindly explaining the consequential aspect of subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to speak as one who has had six years experience as an elected regional councillor since <e> <s> i should like to speak from the practical background that i have gathered during that time <e> <s> when the local government scotland act devolved powers to the newly reorganised local authorities in may there were many people both within and outwith local government who had severe misgivings <e> <s> the margin of unease was very wide stretching from those who saw the act as heading for disaster from the start to those who were prepared to find fault with it purely for faults sake <e> <s> there were <e>", "<cs> may i support the noble lord lord drumalbyn in his support of the noble lord lord hughes <e> <s> if the situation arose where successive secretaries of state were to take powers on revaluation then you are undermining the base of the rate element on which either the region or district depends <e> <s> i think we cannot have an open-ended clause on this if it is open-ended <e> <s> unless the may be that the noble earl the minister used with regard to the new form of taxation taking place becomes a certainty rather than a may be one will be without a base in a relatively short space of time <e>", "<cs> may i ask whether in fact the local authority does not already have the power in the bill <e> <s> it does not say that the sum has to be it is or less so therefore i think the local authority already has the power <e> <s> i see as a guideline above which it should not be and anything which is seen to be sensible below would appear to me to be permissible within the bill <e> <s> i should like to have the advice of the minister on that <e>", "<cs> at this point in time i should like simply to say that following six years experience as a regional councillor in scotland i find this clause quite nauseating <e> <s> it really does go out of its way to make life exceptionally difficult for the local authorities <e> <s> i take the point made by the noble baroness lady elliot of harwood that some people are extremely angry about the increases in rates but the fact of the matter is and one cannot dodge it that in the vast majority of regions and districts in scotland far more letters are received by members and officials about the diminution of services than about the increase in rates <e> <s> that is a fact <e> <s> it is all very well talking in terms of one or two authorities but does one beat all ones children to make sure that one of them who may be in default is punished <e> <s> i think the answer must be no and in this particular case i am sure we shall come back to it again and i certainly do not want to take up any more of your lordships time than is necessary we have very good reason to look at this clause extraordinarily carefully <e> <s> if we do not what we know now as local government in scotland really is subject to demise <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to burden your lordships committee at this time of night with a recapitulation of virtually everything that i said on second reading and throughout part of today <e> <s> therefore i shall say that it is with a sad heart that i find that the government have so far been intransigent on this clause <e> <s> i believe that it is the first of the clauses which will most seriously damage the relationship between central and local government in scotland <e> <s> i find myself very closely aligned with all that has been said by the noble lord lord hughes who virtually spoke my words for me <e> <s> if to be on the record one has to rise to ones feet and be counted in that way then i should like to do so as briefly as possible by associating myself with the noble lord lord hughes <e>", "<cs> will the minister give way <e> <s> i did not make any suggestions as to how these cuts should be achieved because i believe i have said it in the house and i am on record as doing so that the costs of services that are viewed as acceptable by the government are wholly out of proportion with the actual costs on the ground <e> <s> the government are fundamentally wrong on this point <e> <s> therefore i do not feel that it is necessary for me to make a suggestion <e> <s> if a local authority feels that it has responsibility to those whom it represents and that that will cost a certain sum of money then that money should be spent so long as it is within the law <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to apologise to the house for not being present during the report stage <e> <s> four years ago i accepted an invitation to be present and to speak at a gathering in scotland which occurred on nd june and i really felt that after four years only a fortnights notice of absence would <e>", "<cs> first may i apologise to the noble earl the minister for the fact that i was not in my seat at second reading <e> <s> this was because i was informed that it was going to be a short day <e> <s> due to an illness in my family had made arrangements to travel back to scotland by a specific aircraft <e> <s> local government was being discussed by our english colleagues and at one point they became obsessed with sex and the debate went on and on <e> <s> consequently i had to leave your lordships house <e> <s> i apologise for what might have appeared to be rude <e> <s> it was not intended so to be <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no wish whatsoever to enter into this particular debate on this question on any form of prohibitionist ticket <e> <s> i have been for over years closely associated with the field of alcoholism and alcohol abuse in scotland <e> <s> i have also been for many years the chairman of the scottish council on alcoholism <e> <s> but i should like to make it clear before i go any further that those over whom i take the chair in all the voluntary agencies throughout scotland because we are differently organised to in england as well as myself have a deep detestation of the prohibition lobby on the basis in scotland of the terrible damage that we have seen done by it in those areas of our native country which subscribe somewhat to it for social or religious reasons <e> <s> therefore i rise as a humble scot on a question which pertains essentially to england and wales but i also rise with the i hope useful knowledge of a little of what has happened in scotland since the licensing scotland act <e>", "<cs> my lords yes in scotland <e> <s> it is perhaps proper to note that one of the recommendations made by the central policy review staff in was that scotland should reconsider its all-day legislation and that there should be no adoption of such liberal practices south of the border <e>", "<cs> as my name is associated with this amendment it might be helpful to the committee and also to the noble and learned lord the lord advocate if i speak immediately after the noble lady lady saltoun <e> <s> i also have to declare what i suppose is called a non-interest <e> <s> i make no bones about it i shoot <e> <s> i have property in scotland over which i shoot <e> <s> i have friends in scotland with whom i shoot and i am very lucky to do so <e> <s> but in every single instance and i do mean every single instance the properties whether they are mine or the properties over which i shoot are let and for that reason they pay rates <e> <s> this amendment would in no way stop them from continuing to pay rates <e> <s> therefore i believe that i can genuinely say that i do not have a vested interest in the outcome of this particular amendment <e>", "<cs> i cannot believe that the noble and learned lord can remember <e> <s> he looks so young <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to join with other noble lords in thanking the noble lord lord teviot for providing us with this opportunity to discuss the white paper on <e>", "<cs> i should like to say a few words as an elected regional councillor in scotland <e> <s> i support everything that has been said by the noble baroness lady carnegy of lour <e> <s> i should like to hear the ministers answer to the question posed <e> <s> i have a great deal of sympathy for the amendment as it stands <e> <s> we in the border region of scotland will suffer greatly unless the cookie crumbles i hope the expression may be used in the committee in the correct way <e> <s> the only way one will discover that is in the answer given by the minister <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may be allowed to speak as a member of a fire board in scotland <e> <s> outside a fire board i cannot remember ever having been in the company of so many distinguished firemen <e> <s> be that as it may there is a very strong <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord withdraws his amendment on those conditions i put on a third hat as the chairman or vice-chairman of a highways authority for far too many years <e> <s> i do not think that this matter should be underestimated by the minister <e> <s> it is indeed late but the fact is that here too lies life and death <e> <s> if you live in the north as i do and i have no reason to suppose that it is any different in the south you may well be without railways as we are you may be without airports as indeed we are and you may rely entirely on your road network to get people to and from hospital to and from the necessary health services that they require and to and from every sort of really important function in life <e>"]
