["<cs> my lords may i begin by adding myself to those who have already extended congratulations to the noble earl lord mansfield on his appointment to the government front bench <e> <s> i wish him success in his efforts so far as the government of scotland is concerned <e> <s> may i also congratulate the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey <e> <s> he confirmed the reputation which he gained in the course of the passage of the act that whatever the odds against him he is <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord sits down i wonder whether he could assist me on this point <e> <s> he referred to the per cent rule and he dismissed somewhat cavalierly the complaints which had been made about the suggestion disseminated that an abstention was the same as a no vote by suggesting that people could not surely be so silly as that <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble and learned lord for that answer which will help to allay a good deal of concern and anxiety that has existed in scotland on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am bound to say that i share some of the concern expressed by the noble earl lord selkirk at the outset of his speech because this is a difficult bill on which to make a second reading speech for the simple reason that from its very nature there is no single principle underlying the provisions of this measure <e> <s> i say that but of course the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey made an extraordinarily effective second reading speech with that facility and skill in advocacy which he so uniquely commands <e> <s> if i may say so i think that we are in the debt of all three front bench speakers who introduced and commented on this measure <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot see any problem arising out of that <e> <s> if they have reasonable cause to believe why should they not arrest <e> <s> surely that is the proper thing to do <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord sits down may i ask him to go back to the question of the right of search <e> <s> i understood him to suggest that the right to search given in particular in relation to the prevention of crime was simpler and therefore should be preferable to the more formal process of arrest <e> <s> am i not right in thinking that so far as arrest is concerned the advantage from the individual citizens point of view is that he has a clear remedy in the event of the arrest being wrongful <e> <s> would it not be more difficult to establish a wrong in the event of a casual search by a police constable in the street <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble and learned lord can help me further on this point <e> <s> if indeed he said as i understood him to say that the provisions of clause may apply to the case of a solicitor how can it be said in that event that these provisions are without prejudice to the provisions of sections and of the act <e>", "<cs> the arguments in favour of the new provisions of clause are those which have been stated so forcefully and pointedly by the noble and learned lord lord wheatley and the noble baroness <e> <s> but is the difference proposed to be brought into effect not in practical terms more apparent than real <e> <s> the clause commences by saying <e>", "<cs> the noble earl said if i heard him aright and understood him aright that the powers which a constable has under section of the prevention of crime act to arrest a person depend on his seeing the person in possession of the weapon or seeing the weapon which the person is alleged to be in possession of <e> <s> surely that is not right <e> <s> surely the powers of arrest conferred upon a constable in terms of section of the act are very much the same as the powers given to a constable to search the grounds are substantially the same <e> <s> surely that is so <e>", "<cs> perhaps it would be helpful if i pointed out that prevarication is not a new offence <e> <s> prevarication is the word which is used in section of the criminal procedure scotland act <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord ross of marnock is right to say that there are many delays greater than days in the summary criminal courts especially in the busier sheriff courts to which the noble and learned lord lord wheatley referred <e> <s> as i understand it this provision in the new proposed clause a refers to people who are detained in custody pending trial who i should have thought would be a small minority of the number involved and i should have thought that in most courts a trial diet could be fixed without too great difficulty even in the busier courts within the -day period or a period not very much greater than that <e>", "<cs> i have listened to the noble and learned lord lord mackay of clashfern with great interest and i could see the force of what he says but for the provisions of clause of the bill and in particular the proposed new section to the act which unless i misread it provides that applications for an extension of the -month period may be taken before the sheriff <e> <s> this is in much more serious cases on indictment but perhaps i have missed some particular point <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for what he has said about giving the matter further consideration <e> <s> will he consider the possibility that the matter raises such questions of constitutional importance related to the freedom of the individual and so on that perhaps the sheriff principal would be capable of dealing with these matters <e> <s> that would be just as inexpensive as going to the sheriff and it would be just as speedy too because in the ordinary courts and especially in the busier courts he would probably be in the same building and so it would not be necessary to go to edinburgh <e>", "<cs> i stand corrected on these points <e> <s> one makes these general assertions and is then picked up on them but the fact remains that what i suggest would be cheaper and quicker <e> <s> if the noble and learned lord thinks that i should declare an interest i would say i have declared this interest so often to your lordships that i have myself become bored with declaring it that from time to time i sit in the summary criminal courts in scotland and i did not think that that raised the question of an intense interest in this matter <e> <s> while i accept the correction of the noble and learned lord lord wheatley that in the far-flung outposts of the scottish <e>", "<cs> i take it from what the noble and learned lord the lord advocate has said and indeed from what has been said by the noble and learned lord lord wheatley that in effect the government consider that the courts should have resort to what used to be called probation reports in most it not all cases <e> <s> this will in practice add a significant burden to the working of the courts and to the work of the social work departments <e> <s> in the case of clause i can readily understand that it is absolutely vital that where a person is not legally represented resort should be had to the social work departments <e> <s> but at not inconsiderable public expense in all these cases to which clause refers the accused person will have the assistance of a legal adviser <e> <s> if the legal adviser is not capable of giving to the court the kind of information that would enable it to decide this kind of question then in my humble opinion the question arises as to whether so much public money should be spent in providing legal advice to people <e> <s> surely the kind of information the court needs in order to decide this kind of question over a person who had never been in prison before ought to be provided with a legal adviser whether he be privately instructed or instructed at public expense <e> <s> why should it be thought that as i understand it many overworked social work departments in scotland should have the burden put on to them <e> <s> a burden which many of them say they have great difficulty in carrying at the moment <e> <s> it was with these sorts of considerations in mind that i put down this amendment <e> <s> at first sight it might be thought a little callous to say why should not the court go to the social work department <e> <s> is it really necessary if he has a good legal adviser <e>", "<cs> f do not want to press this point because it is a short one <e> <s> i accept everything that the noble lord lord foot has said <e> <s> there will be many cases in which the court will be doubtful as to whether it should proceed to imprisonment without getting a report from a social work department <e> <s> the point is that in the scottish courts the approach certainly in the summary criminal courts to the question of whether or not to impose a sentence of imprisonment is very much the approach enshrined in this clause of the bill <e> <s> the only point at which i cavill is tying the hands of the court and saying you cannot do it unless you get a report from the social work department i would have thought this was an unnecessary and undue restriction <e> <s> that was the only point i wanted to make and in the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i agree with what has been said in support of the amendment <e> <s> the amendment which i put down amendment no <e> <s> a covered only the case of the probation order <e> <s> that was simply because i could see a kind of legal logic in saying that if an absolute discharge was appropriate then perhaps a compensation order was not <e> <s> however i think that my legal logic was wrong <e>", "<cs> there is a further point which may have a hearing on this difficulty <e> <s> the summary courts have no power when they impose a fine <e>", "<cs> i support the noble lord wholeheartedly <e> <s> i hesitate to say that this matter raises a question of principle because that would make everyone suspicious particularly at this late hour <e> <s> if it were not so late i should certainly be concerned to press it to a division because i think it raises a question of great importance <e> <s> at this late hour however i content myself with saying that i was surprised to hear the <e>", "<cs> i do not propose to add anything except that those of us who put down this amendment share the noble earls concern about this serious public mischief <e> <s> we are just as concerned about it as he is <e> <s> we put down this amendment because we regard this provision in the bill as being essentially cosmetic and dishonest <e> <s> it is to encourage people to think that vigorous action is being taken when all that is being done is to change the words <e> <s> it is not a matter of semantics <e> <s> i do not propose to pursue this tonight but i can think of many arguments which i hope in due course will be considered by noble lords who spoke in favour of this provision and against the amendment <e> <s> i think it important from every point of view that the matter should be gone into very thoroughly <e> <s> this is not the hour of night in this committee when that can be done <e>", "<cs> my <e>", "<cs> my lords i too would support this amendment <e> <s> i must confess that i did not find the arguments in favour of the amendment quite so overwhelming as did the noble lord lord monson and i thought that perhaps there was something in the statistical point which was made by the noble lord lord foot <e> <s> but it can surely do no harm to have this five-year trial period <e> <s> it will give us the opportunity to reassess the situation in the kind of context to which the noble lord lord mishcon has referred <e> <s> for myself i must say that i think it is a great pity that during the period since in particular no doubt this applied before too but in our efforts in the reform of the criminal law of scotland since in particular we have never properly stopped to reassess the situation and see whether all these things that we have been doing have made any impact on the problem at all or whether perhaps we have been on the wrong lines altogether <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether it will be <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house may i say in reply to the point raised by the noble baroness lady phillips that i do not share any illusions with anyone that one can make a real impact on the problems of crime by punishment in the courts <e> <s> i have no illusions about that <e> <s> may i say to the noble earl that i am not a sinner come to repentance so far as this clause is concerned <e> <s> i thought it proper to put <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord lord ross of marnock that we have had enough of this <e> <s> i think there is one small error of the noble earls which should be pointed out to him <e> <s> he suggested that there was nothing wrong with cosmetology as i understood him <e> <s> he said to your lordships that after all ones loved one who was attractive at all times became even more attractive when more elaborately adorned with the cosmetic <e> <s> he is quite wrong <e> <s> one only thinks that she is more attractive <e> <s> this of course is the whole point of the objections to this provision <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble and learned lord could clarify two further points <e> <s> in the first place assuming that mr skeen feels that his character has been wrongfully defamed what remedies at law has he against the crown office against the crown agent or indeed against the noble and learned lord himself <e> <s> in the second place can the noble and learned lord tell us whether anything was known within the crown office bearing upon the character of the three women concerned that might have made one think twice about accepting the truth of the allegations which they were making <e>", "<cs> my lords in spite of what the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey has said perhaps i might be permitted to make one short point <e> <s> i am sure that all that can sensibly be said in support of these amendments has been said this afternoon and i should not wish to presume to add to the wisdom which your lordships have on this matter <e> <s> however in view of a passing reference by the noble lord lord boothby to something that i said in the past i felt it prudent to put on record that i would support this amendment <e> <s> i agree with what has been said by the noble earls lord selkirk and lord perth and by the noble lord lord ross <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not complaining but i thought that i should just put my view of the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise with the greatest reluctance because i find it difficult to believe that i can find anything new to say on this subject but let me just try <e> <s> i can understand the anxieties of the noble earl lord lauderdale and the noble lords lord galpern and lord drumalbyn as to the procedure which has been followed which brings this clause before your lordships now <e> <s> but when one looks at the history of this wretched matter since the labouchre amendment which is the cause of it all over years ago it is surely stretching things a little to suggest as the noble lord lord drumalbyn did that it was an abuse of parliamentary privilege to try to put the matter right in this way now <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise but subject to that correction i hope that your lordships will take my point <e> <s> i hope that your lordships will reflect carefully on what particularly the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey and the noble lord lord shackleton have said on this matter <e> <s> what will happen if your lordships decide because of your reservations on the procedural aspect of the matter that this shall not become the law <e> <s> we shall go on discussing it here and elsewhere to the acute boredom of many of us <e> <s> the thing will go on just as it has always done <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened to the debate so far with the greatest possible interest and i would agree with the view already expressed that sweetness and light upon this issue is not all on the one side <e> <s> nevertheless i have no doubt for myself on which side the balance falls and that is on the side of the noble lord lord nugent of guildford in whose debt we are for his presentation with such meticulous care and tenacity of this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not see it quite like that <e> <s> i accept a compulsion imposed upon me by the queen and parliament <e>", "<cs> before the noble and learned lord spoke it had never occurred to me to address your lordships on this amendment because i cannot match the knowledge and experience of the several of your lordships who have spoken to it <e> <s> i found the response of the government as expressed by the noble and learned lord on the front bench to these imaginative and potentially exciting innovations in the industrial scene more than somewhat disappointing <e> <s> indeed i thought in spite of the note on which the noble and learned lord concluded that the governments approach to these matters tended just a little i hope that this is not an unkind thing to say to express the spirit of a man who has a problem for every solution <e>", "<cs> i certainly apologise to the noble and learned lord if i misinterpreted the spirit in which he replied to the amendment <e> <s> i readily apologise for that but certainly that was the impression i gathered <e> <s> but of course i may have been wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords may i support this amendment for all the reasons stated by all the noble lords who have already spoken <e> <s> i do not imagine that the noble earl on behalf of the government will now resist the amendment <e> <s> clearly the drafting is inappropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords i support this amendment <e> <s> i am reluctant to some extent to speak upon it because unfortunately i have not been able to participate in the earlier debates on this bill <e> <s> but i agree with the noble earl lord selkirk that this is an unhappy phrase and is one which so far as i am aware is unknown to our scottish courts <e> <s> his suggestion of respondent too raises the question of the procedure in accordance with which these applications will be dealt with <e> <s> this is not in fact laid down as i understand it in the bill and accordingly i imagine though the noble and learned lord who is present will know better than i that the application will be dealt with as a summary application in terms of i think section of the sheriff courts scotland act <e> <s> in that case if the application proceeds according to the procedure appropriate to a summary application the initiator of the procedure will be the applicant and the person who answers will be the respondent <e> <s> of course i have in mind what the noble and learned lord lord fraser of tullybelton said but subject to that it seems to me that the word respondent would be the more appropriate drafting term <e>", "<cs> my lords surely that is so <e> <s> if the system in accordance with which local authorities have been dealing with this kind of situation without complaint from parties concerned has as the noble lord lord ross said worked for many years surely this right of theirs should be left as it is <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble earl for the clarity of his presentation of the bill but we share many if not indeed all of the reservations which have been expressed by the noble lord lord beaumont of whitley upon its terms <e> <s> as he said the house will be considering the terms of the bill with great care with a view if that be possible to effecting the necessary improvement <e>", "<cs> my lords without wishing to introduce a parochial note may i ask the minister whether he is aware that among the less publicised consequences of the civil service strike action is that the administration of justice in the cities of edinburgh and glasgow has been brought practically to a standstill <e> <s> is the minister also aware that it is widely felt up there that if this had happened in the old bailey action more effective might have been taken so that master rumpole and his brothers might have been getting on with it <e> <s> is the minister further aware that it is widely felt up there that a little more managerial skill and perhaps a little more effective planning ahead might well have reduced significantly the disruption of the administration of justice in these cities <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble and learned lord for that reply i am bound to say that i am a little startled by its inadequacy <e> <s> in finalising it did the noble and learned lord have in mind the following circumstances first did he have in mind the duration of the strike which is now in its second month during which the administration of justice in glasgow and edinburgh has been practically at a standstill <e> <s> did he have in mind also the three previous incidents of strikes in the civil service and their consequences for the scottish courts <e> <s> on the first of these occasions none of the staff or only a minority of the staff in the sheriff court struck and none at all in the supreme court <e> <s> does not the noble and learned lord recognise that this suggests a considerable decline in the morale of the staff of the courts the restoration of which must be the responsibility of the ministers in the scottish office <e> <s> finally <e>", "<cs> finally did he have in mind the action taken in by the labour government for whose competence i had no particular love when they took the necessary emergency powers to keep the wheels of justice turning <e> <s> does he not appreciate that something of that vigorous nature is called for by this strike which is causing so much difficulty in scotland <e>", "<cs> i shall be perfectly willing to withdraw my amendment subject to this <e> <s> will the noble earl also undertake to consider perhaps along with his right honourable and learned friend the circumstance that of course in law generally where a duty to take certain precautions is imposed upon someone and it is said that these precautions should be taken so far <e>", "<cs> in those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certain that nothing i am likely to say on this matter will bring comfort to the noble earl lord mansfield <e> <s> i find myself broadly in agreement with what the noble viscount lord thurso said about clause <e> <s> i do so particularly in the context of the provisions of section of the local government scotland act a measure promoted by a government of which the noble lord lord ross and myself for our sins or otherwise according to the view one takes of the matter were members <e> <s> section and in particular section empowers the secretary of state to take action by making regulations for prescribing standards and general requirements in relation to any function of a local authority in scotland <e> <s> that colours my <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down and with the leave of the house may i ask him on what basis he asserts that the local government scotland act was a consolidation statute <e> <s> if in fact it was what relevance does that have <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not intended to intervene at this stage on this particular amendment but having listened with great interest to everything that has been said in the debate i feel compelled to intervene and for this reason no one has spoken against the amendment at all <e> <s> all who have spoken have spoken in favour of it <e> <s> two reasons have been advanced in answer to it <e> <s> the first is that it is against the current approach of government to scottish local government problems <e> <s> i find that a quite astonishing proposition in the light of the various powers which different governments have taken to control scottish local government operations since <e> <s> i must say i find this the first of the two answers of the government to this amendment a little startling and certainly unconvincing <e>", "<cs> my lords in welcoming this amendment from these benches i would only say that in order to support the view that this amendment is a significant step forward in the context of the needs of the disabled there is nothing that i can add to what has already been said from all sides of the house in particular by the noble baronesses lady masham and lady darcy de knayth and the noble viscount lord ingleby <e> <s> all of us are greatly indebted to the noble earl for his efforts <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble earl two questions <e> <s> the first arises out of the conclusion of the statement which referred to the unfairness of the rating system in scotland <e> <s> can he tell your lordships for how long this matter of fairness of the rating system has been under consideration in the scottish office under successive governments <e> <s> if my recollection that the period of time may be calculated in decades rather than years is correct can we expect an answer to this problem to be forthcoming soon from the government <e>", "<cs> my lords as one whose principal overt concern with this bill was to see strengthened the provisions of the original clause i should simply like to express my appreciation of the noble earls willingness to accept the need for this and most wholeheartedly to add my appreciation of his efforts in that direction to the words of the noble lord lord campbell of croy <e>", "<cs> may i ask the minister two short questions my lords <e> <s> have the government in deciding that no further action than has been announced in this statement need be taken so far as local government in scotland is concerned had due full and careful regard to the somewhat critical comments in paragraphs to of the valuable stodart report <e> <s> the conclusion of paragraph is to the effect that it is clear that there are certain flaws in the present arrangements which need correcting <e> <s> secondly have they had regard to what is said about community councils in paragraph of the report and will the government consider the necessity for action to be taken to meet the evidence which the committee heard about the scant attention which was paid to the views of the community councils by district and regional councils <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that in scotland at the last count all but two of the responsible local authorities had responded in this context and that it is confidently expected that the response will shortly be per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble earl for the care and clarity of his presentation of the provisions of this bill <e> <s> i rise not for the first time with some hesitation because the education of the young is not a field in which i would claim any high qualities or qualifications to pronounce any judgment <e> <s> i can hear some of your lordships saying to yourselves in that event why do you presume to detain us here somewhat late on a thursday afternoon <e> <s> i would answer that question by saying i do so because i am a scotsman and also because am a social democrat <e>", "<cs> my lords at this hour of the evening i shall content myself with concurring with everything that the noble lord lord airedale has said <e> <s> the house is in debt to the noble baroness lady burton of coventry for the pertinacity with which she has pursued this by no means unimportant issue <e> <s> i would content myself with making only three short points <e> <s> i have listened to most of the questions that the noble baroness has asked the government on this matter over the last year or so <e> <s> having listened to the questions and to the answers as i understand it thanks to the pertinacity of the noble baroness lady burton the merits of the issue raised in her question are not in dispute they are conceded <e> <s> i have heard the noble lord lord trefgarne himself say that he shared to the full the concern which the noble baroness lady burton had expressed on this subject <e> <s> so the only question now is what can and should the <e>", "<cs> there is another aspect of the matter on which the minister might usefully reflect <e> <s> i resisted the temptation to meet any of the arguments presented in support of his amendment by the noble lord lord ross of marnock because i thought the amendment was entirely misconceived <e> <s> indeed i thought the noble lord was completely wrong i will not develop the argument because in my view it is self-evident in suggesting that it was more appropriate that the decision on an appeal from the committee should go to the secretary of state rather than to the sheriff <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord hughes raises a point of great interest and there may be something in it which the minister wishes to consider <e> <s> but may i point out that of course governments appoint judges and governments still litigate before judges and local authorities appoint stipendiary magistrates and still expect them to behave judicially and by and large they do <e> <s> the point i am making is that there is all the difference in the world between the situation where members of the tribunal are actually members of the education authority and where they are albeit appointed by the local authority not members of the authority or a committee <e>", "<cs> if the noble earl as i understood him to say is prepared to consider both these amendments then i can proceed accordingly <e> <s> i am anxious not to delay the house at all in view of the other important business that is to come on and to hear what other noble lords who are experienced in local government affairs have to say on this matter <e> <s> i am a little concerned that my advocacy is so very had and that i have apparently misled the minister and i am sure it is my fault into thinking that i was making unwarrantable insinuations against people <e> <s> it was nothing of the kind <e> <s> i refrained from talking about the importance of justice being seen to be done because there are plenty of platitudes flying about <e>", "<cs> in view of what the noble earl the minister has said and with the reservation of any right which i have to raise the matter again on report i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness acknowledge that one of the reasons why the act did not fulfil the expectations which many of us had of it was the undue restriction to complaints made through members of the house of commons <e> <s> would she not acknowledge that lord winstanleys suggestion would go far to correct this <e> <s> in the second place would a simple amendment to the act not suffice <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with much of what the noble lord lord molloy has said in addressing your lordships but he will no doubt forgive me if i do not follow him in what he said <e> <s> i doubt whether i should be qualified to expatiate upon the afterlife of either florence nightingale or aneurin bevan <e> <s> may i start as a simple scots lawyer by echoing the many congratulations which have been extended to the self-styled simple scots farmer the noble lord lord stodart of leaston <e> <s> he will understand that at this late hour i leave my eulogy there <e>", "<cs> my lords i can see force in some of the detailed criticisms directed against the bill by the noble lord lord ross of marnock and i can understand well enough why the noble lord <e> <s> lord mackie of benshie described it as a beastly bill having said that i venture to think that it is a good bill because as the explanatory memorandum says it consolidates much of the scots law and at the same time in a sense codifies much of the scots law related to civic government <e> <s> this was a very necessary exercise so i see it as a good and as a necessary bill <e> <s> i sec it also as a bill to be commended in that most of its language is comprehensible and understandable even to myself <e> <s> this is not over-common in our statute law <e> <s> for most of my life though not so much now i have been puzzled as to why parliamentary draftsmen apparently enjoy drafting in language which it is difficult to understand and to comprehend <e> <s> far be it from me to suggest that the circumstance that clarity of language would reduce the need for so many lawyers has anything to do with it <e> <s> however the bill is a good and a necessary bill and its language because it is fairly readily understandable is to be commended <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down may i ask him this <e> <s> i enjoyed his riposte to my suggestion a veiled criticism i thought that the exercise had taken rather a long time <e> <s> it showed that combined with his good humour he has the quality of quick thinking <e> <s> i thought that it was a very good reply <e> <s> i acknowledge the hard work of the working party which took four years <e> <s> does he not acknowledge that <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to intervene in relation to a matter pertaining to the administration of english criminal justice but may i ask the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor if he thinks it is conceivable that any sensible english jury properly directed by the presiding judge could have returned a verdict of guilty of murder or guilty of attempted murder against the doctor in question <e> <s> if he thinks that is conceivable would he agree that <e>", "<cs> i think this amendment is a very desirable one <e> <s> any amendment which uses four words where eight are used in the bill as at present is surely to be encouraged <e>", "<cs> my reason for not responding to the invitation of the noble lord lord ross to metaphorical fisticuffs is that i have much more consideration for the value of your lordships time than i sometimes feel the noble lord lord ross of marnock has <e> <s> to me the two things are entirely different <e> <s> i had really forgotten about this earlier <e>", "<cs> my lords there are several questions i wish to put to the noble and learned lord and i preface them by saying that i readily appreciate the difficulty of his position having been out of the country until yesterday and i accept without qualification his assurance of the care which he has given to these matters and i have some sympathy with the views expressed by the noble lord lord wigoder <e>", "<cs> with respect my lords i think not and i certainly hope i do not appear to be doing that <e> <s> this matter is one of the utmost concern to the administration of criminal justice in scotland and i am certain <e>", "<cs> of course my lords i accept the noble leaders ruling and i apologise <e> <s> this is my final question <e> <s> are the reports in the press and on the bbc that the procurator fiscals office in glasgow was gravely concerned with the crown office decision well founded <e> <s> if so was anything done to clarify the position at that time and should not this case have gone to a law officer at a very much earlier stage <e>", "<cs> i share many of the misgivings expressed by the noble lord lord ross <e> <s> i was not at all reassured by the answer of the noble earl <e> <s> he suggests guidelines <e> <s> i cannot see that they would dispel some of the uncertainties which may arise from the operation of this clause <e> <s> i hope the government will give very careful attention to the points raised by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i understood the minister to say and this is my own recollection that these provisions or similar provisions have been in effect for many years under the burgh police scotland acts <e> <s> this is not to introduce fresh law but simply to codify existing law <e> <s> of course i see the force of what the noble lord lord mackie of benshie said but i imagine that although these laws existed the law enforcement authorities and the police have exercised a certain sensible discretion before taking proceedings <e> <s> but as i understand it and the minister will correct me if i am wrong these penalties have always existed in this field <e>", "<cs> when the noble earl is doing that would he bear in mind that on the face of it there is room for the view that lord ross of marnocks itinerant

metal dealer but i think i am right in saying that <e>", "<cs> i should not have thought the reference to the itinerant metal dealer going from house to house collecting certain articles included the collection of old gold but i do not want to pursue the subject and merely suggest that when the noble earl is considering the matter he has regard to that as a point of view <e>", "<cs> surely if the ministers intepretation of the provisions is correct the government will take steps to remedy the position <e> <s> surely it was never intended that the activity by the farmers wife outlined by the noble lord opposite should be covered by the provisions <e> <s> that was not the purpose at all <e> <s> i very much doubt that the ministers interpretation is correct and that the farmers wife carrying out this activity in the countryside would be covered by the provisions <e> <s> but if that is the governments view will they not consider putting the matter right <e>", "<cs> i have listened with great interest to the noble earls reply to the suggestion that this clause should be dropped <e> <s> there is of course much force in his part about concern with the criminal fraternity in glasgow aberdeen and edinburgh and indeed elsewhere <e> <s> but the first thing that strikes me about that is that in the days when i was dealing in one way or another with the criminal fraternity especially in glasgow i was astonished at the number of that fraternity who when asked what their employment was replied that it was that of a window cleaner <e> <s> i never had the opportunity to ascertain whether or not these people held a licence for that occupation but i believe there is a certain amount of illusion as to the extent to which by imposing licensing provisions in this particular form one will bring the situation under better control <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a matter of great personal regret to me and it may be also to your lordships that i am not qualified nor equipped to follow the noble lord lord beloff into those areas on which he has touched in the course of his stimulating and reflective speech <e> <s> indeed the only point that i wish to make to your lordships is a short sharp political one of no great subtlety which i imagine will not commend itself a great deal to noble lords opposite or such of them as are still here when i come to it <e> <s> let me just say that if i take more than minutes to come to it i shall sit down and allow the debate to proceed <e> <s> but if i do come to it in under minutes i shall take just a moment or two to make it <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of the arguments which have been presented by the noble lords lord ross of marnock and lord underhill i am sure that the noble earl with his usual careful consideration of these matters will find it very difficult to resist this amendment <e> <s> i express the hope that he will accept it <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say that i find it highly unsatisfactory that the matter should be raised in your lordships house at this late stage and that it will be introduced by way of amendment in another place <e> <s> the noble earl has said that this house will have a full opportunity to discuss the matter when the bill returns from the other place <e> <s> i hope that that is indeed so <e> <s> i am in a little difficulty about this because at this hour of the night and on the noble lords amendment it is of course quite impossible to discuss this matter which is one of considerable concern to people in the country and one which this house certainly should discuss very fully if an opportunity is presented <e>", "<cs> although not sharing the understandable concern of the noble lord lord ross about the costs of police attendance at football matches share all the other views that he expressed in support of this amendment <e> <s> although i am not seriously concerned about the influence of marxism in scottish local government i agree also with what the noble viscount has said and i would support these amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may raise another point and perhaps to reassure the noble lord lord howie of troon in passing <e>", "<cs> my lords one would hope that the forces of law and order and law enforcement would have more sense than to prosecute in the instance he mentions <e> <s> if they did not have more sense than to prosecute then i should have thought they should not be in the business of prosecuting <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i should not have started to accept any responsibility for answering the noble lords question by way of preliminary <e> <s> my other point goes to the other end of the scale <e> <s> at one end of the scale is the lady impersonating mary queen of scots and the possibility of her facing the full penalties <e> <s> on the other hand more seriously one can envisage the consequences of one of these offences organising and carrying through a procession which had been forbidden it could cause very serious consequences and very serious public disorder <e> <s> it may be that at the two ends of the penalty scale are two things to be considered whether there is a danger in these provisions that you might pick out some relatively innocent young boy or girl who is just taking part in a gala performance and on the other hand some criminal person who had seen a procession through which had been forbidden and the consequences of which the scale of disorder damage to property and more or less serious injury to persons might require penalties even greater than those provided here if the offences were to be seen to be adequately reflected in the way in which the court had dealt with them <e>", "<cs> my lords i took little active part in the debates on this bill which has turned out to be such a useful one but i take credit for listening to practically all the debates we have had and i think the noble lord lord ross of marnock would concede that listening too can be a fine art <e> <s> i rise only to echo the words of the noble viscount lord thurso and his appreciation particularly of the readiness of the noble earl and the noble lord lord lyell to listen to the many suggestions that were made for the improvement of this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down could he answer this question <e> <s> i gather that he rejected to some extent the serious impact of this order on the rights of appeal of domestic house-holders <e> <s> there is no doubt that if somebody is concerned about his valuation he has the right to go to the valuation appeal committee but his right is exhausted once he has been there <e> <s> there is a significant number of ratepayers in scotland who have been dissatisfied with the decisions of valuation appeal committees who have taken the views of assessors rather than the views of appellants <e> <s> and they cannot appeal again <e> <s> this was provided for under the act <e> <s> as the minister will recall more clearly than do i because he has been concerned with it much more recently than i in the old days in scotland appeals took place as a matter of course every year year after year <e> <s> appellants went to the valuation appeal committees with the same grounds of appeal and to stop that abuse it was provided that the appeal should be restricted to the quinquennium <e> <s> you could go again at the second quinquennium <e> <s> there are many of those who feel aggrieved <e>", "<cs> is a substantial change of circumstances my lords i appreciate that <e> <s> the point is that the impact of this order will restrict the rights of some who would be waiting to appeal <e>", "<cs> my lords might i just apologise <e>", "<cs> my lords in spite of the weight which we would all surely wish to give to the views of the noble lord lord kearton which have just been quoted to us i and we on these benches would agree with the noble lord lord bruce of donington that the best thing the government could do would be to withdraw this bill and have another look at the problem <e> <s> i only hope that the noble lord lord bruce of donington will not regard this as something of a kiss of death coming from these benches because in my recent experiences in the hustings in hillhead my impression was that the mutual distaste of members of the labour and conservative parties is far surpassed by their distaste for the social democratic party <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to add my congratulations to those of the noble baroness lady elliot to the noble lord lord mishcon for his admirable presentation and clarity of explanation of the bill <e> <s> the only point on which i wish to touch is that of the circumstances by which scotland came to be excluded from the terms of measure and i ask lord mischon to believe me when i say that i do it with the greatest of reluctance <e> <s> i say that because i am one of those peculiar scotsmen who think that the scots on the whole are at their best when in partnership with the english in terms of the treaty of union <e> <s> i cannot speak for the other side of the partnership <e> <s> i am always conscious i was conscious of it when i was in government and i am equally conscious of it out of government that if one puts a strain on that partnership at however simple a level that is undesirable and the scottish dimension is in danger of becoming a bore to the english which is bad for the relationship <e>", "<cs> if the attitude of the government towards this provision is as the noble lord has explained it it baffles me why they do not accept the amendment <e> <s> if that is how they intend it to work as i understood the minister to say why not put it in the words of the amendment which are clear specific and detailed <e> <s> i do not always accept the more colourful expressions of my noble friend lord ross of marnock i can still call him my noble friend although i do not know what he calls me actually i do from time to time now that i think of it but when he said that this was not just bureaucracy run mad potentially but bureaucracy run dangerously mad i must say that i thought there was a great deal to be said for that <e> <s> i do not remember ever seeing it in a bill or an act of parliament before but what exactly is <e>", "<cs> i think it is a great pity that this amendment moved by the noble lord lord lovell-davis should have come so late at night <e> <s> i hope that the minister who will reply will in spite of the good-humoured observations of the noble lord opposite realise that there is in fact behind the thinking of those of us who most strongly support this amendment no party political thinking at all <e> <s> it does raise a question of fundamental constitutional importance the question of the control of the executive by parliament a matter on which i should have thought all noble lords opposite felt most strongly whether their party was in power in government or not <e>", "<cs> i certainly had amendment no <e> <s> very much in mind but not amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> however as i have said if the government show no sympathy to the arguments which the noble lord lord lovell-davis has presented in support of the amendment we may have to raise all these matters again as i think we would be able to do at a later stage <e> <s> i am sorry about this <e> <s> as the noble earl knows i am like the noble lord lord ross of marnock just a simple scotsman <e> <s> i did not realise that i had said anything that would upset him <e> <s> i always seem to be upsetting him and i really wish that i did not do so <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl <e>", "<cs> the noble earl said that he would answer with logic rather than emotion <e> <s>

interesting if he did <e>", "<cs> my lords before the debate in this house on this bill opened i did not have a single solitary word of consultation with the noble lord lord mackie of benshie <e> <s>

the noble lord lord mackie of benshie <e> <s> this bill like so many modern bills is in such terms that it is difficult to discern anywhere within or underlying its provisions any principle to attack

like will clearly require a deal of work on committee <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord the minister and the government have it in mind for the future that in the view of many against the background of the nurses claim to accord to judges an increase in salary of per cent <e> <s> is consistent neither with commonsense nor with justice <e> <s> will he bear in mind for the future the need for recognition of the fact that this kind of thing encourages militants and discourages moderates <e>", "<cs> we must all be most grateful to the noble and learned lord for all that he <e>",

irresistible <e> <s> i see no reason why a statutory protection for satisfactory <e>", "<cs> my lords i support this amendment <e> <s> the house is in debt to the noble lord lord beswick for his persistent pursuit of this theme <e> <s> to delegate to the executive a power to give directions <e>", "<cs> my lords i would echo the regrets expressed by the noble lord lord bishopston and concur in the observations of the noble lord lord tanlaw with regard to the difficulties of opposition spokesmen on technical bills of this kind <e> <s> my impression is that your lordships deliberations this afternoon have taken rather longer than had been anticipated <e> <s> with that in mind while saying that i like the bill no better now than we on this bench did when it started i shall content myself

noble lord the lord advocate and the noble lord lord skelmersdale <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble lord lord hughes is probably right in saying that the world will not come to an end whichever way this matter goes <e> <s> but surely the case made out in favour of the amendment by the noble lord lord campbell of croy the noble lord lord mottistone and the noble baroness was a formidable one <e>

mind as indeed i had not done <e> <s> but i must say having considered the arguments which he and his colleagues have put forward in supporting this amendment that i find it an impressive and formidable case <e>", "<cs> may i make one short point before the noble earl and the noble lord lord howie of troon express a view <e> <s> to some extent this may conflict with what the noble lord

knew when this debate started but having listened to the debate i find myself in some doubt <e> <s> the question is simply this is there anything in this amendment which would prevent an individual or a company who wished to employ a contractor who observed certain conditions for his workpeople with regard to membership of trade unions from doing so <e>", "<cs> before the noble and learned lord answers that matter further indeed i thought that he did say something about it i should like to focus his attention in particular on the provisions of subsection of the amendment which trouble me a little <e> <s> i have not had much time to think about it but it states <e>", "<cs> my lords lest the minister is not prepared to accept the view of the noble lord lord george-brown may i just say that as one by no means unfamiliar with the idiosyncracies of parliamentary draftsmen and in particular scottish parliamentary draftsmen i find it a little startling that the minister should suggest that any one of those is in this context a greater authority than the noble lord lord ross of marnock <e> <s> surely with that in mind the minister is bound to give way <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall say very little but i must certainly echo the words of the noble lord lord mishcon in expressing our gratitude to the noble lord lord wigoder for raising the questions arising on this altogether important and interesting royal commission report <e> <s> i shall say very little particularly because of course in this context i speak as a foreign lawyer <e> <s> indeed as a foreign lawyer unprompted i should not have ventured even briefly to speak in the house tonight <e>", "<cs> my lords it occurred to me a moment ago that with the noble lord lord mccarthy and the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter in alliance holy or unholy according to ones view there could be little hope for the amendment moved so effectively by the noble lord lord aylestone and the noble lord lord kilmarnock <e> <s> i say that about the alliance because i have always felt that if ever i were on the wrong side of the bar in a court of law and had a free choice of advocate i would have either the noble lord

local authorities in this context <e> <s> quite apart from that it is most unfortunate to put it at its lowest that this matter in the scottish context should have been dealt with in this way and that these amendments should he going through without any opportunity for your lordships house to discuss this matter thoroughly <e> <s> something i do not at all accept and i believe i am not alone in this is that the only way to regulate this matter in the scottish context is by a licensing arrangement such as that which is provided for here <e> <s> i listened to much of the debate in the house on the comparable english provisions <e> <s> i took no part in it for a number of reasons <e> <s> for one thing i felt that if the english felt they really wanted sex shops who was i to interfere with

the government should encourage them in scotland <e> <s> i suppose there has been commercial exploitation of sex all through society except perhaps in the more primitive societies <e> <s> there has

started i imagine in london <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord lucas of chilworth expressed reservations about the amendment on the ground that he had in turn reservations about the possibility of matters coming before your lordships house and the other place on which parliamentarians would not have a full understanding <e> <s> the noble lord shakes his head <e> <s> perhaps i misunderstood him and if so it is my fault <e> <s> i was merely about to say that if that were the consequence of this amendment being accepted it would not be the first time that such a situation had arisen where

situation under this clause and that of drunken driving or driving with an excessive amount of alcohol in ones blood and the use of the breathalyser <e> <s> for my part having listened to the debate i would certainly hope that the government would accept this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords not for the first time as oclock approaches having listened to a large number of interesting speeches on this

a party with a common interest one could adopt the pleadings and arguments of the other party and ask the court to accept them as repeated <e>", "<cs> i did not think that in introducing the amendment the noble lord lord bishopston was suggesting that the government were proposing to grind the faces of the poor and certainly i make no such suggestion <e> <s> if i may say so i can think of no one less likely to be concerned to grind the faces of the poor than the minister who has opposed the amendment <e> <s> i should have thought that there was everything to be said for an amendment to this effect not in order to prevent government or anyone else from grinding the faces of the poor but in order to avoid people feeling that perhaps advantage has been taken of them in the original agreement <e>", "<cs> i do not want to take a sledge-hammer to crack what might be a very small nut <e> <s> however will the minister correct me if i am wrong in thinking that in the kind of situations to which the provisions will relate it is reasonably foreseeable that one party to a written agreement may sign it apparently agreeing to the appointment of an arbiter and will not at all

with lord chalfont when he said that embarking upon a party political debate raking over the ashes of this particular matter would be indeed a sterile exercise <e>", "<cs> my lords i added my name to the list of those wishing to speak on this bill with more than usual reluctance not only because the bill as the noble lord lord elton has said applies only to england wales and northern ireland and

reinforce the point made by the noble lord lord foot that if certain other of your lordships agree and express appreciation at the noble and learned lords introduction of these regulations if i also agree then <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord lord lyell has finished with the interesting point raised by the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey and before he sits down i do not wish to join in any argument about compassion but i shall look forward to discussing the matter on some future occasion <e> <s> i could not raise any matter with the noble lord lord lyell because i was unable to obtain a copy of the order until two oclock this afternoon and i have been in the chamber since then <e> <s> i was a little bothered by the explanatory note which does not seem to explain anything <e> <s> i appreciate that the explanatory note does not form part of the order but it simply adds nothing at all <e> <s> the explanatory notes to many of the orders we debated earlier did add something particularly for the layman reading these matters for the first time perhaps <e> <s> valuation and rating are difficult and complicated matters and i submit for the noble lords consideration that he <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not blaming anyone but myself <e> <s> it was not available when i was last in the house <e> <s> i am not complaining about not getting it i was just explaining why i had not paid the minister the courtesy which lord mccluskey had of giving him notice of the points i was raising <e> <s> that was all <e> <s> i am not complaining <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord the minister for his explanation as for his explanation of the order <e> <s> may i reassure him that when i referred to the subject of compassion i was trying to be light-hearted i was not being serious at all <e> <s> but i find absolutely fascinating the competing claims of the labour and conservative parties to compassion especially as i have known them both for a long time <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not at all grudge the noble lord lord harris of high cross his fun at the expense of the social democratic party <e> <s> indeed it was good natured and here and there there may have been a point which all of us up here might well take to heart <e> <s> i was a little disappointed on the other hand when he suggested if i did not misunderstand him that we should be moving further in the direction of denationalisation and should be less concerned with the issues which as he put it lord taylor of gryfe has drawn our weary attention to <e> <s> of course we are much indebted to the noble lord lord taylor for moving his motion and although lord harris is apparently weary of those issues to which his motion refers we here certainly are not <e> <s> and why <e> <s> it is because it deals with the problems of the relations between her majestys government and the nationalised industries and if we did not know before we surely know now having listened to the speech of noble lord lord ezra that there is a problem that it is a perennial problem and that if we do not get it solved and solved soon it will become worse rather than better <e> <s> so let us not be weary about it <e>", "<cs> in spite of the discouragement of the minister may i try to make three short points in support of the propositions of the noble lords lord molloy and lord bruce of donington <e> <s> first surely if precedent is to be the test in these matters it is quite inappropriate <e> <s> i speak as a member of a profession which without precedent was frequently unable either to move backwards or forwards <e> <s> if precedent is to be the test it is quite the wrong test <e>", "<cs> my lords we mountaineers on this bench as i think we are now entitled to call ourselves if my title is perhaps not impressive that of the noble lord on my right carries a great deal of weight are not disposed more than most to disagree with one another but i disagreed with my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to say just a brief word about the scottish dimension of this problem <e> <s> i do not know whether i succeed in showing it but when your lordships are considering a problem which has a different shape or perhaps somewhat different aspects as between scotland and england i am always reluctant to raise the scottish dimension partly because as i have said before perhaps to the point of tedium i am a great believer in the anglo-scottish symbiosis <e> <s> when in discussions in your lordships house and perhaps in the other place as well one produces the scottish dimension one presents the minister concerned and perhaps ones colleagues with something of a distraction which may be irritating particularly for the minister <e> <s> he has enough to think of in the english dimension without these wretched people from the north introducing a new element <e> <s> i appreciate that the noble lord lord elton has no responsibility for the scottish situation and i did somewhat belatedly because i had not thought to take part in this debate inform the scottish office yesterday that i would raise some of the problems which are peculiar to that country <e>", "<cs> my lords as it is open to a convicted person to appeal against an unduly harsh sentence may i ask the noble and learned lord whether it would not be certainly more logical probably sensible and certainly promote confidence in the administration of criminal justice if the crown had a corresponding right to appeal against what might be regarded as a derisory sentence for any offence quite apart from the ones in this question <e>", "<cs> my lords may i revert to the noble and learned lords answer to the question i put with regard to appealing the question of sentence <e> <s> would he acknowledge that it is not only the country <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> if he is right that there is nothing open to criticism in the principle can he comment on the circumstance that when the matter was considered in the late s there was agreement between both front benches as to the need for the abolition of the hereditary principle <e> <s> at that time this was a matter of discussion between both front benches in the other place <e>", "<cs> my lords may i briefly accord a similar welcome from these benches as has been accorded by the noble and learned lord lord rawlinson of ewell and the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones to this very useful measure which has been gone into with such care and detail by the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor <e> <s> it is almost traditional in your lordships house when english lawyers rise to address your lordships on matter of scots law to say that they do so with the greatest trepidation <e> <s> that trepidation is as nothing compared with the trepidation felt by mere scots lawyers when venturing into this area <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness lady faithfull will appreciate why i do not at this late hour i should love to be able to do so although i would not do so as effectively as she has done follow her into some of the fields she has explored <e> <s> what emerges clearly at this stage is that there is no dispute about the need to call the attention of the government and indeed parliament to finding new ways of dealing with violent crime <e> <s> it is probably sensible to separate violent crime from the other fields of crime in this way because it is a special variety calling for special treatment and special care and a special and in some ways expert approach provided that it does not blind us to the fact that the non-violent crimes include a wide range of crime whose effects are often profoundly evil for the victim sometimes just as evil in their own way as are the crimes of violence <e> <s> however there it is it is crimes of violence that we are considering tonight <e>", "<cs> my lords not for the first time i agree with the noble lord lord stodart in saying that both the noble lord lord carmichael of kelvingrove and the noble lord lord gray of contin have earned our congratulations this afternoon <e> <s> i have known lord carmichael almost as long as i have known lord taylor of gryfe but as time has marched on i shall not indulge in any reminiscences about the personal relationships which we have <e> <s> we all hope to hear him on many occasions in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord the minister two questions <e> <s> first how does he meet the charge levelled by the convention of scottish local authorities that the cuts in rate support grant expose the hypocrisy of the government in relation to rates <e> <s> the government present themselves as the champions of the ratepayers on the one hand on the other they pursue policies which put pressure on councils to increase their rates <e>", "<cs> this amendment has already occupied a good deal of time and i hesitate to take up any more of the time of the committee <e> <s> however i find it quite astonishing having listened to the ministers reply that he has not received one word of support either from his side of the committee or from this <e> <s> the minister has not said that he will take the matter away and look at it again <e> <s> i agree with everything that in particular the noble lord lord hughes said in support of the amendment <e> <s> i find it surprising that in answer to what has been said on both sides of the committee the minister should apparently still be reluctant to have another look at the matter and that he is content to leave the bill with apparently an obligation on the secretary of state to consult the british tourist authority <e> <s> it is not enough to reassure us by saying that in the bill as it stands an implied veto is not left in the hands of the british tourist authority <e>", "<cs> my lords in that situation can the minister tell the house whether any estimate has been made of how prolonged or otherwise this litigation is likely to be and whether or not any action is open to them to expedite the matter <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the three noble lords who have spoken on this amendment for what they have said <e> <s> i thought that the noble lord lord howie of troon and the noble lord lord carmichael of kelvingrove were perhaps a little sensitive to the criticisms of my drafting which i thought was at least as comprehensive as what the draftsmen often produce for our delectation <e> <s> however the amendment as it stands was essentially as the minister said a probing amendment and in the light of what he has said and i hope he will give serious regard to what the noble lord lord howie of troon said <e>", "<cs> i had rather thought that i would withdraw at this stage <e> <s> i had overlooked the circumstance that the minister had not replied <e> <s> i am sorry <e> <s> i thought that we had been on these amendments for quite a long time <e>", "<cs> with the leave of the committee i shall in a moment beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> i am sorry i seem to have upset lord howie of troon in doing it too soon <e>", "<cs> there is no-one i should less like to upset because i have a great respect for the noble lord <e> <s> although i shall withdraw the amendment i should like to make it clear to the minister that in my fallible judgment he was wrong to suggest that giving people a discretion makes bad law <e> <s> half the had law we have emerges because we do not give people discretion but they have to stick to the letter and lose sight of the spirit <e> <s> having made my point that i am not impressed by that part of his argument in the light of what else has been said by the minister and by others who have spoken i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i too think that this is a wholly admirable amendment <e> <s> it is right in principle in the context of this bill that it should be there <e> <s> i think in practice it would make the working efficiency and competence of the various tourist boards and the british tourist authority better <e> <s> for that reason i hope the minister will accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord the minister earlier spoke a good deal about the need for cohesiveness and consensus <e> <s> that is a view with which none would disagree <e> <s> for my part i would have thought that this amendment would produce more cohesiveness and a more readily-reached consensus than the bill as it now stands under which the obligations to seek consent and to consult are all on the other side <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend lord mackie of benshie has said this bill albeit simple is of some importance to the people of scotland <e> <s> i would express the hope and if i were a praying man i would pray that the minister and the government will give the fullest and most careful consideration to what my noble friend said particularly in the opening part of his speech which surely went to the crux of the scottish housing problem <e>", "<cs> i too have listened to the ministers reply to the arguments presented in support of this amendment <e> <s> i listened particularly because of course what was said in support of the amendment was a considerable argument <e> <s> i was genuinely waiting to hear what the answer to these arguments would be but the minister has not told us anything at all that we did not know already <e> <s> we know that the original bill provided for a period of three years and that the bill before us reduces that period to two years but not a single word has been said to justify this change in answer in particular to the argument of the noble lord lord mackie of benshie but equally to that of the noble lord lord ross of marnock <e> <s> the matter therefore remains something of a mystery certainly to someone like myself who was simply waiting to hear the argument and reach a conclusion about it <e> <s> i think that the government have no answer to the arguments which have been put forward in support of this amendment <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to come in again but that is exactly the point which the minister has not faced up to <e> <s> he compares the situation with the situation of a tenant of a private house a sitting tenant buying and of course there would be some discount which would be acceptable in such a case <e> <s> but here the tenant has also as it were a statutory built-in-right <e> <s> you can lease a local authority house and have a statutory right to this extraordinarily large discount and this is something that the government must face up to <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment <e> <s> in the course of our discussions on this matter both during second reading and so far today a good deal has been said on behalf of the government about the position of a private tenant sitting on his lease and seeking to purchase the house of which he has the tenancy <e> <s> i should have thought that it would be quite a simple matter to put before the committee some evidence for example the views of valuers as to the kind of discount which would be regarded as appropriate within certain limits <e>", "<cs> i do not grudge the minister his party political fisticuffs with the noble lord lord ross of marnock they add to the general enjoyment of the scene <e> <s> i assure the noble earl lord selkirk that i am not at all emotionally involved in this in this context ones emotions do not get aroused a great deal <e> <s> however i was trying to find out on what basis and upon what principle of valuation if any the government proceeded in reaching the conclusion that these discounts were appropriate in this bill <e>", "<cs> as i listened to the argument of the noble lords lord ross of marnock and lord mackie of benshie and indeed the argument in his first speech of lord howie of troon the only thing i wondered because the minister is a kindly thoughtful minister and i am sure he listens to all the arguments and weighs them carefully was whether he would accept the amendment in the light of these arguments or at least say that he would take it away and look at the situation once again <e>", "<cs> i too agree and i was sitting wondering whether this would be the record when the minister accepted this very sensible suggestion <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the explanation which the minister has given to the committee and i am happy to ask for its leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> in view of what the minister has said why not insert the words proposed and put this matter beyond doubt <e> <s> i was tempted when moving my own amendment amendment no <e> <s> to go on to say in reply but because of the hour i resisted the temptation and kept quiet that one of the primary objects of legislation should be to enable people to avoid being involved in situations in relation to which the law is in any doubt at all <e> <s> what harm would it do to insert the proposed words and to put the matter beyond all doubt <e>", "<cs> i am really very unhappy with the ministers reply <e> <s> i should perhaps blame myself for not making the points in support of the amendment as forcefully and effectively as i should have done <e> <s> i am astonished at the ministers attitude which has led to the noble lord lord ross of marnock being so highly critical of him and i must say i sympathise entirely with the criticism which the noble lord directed to him <e>", "<cs> i hope that the minister will give serious consideration to this amendment <e> <s> after all here we are dealing with provisions entitling a tenant under a tenancy to carry out repairs to the property in which he is a tenant which the landlord is under an obligation to carry out <e> <s> the implications of this right at the beginning are considerable <e> <s> the legal implications are considerable <e> <s> the practical implications may very well be even more considerable and i would have thought that it was quite vital that regulations of this somewhat novel nature should be dealt with in accordance with the amendment rather than as is at present proposed under the negative resolution procedure <e> <s> i hope the minister and the government will give serious consideration to this more serious consideration than appears to me to have been given to many of the very sensible amendments that have been moved this afternoon and evening <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very glad indeed to follow the noble viscount lord ingleby and to have this opportunity to say that i agreed with what he said about this bill <e> <s> i ask your lordships to believe that i had really decided before this debate started that i should direct my opening remarks to the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby <e> <s> i now have some hesitation in doing that but i think i shall just stick to my guns <e> <s> the last time i had occasion to direct some indignation at the governments handling of the scottish end of the sex shops business i expressed myself frankly and strongly <e> <s> on that occasion the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby said as i understood him that he was surprised that any scotsman should be a follower of mrs mary whitehouse <e> <s> i want to begin by saying for the avoidance of misunderstanding in the future that i would regard my personal classification as a supporter of mrs mary whitehouse as if not a fate worse than death <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord will allow me to finish my sentence <e> <s> i shall then sit down and allow him to interrupt me <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord said nothing of the sort i apologise to him but usually i listen fairly carefully and this is what i thought he said <e> <s> all i want to make clear to him before we go any further in this debate is that i would regard my classification as a follower of mrs mary whitehouse as if not a fate worse than death something fairly close to it <e> <s> that is all i want to make clear and i apologise to the noble lord if i misunderstood him on that occasion <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby that the fact that he has never been in either a sex shop or a video shop and has never looked closely at videos and watched recordings does not disqualify him from making speeches on the matter <e> <s> however it should not surprise him if his refusal to look at real life makes those of us who listen give less weight to his judgments on the matter than we might otherwise do <e>", "<cs> my lords i have very little to say from these benches except to accord to this measure a very warm and wholehearted welcome and to express our appreciation of lord selkirks presentation and admirably clear explanation of the provisions contained in the bill <e> <s> the principle of the bill is admirable it is concerned with bringing the law into line with the reality of the social and legal position of women in who would want to quarrel with that <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord sits down may i tell him that i had the greatest difficulty today in getting a copy of the law commissions report <e> <s> i asked for it in the printed paper office and they were unable to trace it <e> <s> the request was put on the computer but defeated even that <e>", "<cs> my lords they were unable to give it to me <e> <s> i eventually told the noble and learned lords office and they finally gave me it but i did have difficulty <e> <s> on this occasion it was not my own stupidity <e> <s> they could not give it to me in the printed paper office and they could not trace it in the library <e> <s> i just thought that the noble and learned lord should know that as he commended that report <e>", "<cs> there might be one point which is worth clarifying <e> <s> in the course of his <e>", "<cs> before the minister replies to the mover and the supporters of this amendment i should like to say that i resisted the temptation to express the strong support which i feel for the amendment for a number of reasons <e> <s> in particular i resisted the temptation because and i must say this i think that a very formidable case was made out in the three speeches from this side of the committee by lord ross of marnock lord mackie of benshie and lord grimond it was so formidable that i should have thought it was unanswerable <e> <s> i thought it unlikely that the government would resist it <e> <s> i should have known better because they resisted the last amendment on the last bill before your lordships house but with a happy outcome showing the great common sense of your lordships house <e>", "<cs> again i find the ministers answer somewhat disappointing <e> <s> are we not in a new and special situation so far as the relations of local and central government are concerned <e> <s> i know that historically there have always been tensions i am not so naive as to be unaware of that <e> <s> but when there is a climate which is very akin to a cold war between local and national government would not a body of this kind have a very useful function to perform which the committee should consider very carefully before rejecting <e>", "<cs> i too shall await with interest <e> <s> i support these amendments because the clause unamended which is the basis of the bill focuses on bringing into perspective how utterly misdirected is the governments policy in this field <e> <s> a vast amount has been said on the subject in relation to the english bill a bill which produced something of a <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord the minister is to look at the matter again would he undertake to have regard to the circumstance that the matter has already apparently been the subject of litigation in england <e> <s> surely we should be legislating in such a way as as far as possible to keep the citizen out of the hands of the lawyers and to keep him out of the courts which have a great many other things to do <e>", "<cs> although i am prepared to lay as i think the phrase has it all lombard street to a china orange that i was born nearer to hampden park than was lord ross of marnock it is not my intention to lead your lordships across any of those fields on which lord ross has been playing tonight <e> <s> but i am impelled to say just a brief word because i have resisted the temptation during your lordships discussions on the last two amendments to express strong disagreement with lord ross of marnock <e>", "<cs> in the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i would have thought it inappropriate to link this question with the other matter that the minister was good enough to say he would consider <e> <s> i find it difficult to believe that the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby in suggesting this has reflected on the careful answer of the noble lord lord nugent of guildford to the very deliberate point of the noble lord lord monson <e> <s> in particular although theoretically a person charged in the circumstances outlined by lord monson might be liable to a fine of no court would consider imposing a fine approaching that figure <e> <s> in the part of the country where i have my legal being before fixing a fine the courts are bound and they are very conscious of the obligation to take into account the means of the accused <e>", "<cs> i have great sympathy with this amendment and with what the noble lord lord swinfen has said in support of it <e> <s> like the rest of your lordships i greatly enjoy the good-humoured scorn which the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby delights to direct upon what i think is coloquially called the morality lobby <e> <s> throughout history since the labouchere amendment and before that no doubt we as a nation have made ourselves look a little absurd from time to time with these great urgings which beset us to get after the evildoers and in the light of history we can see the absurdity of it <e>", "<cs> i was going to say shortly that i would oppose this amendment <e> <s> i think it illustrates what these committee debates on this bill have suffered from and that is someone on the other side not the non-liberal side but the side opposite to that on which the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby speaks with an equally vociferous voice in support of the reasonableness of the bill against that of the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby with the noble lord lord nugent of guildford in the altogether reasonable middle supported by the noble lord the minister <e> <s> at least that is how i see it because quite frankly i do not care whether or not the word censorship goes into the bill but if the choice is between what the noble lord lord houghton regards as censorship and the alternative then i am for censorship <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the minister will look carefully and sympathetically at everything said by the noble lord lord carmichael of kelvingrove <e> <s> it is clear that because of the practice of assessors anomalies have tended to grow up <e> <s> the noble lord confessed that the drafting of the amendment was not perhaps ideal but i hope that that will not blind the minister to the fact that clearly there are anomalies which need to be considered from the point of view of the humanity of the situation <e> <s> some steps should be taken to meet it <e> <s> i hope that the minister will not as he did on the previous amendment and on many other sensible and good amendments content himself simply with expressing sympathy but will undertake to do something about the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i too venture to hope that the minister will give the most sympathetic and careful consideration to everything that the noble lord lord mackie of benshie has said in support of his amendment <e> <s> all that is proposed is a very modest measure of if you like derating to an important section of the scottish working population <e> <s> i find it difficult to believe having read and carefully considered everything that the minister said in response to a similar amendment moved by the noble lord lord mackie at committee stage that he will find it possible to resist this one <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord carmichael of kelvingrove has said this little bill is the latest contribution to the development of that chapter of the law which started with the law reform limitation of actions act <e> <s> the house is much in debt to the noble lord for his presentation and explanation of the bill as was the other place in debt as far as the contribution of mr eadie who presented the bill there was concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i imagine that there are currently one or two areas of public concern in relation to which it might reasonably be said that the governments approach is wholly misguided and wrong <e> <s> so far as the actual provisions of this bill are concerned <e> <s> it would not be quite appropriate to say that of the government but certainly the presentation of this measure to this house on a friday afternoon is <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> if i suggested there was something sinister in it then i misled myself as well as the minister <e> <s> what i was suggesting was that it showed a wrong sense of priorities <e>", "<cs> i find the ministers reply to the argument of the noble lord lord plant in support of the amendment a little unconvincing <e> <s> i wonder whether she could elaborate on the circumstances in which it would be thought desirable for an officer who had exercised in the street this his most important function to change his mind and admit his mistake <e> <s> what is the situation too in the event of the arrest being wrongful which would give the arrested citizen a right to pursue an action for damages <e> <s> would this not leave a very unsatisfactory situation so far as any future action was concerned <e> <s> is the noble lord lord plant not indeed right in saying that his amendments would protect the interests of both the police and the public <e>", "<cs> surely the noble lord lord elystan-morgan has put his finger on the point when he says that the police officer is in a unique position which is surely lord rentons point <e> <s> i hope too that the noble lord the minister will have another look at this <e>", "<cs> i agree with everything which my noble friend lord grimond has said <e> <s> i shall not repeat what he said <e> <s> however i hope that the minister will consider most sympathetically what the noble lord lord graham of edmonton said in this context <e> <s> for the sake of brevity i shall ask the minister only one question <e> <s> precedents are not decisive or all-important but can the minister suggest to us any other situation in which parliament has enacted a statute which has established a body under the terms of that statute to carry out certain duties and functions and at the same time has been asked to empower the responsible minister to abolish it what is the phrase <e> <s> overnight <e> <s> that is not the phrase but the one i had at the back of my mind escapes me <e>", "<cs> i venture to say only that i hope the minister will consider this amendment somewhat more sympathetically than he did the previous amendment <e> <s> it may encourage him to do so if i say that i had a certain amount of sympathy with his reaction to the amendment proposing the abolition <e>", "<cs> i assure the noble lord the minister that i shall answer to anything <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord ezra said that the front bench opposite might well find boring the subject of infrastructure <e> <s> i imagine that not only the front benches but perhaps the rest of the house would find even more boring the subject of social stability and its retention or restoration <e> <s> we are all agreed that we are much in debt to the noble lord lord diamond for his presentation of this extremely wide motion <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl the minister aware that there is quite a widespread and i think well-founded feeling in the country which is this <e> <s> in the role which the government have adopted throughout this dispute and in the contribution or lack of it which they have made to its solution they have failed the nation <e> <s> this lies in the fact that their sole overt contribution and i stress the word overt has been repeated ministerial rhetorical denunciations of violence at the picket lines which no sensible person who is not in alliance with the scargill-mcgahey axis would deny <e> <s> instead the government have left it to the police who do not want the problem and to mr macgregor whose talents appear to lie in other directions to slog it out from week to week and month to month with the national union of mineworkers dominated by scargill and mcgahey <e>", "<cs> my lords i resist the temptation to follow lord mottistone into a detailed description of the last occasion on which i myself was submitted to the indignity of corporal punishment no doubt a well-deserved indignity <e> <s> i resist the temptation not least because i do not think that i can assert with the same confidence as had he that none of my several idiosyncracies may not be attributable to this experience <e> <s> i resist the temptation too to enter into the controversies which there have been between certain right reverend prelates and members of her majestys government for rather different reasons <e>", "<cs> my lords it just goes to show does it not that one is never too old to learn <e> <s> i had not appreciated that there was a process known to the law of either scotland or england as sepronounced seequestration <e> <s> i had assumed that it was simply the bbc news readers mispronunciation of the word sequestration <e> <s> i am glad to have my ignorance corrected by the noble and learned lord the lord advocate <e> <s> we on these benches accord to the bill a similarly qualified welcome to that expressed by the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey <e> <s> there is of course no doubt that the administration of the law in the context of bankruptcy and sequestration will be improved if and when as i am sure it will the bill becomes law <e> <s> for that reason alone it is to be welcomed <e> <s> i received yesterday morning three lengthy papers from the scottish law commission <e> <s> unfortunately i had other preoccupations yesterday and this morning which prevented me digesting them <e> <s> however i doubt when i have done so that they will greatly modify the qualified welcome that i accord to the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches we accord a virtually unqualified welcome to this measure <e> <s> it effects reforms of the law which are desirable and fills gaps in the law which is also necessary as well as desirable <e> <s> in this field it is difficult to achieve perfection <e> <s> one seldom does <e> <s> every reform produces its own particular problems <e> <s> no doubt at committee we shall be discussing many of the points of detail which will arise but in general the bill is wholly welcome <e> <s> the reports from which it proceeds are admirable and the scottish law commission is to be congratulated and the lord advocate also for the clarity and ability of his presentation of the bill to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords from this bench i express as it were the scottish interest and extend a welcome to these measures which is not surprisingly similar to that of the noble lord lord wigoder <e> <s> i always enjoy the statutory joke of the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones on these occasions about the importance of ensuring equality of benefit to scotland and to england <e> <s> this i do welcome <e>", "<cs> listening as i invariably do with immense interest to what the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey had to say on this <e>", "<cs> i appreciate of course for my part the force of the answer which the lord advocate has given and the arguments that persuaded the scottish law commission <e> <s> the only point i would make in reply is that of course one should have confidence that those administering these matters and considering these petitions for sequestration are fully alert to the dangers which may follow if they are too readily persuaded of the exceptional circumstances envisaged in the amendment <e>", "<cs> i wonder if i may add a word on this <e> <s> i am very glad that the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey <e> <s> raised this point <e> <s> it would be possible of course to give the jurisdiction in the matter to the sheriff principal if that were thought to be desirable <e> <s> that would certainly be less expensive than going to the court of session and almost invariably not invariably but almost invariably much quicker <e>", "<cs> the two speeches on this matter certainly were interesting but surely the outcome of this debate is very unsatisfactory <e> <s> we heard from lord mccluskey a classic presentation of the case for the complete abolition of government preferences and we heard the statutory reply <e> <s> i do not regard myself as an authority in this field at all but i was struck first of all by the fact that the lord advocate referred to the circumstance that the institute of chartered accountants of scotland have not agreed with the scottish law commissions recommendation that all government preferences should be swept aside <e> <s> that of course is perfectly true but the emphasis in the case of the chartered accountants of scotland was on the word all and the same applies to the lord advocates praying in aid of the cork report <e>", "<cs> i can understand why the noble and learned lord put down this amendment but surely this is a matter that would be best left to the discretion of the court <e>", "<cs> i have some difficulty in understanding why the noble and learned lord associates this amendment and its effect with the previous one <e> <s> i should have thought it was altogether sensible to put in the word material <e> <s> my recollection which may be wrong is that in earlier provisions on this very matter statutory provisions the word material appeared <e> <s> certainly in practice it was recognised that the change of circumstance should be a change of a material nature and not a minor <e>", "<cs> this amendment like practically all the amendments of the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey <e> <s> is very well founded <e> <s> the question is whether one should be more worried by the situation as it will be under the clause as drafted than one would be by the situation that will arise when lawyers start arguing about whether or not the conduct is reasonably related to the financial circumstances etc <e> <s> of the parties <e> <s> however i agree that the matter is worth looking at again and i hope that the lord advocate may perhaps do so and that something maybe drafted to assist the courts <e> <s> it may be that the situation would be better left as it is but it is certainly worth thinking about <e>", "<cs> i am very reluctant to introduce anything of a sour note at this late hour when everyone is anxious to proceed to the next business but i was very glad that the noble and learned lord the lord advocate added his last two sentences <e> <s> we have all expressed the utmost admiration for the scottish law commission but in the earlier part of the noble and learned lords reply i was beginning to wonder whether law commissions and other similar bodies are usurping the functions of government <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble and learned lord not agree that the statement and the issues which have been raised today upon it lend support to the view of the many in the country that the issue arising out of the miners strike is one which ought long ago thoroughly to have been debated in parliament <e> <s> since the fundamental issues involved are political issues is parliament not the place in which they ought to be discussed <e> <s> is the noble and learned lord aware that there is a widespread feeling in the country about this matter that the government have failed the nation and in particular that parliament ought to have been consulted at different stages as this deplorable chapter in our industrial history developed <e>", "<cs> my lords i content myself from these benches with simply saying that i agree with the noble lord lord ross of marnock that this has been a useful exercise that we have had a useful discussion on the provisions of the bill and that we are in debt to the noble and learned lord the lord advocate and to the scottish law commission for bringing it about <e> <s> i would merely add that i was somewhat touched that the noble and learned lord the lord advocate should express any thanks towards myself because i have really made very little contribution to the discussions which we have had <e> <s> however i have listened carefully and there is a lot to be said for listening as well as talking <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i would simply echo perhaps a little more briefly the welcome that the noble lord lord ross of marnock gave to the bill <e> <s> we had a useful discussion on it <e> <s> it improves the forms and to some extent clarifies the law relating to family affairs in scotland <e> <s> for that reason alone it is to be welcomed <e> <s> as the noble lord lord ross said we are in debt to the scottish law commission and to the noble and learned lord the lord advocate for his presentation of the bill <e> <s> there are some intriguing historical incidents behind the development of the law in this context but <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with great interest to the speech of the noble lord lord prys-davies <e> <s> i am sorry that i am not able to follow him in his theme but i hope that the minister in replying will have something convincing to say in response to the many matters which the noble lord raised <e>", "<cs> i support wholeheartedly the rejection of this clause <e> <s> i rise to do so with a degree of diffidence because of course the criminal jurisdiction with which i am familiar is foreign to that of the english <e> <s> perhaps my interest in opposing the clause might be said to be that if in what i imagine is the quite unlikely event of the government rejecting out of hand everything that has been said from the opposition front bench from these benches and above all from the cross-benches and insisting on this clause and in the unlikely event of your lordships also supporting it there is a danger it sometimes happens that if this becomes part of the english law and the administration of english justice in time those responsible north of the cheviots will emulate this thoroughly bad example <e>", "<cs> my lords it will be a serious reflection on the wisdom of the government if we do not have a significant response to the appeals which have been made in this debate by the noble lord lord kilmarnock himself and by the noble lords lord ennals lord porritt and the others up to and including the noble baroness lady darcy de knayth <e> <s> it will be a serious reflection if we do not have a significantly positive response from the government perhaps not tonight since that might be too much to expect but certainly before the matter is finalised <e>", "<cs> i support this amendment <e> <s> i take it that the minister will accept it in principle on a basis faintly similar to that on which he accepted the principle of the amendment moved by the noble lord lord meston earlier <e> <s> as i understand <e>", "<cs> arising from the reply of the noble and learned lord the lord advocate to the noble earl far be it from me to put the law back to or even to but i wonder whether the lord advocate has regard to the anxieties expressed in this context by the law society of scotland that the concept of associate introduced in the bankruptcy scotland act and now into the bill may not catch up on the existing concept of the old scots conjunct or confident person <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not delay your lordships for more than one or two minutes <e> <s> i want only to say that i share the fascination of the noble lord lord ross of marnock with these diverting formulae in accordance with which the aggregate amount of the rateable values are apportioned among the rating areas in scotland <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble earl could say a further word or two about the nature and extent of the consultations which have taken place on these instruments <e> <s> i gather from what he said that there were some reservations among tthe bodies <e> <s> can he tell us a a little more about that <e>", "<cs> my lords to reinforce the point that this is no laughing matter may i ask the noble baroness two questions <e> <s> first of all is she aware that the city of edinburgh which in the latter part of the th century was known as the athens of the north by the middle of the th century had become known as the city of the sacred dog <e> <s> secondly would she not agree that perhaps the most sensible imaginative and courageous thing that this government could now do with this problem is in the coming budget to impose a swingeing tax on dogs and say damn the doggy vote which of course has been the single biggest factor preventing this issue from being grappled with in the past years <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to intervene in this matter more particularly because i did not hear the initial presentation of this amendment <e> <s> unfortunately i was detained outside the chamber <e> <s> but may i just ask the minister if he has thought that it might be helpful and i put it no higher to consult with his noble and learned friend the lord advocate about this <e> <s> that is because the lord advocate carries or carried at one time the responsibilities in relation to the procurators fiscal who were in the same position and i think had to approve their appointment <e> <s> it is so long since i was concerned in the matter that i do not wish to pontificate but i should have thought that the lord advocate might be able to give some helpful advice as to his situation which would be relevant to the context of this amendment <e>", "<cs> as something of a silent observer of and listener to the debate so far on this bill i rise only to say that i do not know whether the arguments of the noble lord lord grimond and the noble lord lord howie of troon have impressed the noble lord lord gray but they certainly impressed me <e> <s> i hope that the minister will take a careful look at this matter with his lawyers and others <e>", "<cs> my lords so far in the debate one simple point has emerged with clarity that is that this bill enacted as i am sure it will be will see another chapter in a remarkable success story which began around years ago <e> <s> that success achieved from such simple beginnings is a fascinating tale and the noble earl lord ferrers touched upon it <e> <s> the achievement was of course the achievement of the founders the trustees the managers and the staff and was due to the thrift of the depositors <e> <s> so far as i am aware no group of political enthusiasts can claim any special credit in the matter at all <e> <s> we know that successive governments whig and tory i suppose and conservative and liberal and latterly labour governments have been concerned only to provide a statutory framework within which the banks could operate defining the duties of the trustees and the rights of the depositors and having provided that framework to modify it from time to time as changing social and economic circumstances made necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i should like to echo our thanks to the minister for repeating the statement <e> <s> it will of course do little or nothing at all to allay the acute anxieties among so many people in scotland if not indeed all ratepayers in scotland over the increasing burden of rates which they face <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord the minister sits down if i understood him aright he said that he regretted the feeling that we on these benches and i think that he suggested that this was true of members of the medical profession too felt that the government were mounting an attack on the prescribing practice of the profession <e> <s> if that suspicion is not justified why did he quote these rather absurd illustrations in response to the intervention of the noble countess <e>", "<cs> my lords my task in winding up this debate from these benches has been rendered much the easier by the speech just made by my noble friend lord winstanley <e> <s> as i listened to the debate i made up my mind that i would not shake indeed was incapable of shaking the conviction of the noble lord lord colwyn but it occurred to me that perhaps my noble friends speech had given the noble lord at least some food for thought <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always on the whole encouraging in your lordships house to speak especially at a fairly late stage in the debate as this is after someone like the noble lord <e> <s> lord beloff who comes out of his corner fighting and ready as it were to swim against what i think has been up to date the tide of this debate <e> <s> i say that particularly because i had thought prior to his speech that the truest words which have so far been spoken were said by my noble friend lord hutchinson of lullington when he said that there is nothing more to say meaning that it is impossible without repetition or to any purpose to add to the spate of words which has been spoken on this subject since <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister inform the house what is the size of the department at the disposal of the minister for sport and how those people occupy themselves in the context of this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps not surprisingly i do not entirely agree with the noble baroness lady hornsby-smith <e> <s> speaking only for myself on this matter i support without reservation or qualification the reasoned amendment in the name of the noble baroness <e> <s> beyond that i really have very little to say <e> <s> let me accordingly seek to justify my intervention in this debate because like a number of others who have spoken this afternoon and this evening i come from north of watford and even worse i come from north of newcastle <e> <s> when one gets up there near to the arctic circle we operate a system of local government which is foreign to that of england and wales <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to intervene because unfortunately i was unable to be present to hear the answer itself <e> <s> however as i understood the question of the noble lord lord ross of marnock he was asking whether the fatal accident inquiry could not be expedited <e> <s> is there any good reason at all in law or otherwise why that inquiry should not be expedited <e> <s> with great respect to the noble and learned lord the lord advocate he did not answer that question put by the noble lord lord ross of marnock <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> there was a time when i took what i think was the traditional lawyers view expressed by the noble lord lord campbell of alloway that referenda were not appropriate to our constitutional arrangements <e> <s> what converted me was the experience which some of your lordships will recall in and with the legislation for legislative devolution to wales and to scotland <e> <s> so far as scotland was concerned this was in the view of many of us a piece of that labour governments legislative folly which was not largely removed in scale or conception from <e>", "<cs> i rise only to observe that frankly i cannot understand the assertion of the noble lord regarding the salisbury and the carrington conventions to which he referred <e> <s> i tried to rise on this point at an earlier stage during the debate on the first amendment but obviously the committee had had enough and so i did not pursue it <e> <s> frankly i do not understand that assertion <e> <s> i think the noble lord is wrong about this <e>", "<cs> my lords with one point at least i have no difficulty at all <e> <s> that is to echo most warmly our congratulations and warm good wishes to the noble baroness lady cox on her first appearance at the dispatch box <e> <s> it worried me a little only in this way that she presented the matter with such clarity and conviction that i began to wonder whether i myself was quite right in what i was going to say <e> <s> certainly we all look forward keenly to her appearances at the dispatch box we would hope that she will as the noble lord lord stewart of fulham put it have better causes to advocate <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister complained about the lack of penetrating questions <e> <s> since he has failed to answer at least four penetrating questions may it ask him whether he is aware that there are a number of us from scotland who have what we consider to be penetrating questions and that we are refraining from asking them only because we are conscious that the house is anxious to get on with the arts and to be damned with the scottish philistines <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord campbell of alloway may have been right when he said that there were no unconstitutional implications in the provisions to which the noble lord lord hooson has referred in moving the amendment <e> <s> but the constitutional implications of these matters cannot be exaggerated <e> <s> the potential constitutional dangers cannot be exaggerated as i should have thought the noble lord lord hooson made perfectly clear in what he said in support of the amendment <e>", "<cs> if i may intervene again the noble and learned lord lord denning as one would expect because we all hold him in high regard and respect was perfectly right when he said that we can go to the courts to put ministers right <e> <s> but i should have thought that one of the tests of good legislation is the extent to which it minimises the necessity for going to court <e> <s> we lawyers are not inclined to discourage people from going to court <e> <s> certainly i do not remember it as one of my major concerns when i was young and in practice that people should be reluctant to go to court <e> <s> but one grows older and perhaps less enthusiastic about the prospect of going to court <e> <s> but one of the fundamental tests which should be applied to all legislation is will it reduce or increase the necessity for submitting to the laws often delays <e>", "<cs> in giving notice of my intention to oppose the motion <e> <s> that this clause shall stand part of the bill my object is to exclude scotland from the operations of the bill <e> <s> i will speak to clause and also to my amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to interrupt the minister but it is not clauses and <e> <s> i explained that there was a misprint and that amendment no <e> <s> should read at the end and insert and not and <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the minister for his careful reply <e> <s> he was good enough to say that my motion had been presented succinctly but apparently not sufficiently succinctly to enable him to understand what at the outset i was getting at <e> <s> it is for your lordships to say whether that was due to a lack of clarity on my part or to a bit of obtuseness on his <e> <s> but one of the questions i was asking and i am not satisfied with the answer which the noble lord has given was why the government could not have applied themselves to the problem of continuing the elimination by voluntary means in the time which has been taken up with the preparation and presentation of this bill <e> <s> after all it will be some time before the bill is passed by this house receives royal assent and is eventually brought into effect <e> <s> one question i wish to ask is why was the time not used to press on with the elimination by the voluntary process <e>", "<cs> i am not surprised by anything in the sphere in which we operate in the palace of westminster <e> <s> i was very nave when i first came here <e> <s> i am still nave but not all that much <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw at this stage my opposition to clause but i shall certainly raise it again at the next stage of the bill <e> <s> i shall not move my two amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords does it not occur to the minister that people in the real world outside this house will find vast amusement in the conservative and labour parties accusing one another of giving jobs to the boys <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i am right in saying that it has been made known in your lordships house in the mysterious way in which these important matters are made known that it should not be customary for more than one speaker after a maiden speech to express his congratulations and good wishes to the speaker <e> <s> i hope your lordships will forgive me if i make an exception in this case <e> <s> i have known the noble lord lord morton of shuna over these last years and i have always had the highest regard for his personal and professional ability and integrity <e> <s> he talked about the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey and of course the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey was a great advocate <e> <s> he is now a judge <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i should like to apologise to the house and to the minister <e> <s> i was a little impatient in view of the time factor and i neglected to refer to this matter <e> <s> i wish to ask the noble lord whether he was aware of the great concern which the retail consortium has expressed about the detail of the bill <e> <s> the retail consortium represents some per cent <e> <s> so it says of retailers in the united kingdom <e> <s> it is known that the concessions in the bill will amount to about per cent <e> <s> of the total bill in the commercial sector <e> <s> the concern of the retail consortium is that the impact so far as the retail trader is concerned will be even less <e> <s> i have a number of figures which i received from the consortium this morning and i had intended to put them to the minister <e> <s> i should simply like to ask whether he can tell the house that he is aware of the consortiums extreme concern and its rather pessimistic assessment of the governments proposals in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the point that has been raised can the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords i wanted to ask the minister to give an assurance to the house <e> <s> the suggestion has been made that in the context of this amendment the word may makes the provision mandatory <e> <s> i think we need some assurance about that <e>", "<cs> i share the disappointment of the noble lord lord ross of marnock that the government have not shown themselves to be a little more flexible in their approach to these amendments <e> <s> indeed my amendment no <e> <s> was designed to achieve more or less the same object as the amendment moved by the noble lord lord morton of shuna <e> <s> but against the whole background which was reviewed so effectively by the noble lord lord ross i should have thought that surely there was something to be said for extending this power into the future rather than pleading flexibility as a reason for doing nothing <e>", "<cs> i did not rise to my feet after the noble lord lord morton of shuna moved the amendment because i was as certain as one can ever be that the government would accept it <e> <s> i find their response utterly astonishing and the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will surely be in debt to the noble and learned lord the lord advocate for his careful and thorough presentation of this remarkable bill <e> <s> perhaps i may start where the noble lord lord morton of shuna finished <e> <s> i do not disagree with him but i have some reservations about the plea for more and more judges <e> <s> my experience has tended to be that judges and lawyers share the same occupational disease as so many other professional and other bodies <e> <s> their answer to every problem which is presented is more resources <e> <s> more resources always means more money and more people and sometimes they are not always available <e> <s> this is merely a reservation <e> <s> the noble lord lord morton may be absolutely right <e> <s> i am not in touch as he is with what is going on in the court of session and with how overworked they are <e> <s> however whenever i hear this plea i have reservations because it is the plea which i imagine over the centuries and certainly over my lifetime has always been presented to those who complain about the laws delays <e> <s> the matter of the laws delays has been one of my hobby horses for many years <e>", "<cs> my lords to follow what has just been said by the noble earl who has just sat down i think it is a great pity if the issue is polarised on the question of whether or not corporal punishment should be abolished <e> <s> the bill is the governments response to the decision of the european court <e> <s> for myself i do not think the decision of the court was absurd i do not think it was nonsense <e> <s> i think it was just mistaken <e> <s> from my study of the reports of the commission and the judgment of the court the mistake which the court made may have been and i put it no higher than this because i was not there contributed to by the inadequacy of the case which was put before it on behalf of the british government <e>", "<cs> my lords we scots are a broadminded people even the lawyers among us and we welcome the english i was about to say foreign intervention into this little scottish matter <e> <s> any step in the direction of reducing the laws delays is surely at first sight to be welcomed and indeed this particular step is welcomed from these benches because delay is perhaps the most significant problem of the law which bears so hard upon the people who are involved with it <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be indebted to the minister for repeating this quite detailed statement on a matter which has understandably caused so much public concern <e> <s> i begin by saying that i share the hope expressed in the conclusion of the statement that the governor and staff of glenochil will be left to get on with their difficult and demanding task and that the institution will be afforded an opportunity to settle down after these unfortunate events <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down i wonder if he would tell me if i was correct in thinking that he was asserting that it was sensible for government to surrender their fundamental responsibilities to bodies such as the top salaries review body <e>", "<cs> i believe that i can assist the noble lord <e> <s> i should have said that my first draft of this amendment and the responsibility for it is entirely mine and no one elses was very confusing <e> <s> indeed when i first saw it reproduced last night

working alone to fall into traps <e> <s> i apologise for that <e> <s> a correction has been made and amendment no <e> <s> has now been starred on the marshalled list <e> <s> i should have mentioned

consideration that he has given to the matters which i have raised <e> <s> i am particularly encouraged by his assurance that the government are carefully monitoring the working of this all-important act <e> <s> i hope that they will continue to do so and that a good relationship will be established between his office and bodies such as the scottish womens aid which is as i have already said much involved in the practical working of the act <e> <s> however in the light of what has been said i ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble and learned lord the lord advocate for the careful consideration he has given to these matters <e> <s> i shall read what he has said with some interest and give further consideration to it and if so advised i may raise this question again at the next stage <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i support this amendment wholeheartedly and share the hope of the noble lord lord morton of shuna that the lord advocate and the government will give it most sympathetic consideration <e>", "<cs> i do not know what the noble lord lord morton feels about being accused of good intentions

noble and learned lord the lord advocate for his reply <e> <s> i am always uneasy when in situations of this kind questions of high constitutional principle are raised <e> <s> it may be that in presenting my amendment i overstated the case in its favour <e> <s> that may well be so <e> <s> if i did it was in part because what i have read of the exchanges which have taken place between the crown office and womens aid and what i have read of what was said in the other place has left me with the impression that government as represented by the crown office and certainly this letter to which i have referred very much gave me this impression and the crown office in particular which are closely involved did not appreciate the difficulties derivng from this discretion and from the operation <e> <s> having the background of the old traditional police approach to matrimonial disputes and the lord advocates guidelines i had felt that all was well <e>", "<cs> i also put my name to this amendment and i support it <e> <s> i do not regard it as a matter of great importance or as one which need take up much of your lordships time <e> <s> but on the face of it i felt that it was difficult to understand why if under our peculiar system of concurrent jurisdiction between the sheriff court and the court of session in civil matters parties chose to go to the court of session the

"<cs> i must ask your lordships to reject this amendment <e> <s> certainly so far as the approach of the scottish law commission is concerned their experience is not in accord with the suggestion of

lordships but i propose to approach the questions that it presents in a slightly different way <e> <s> in every corner of human affairs there are those who regard a change for the better as a contradiction in terms <e> <s> for that reason i have more than usual sympathy with the government and the lord advocate in their approach to the problem <e> <s> i say that because of course the scottish legal profession arguably at least has its fair share of people who approach change in that way <e> <s> as i say for that reason and for a number of others to which with a little hit of luck i shall shortly come i approach the question of whether these fundamental changes in our legal aid scheme now proposed in the bill are for the better or are an unnecessary step in the wrong direction

the discussion on this group of amendments the noble and learned lord the lord advocate will inform the house that he will look again at the structure of this board which apparently has caused a good deal of disquiet <e> <s> i said on second reading and with a bit of luck i may even have made it clear that i have a certain sympathy with the problems with which in this context of legal aid in scotland they have to cope <e> <s> i cannot agree with the view that the previous administration of legal aid in scotland since and i was off and on in close touch with it did not from time to time give grounds for disquiet which was expressed quite rightly by members of the public and occasionally by some lawyers <e>", "<cs> does the noble and learned lord recall whether the bill had many unqualified friends when it was first introduced <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble and learned lord the lord advocate to assure the house that he and his right honourable friend the secretary of state

lord perry presented the bill to your lordships and also by the good humoured but at the same time serious speech of the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby <e> <s> i hope that your lordships will seriously support this bill because of course it restores your lordships house to the traditional position from which it was dislodged only in or by that wicked earl lloyd george when he said in those immortal words which i need not repeat to your lordships that this house was no longer the watchdog of the constitution <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord the minister acknowledge that the situation disclosed both by the reports in the press and by the statement made today that what is now required to satisfy those both within the house and the public outside is not just some sort of inquiry as the minister suggested but a most thorough and comprehensive inquiry which will make the position and the responsibility for that position clear beyond peradventure <e>", "<cs> i have listened with enormous interest to everything that has been said from all sides of the committee <e> <s> i do not propose to take issue with any part of it <e> <s> however i felt that rather than stay silent on these benches in the face of the attack which has been made i should confess that i find the situation paradoxic <e> <s> as i understand it unless my researches have led me astray this provision derives from section of the legal aid scotland act which was passed by a government of which both the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones and myself were members <e>", "<cs> i find this provision somewhat puzzling and i hope that the lord advocate will be able to explain it <e> <s> the situation at least some years ago when i was last involved was that legal aid was immediately available before an accused appeared and tendered a plea <e> <s> there may be some technical explanation but it is difficult to comprehend what it might be <e>", "<cs> i had not expected a great deal of support <e> <s> however i am interested in how often the noble lord lord morton of shuna has complained at not having been given any evidence about shortcomings and abuse in the working of the legal aid scheme in the past <e> <s> i shall take the opportunity of telling him something of my experience of that over the last few years but not tonight <e> <s> third reading may present the appropriate opportunity <e>", "<cs> my lords by way of preface to his admirable and much admired presentation of the review of the motion that is before the house the noble lord lord marshall of leeds

know that in the situation in which i find myself at this moment i am reminded of nothing so much as the strength and influence of the sergeant-major <e> <s> your lordships will remember how he used to call for volunteers in terms which implied that you were bound to respond and there was trouble if you did not and that was it <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will have his fun <e>", "<cs> my

would be crazy to rush it through <e> <s> how detached from reality is that approach to this important matter of government <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord lord galpern sits down perhaps i may pursue two points he raised in his speech <e> <s> he said that he was glad to see that i was in favour of a public local inquiry <e> <s> if i gave that impression i failed to express myself with clarity either because like the noble lord lord galpern i am getting old or perhaps because of the lateness of the hour i was anxious to say what i had to say as quickly as possible <e>", "<cs> my

lawyers would have a majority <e> <s> i said that there would be a majority with a professional interest <e> <s> the person with the experience of the practice and procedure of the court is a clerk of

independence not in relation to the secretary of state but in relation to other interests <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of what has been said i assume that the noble and learned lord the lord advocate will give an undertaking to look again at this matter <e> <s> for my part and from these benches i hope that he will do so and that he will look in some depth at the position of the lord chancellor in

point <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say that i share the concern of all of those who have spoken in favour of this amendment about the lord advocates refusal to accept it or his resistance to it <e> <s> at the same time in the light of the somewhat extreme statement which the noble earl made about the department i understand his anxiety <e> <s> we all have anxieties <e> <s> the departments of the scottish office have always had a part to play in the administration of justice <e> <s> the scottish courts administration was set up by the then government in with the object of making the administration of justice more effective and more efficient <e>", "<cs> my lords i take it that it is not intended that the person concerned in this unfortunate situation should be entitled to legal aid in the event of his having come into a fortune in the meantime or perhaps having won a large premium bond prize or having done something as undignified as winning the football pools <e> <s> i take it that there would have to be a proviso to cover that sort of situation <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will allow me <e>", "<cs> my lords i was going to say that <e> <s> i just thought that i

disturbing because it does not meet at all the point on the basis of which my noble friend presented his amendment to the committee <e>", "<cs> my lords unhappily i was unable to be present either during second reading or at the committee stage of this not unimportant bill <e> <s> i must say that i came here this afternoon expecting a sympathetic warm and more considered response to a number of amendments which have been put down including the present amendment <e> <s> i found the ministers reply not only to the presentation of the amendment by the noble lord lord carmichael of kelvingrove but also to the question asked by my noble friend lord mackie of benshie a moment or two ago profoundly unconvincing and certainly disappointing <e> <s> it suggests to me if i may say so without offence that the minister is unwilling to open as the noble lord lord mackie of benshie hoped he might either his heart or his mind to this matter which is so important to the housing associations

around the scottish office will give due weight to these criticisms <e>", "<cs> my lords so far we have had an interesting debate <e> <s> i venture to say that it will probably become even more interesting when the minister replies to at least half of the very pointed questions put to him by the noble lord lord hooson <e> <s> i hope he will have already applied his mind to that <e>", "<cs> to an elderly scots lawyer like myself it is a matter of great encouragement that so alert and fertile a mind as that of the noble lord lord morton of shuna has been applied to the problem not merely of keeping the law of scotland in line with that of england but ensuring that our law in the criminal context does not fall behind <e> <s> i gathered from part of what he said that that results in the possibility of large or small numbers of insider dealers seeking refuge for their activities in scotland at any time <e>", "<cs> i should be very grateful if the noble lord would also let me have a

that i was not suggesting that there was anything improper in the course which was adopted <e> <s> i was suggesting and i suggest again that the somewhat comic opera situation which had developed and

lord lord campbell of alloway and i see great force in his argument <e> <s> i take his point that as a matter of correct drafting it would have been better if amendments nos and which are the ones with which we on these benches are principally concerned had gone in under the exception clause clause <e> <s> however so far and i hope the minister agrees this has been a useful preliminary discussion of the immensely difficult problem of dealing with students in a bill of this kind <e>", "<cs> i find myself still a little uncertain as to the extent of the ministers commitment <e> <s> at one stage i understood him to say that he would not go the whole hog meaning amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> as i understood it he rejected them outright <e> <s> later he said he would commit himself to a full and thorough consideration of everything that had been said <e> <s> this leaves me in a little doubt as to the extent to which he is prepared to commit himself <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say from these benches that i find that reply very disappointing <e> <s> it may be that there is some exaggeration in the reports which have been in the press <e> <s> newspaper reports are not infrequently exaggerated <e> <s> however one does not need to be an alarmist to be aware that the fears that have been expressed in this context are real <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to press the minister on this matter <e> <s> i quite accept as i thought i made clear that there is a possibility of exaggeration <e> <s> i know that the minister has had a hard time this afternoon and he has coped magnificently <e> <s> my point was that even if such views are exaggerated can the minister justify the refusal of this amendment as a safety net for a situation which many people in the field think is unlikely to arise <e>", "<cs> i sympathise with the purpose of this amendment although i am intrigued by the form it takes <e> <s> i confess that when i first read the bill the expression solely or mainly resident did not greatly trouble me <e> <s> i felt that it was something which would be easily understandable <e> <s> however as i spoke with others more learned in the law than i and more concerned in these matters i found a considerable concern about the meaning of that expression <e> <s> when i reflected upon it that concern became understandable <e> <s> they asked whether some people being solely resident in the area of a local authority precludes the idea of residence in another area for part <e>", "<cs> at first sight i should have thought that that was right <e> <s> i hope the government will accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> i listened to the ministers reply with fascination <e> <s> my only regret is that the committee is not as full as it was earlier <e> <s> that reply <e>", "<cs> my friend lord mackie of benshie whose name appears on the marshalled list in support of these amendments has asked me to express his regret to the committee and to the noble lady lady saltoun since he is unavoidably prevented from being present tonight <e> <s> i express a similar regret for i am sure he would have lent his support to the principle of these amendments with much more robust vigour at this time of night than i find myself capable of commanding <e>", "<cs> i knew that but if i had known that the noble lord lord morton of shuna would intervene i would not have said that <e> <s> we of the older generation must have our fun it must not he taken too seriously i merely wanted to make a point <e> <s> in any event on behalf of my noble friend lord mackie of benshie we on these benches support the principle of the amendments and hope that the government will respond with an appreciation of the problems which these matters present <e>", "<cs> i support this amendment without qualification <e> <s> of the three amendments referred to by the noble lord lord morton of shuna clearly amendment no <e> <s> puts the matter in the best drafting state <e> <s> indeed as i look at the amendments i wonder why on earth when i drafted my own amendment i took the rather legalistic line of simply scoring out the words jointly and <e>", "<cs> i should like to make it clear to the noble and learned lord that that was one of the difficulties to which i referred when i said that the clause adds a number of unnecessary problems <e> <s> i did not go into detail but that is only one of them <e>", "<cs> i listened very carefully as i always do to what the noble and learned lord the lord advocate said in reply to this amendment and i found it more than usually unimpressive <e> <s> i shall certainly read and consider what he said before putting down a similar amendment at report if by chance the noble lord lord morton of shuna withdraws the amendment to which he has spoken <e>", "<cs> not for the first time i agree entirely with the noble lord lord ross of marnock <e> <s> everything that can be said in this context has been said <e> <s> i rise only because if i heard him aright the noble lord lord campbell of alloway mentioned amendment no <e> <s> which is in the names of the noble lord lord kirkhill and myself <e> <s> i had thought the amendment was grouped with the amendment of the noble lord lord henderson of brompton and others but in todays list it is not so grouped <e> <s> rather than take up even a moment of the committees time when amendment no <e> <s> is called i will simply draw it to the attention of the minister <e>", "<cs> in view of what has been said on the subject of rebates is not part of the difficulty that much of the growing concern about this bill which has been heard not only in scotland but also in england concerning its effect on the most vulnerable members of society stems from the fact that we have no clear indication of how the rebate system will work <e> <s> that is of great importance in the immediate context of this bill for the people in scotland and england who are waiting for it <e>", "<cs> i certainly support this amendment <e> <s> fortunately the noble lord lord kirkhill has dealt with the matter so fully that all i need to say is that i share entirely his anxieties about this whole matter <e> <s> no doubt we will have an opportunity of discussing it more fully when we deal with clause <e>", "<cs> i found the ministers answer on the amendment of the noble lord lord ross of marnock singularly unconvincing as with the one before <e> <s> it is not enough for the minister to say that he is puzzled by what the noble lord is getting at <e> <s> i have found some of his replies either ingenuous or disingenuous i am not quite sure which <e> <s> in embarking on the absurd scheme of this bill the committee is entitled to know what kind of assessment of this problem the government made before they embarked upon it <e> <s> surely it is the job of government to assess these kinds of problems and decide whether they form a barrier to going in a certain direction <e>", "<cs> i find the words that the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter has addressed to the minister convincing evidence as convincing as anything we have heard from this side of the <e>", "<cs> we could go on all night saying on one side that it is a property tax and on the other that it is not a property tax <e> <s> to me it is perfectly clear that it is a tax on property <e> <s> the noble lord lord sanderson said that he could not understand why there was any objection to calling it a standard community charge <e>", "<cs> i am surprised that in view of the pointed remarks made by my noble friend lord mackie of benshie and the noble lord lord morton of shuna no one rose from the other side of the house to defend this clause <e> <s> of course the essence of the clause as it is put is that this government have an unfortunate tendency every now and then to throw money at the wrong people <e> <s> i am not in favour of governments throwing money about at all but if they must do it they should not throw the money at the wrong people <e>", "<cs> on the last occasion that the question of refuges was raised i understood the minister to say that the position of refuges operated by womens aid associations in particular would receive the most sympathetic consideration and that we could expect something at a later stage in the bill which quite clearly met the gravamen of their concerns <e> <s> that was my clear understanding of what the minister said on that occasion <e>", "<cs> i hope that i am not in error <e> <s> according to my grouping it is amendments nos <e> <s> za a b c a and b <e>", "<cs> i am conscious of the paper myself <e> <s> the idea behind this group of amendments derives from the view of those of us on these benches that the collective community multiplier is unworkable and unfair as currently defined <e> <s> the effect of the amendment would be to move away from the idea of the multiplier <e> <s> the logic behind the amendment is that if landlords are obliged to keep a detailed record of the amounts received by them in collective community charge contributions from residents they should merely pay that precise amount to the levying authority <e>", "<cs> according to the grouping which i have it includes amendment no <e> <s> a <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that the minister has convinced me that certainty in the context of these amendments will be achieved by the provisions of the bill as they stand but i am most grateful to him for the very careful and detailed reply which he has presented to the committee <e> <s> i will not say that i shall read it with pleasure because i get less and less pleasure out of reading anything to do with this bill but i shall certainly read it with interest and come back on these matters only if i think there is no escape from doing so <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> if this debate is not going to come to an end soon perhaps there should be a provision that if one has a conscientious objection to disclosing ones age one does not disclose it <e> <s> then we could have a tribunal to add to the bureaucracy to certify whether the objections were conscientious or not <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the minister agree that unemployment makes it more difficult for those on the bench any bench to deal with crime <e> <s> in the old days one could say to these young people in particular if you find yourself a job and keep out of trouble i will defer sentence for six months or put you on probation and so on <e> <s> today if you say that from the bench they just laugh at you because they know that jobs are very difficult to find <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not think that perhaps a nod would be as good as a wink to a blind horse and could he send a note of these exchanges to british telecom and tell it to consider them <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the minister for his careful reply to these two amendments <e> <s> i do not know whether what he has said will allay the anxieties that have been expressed to us in the real world outside <e> <s> but this adds to my anxieties because all these prescriptions are to be subject to the negative resolution so that they can always be changed <e> <s> i am sure that the present government would never depart from any undertaking which they have given and which has been given in particular in your <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> i can understand the attitude of government in relation to certain of the aspects of the revenue laws having a preference for the civil approach and so on <e> <s> but i think it is a mistake in the context of this bill which has been described in a great variety of ways particularly by lord ross of marnock <e> <s> i have in mind especially when the registration officer has designated the responsible person <e> <s> i think the description of the noble lord lord kirkhill of this as an erroneous conception was an understatement if one thinks of the situation in which it is likely to happen <e>", "<cs> once he has read the bill he will be looking for a solicitor and no doubt in many cases will have to apply for legal aid <e> <s> it will all be great fun for the lawyers <e>", "<cs> it may be that this amendment is acceptable to the government <e> <s> however i should not wish the minister to think that those of us who are concerned about the position of womens refuges find that it makes any great contribution to solving the problem <e>", "<cs> i see that the amendment of the noble lord lord burton is grouped with amendments nos <e> <s> and in the names of myself and my noble friend lord mackie of benshie <e> <s> all i proposed to say about them was that they are two niggling little amendments which only lawyers could think of <e> <s> i should have thought that of the possible <e>", "<cs> i shall have to read what the minister said <e> <s> as i said i thought it was a simple matter over which only lawyers would niggle <e> <s> however i will read what has been said and see what i make of it <e> <s> in the meantime i shall not be moving my amendments <e>", "<cs> as the committee knows clause gives effect to schedule of the bill <e> <s> as i read schedule it is just about the last straw <e> <s> there are probably one or two more but this is the last straw in this bill <e> <s> it is a matter on which the government are open to serious criticism <e>", "<cs> we have had a full discussion <e> <s> i am sorry if the gravamen of my attack on the substance of the schedule was not expressed with sufficient clarity to convince the minister or the noble lord lord sanderson <e> <s> i shall not try to remedy that now <e> <s> in view of what has been said from all sides of the committee i shall not withdraw my motion that clause should not stand part of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords it is of great encouragement to those of us on these benches who are so opposed to this wretched bill that the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter should pray in aid the case of the old widow compared with others because he is quite right about that <e> <s> the noble lord is one of the few members apart from one or two scottish peers on the other side who has come to the aid of the minister when these matters have been discussed <e> <s> this bill will help the old widows and the old-age pensioners in a similar position relative to the large families next door all of whom are wage earning <e> <s> but that is about the only good thing that there is to be said about it <e>", "<cs> my lords this is report stage <e> <s> perhaps we could have some guidance on the number of occasions upon which noble lords may speak <e>", "<cs> my lords i find the ministers answer very puzzling <e> <s> he is suggesting that there is no point in throwing a lifeline to a chap who is not in difficulty <e> <s> but if half the local authorities that will be affected by this measure are saying that if you do not throw a lifeline you may get into difficulty would it not be prudent to accept the amendment and throw the lifeline <e> <s> what harm can it do <e> <s> if at the end of the day the minister is able to say to those of us who have been critical of the time that this bill will take i told you so we shall not blame him at all <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with great interest and very attentively as i always do to everything that the minister said <e> <s> however i thought there was much wisdom in what was said by my noble friend lord taylor the noble lord lord howie of troon and others who spoke in favour of the amendment <e> <s> i am sorry that the minister gave it so little consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords i am satisfied that this bill could be the subject of a simple referendum question which the scottish people have sufficient wisdom to answer after listening to the arguments for and against it <e> <s> entry into europe was a much more complicated business <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the minister for his careful explanation <e> <s> i am very conscious and was very conscious even before the noble baroness spoke that the drafting of the amendment raises questions <e> <s> perhaps i made a mistake in putting it in this form and i apologise to the minister for that <e> <s> it may be that i should have taken time and considered with others the possibility of meeting the kind of points which i was fully conscious of right at the beginning <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister intrigued me by suggesting in response to the point made by my noble friend lord mackie of benshie that it is possible to dream up all kinds of complex scenarios <e> <s> the complexity of the social lives of the wives and families who resort to these refuges is not a dream it is for them the reality or as my noble friend lord taylor of gryfe has said a nightmare <e> <s> that is the reality <e> <s> i am profoundly disappointed by the ministers response to the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for his explanation and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i support this amendment from these benches <e> <s> it may be for the convenience of the house if i speak also to amendment no <e> <s> and the other amendments in my name which are grouped together with this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i understood that further interventions by members of the house could be made only with leave <e> <s> that seems to have been forgotten if i may say so i am no authority on the matter but as the debate continues the situation seems to get worse <e>", "<cs> my lords then i am very happy to express warmest appreciation of the concessions which the government have made and for those which i understand are to follow later <e> <s> i do so without reservation <e> <s> indeed i think that the minister must be somewhat of a bonny fechter to get anything out of the government in their present mood with regard to these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may contribute to these hilarious exchanges there is of course a legal statutory construction <e> <s> if parliament in its wisdom passes a bill which is open to two constructions the courts will interpret it in accordance with that interpretation which is most consistent with common sense <e> <s> i do not think the draftsman would want to put the courts in that position too often and perhaps another look would be advisable <e>", "<cs> my lords surely the ministers answer to the amendment is somewhat outrageous <e> <s> in the first case the drafting point is technically valid <e> <s> however it is perfectly obvious that what is intended by the amendment is to have an agreed version <e> <s> that seems to me to be eminently reasonable in the whole of the circumstances <e> <s> surely if there is to be a summary it should be an agreed summary <e> <s> i find it extraordinary that the minister should say that perhaps the authority will use that as an opportunity to delay the matter <e> <s> equally one could say if one were so tempted that the minister might present a summary somewhat biased in his favour <e>", "<cs> my lords this is quite a weird provision in an act of parliament <e> <s> in general i do not think that precedent is necessarily tremendously important but i think that the house is entitled to have a precedent for something quite so excruciating as this particular provision <e>", "<cs> my lords arising out of the ministers reply to the noble lord lord ross of marnock can he inform the house whether in view of as i understand it the continuing flow of information reports and suggestions about the administrative difficulties in bringing the provisions of this bill into operation the government have kept the situation under continuing review during the progress of the bill having regard to the very serious reservations which have been expressed not only from this side of the house but from many independent sources <e>", "<cs> my lords one or two intriguing features have emerged from the discussions which your lordships have had over the past eight or nine days on this measure <e> <s> one feature which strikes me i hope i am right in saying this and that i do no injustice is that in this house we have been more effective in achieving changes in the detailed provisions of the bill than was the other place <e> <s> i found that very intriguing bearing in mind that this is an establishment which was once described by a little-known labour member of the other place as a somewhat quaint and archaic ancient establishment <e> <s> it was described by a rather better-known liberal member of parliament and minister as mr balfours poodle <e> <s> therefore i think we are advancing <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches too we welcome this bill <e> <s> it is not in any spirit of the animal whom the noble and learned lord the lord advocate described as the lazy lawyer which he thought was a rare animal <e> <s> i am not quite so sure that i take so sanguine a view <e> <s> but in any event whatever the zoological position may be it is <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment <e> <s> i had the same difficulty in understanding what led the government to include it in the bill <e> <s> i puzzled over it for some minutes <e> <s> in a very useful and helpful bill which has obviously been given a great deal of consideration by the law commission and by the noble and learned lord it would seem a pity if any part of it was disfigured by an unnecessary provision <e>", "<cs> i must say that i have the same reservations about the inclusion of these words at the beginning of clause as my noble friend lord morton of shuna <e> <s> it is a daunting circumstance that contrary to both the view of my noble friend and that of the noble and learned lord the lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that many of my countrymen would regard the english as an overtalkative people and many of my english friends would regard the scots as a somewhat taciturn and dour race so it is a kind of poetic justice that this afternoon our speeches are limited to a ration of five minutes <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that in scotland the hostility to this measure miscalled the abolition of domestic rates etc <e> <s> scotland act is even greater than that felt by a number of respected former cabinet ministers of the conservative government <e> <s> are the government aware that as the english counterpart to the scottish act to which my noble friends question refers makes progress in another place this adds evidence to the view advanced from these benches that the governments approach to the business of the reform of local government finance was completely misconceived <e>", "<cs> my lords surely the position of the finance bill is entirely different <e> <s> the one thing that is quite clear is that the announcement made by the scottish office was not appropriate in law <e>", "<cs> my lords can the secretary of state tell the house whether the precedents to which he has referred were at any time questioned <e> <s> one is familiar with bad precedents being established because no one challenged them at the time <e>", "<cs> i was disappointed to hear the noble lord lord peston say that the amendment was a forlorn hope <e> <s> perhaps naively i had assumed that surrounded as he is on the front bench by scotsmen he was about to tell the committee that with their enthusiasm for devolution they had persuaded him that this was an appropriate step to take <e>", "<cs> my lords not for the first time i have great sympathy with almost everything that my noble friend lord taylor of gryfe said <e> <s> like him at the outset i was concerned about the constitutional implications of the fact that in effect the bill comes into operation before it has been finally approved by parliament <e> <s> i am most grateful to the secretary of state for sending me a copy of the letter on that matter which he addressed to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i was intrigued by one point in the noble earls introduction of the bill when he understandably said after describing the present rating system that if we were starting again we certainly would not start with that <e> <s> it occurred to me that if were to embark on radical reform of our constitutional arrangements it is very unlikely that anyone would come up with something as odd as your lordships house <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> my lords the most interesting speech of the noble lord lord elliott of morpeth has added force to the conviction that has been growing on me over these last months particularly since the govan by-election that we the scottish people must make more of an effort to get into perspective the issues involved in this question of devolution <e> <s> i imagine that few would quarrel with the proposition that so far as administrative and executive devolution is concerned we must have as much of it as is consistent with efficiency within the context of the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not disputed that private legislation is an important part of the work of parliament <e> <s> my impression is that at least in the other place it is not a universally popular part of that work <e> <s> i shall not speculate on the basis for that impression <e> <s> i shall content myself by saying that i hope the report of the committee will promote not only its popularity but serious consideration by government of the way in which the procedure by which such legislation is enacted may be improved <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that it was a character created by oscar wilde if it was not it certainly sounds like one who opened an address to a gathering of lawyers by observing that this was the kind of occasion upon which that to speak his mind was more than a duty it was a pleasure <e> <s> it is in that spirit that i take great pleasure in expressing to the noble and learned lord lord jauncey of tullichettle i know how to pronounce it the congratulations of the house on his maiden speech <e> <s> it is a particularly difficult matter for any judge as your lordships will have gathered during the discussions that we have had on the lord chancellors green papers and this current paper from the secretary of state for scotland to express himself in this context uncontroversially yet there is no doubt that he succeeded beyond measure <e> <s> he has had a distinguished career in the law and before that and we look forward with great pleasure to hearing him on many future occasions <e>"]
