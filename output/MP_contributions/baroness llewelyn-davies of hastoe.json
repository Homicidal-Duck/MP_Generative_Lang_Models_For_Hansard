takes rather more than a week or so to get used to being on this side of the house and we discovered at lunchtime that it was procedurally impossible for him to speak twice in this debate <e> <s> the

debate <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that if more sympathy were shown to the problems of the african countries and there were less blind antipathy towards them on the part of some noble lords there would be less likelihood of their needing assistance from other powers <e>", "<cs> my lords while entirely understanding the delicacy of the present situation and not wishing in any way to

desperately need because their crops failed and they need maize <e> <s> they are using rhodesian transport and since the noble lord had not referred to governments which have actually infringed

this afternoon we on these benches and i am sure in other parts of the house are really deeply shocked that her majestys government who are moving a major reduction of aid to industry in areas where there is the highest unemployment where they are putting thousands of jobs into jeopardy and causing a major disruption of industry itself during the course of it should have put this through with

would only hope that her majestys government are able to run the country better than they are able to run their orders and the joint committee on statutory instruments <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps

be here any moment <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down there is one point which my noble friend lord goronwy-roberts raised to which i think the whole house would like an answer and

course like to give our own very warm welcome to <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that while my noble friend lord murray of gravesend is i am sure deeply grateful for the offer of the lecture which the minister made to him the house in general would appreciate more the lectures which we regularly receive from the noble lord if they were accompanied by more generosity of spirit and a lot more humour <e>", "<cs> my lords since the noble baroness expressed overwhelming interest <e>", "<cs> does the noble lord drive a coach <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i might intervene for a

transport stops quite soon and i think the committee is entitled to know the intentions of the noble lord the chief whip whether we are to go on to the end of the committee stage of the bill tonight whether we are to adjourn before the end or what he plans to do <e>", "<cs> i accept that perhaps we might confer in about ten minutes time but i might add that if the government had thought of it earlier before they tabled their amendments to the bill and indeed if they had thought out their own line more clearly at the beginning of the bill the committee would have known the direction in which we were going and our deliberations might not have taken this long <e> <s> however i quite agree with the noble lord that we might have a word in about ten minutes time <e>", "<cs> may i intervene again for one moment at this stage <e> <s> this committee stage has been discussed with great seriousness in all parts of the committee <e> <s> we have had an extremely good and serious debate but i feel that noble lords will wish me to point out to the noble lord the chief whip that the government have in their great wisdom withdrawn so many parts of the bill and have listened to opinions from all sides of your lordships house and i give them credit for listening with generosity that i feel that there will be a great deal to go through at report stage <e> <s> i must formally inform the noble lord the chief whip that we may well need an extra day on report stage after these proceedings at committee stage <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend lord

would not allow me to intervene for a moment although he has since perhaps he will allow me to say that i was not going to interrupt his argument i would not have thought it was worth it frankly <e>

the house will wish to thank the noble lord for making that statement <e> <s> we welcome his statement that overseas aid continues to be an essential element in development especially in the poorest countries <e> <s> we also agree that if the free world were to slide towards protectionism we should all suffer <e> <s> the fact that he is proposing to give greater weight in allocation of our aid to

circumstances to be taken aside to an office and to have a file taken down labelled prohibited immigrants <e> <s> his wife had never been in rhodesia before and she was treated in the same way <e> <s> and the noble lord the secretary of state quotes to us rhodesian law law invented by an illegal rgime as a justification for the treatment of these people <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to persist but is the noble lord aware that we are deeply disappointed by his response to this question <e> <s> we had expected a very different kind of answer from the marvellously diplomatic and skilful way in which he has dealt with most of these difficult problems <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord answer the question raised by my my noble friend lord brockway and the right reverend prelate the bishop of derby about the difference in the information given to congress and here <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that we very much welcome the aid which her majestys government have given to zambia but does he not agree that it would be difficult to repay the debt owed by the world to that country for maintaining the policy of united nations sanctions a policy from which she has suffered far more than any other country <e>", "<cs> my lords while welcoming the noble lords statement about american aid which is immediate and therefore especially valuable and noting that the commonwealth also will give aid may we ask the government after their magnificent achievement in getting zimbabwe to independence with so little bloodshed not to spoil the ship for a haporth of tar at this point <e> <s> the million spread over four years which the government propose to give is we feel while understanding the need for cuts almost grossly inadequate at this stage <e> <s> is the noble

grudging response to the noble earls comment about zimbabwe being a bastion of the free world <e> <s> are the government aware that zimbabwe is potentially a centre of stability in one of the most important areas in central africa <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to return to the point but what worries those of us who are deeply concerned with the matter is that we wonder whether the minister is aware that the need for aid arises now <e> <s> of course zimbabwe is potentially a rich country in minerals and everything else but may i say that to <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that there are occasions when one says thank you very much hoping to get some more pretty quickly <e>", "<cs> my lords while wholly understanding the extreme difficulty of the present situation and how it should be dealt with and that the whole country is deeply concerned with this matter may i ask the noble lord whether he could comment upon the report in <e>", "<cs> my lords in spite of the fact that

economic assistance from the ussr raise <e>", "<cs> my lords far be it from me ever to defend this government in anything they ever do but i must say that this was a very difficult situation <e> <s> i think that as the people who were to participate in the debate did not wish to proceed the government whips really had no alternative and i think we ought to thank the noble lord lord sandys for his courtesy in interrupting the previous debate so that nobody stays unnecessarily <e>", "<cs> my lords may we on this side wish everybody a very pleasant recess and may we not be worked so hard when we come back <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that many people on this side and i think in many parts of the house would strongly deprecate any suggestion that money should come from the ministry of defence for the external services of the bbc because their strength throughout the world is their known impartiality <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the feeling all round the house on this subject can we ask the noble baroness to use her very great persuasive powers with her colleagues to change the zenophobic approach which has been taken on this subject including our own commonwealth <e>", "<cs> my lords with the permission of the house may i ask the noble lord the chief whip a question about to-days business <e> <s> in view of the length of the list of speakers to-day on the housing bill is it still the governments intention to take the iran trading sanctions orders at such a late hour tonight <e> <s> i think the house had hoped that since these orders do not lapse until days after they have been laid and since there has been such widespread interest in the house about them the government might have found another time for them <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is always courteous and always mindful of the convenience of the house but has he not dug a pit and fallen into it himself <e> <s> has he not provided for the house a totally indigestible programme of legislation so much so that if this side of the house were sitting on the government side the protests from the conservative benches about the amount of important business which was being pushed through at a totally unreasonable hour would have been legion <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that he is talking about a situation which is full of human tragedy and that cheap gibes at this side of the house are not really appropriate <e> <s> is he further aware that if a country finds itself unable to benefit socially and politically from the terms of a loan of this kind it makes the loan inoperable <e> <s> is it not time that her majestys government looked around them outside their own terms of vision <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether he is aware that it is not for him to say what we debate in this house <e> <s> any noble lord is entitled to ask a question and her majestys government then have to reply <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say that we are most grateful to the noble lord the chief whip for making the position clear again <e> <s> i expect he will have to do it again and again <e> <s> we heartily agree with his entirely correct description of what our practices are <e>", "<cs> the more the noble lord is intimidated the better for us all <e>", "<cs> as neither the chief whip nor i was here at the beginning of this discussion may i say that as we understand it nobody on our side of the committee wished to say anything further on that particular amendment and that therefore it was proper to take the division <e> <s> what we did not think was proper was to resume the house <e>", "<cs> if we are still in the middle of a discussion on an amendment of course we should continue with it <e> <s> i am sure the noble lord the chief whip will agree with me that we take statements at a time agreed between the two front benches <e> <s> that time was not agreed <e>", "<cs> with the leave of the committee may i say that although i should be loath to echo the words of the noble lord that this is a dogs dinner i am sure that we should have understood the bill better if we had had the notes on clauses <e> <s> if i may leave that point aside may i add that the time is just after a quarter to eleven and there was an unofficial agreement between both sides of the house that we should rise at about this time <e> <s> i wonder what the noble lord the chief whip would think about that <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may return to the previous answer given by the noble baroness she said that normally fees had to be paid for a whole year <e> <s> i remember the last time this matter arose <e> <s> is the noble baroness aware that on that occasion many noble lords in all parts of the house asked whether this could not be varied and that if the government could not go the whole way perhaps students could he required to pay the full rate for the first three months but have their fees varied from the moment when greece was in the eec <e> <s> i am sure there is support for that in all parts of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble earl is going to ignore the results of the surveys which are commissioned by his own department and to use two different kinds of lenses is it not possible that he might end up cross-eyed <e>", "<cs> an apology has been asked for <e> <s> it seems that none of us was quite clear what happened to cause my noble friend lady fisher to seek an apology but if a noble baroness asks for an apology for some sort of uncouth interruption in your lordships committee she is entitled to one <e>", "<cs> i suggest that in the interests of the committee some sort of gesture from the front bench opposite is required <e> <s> nobody wants to make a fuss over this <e> <s> there was what i repeat was an uncouth interruption <e> <s> would the noble lord lord mowbray and stourton out of his usual courtesy make a move <e>", "<cs> i do not think that quite constitutes an apology <e> <s> we just need a courteous acknowledgment that perhaps it was unfortunate to laugh so loudly <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to go on about this my lords but we really cannot go on until the matter is resolved <e> <s> the noble lord is the only whip present on the government benches <e> <s> he is the deputy chief whip <e>", "<cs> whatever the noble lord is he is the only senior whip present and it is up to him to keep the proceedings of the committee going <e> <s> my noble friend lady fisher is not a compulsive speaker and it was an uncouth thing to laugh so loudly when she said she did not like speaking much <e> <s> we all know there are many compulsive speakers in your lordships house but she is not one of them <e> <s> it is extremely ungentlemanly if i may say so of the noble lord after all this pleading not to get to his feet and say something courteous <e>", "<cs> my lords may on a business point ask whether there arc any practical reasons why the government could not have answered these questions about cost-effectiveness to which the noble lord continually refers and why this house and the other house should not be familiar with the arguments before the noble lord makes this statement <e> <s> his excuse that such a statement would take much longer simply does not fit the seriousness of the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that we are extremely grateful that he did consult that rather unsung and very hardworking organisation the womens national commission and of course the equal opportunities commission and that we should like them not merely to consult them but to really take notice of the policies that they recommend <e> <s> is the noble lord further aware that if women had been consulted more often we should not be in half such a mess as we are today <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way for just a moment <e> <s> perhaps i may intervene <e> <s> he made a reference to hyperbole <e> <s> i hope he will acquit anybody on this side or even on his own side of the house of hyperbole <e> <s> we have been as moderate as we possibly could <e> <s> in reference to the last points he was making can he really say that nobody is going to suffer financially because of this bill <e> <s> i think it is very unlikely that anybody on any side of this house could really accept that point <e> <s> it is a mean and a despicable bill we feel it so and if he could show us that nobody will suffer financially we should be very grateful to him <e>", "<cs> my lords while the house will be grateful to the noble lord for making that statement is he aware that it causes a great deal of dismay in many parts of this house <e> <s> we know that all governments and especially in their first year try to put through too much legislation <e> <s> we are familiar with that <e> <s> we know that the noble lord is always mindful of the welfare of the house and that the noble lord the leader of the house strives manfully on our behalf but very many noble lords believe that her majestys government simply do not understand the functions and the capabilities of this house <e> <s> her majestys government have refused to allow a single major bill to start here with the result that at the end of the session an intolerable burden is placed on our house <e>", "<cs> my lords it is for the government to govern <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord be so kind as to answer my last question which was this while the government are compelling the lords to burn their candle at both ends what will be happening in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that statement <e> <s> while we understand that if the government need time for consideration for amendments to the broadcasting bill the first committee day should be postponed we should nevertheless like an assurance from the noble lord that the government will give full and proper time for consideration of the broadcasting bill during the autumn spill-over <e>", "<cs> my lords since there is some confusion about what was actually said and since our information is that the government said that they intended to reject the lords amendment can i ask the noble lord the chief whip whether we should not suspend the sitting of the house for a quarter of an hour until we have heard what the government said <e> <s> lf indeed they did say what it is reported they said it surely calls into question how and in what form we debate the third reading of a bill which has not been through this house but a bit of which has been prematurely rejected in the other place <e>", "<cs> my lords then i think we really must ask for a suspension until we find out what was said <e> <s> the noble lord clearly does not know what was said <e> <s> we shall soon know after the end of questions and if necessary i think we must ask the house to decide <e>", "<cs> my lords if it is only a discourtesy then we accept it but i think the whole house wishes to know what actually happened <e> <s> this is why with i think the support of most parts of the house i should like to move a temporary suspension during pleasure while we find out what was actually said <e> <s> after that we can find out where we go from there <e> <s> so i think at this point <e>", "<cs> my lords i do beg to move and was about to beg to move that we divide on the question whether the house should be suspended during pleasure until we have heard what happened in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i ask the noble lord to withdraw <e>", "<cs> my lords i ask the noble lord to withdraw <e>", "<cs> my lords i ask the noble lord to withdraw now <e>", "<cs> as the leader of the house stood up i sat down but i shall not sit down now <e>", "<cs> my lords i call on the leader to ask the noble lord to withdraw <e>", "<cs> my lords while agreeing with the noble and learned lord that we shall be sadly deprived if we cannot listen to this service does he agree that the overriding importance is that the world service should be heard all over the world <e> <s> we urge the foreign office not to make economies in this direction <e> <s> when every other country is stepping up this kind of service we should continue to step up ours even more than we have up to now <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble lord for making that statement and if the commons messages reach us on thursday the house will of course debate them <e> <s> but i would ask the noble lord whether he is aware that almost all parts of the house believe that if the government had not been so exceptionally rigid in their handling of these latest bills to reach the house and if they had not disregarded the expert advice available to them which was given from all parts of the house they would not be in the trouble in which they are in now <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that whereas the house expects from him in answer to every question put to him an analysis of the work of the last months of the previous government it would greatly appreciate a more constructive and very much lighter approach from him in answer to questions <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that it is bad enough to have to listen to it <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that on this side of the house indeed i think in most parts of the house there is a feeling that the south african government has delayed in this settlement beyond what is a reasonable time <e> <s> could we have an assurance that her majestys government will be pressing both at the united nations and in other ways which are open to them to obtain a very speedy attempt at an agreement in what is a serious and dangerous situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord very much for that answer because the whole house and indeed the country are deeply anxious about the dangerous situation in the middle east <e> <s> because of that anxiety may i ask him one or two more detailed supplementaries <e> <s> of course we very much accept and welcome his concern about the conflict spreading <e> <s> i wonder whether he could give us any further information about that with particular reference to jordan and to syria to the possible supply by the russians of arms to iran to the possible supply of arms by the french to iraq and the calls in some quarters in the united states for an armed strike <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask a short supplementary question on that <e> <s> one of the great dangers of the whole oil position is that it is going to bear much <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the last <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord and perhaps through him the noble lord the chief whip whether he is aware that since we were told only this morning that the secretary of state would make a public announcement of his decision we are gravely disturbed at the disrespect shown to this house in that although we have a committee stage on the bill on thursday the public statement would not have been made in this house <e> <s> is he further aware that the whole house now knows that the statement would not have been made in parliament unless we the opposition had asked for it <e> <s> is he further aware that in view of the almost overwhelming pressure put upon your lordships house to implement the governments unreasonable programme in this overspill we should particularly like to ask the noble lord whether in future he will consider the physcial as well as the i was going to say moral but perhaps i had better not say that pressures put upon this house <e> <s> since the government may have known eighteen months ago and certainly should have known at second reading three months ago i suggest that the committee stage of this bill in this house in this overspill was unnecessary <e>", "<cs> my lords the whole house knows that the noble lord himself always treats the house with consideration and kindness but on this occasion i must ask him to accept that the whole house and certainly the opposition has been astonished by this performance <e> <s> it is really astonishing that the government should have had no intention of announcing in this house something which is essential to what we are going to debate on thursday <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that we on this side attack torture wherever it happens wherever in the world <e> <s> is he further aware it is not a matter of our simply singling out chile <e> <s> is he aware that cardinal hume has made a special appeal to the government in view of his evidence from chile that torture is growing and that the security police have been given new draconian powers and that he appealed to the government not to sell arms and not to resume trade <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel that the time has come when the whole house must ask the noble lord the chief whip some questions about the further conduct of this bill <e> <s> i do not want to delay the committee <e> <s> in spite of sitting during the night until nearly three oclock this morning we still have a very long way to go <e> <s> we have about amendments before us and many debates on whether clauses shall stand part of

on the committee stage and that he will let us know how far he thinks we shall get tonight <e> <s> i must repeat again amendments and debates on clauses stand part <e> <s> i think he will be a genius if he gets this through without driving us all mad <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord repudiated the word meanness which my noble friend uttered <e> <s> but surely is he not aware that this government this country has been criticised not merely by leaders in the commonwealth but by herr willy brandt and by south american governments <e> <s> is he also aware that all of our forebodings when we found that overseas aid was to be put under the foreign office have been confirmed regularly <e> <s> the fact that the proportion of cuts as regards aid is so much out of proportion with the other cuts in this country really is a disgrace and is he aware that we are bearing criticism from all over the world for doing it <e>", "<cs> my lords our reputation in the world has suffered

perhaps i had better add that i hope he is aware that he will have to have a jolly good case because we do not think this ought to be done in a circular or if it is done in a circular only after parliament has been informed <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just say that i think this is an historic occasion <e> <s> i have never known my noble friend lord ross of marnock mystified in the whole of my life until tonight <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that is the only point throughout the course of this entire bill on which i have agreed with the noble lord the chief whip <e> <s> nevertheless as always he treats us with courtesy and kindness <e> <s> we deeply appreciate what he has said <e> <s> we disagree with everything that he stands for and i think possibly everything he believes in but we nevertheless very much appreciate his courtesy and his care for this house <e> <s> we for our part could have gone on for very much longer <e> <s> we think the bill still needs an enormous amount of correction and a great deal more consideration <e> <s> but as a matter of fact if i may be absolutely frank with the house we just are too exhausted to go another minute further <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord indicate whether there is any hope of the south west africans coming to negotiation in the fairly early future <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that all parts of the house are deeply worried about the fact that this issue is dragging itself on with no resolution at the end of it <e>", "<cs> my lords while totally agreeing with the last sentence of the ministers reply may i ask whether the attitude of the government does not reflect rather a complacent and negative attitude to a situation which is in itself really very explosive <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that we give great credit to those companies which have done well in this respect <e> <s> is he further aware that it was the labour government who took the initiative over this and over bringing the eec into it <e> <s> furthermore is he aware that we should like the noble lord to lend more strength to his elbow in obtaining perhaps more factual accounts as indeed the german government do <e>", "<cs> my lords i rather think that the noble lord has shot my fox <e> <s> i was going to ask the noble lord this while acknowledging that it is never the right time to raise the salaries of anybody in the public service especially in this house may i ask whether he would remember the church mice the unpaid whips on the opposition side <e> <s> with <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware how very much the house enjoys listening to him when he is explaining a really difficult question <e> <s> his felicity of language his knowledge and his skill are really a delight to the house especially when he is not trying to blame everything on the previous administration <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that he may be doing his own filing much sooner than he thinks <e>", "<cs> my lords may we ask the noble lord whether he is aware that the greatest time lag of all is that between government promises and their fulfilment <e>", "<cs> nevertheless my lords may i ask the noble viscount to convey to his secretary of state the views which were expressed by my noble friend lord goronwy-roberts which we on this side feel to be of the greatest importance <e>", "<cs> my lords since the noble lord referred to aid and the concern which the government have about that and since there are over displaced people who are in refugee camps still subject to harassment from government troops children who have been orphaned and people who have become exiled in neighbouring <e>", "<cs> my lords with the permission of the house may i respond to what the noble lord has said <e> <s> we on this side entirely agree about the timing <e> <s> but i am not sure that it might not be politic and useful for him to repeat the last part of his statement when his own benches are rather fuller <e> <s> i am sure that the committee will give him permission to interrupt and do so <e> <s> he would have anyway a great deal of support from this side <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask a non-technical question <e> <s> is there any risk of a child being exposed to <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will wish to thank the noble lord for that announcement and his usual courtesy <e> <s> owing to the remarkable character of this bill and if i may say so the indecisiveness of the government in dealing with it we must just hope for the best <e> <s> those noble lords who were in the chamber late last night will have heard the noble lord lord winstanley say that he thought that the noble lord lord denham was getting twitchy and offered him a prescription to cure his twitchiness <e> <s> i just wonder whether the prescription has arrived <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the house will as always accept the advice of the noble lord the chief whip <e> <s> however i think that the government perhaps ought to realise that this kind of statement this extraordinary statement in every sense of the word requires proper debate <e> <s> i think that the whole house even those relatively silent members on the benches opposite will wish to discuss the statement at some time perhaps before the bill is taken <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that his last answer has given some pleasure to this side of the house because we on this side were rather disturbed by the levity displayed by the other side even by the front bench about the very serious matters which were being raised involving the future prosperity of this country and of most other parts of the world <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that if the further statement of his right honourable friend is not more satisfactory than his own answer he will still have the description of a black beetle thrown at him <e> <s> does not the noble earl agree that the beautiful clean abbey shows up this building of which we are all so proud and about which even this government ought not to be stingy <e>", "<cs> my lords i am so sorry that the noble lord finds it difficult to concentrate <e> <s> i am not interrupting him i do not feel there is much need to because his speech is if i may say so not awfully relevant to what noble lords in this house have said <e>", "<cs> my lords if the house will forgive this intervention the highly marginal difference is a little irrelevant <e> <s> we have been harried by the government for the whole of this session to get their programme through <e> <s> time after time the noble lord the chief whip has urged the house to get everything through <e> <s> he is now going to have an immense debate in this house and will face the same thing win or lose in this house in the other place <e> <s> i do not think that this is getting the government legislative programme through <e>", "<cs> my lords can we say how much the house appreciates the fact that her majestys government will do everything they can to support the botswana government as this is a matter which is absolutely vital to them <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to spoil the noble lords clay but he does not receive congratulations from these benches on the reduction in the overall aid <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord must be surprised at being congratulated by my noble friend <e> <s> may i add my own congratulations to her majestys government <e> <s> may i ask the noble lord whether he is aware i am sure he is that it is not only a question of impure water but that the women separate the fat from the milk and give it to their husbands and the babies therefore hear hear <e> <s> says the noble leader get not only impure poisoned powder but un-nutritional stuff <e> <s> can we ask her majestys government to impress upon the united states government if possible and at every opportunity in the un agencies world health fao and everywhere else the dreadful practice of the aggressive selling tactics that the companies go in for <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the occasion of his second reply to my noble friend lord shinwell was the first time in many years during my experience in this house that i have heard a member of the government front bench say for whatever reason that the answer that he had given to a noble lord was not the true answer but that the true answer was the opposite one <e> <s> this gives rise to some disquiet about the answers that the government are giving <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord said that because of the affection and respect that the house has for my noble friend lord shinwell he had given him one answer whereas the real answer was no <e> <s> could not my noble friend have been given that answer in the first place <e>", "<cs> my lords while wishing to agree entirely with what the noble lord the leader of the house has said may i ask the noble lord the chief whip to consult with his colleagues in another place <e> <s> is it really reasonable that in the middle of a busy afternoon the noble viscount should be required to repeat a statement which lasted over minutes <e> <s> the noble lord the chief whip keeps us under constant pressure to get the governments programme through <e> <s> may we have an assurance that this kind of performance when there is a debate coming on on the white paper published this afternoon will not be repeated during the rest of this session <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that although i voted for the amendment to which this question relates every single seat belt in every car i drive fits neatly across my throat <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will wish to thank the noble lord for repeating that statement <e> <s> the whole house will be very glad to hear about his visit to moscow for discussions on afghanistan and will wish him success <e> <s> we note that he himself puts his chances at only about / but we still welcome this more positive approach and we welcome the fact that he seems to have persuaded our american allies to move more in the direction of discussion <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord will forgive me for interrupting but in fact i quoted from <e>", "<cs> my lords may we thank the noble lord for his answer in which he said that this request was being considered <e> <s> we noticed that there was no reference to it in the summit communiqu <e> <s> we fully understand the delicacy of the situation and we are grateful to the government for considering it <e>", "<cs> my lords while i think the whole house understands the rather unfortunate background to the whole unesco discussions on communications it still remains an extremely important subject <e> <s> could the government bear in mind the importance of the relations between north and south which will arise at the mexico conference and help to smooth some of the difficulties along this path before then <e>", "<cs> no my lords and the noble lord is not likely to have any such responsibility <e>", "<cs> we entirely understand the feelings of the chief whip <e> <s> of course it is his job to get the business through <e> <s> however he must also understand the very deep feelings that there are about this particular subject <e> <s> when he said that we spent a long time on the first amendments this afternoon i think he must have forgotten that we had a long government statement then and a very important one too <e> <s> i do not think that we ought to be lectured about going into something deeply at the beginning of the afternoon when part of the time was taken up with a statement <e> <s> everybody who has spoken has done so with deep seriousness <e> <s> there has been no suggestion of wasting time or not dealing with the matter in depth <e> <s> i think the chief whips lecture was very slightly misplaced <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the noble lord will forgive me for interrupting but for clarification did i understand him to say that he thought it was the policy of the labour party that the state should own the newspapers <e>", "<cs> my lords may i assure the noble lord that the noble lord lord kennet is not an expert on the policies of the labour party and that that is decidedly not our policy <e>", "<cs> my lords you can do anything with figures if you try except feed poor people in the poorest countries <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble viscount forgive me if i asked him a rather practical question about these aircraft <e> <s> is he aware that since the aircraft are unable to fly very high privy counsellors when flying north as part of their duty often are most horribly sick <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that he really cannot get away with that <e> <s> the governments response as he perfectly well knows does he not <e> <s> was originally extremely cold as my noble friend has said <e> <s> we do very much welcome the increase in wisdom of the government at the moment <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that the world outside though at first shocked by the governments initial response is now beginning to see that they can sometimes learn by experience <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will wish to thank the noble lord for making that announcement <e> <s> may i ask whether he realises i am sure he does that in all parts of the house there is a very strong feeling that an almost impossible burden of work has been put upon the house at this very difficult part of the session and that the government really should not cram so much complicated and controversial legislation into the back end of the session <e> <s> of course we know it is not entirely the <e>", "<cs> absurd <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble baroness understand i am sure she does that it is not only money which is needed although that is important <e> <s> one thing which i hope she will agree would be appreciated would be if the appointments system could be improved <e> <s> could she offer any sort of hope to those of us who campaign on these issues that say patients are not all summoned for and another for <e> <s> is there anything which the ministry can do to ensure that the doctors are there when the patients are there <e>", "<cs> my lords while noting and may we ask him why <e> <s> that the noble lord did not mention the figures may i also ask him whether he thinks it proper to question the nature of the parliamentary question which my noble friend put down which was presumably passed by the table <e> <s> it appears to us to be not a statement but a question and it comes rather ill from the noble lord to dispute it <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the clerks do give the many individual members of our house a great deal of advice which we very willingly accept <e> <s> is he further aware that we on these benches feel that if he approached these questions with a good deal less cynicism we should enjoy his answers much better <e>", "<cs> the amendment does not mean that <e>", "<cs> it might be appropriate if i confirm that <e> <s> if the government accepted the amendment and the bill went back to the other house they could easily find time for it to reach us by friday <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord hatch has waited for nearly three months for this unstarred question to be answered <e> <s> i am very glad indeed that his patience has at last been rewarded because this is a very important and indeed highly dangerous situation which is brewing in namibia and throughout the whole of southern africa <e> <s> he should of course have been supported in this debate by a deeply-experienced and knowledgeable front bench spokesman but owing to the tragic loss of my noble friend lord goronwy-roberts i shall try to speak briefly although i am afraid much less adequately than he could have done and with much less detailed knowledge than the very powerful speeches we have heard tonight <e>", "<cs> my lords while welcoming part of the noble lords reply would he not agree that on a question of such universal and devastating importance the government spokesmen while not orchestrating public opinion ought to do more than to touch on the question of disarmament <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord referred both to the debts and to the low productivity point may i ask him whether since poland first asked for emergency consideration to be given to the position in june and they have had no answer and the noble lord can give no answer now he would agree that at this particularly urgent moment the too little and too late approach can lead only to further economic and political dependence by the poles on the russians <e> <s> while one understands the difficulties created for the lending authorities the banks and governments by the low productivity rate in poland is not that last question more important than anything else <e>", "<cs> my lords may we say how much we have enjoyed this exchange between the various members of her majestys government <e>", "<cs> my lords could the noble lord give an answer to the question which my noble friend has put to him about whether discussion has been postponed until <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely understand the difficulties in which the noble lord finds himself but if the usual channels communicate about this as of course they must the house will know nothing until tuesday because we shall not be meeting again until then <e> <s> all whips go out today and i think that the house may be in some difficulty about not knowing what will happen on tuesday <e>", "<cs> i think my lords that the house would perhaps prefer that i should continue my argument <e> <s> i shall give way a bit later <e> <s> i do not want to go through the whole fahd plan point by point <e> <s> many of those points will not be acceptable in their present form to your lordships as they are clearly not acceptable to president reagan <e> <s> i cannot myself see israel ever accepting jerusalem as the capital of an arab palestine nor can i see them giving up the strategic heights of golan nor can any of us approve any plan which leaves a limited israeli state menaced from all sides by missiles provided by the russians often through colonel gadaffi which could destroy all the main cities of israel <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that we on this side are glad that the government have expressed their disapproval of the chilean governments attitude to human rights and are glad indeed that the minister of state mentioned that to the visiting chilean minister who i think is the minister for mines <e> <s> would it not be even more effective if the question of handing over these two warships had been put into the argument as a possible <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i ask him to work out the arithmetic of each speech <e>", "<cs> my lords i must briefly praise the self-discipline of the house for the way in which this debate has been carried through <e> <s> there have been excellent speeches mostly which have been very well argued and we have kept completely within the time limit <e> <s> we owe a debt of gratitude to the noble earl lord kimberley for raising this extremely important subject <e> <s> of course nato and our relations with the united states is a matter of fundamental importance <e> <s> however i must also tell the noble earl that i profoundly disagree with his arguments about propaganda <e> <s> the peace movements do not need propaganda from russia or from anywhere else <e> <s> the whole world can see the danger that we are in <e> <s> as the house knows the noble lord lord jenkins of putney looks after himself very well indeed but i say with some sorrow that i very much regret that the noble earl took the opportunity of a serious foreign policy and defence debate to vilify sincere and legitimate peace movements <e> <s> indeed i feel it is unworthy of the standards of this house <e>", "<cs> my lords in the time i have got i would rather not <e> <s> the noble earl did not give way either <e> <s> it is not necessary for noble lords to respond to the wilder expressions of tory intolerance <e> <s> the subject which we are discussing is much too important <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that many of the donor countries even from the eec have not yet fulfilled the pledges that they made about aiding transport in central africa <e> <s> is he further aware that this is short-sighted since we need the minerals if nothing else from central africa and without transport we shall not get them <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord was right the first time <e>", "<cs> my lords since this is rather a complex matter may i ask a purely factual question of the foreign secretary <e> <s> can we broadly assume that the five nations the front-line states and even swapo are broadly in accord with those proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord paget of northampton of whom if i may say so the house is very fond and i hope he will not think me presumptuous is highly intelligent and i am sure a man of temperate habits but he does occasionally use very intemperate language <e> <s> my noble friend tonight referred to what he had said in the debate on the queens speech and i think that i must say at once that no one on this side of the house could possibly agree with my noble friends recommendation that the only way to deal with people like colonel gaddafi is as he suggested to exterminate them <e> <s> we cannot agree with that kind of thinking or argument <e>", "<cs> my lords one can understand about keeping open channels of communication but is it necessary at this juncture for our banks to donate to libya some million money which is badly needed for investment in industry here <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that we find his answers very fair and reasoned <e> <s> may i ask him whether he could perhaps convey to his noble friend whether he thinks that soviet gold is going to the pastors of the lutheran church of east germany who are organising a peace movement and to the hungarian roman catholic priests who are preaching for conscientious objection and to the entire romanian government which has just organised a peace rally of hundreds of thousands of people and whether all that is part of soviet propaganda <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be most grateful to the noble lord the foreign secretary for his statement because the whole house and indeed the whole country are deeply concerned at the very grave situation in poland today and none of us would wish to say anything which could contribute to the dangers of the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords after that i am sorry to rise again but may i ask the noble lord a final question <e> <s> one entirely understands his hesitation nobody quite understands what is going on at the moment <e> <s> but about the financial position would it not be prudent for the ten including ourselves with the americans to be considering what we might do provided that the polish government can still negotiate with us on this financial point <e> <s> surely it should not be left to the banks alone but should be a matter for government assistance <e>", "<cs> and the tory party <e>", "<cs> my lords in spite of the noble lords reference to his own shaky arithmetic is he not aware that as <e>", "<cs> my lords before the house adjourns may i ask the deputy leader whether he has any statement to make about the proceedings on the consolidated fund bill earlier today <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches would like to echo very warmly especially the last words that the noble lord the chief whip has uttered <e> <s> we owe such a lot to all the staff of the house and we all of us wish them a particularly restful and happy christmas and a prosperous new year <e> <s> we also wish noble lords in all parts of the house a peaceful and a happy new year <e>", "<cs> my lords before we leave the statement with the leave of the house may i ask the noble lord the chief whip whether he could consider reviewing the procedure by which front bench spokesmen get statements of this kind <e> <s> with great respect to the noble lord the foreign secretary the difficulty is always particularly serious with the foreign office <e> <s> as those statements are of great importance and are usually complicated even minutes is not enough time to consider them properly <e> <s> i think that i am right in saying that the liberal front bench received the statement only minutes before it was made to the house <e> <s> i know how difficult these matters are but may i ask the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for saying that <e> <s> perhaps we could have an indication on a subject like this whether it is on the whole of the two-day summit a review of the summit or is confined to specific aspects only <e>", "<cs> never humble <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether the motion has been put <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that while in no way excusing the actions of the soviet government in many places there is very very grave anxiety about some of the utterances of the american administration <e> <s> since we do not expect him to have a direct influence on the soviet government would her majestys government be good enough to make representations to the american administration about those anxieties <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that those of us who were around <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble lord very much for that explanation of what is a highly technical matter may i ask him a few simple questions <e> <s> first how many mariners are likely to be affected by this <e> <s> secondly this is important does this affect the interests of men who are employed in foreign ships or ships with flags of convenience <e> <s> thirdly has the national union of seamen been fully consulted about it <e> <s> if the minister needs time to consider the matter i shall perfectly understand the position <e>", "<cs> my lords since this is a rather unique situation where a former french colony and a former british colony have got together and since we know that the main difficulties are economic could not the noble lord make representations if not to the imf then in general to make sure that the stability whose importance he emphasised is maintained financially and that therefore a democratic rgime can be maintained in senegambia <e>", "<cs> my lords while there are very many noble lords on this side of the house and i think on this side in general who profoundly disagree with a great deal that the government have said in this statement the house accepted the collection of views taken by the noble baroness the leader of the house on three separate occasions that the discussion on the statement should conclude <e> <s> although i must say again that we disagree with a great deal of what the government have said i think we must abide by the conventions of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords could this be said to be an argument against privatisation in general <e>", "<cs> we do my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that there is a very strong feeling in the country and in the house that precisely because of the dangers and difficulties in the middle east at the moment we feel it is essential that his noble friend should carry out his visit to israel <e> <s> the most productive gesture that could be made at this time of great danger would be for the plo to declare formally its belief that the state of israel should exist particularly since there are many israelis who do not approve of their own governments methods on the west bank <e> <s> will the noble lord urge his noble friend to repeat that plea to the plo <e>", "<cs> my lords since the noble lord referred to somalia and since it is one of the poorest countries in the world with its addition of the frightful burden of tragic refugees could not the noble lords government consider giving more than what even the <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord really consider that a large sum of money for such distress <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way for a moment <e> <s> there has been very little political abuse in this debate it has been kept on a very serious level <e> <s> i am rather sorry that the noble lord is having fun <e> <s> everybody knows that it is only the members of the labour party who criticise the labour party everybody else loves it <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the house will very much welcome his statement that camp david is not exhausted and that negotiations are proceeding between egypt and israel about palestinian autonomy <e> <s> is the noble lord also aware that in all parts of the house there will be great sadness that this particular subject should be discussed on the day and at the time of the funeral of lord janner who contributed so much to our knowledge of the middle east <e>", "<cs> i think that i ought to ask the noble lord the chief whip whether he was aware of this undertaking apparently given in another place that there would be amendments to clause at the report stage because this is the important point <e> <s> when we were discussing how far we would try to get with the legislation tonight we were told first that the department hoped to go to clause which we agreed <e> <s> we were then told that we would go to clause if there was time and if the debate fitted in properly <e> <s> we now find that we have been debating clause under a total misapprehension <e> <s> we did not expect to debate a clause which would subsequently be amended <e> <s> this is not the way in which bills are carried through <e> <s> i know that my noble friend lady birk never did this kind of thing when she was in charge of bills from the government bench <e> <s> i really must ask for an explanation <e>", "<cs> i am worried about your lordships committee considering a clause which the government have every intention of altering later on <e> <s> surely this is a waste of the committees time <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> with his usual fairness he appreciates the point that we are making not in any antagonistic spirit at all <e> <s> we understand the haste with which the government have had to prepare their case but that is not the fault of the opposition <e> <s> i think that i must ask the noble lord the chief whip what he proposes to do now <e> <s> i should have thought the thing to do would be to stop <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble lord lord bellwin has a clear understanding of the situation on the bill and where we are in this particular clause <e> <s> might i suggest respectfully to the noble lord the chief whip that the whole committee would find the situation clearer when we start again if we finished discussing i think it is amendments nos <e> <s> and and started again with a clear slate <e>", "<cs> that is very generous of the noble lord and we are grateful <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may ask the government front bench after such a resounding defeat in respect of one of the basic clauses of the whole bill what their intentions are about the rest of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not perfectly possible to listen to a lengthy discussion especially involving the noble lord lord cockfield and still find because he is so stimulating that there are other questions that one wishes to ask afterwards <e> <s> one cannot limit debate by saying that the subject has already been discussed <e> <s> secondly may i ask the noble lord to be a little careful in inferring that people are unable to understand what is said at the time <e> <s> i think his reply to my noble friend required a little consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl lord avon account for the extraordinary hostility shown by successive governments to canals <e> <s> is the noble earl aware that this used to be attributed to the rivalry between railways and canals <e> <s> since that can no longer apply can he account for the scrooge-like disapproval shown by all governments and especially by his own to the existence of such a useful and delightful public service <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that every speaker tonight has said how very grateful the house is to my noble friend lord rhodes for having initiated this debate for making so powerful a speech himself and for giving us the opportunity of hearing such highly qualified experts as the noble lord lord kadoorie <e> <s> chinas importance in the world context is immense and it is curious that our debates about her are so infrequent <e> <s> china has had a cultural and philosophical influence on the world for thousands of years and trade with china has been of historical importance for

mysterious question mark in the minds of most of the british people <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree entirely that it is a very good example which my noble friend has given us <e> <s> i shall not go too far into the question of the olive branch but perhaps the chinese might be forgiven for being a little cynical about the timing of the olive branch just when there were strains appearing between america and china over the taiwan policies <e> <s> at this moment as the noble lord lord geddes mentioned we are naturally sad that the chinese government could not support resolution at the security council but we understand their loyalty to the views of the non-aligned countries and we share their strong wish for a peaceful settlement of the falklands dispute <e> <s> but our debate tonight is taking place under the deep shadow of crisis <e> <s> these are questions which we must leave for a different occasion but what we want to convey tonight is our tremendous goodwill towards the peoples

there is no question of spinning out time <e> <s> that is not the way that this opposition behaves <e> <s> i should like the noble lord to take that from me <e>", "<cs> my lords that may be so but we are not deliberately spinning it out <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord would forgive me for a moment <e> <s> i am very sorry that he seemed to reduce what is perhaps the most important subject facing mankind today that of disarmament in general to the level of party politics <e> <s> but since he has done so i ignore his remarks about unilateralism and the rest of it on the

should like to ask whether they will support the united states which seems to be trying to bring about something which according to <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware in referring to the export surplus that zimbabwe has exported i think tonnes of maize to zambia zaire mozambique and botswana but that its own maize production has been halved by the drought and its cotton production is down by a third so that the impression that he may have given about the export surplus is only because zimbabwe has done this deliberately to help other countries <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the initially disappointing response of the minister although he did explain later that we were pressing our partners have the government really taken on board the dramatic difference in the united states attitude to this that they are now proposing all kinds of trade ties with the chinese scientific technological and educational exchanges-and that we may be in danger of losing the very great advantages which we first had in making advances to the chinese before the americans <e>", "<cs> my lords although the whole house agrees with the view that the present restrictions are insupportable

to make preconditions about sovereignty and so on before then <e>", "<cs> my lords while i partially accept the noble lords remarks about the falklands situation may i ask whether he is aware that this country feels a real debt of gratitude to guyana for being with trinidad almost the only country in central america to support us over the falklands issue <e> <s> will not the noble lord assure the house that we shall give every possible assistance to guyana if there is a dispute over the world bank loan <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that we welcomed his rather more positive answer to my noble friends original question <e> <s> we found it a rather promising and positive approach <e> <s> but with reference to his last answer to my noble friend lord molloy the government are surely aware that for the first time the soviet government has talked about acceptance of on the spot inspection and what is the governments response to that <e> <s> may i ask the noble lord whether he is aware that we hope we do not have the usual rather cynical reaction to that kind of offer from the soviet union <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that his last remark to my noble friend lord brockway was scarcely fair <e> <s> is he aware that my noble friend does like to hear about progress <e> <s> we all do <e> <s> is the noble lord also aware that when my noble friend asked whether the government would back the educational programme on disarmament i felt he was a little unfair in directing the argument on to unilateral disarmament when we all want disarmament of every single kind <e>", "<cs> my lords could the noble lord confirm that the recent british nationality act has deprived the islanders of their british nationality <e> <s> how will that affect their future development <e> <s> could he also say whether there is any news about a possible extension to the landing strip <e>", "<cs> my lords while being most grateful for the last piece of information may i ask whether the noble lord is not aware that there is great disquiet and disappointment and there have been many talks on the radio in england about the pitcairn islanders losing their british nationality <e>", "<cs> order <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that we very much welcome his statement about no preconditions over the cuban troops in angola and that we all very much hope for peace in the whole region <e> <s> may i ask whether he can comment on many statements in the press that western diplomats in the united nations are worried by what they call noises from the military in south africa and the presidents latest accusations against swapo <e>", "<cs> my lords he would have been a working ornament <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble leader replies may i say that we all understand completely the passionate interest taken in this subject by my noble and learned friend and indeed by many noble lords in all parts of the house <e> <s> we understand that and we appreciate the deep feeling <e> <s> nevertheless i think it very important when the leader of the house makes an appeal to the house that its normal practices should be carried out we should take this with very great seriousness <e> <s> we do not have a speaker and this house will not run unless we observe the customs of the house <e> <s> i feel that it is inappropriate for someone of my standing to disagree with anybody as eminent and wise as my noble and learned friend <e> <s> nevertheless we must accent to the house the absolute necessity of observing our own rules before somebody

begging so many peers for so long not to make long speeches that i cannot do so myself <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord expand a little on his answer to my <e>", "<cs> my lords it is quite trivial really <e> <s> there were people who were consumers and not farmers or anything like farmers and are still on the committee <e> <s> a particular noble lord of whom i am thinking is unfortunately unable to be present today <e> <s> also i almost always attend the committees <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount aware that when the eec sub-committee on the social fund reported to the house we had a great deal of evidence that there were very few applications for womens projects <e> <s> could the government do more to bring to the attention of womens organisations the existence of the fund <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble viscount tell the house whether the whole question of the enlargement of the community by spain and portugal which is so relevant to the financing of the community was discussed either in plenary session or perhaps as he described outside it <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the very many friends of this distinguished lawyer and his wife will warmly welcome his statement that her majestys government are in contact with other governments in the eec about this and that we fervently hope that the president who is known for his humanitarian views will commute these tragic death sentences <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware i think she must be that in all parts of the house there are many members with experience of the work of the crown agents who will have heard the statement with much apprehension <e> <s> the noble earl pointed out that this has been a public service since the middle of the th century <e> <s> may i ask the noble baroness whether since the crown agents have not acted for commercial concerns in the private sector and since they do act for the united nations on projects financed by the world bank and for international organisations of a similar kind the government can really be certain that such bodies will have <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask a question about the proposed tax on oils and fats <e> <s> is the noble lord aware indeed i am sure he is that your lordships select committee on the community very recently made a report which on the basis of overwhelming evidence from trade associations among others as well as consumers recommended that the tax should be dropped <e> <s> in view of the fact that in another place last week the minister said that her majestys government were also against it can the noble lord tell us what is now the position <e> <s> was the matter discussed and if it was what was the decision <e>", "<cs> my lords is there any proposal to discuss the matter or does that complete it <e>", "<cs> my lords with reference to short-wave is the noble lord aware that if people could hear the short-wave broadcasts in these places they might be more likely to have short-wave sets <e> <s> that is the first point <e> <s> secondly i am delighted to hear about the new relay station in the seychelles but if it takes anything like as long as the one which was proposed for china as far as i know six years ago may we hope that the noble lord will urge that it be built more quickly <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that noble lords in all parts of the house have been asking for more money to be spent in spite of the million so that the excellent programmes the world service produces can be heard <e> <s> at the moment they fall upon unhearing ears <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether the announcements about the own resources and the possible postponement of the increase coming about would affect the budget and could he indicate in that case what the implications are for the enlargement of the community by spain and portugal <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the noble lord the chief whip a question about the business arranged for rd july <e> <s> the house has known for some time that a debate on the report of the eec select committee on agriculture and the environment and on the report of the science and technology committee on research into the same subjects had been arranged for rd july <e> <s> it had been understood that hopefully government business would be light on that day in order to allow a reasonable time for the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the house will agree that the noble lord must be being over-optimistic <e> <s> there are bound to be amendments on third reading from all parts of the house <e> <s> lately third readings have been taking much longer <e> <s> i am sure there will also be statements about the various national happenings <e> <s> i know that serious discussions have taken place through the usual channels and i do not accuse the noble lord of discourtesy <e> <s> nobody knows better than i how difficult the arrangement of business is <e> <s> nevertheless i think that the house has been treated rather badly over this <e>", "<cs> my lords could the noble lord help the house over the position on enlargement <e> <s> we very much welcome the statement from the commission that they look forward to the accession of portugal and spain in january <e> <s> we note also from the statement that the community positions were agreed and communicated to the spanish and portuguese foreign <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for returning to the subject but may i ask the noble lord whether the reports which he is to place in the

tomorrow of the environment ministers <e> <s> of course the noble viscount will know that the european parliament has not yet delivered an opinion on the commissions directive <e> <s> we wondered whether he would be able to indicate to us the kind of line the government will adopt on the commissions directive and if so whether he thinks that agreement is likely tomorrow <e>", "<cs> my lords while i quite understand that the noble earl thinks this is not a suitable opportunity for a debate on the cap may i ask him a question about the community farm prices <e> <s> the house will know that these negotiations are still being carried on <e> <s> can he tell us something about what effect if any the outcome of these negotiations may have on the new budget and on the inter-governmental agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble baroness lady young for setting out so clearly the provisions of this difficult and technical bill <e> <s> i am glad to join in

note of that report at the end of the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord sits down may i say that i have no fears of a hydra-headed monster appearing in the european parliament <e> <s> it is just that i think it will develop as all parliamentary bodies develop and we wish it luck <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this house takes note of the report of the european communities committee on the single european act and parliamentary scrutiny in the house of lords <e>", "<cs> my lords may i wish the noble baroness many happy returns of the day <e> <s> is

impartially <e> <s> is she further aware that there is only one thing wrong with the world service and that is that it is almost impossible to hear it at home <e>", "<cs> my lords since the research into genetic disorders is now proving so successful and promises so much for the future health of the country in mitigating historic scourges such as haemophilia familial cancer and so on will the noble earl bring especially to the attention of his right honourable friend the secretary of state the suggestions made by the noble countess <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the whole house is grateful for the opportunity given to the women in the house of lords especially in view of the results which show that it was necessary <e> <s> will the noble lord bring that to the attention of other departments and in particular to the attention of another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i intervene for a moment only because i had the privilege of serving for many years on the board of governors of great ormond street hospital and eventually was chairman of the board <e> <s> i saw for myself the devotion and inspired work that were present all the time <e> <s> the brilliance of
