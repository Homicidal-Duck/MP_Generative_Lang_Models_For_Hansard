that during his review it would be as well to take into account the fact that the present european community and british policy of giving aid largely on an area basis is not always fair because

take into account for instance in the london area the docklands and the park royal estate in harlesden <e>", "<cs> my lords the last occasion on which we in this house held a debate exclusively devoted to greece was i believe on th february more than six and a half years ago when we discussed the fact that greece was in the hands of a military junta and those of us who spoke expressed the hope first put into words by the then minister lady tweedsmuir that greece would very soon be restored to democracy <e> <s> at that time we could not know how soon that happy event would come to pass <e> <s> little more than a year later greece was again a democratic state and it was no coincidence that it was europe that put perhaps the greatest pressure on greece to bring her institutions back to democratic process <e> <s> it was the european community by freezing her relations with greece and the council of europe by suspending greeces membership that made many thinking greeks on the fringe of junta circles realise that without this link greece really had no way forward in the international arena <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the

<e> <s> i am very glad that the noble lord the leader of the opposition has given that further explanation <e> <s> i trust that that is the only reason why he advocates caution in this matter and that

parliaments resolution went considerably further than any statement which was made on behalf of the nine foreign ministers <e> <s> can he give an indication of what efforts have been made within the political co-operation machinery of the nine to make further progress along the lines of the european parliaments resolution <e> <s> is there any proposal to discuss this resolution high technology

of the hamburg forum in the reports which from time to time appear in the <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister confirm however that the helsinki agreement must be seen as a whole and that those parts of it which concern scientific co-operation and which are dear to the hearts of the soviet <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join with others who have congratulated my noble friend lord newall on introducing this extremely timely debate on arms sales overseas <e> <s> at a time when our arms sales in various parts of the middle east are severely hit by international crisis and various disagreeable events in saudi arabia and iran it is particularly appropriate that we should concentrate our minds on how the situation can be remedied <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may interrupt the noble lord lord peart <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> i wonder though how aware he is of the very slender resources available to the bbc in broadcasting to afghanistan in terms of staff and more importantly in terms of equipment and particularly transmitter equipment <e> <s> does he not agree that at a time of great crisis in the world and in particular in that part of the world it is not appropriate to implement cuts in the bbc service in that area in particular and will he undertake to take a particular look at the broadcasting services to afghanistan and see whether broadcasting <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware of the special problems of long-term unemployment in areas of urban decay such as the london borough of brent and would he not agree that the eec social fund has a special role to play in retraining and training schemes in such areas especially since we in this country gain per cent <e> <s> of the funds from the eec social fund <e>", "<cs> my lords it was a measure i feel sure of the secretary of states concern for the continuing war in afghanistan that led him to make this latter point in one of his fascinating <e>", "<cs> my lords i must at the outset declare an interest in two respects first that i am an underwriting member at lloyds and secondly that i represent an area in north west london many of whose electors work in the insurance industry <e> <s> it is in this second respect that i congratulate the noble lord lord plowden and his colleagues on the select committee who have brought their traditional and usual expertise and care to bear on a very serious and complicated problem of european legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg the houses pardon <e> <s> i remind the house that this agreement which was signed by my noble friend the secretary of state provided that the restrictions which have existed in gibraltar since would be lifted and that immediately upon that event there would be talks between the british and spanish governments on any proposal that might be put forward by either side <e> <s> it was also provided that there would be full reciprocity of rights between the people of spain and the people of gibraltar during these talks <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been an extremely interesting well-attended and vigorous debate and i am grateful to all noble lords who have taken part and in particular to my noble friend the secretary of state for finding time in an extremely busy schedule to reply at the end of our remarks <e> <s> it is particularly appropriate that he has been able to do so since it was he who signed the lisbon agreement last april <e> <s> i am also grateful to the noble lord lord goronwy-roberts for adding with his usual eloquence a valuable contribution to our debate and for making it clear how much we want to smooth spains re-entry into the western world and i believe he said also the european community <e>", "<cs> perhaps he was not speaking entirely for his party on that <e>", "<cs> i am delighted to hear that my lords <e> <s> the noble lord lord gladwyn indicated that he thought a solution might lie in autonomy provisions eventually being laid before spanish communities <e> <s> i cannot of course speak for the people of gibraltar but it is my impression that any such idea at the moment would not be acceptable to more than a handful of people in that territory but of course that is for them to determine

docks only eight of our fellow community members have an entry point assigned to them and that greeks have to go through the all other countries entry point <e> <s> is he aware of the furore that has been caused in the greek press and among greek public opinion at the idea of their citizens being so obviously separated from others and does he not appreciate the damage that is being done to the understanding of the european community in this country by the removal of the eec nationals designation at various entry points <e> <s> can no way out be found of this most unsatisfactory situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking my noble friend for that rather disappointing reply may i ask him whether he is aware that it has been estimated that some million a year of public money could be saved by fixing a single seat for the european parliament <e> <s> may i ask him whether he agrees with any such estimate and whether he accepts the fact that the people of this country and others would be far more effectively represented by members of the european parliament who were able to establish a single seat <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister please confirm that the present system of fixing air fares within the eec member states is totally illegal under the treaty of rome <e> <s> has not his department determined that this is the case <e> <s> also could he please tell us whether he is aware of the legal action that will soon be brought by myself against the eec commission for fixing air fares and arranging an illegal cartel <e> <s> does he appreciate the fact that if he and his department continue to connive at this illegal arrangement he may find himself before the european court of justice as well <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all anxious to hear further details of the foreign secretarys visit to moscow <e> <s> may i take it that he will be giving those details in another parliament tomorrow <e> <s> may i ask him to confirm that his visit to moscow was a supreme example of the usefulness of political co-operation among the ten <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to those noble lords who have spoken in this important debate <e> <s> i think one result that will come of it whatever happens in a few minutes time will be that the people of gibraltar will be flattered that so many big guns have been out and brought to bear on this question <e> <s> indeed some of the artillery that has appeared could perhaps be compared with the very large guns that were trained upon them during the siege in which the ancestors of some noble lords took part <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps it will help if i intervene at this stage and say a few words about the amendment proposed by my noble friend and the effect as i believe it upon clause <e> <s> i am very grateful to my noble friend for saying that he does not wish in this particular amendment to challenge the principle established by your lordships by a considerable majority when this matter was considered in committee <e> <s> his quarrels are merely with the drafting of the new clause which is now called clause <e> <s> i have one or two observations to make on my noble friend lord rentons speech of a few monemts ago <e>", "<cs> my lords in spite of what my noble friend said at the close of his remarks i should like very much to welcome my noble friends constructive approach to clause as evidenced by this amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i welcome indeed the amendment wholeheartedly and by and large the spirit in which my noble friend has moved it <e> <s> i hasten to assure my noble friend that the government of gibraltar whom i have consulted over this matter have no objection whatever to the amendment proposed by my noble friend <e> <s> indeed i think they would agree with much of what he has said that it is appropriate that under this clause which i trust will remain in the bill at the end of the day gibraltarians should have the power to apply for registration as british citizens by descent <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that a humble address be presented to her majesty in the following terms <e>", "<cs> my lords her royal highness has endeared herself to millions of people in this country and to hundreds of millions throughout the world through her warmth and beauty <e> <s> it is not only her personal qualities which have come to be appreciated by us at home and abroad but also i believe the symbol of having for the first time for many decades a princess of wales able to attend the opening of parliament because since the early part of this century there has not been a princess of wales and we have lacked the symbolism of a princess of wales in the continuity of the hereditary monarchy by which we set such store <e>", "<cs> my lords beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that rather encouraging reply <e> <s> i wonder though whether he will consider consulting with our nine european community partners on this point with a view to making a joint approach to the american administration to encourage the passing through the congress of this bill which would certainly improve relations between the united states and european nations all of whom i believe would qualify under the non-immigrant visa waiver bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his assurance that the government seek to increase the allowance <e> <s> would he though indicate to us whether he seeks an increase not only in line with inflation but also in real terms <e> <s> would he accept the principle that travellers holidaymakers should at the end of the day be allowed to bring in a reasonable amount of goods for their own use <e> <s> after all we are meant to have a common market <e>", "<cs> my lords i am encouraged to believe that some good may come out of even such a deplorable incident as this <e> <s> i have been very encouraged by the unity shown by speakers in this house and by your lordships united determination to support my noble friend the foreign secretarys contention that the falkland islands must be restored to self-determination and british sovereignty as soon as possible <e> <s> i am also encouraged by the early successes that the government have achieved in rallying support for our case in the international fora <e> <s> i think that my noble friends new procedures in the ten member states of the european community have been shown to be a very great triumph and the fact that he has got such support from them so quickly is a measure of his success when he was president in office of european community states <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i wonder whether he is aware of the tremendous public feeling on this issue particularly among young people and of the volume of mail that has been sent to parliamentarians from constituents on this subject <e> <s> will he also confirm that there is in progress at present a scientific survey as to the ecological position of hood and harp seals <e> <s> if that survey should show that the future of these species is indeed in danger will he consider very seriously imposing a total ban on the import of seal products <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend indicate whether or not the united kingdom have guaranteed the territorial integrity of guyana <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to amend the law about the qualification of electors at elections of representatives to the assembly of the european communities so as to extend the franchise to british citizens resident in other member states of the european communities <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this

second reading or indeed to pass it <e> <s> a member of the european parliament represents not the british institutions <e>", "<cs> my lords i am of course grateful to my noble friend for the qualified welcome that he gave to the second reading of this bill and for the assurance that he and his noble friends on the front <e>", "<cs> i am glad at last to be getting one or two cheers from my front bench <e> <s> perhaps the third will follow at some later date <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend tell me whether while flying to europe over the past two years he has noticed that the partition dividing club-class from eurobudget-class has been moving steadily from the front towards the back of the aircraft until as he has just pointed out on some flights it has disappeared entirely <e> <s> in his talks with the caa and british airways will my noble friend point out that the club-class was introduced as an alternative to the then economy class and that british airways ought to provide the two services since it was on that basis that it put the original proposals for ratification by the caa <e>", "<cs> my lords surely my noble friend would agree that it is dangerous and inappropriate to leave these matters to the commercial judgment of british airways when british airways are part of a cartel which fixes these prices conspiratorially together with the other airlines on the route <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend allow me to ask him one question <e>", "<cs> before he starts could my noble friend accept that no-one in this debate has suggested that mr papusoiu was a political dissident <e>", "<cs> my noble friend used the word dissident <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down can he please finally tell us what has happened to mr papusoius belongings <e>", "<cs> my lords i mentioned it in my speech <e>", "<cs> my lords thank you <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that answer <e> <s> will he confirm that britain does not discriminate on an individual basis against representatives of these soviet bodies which with us are members of the inter-parliamentary union whereas the soviet government do discriminate and pick and choose on an individual basis between british parliamentarians <e> <s> therefore will he agree that the time has come to redress this imbalance and deal with applications from soviet so-called parliamentarians on the basis of reciprocity <e>", "<cs> my lords how can there be parliamentary dialogue between the soviet union and britain when the soviet side are allowed to pick and choose with which british parliamentarians they have a dialogue <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the sentiments she has expressed are shared by many people on this side of the house as well and also that the european parliament has more or less unanimously voted for the release of nelson mandela <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that some of these schemes have been partially financed by grants from the european social fund especially in the london area <e> <s> would he agree that that is a useful way of proceeding and of bringing to fruition more schemes for the benefit particularly of areas of urban deprivation <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to amend the law relating to the qualification of electors at elections of representatives to the assembly of the european communities so as to extend the franchise to british citizens resident in other member states of the european communities <e> <s> i beg to move that the bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> your lordships will be relieved to hear that this debate will be considerably shorter than the one that has preceded it and i hope that it will be less controversial <e> <s> it enhances a principle which i believe is shared by all members of your lordshipshouse a democratic principle which says that those who are citizens of a country or a community and who pay its taxes should be entitled to vote for those who supervise the legislature or the administration of that political unit <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble friend and to the noble lord lord underhill for saying that they will not oppose the principle of the bill that i have introduced this evening <e> <s> i should also like to thank my noble friend for the kind remarks that he made about attempts to draft the bill a complicated bill and in this respect i wish in particular to thank my european parliament colleague mr alan tyrell who was the main draftsman in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join with all those noble lords who have congratulated the noble lord lord brimelow on his excellent report <e> <s> i should like to join with those who say that if there is any fault in this document it is that it does not go far enough it is not vigorous enough in its criticism of the present system of motor-car pricing because what after all is the situation that we are expected to approve and live with <e> <s> a british automobile manufacturing industry which is

tenuous links with this country <e>", "<cs> before the minister winds up may i add a couple of remarks to what has been said by the movers of this amendment <e> <s> i think the trouble with the bill at the moment is that it does not sufficiently distinguish between those people who emigrate from the united kingdom and those who go abroad for a period intending to return <e> <s> there have always been people who have left our shores for perfectly valid <e>", "<cs> i should like to make a couple of additional points <e> <s> the first refers to taxation <e> <s> any british citizen wherever he

in this country or in any of the other nine <e> <s> this is the major part of the income of the european community and it is paid by us whether we reside here or there <e> <s> on the principle that there should be no taxation without representation i would suggest that all british citizens resident anywhere in the community are entitled to representation <e>", "<cs> if my noble friend will allow me to interrupt him does he recall that some two or three years ago several of us raised this point and at that time we were informed that nothing could be done with regard to a common electoral system except as a package <e> <s> indeed private members bills were introduced on this point <e> <s> however we were so to speak delayed with the excuse that only by a package agreement on the franchise and on the method of election could agreement be reached in the council and no agreement was reached on the franchise <e>", "<cs> i can reply to the noble lord who has just resumed his seat by saying that there is no european community dimension to this matter so far as i am aware <e> <s> it simply seems to me a matter of common sense and common justice <e> <s> i spoke in the spirit of a quotation from a white paper issued in with the agreement of the labour party then in government of the conservative party and of the liberal party <e> <s> i hoped that my noble friend the minister in his remarks would be able to answer the specific question i put to him as to whether the government are still in favour of that clause in the white paper and the clause in the parliament no <e> <s>

very much take on board some of the points he made but i do not take the point that this is not a suitable matter to be discussed on this bill <e> <s> we have discussed the whole realm of extensions of the franchise to many groups of people <e> <s> we have discussed the extension of voting in the house of commons to servants of the european community in brussels and luxembourg <e> <s> who are we

european air travel will be more easily and quickly brought about as a result of legal action and pursuance of such activities as those referred to by my noble friend <e> <s> will he confirm that the government will now immediately take action under article to set rules to enforce the competition articles of the treaty <e> <s> will he also undertake to co-operate in every legal step which is taken to pursue those airlines which still fix fares and pool revenue in contravention of the treaty and make sure that they are not allowed to practice and to do business in this country anymore <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend not aware though that his department has in the recent past undertaken i believe in public to take action under article in the eventuality of a breakdown of this agreement by the end of june this year <e> <s> am i to understand that the government are now reconsidering the question and may in the event not take action under article <e>", "<cs> i should like to join with other noble lords who congratulated the noble lord lord ezra on introducing the debate at a timely moment when the government and members of your lordships house are right to concentrate on the whole question of the internal market and particularly on the issue of fiscal approximation tabled by the commission in august last year which has been the subject of so much misrepresentation in the media in recent weeks <e> <s> i congratulate my noble friend lord rees also on a most charming maiden speech in particular the way in which he described in modest and engaging terms his path along the road to damascus on the vexed question of the exchange rate of the european monetary system like my noble friend lady elles i welcome him to those who have taken the more european line on this point <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to repeal section of the official secrets act and to make new provision for the protection of official information and articles for the publication of certain documents and for connected purposes <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly be frank <e> <s> i think it is extremely unlikely that the bill will eventually pass <e> <s> the noble lord will perhaps know better than i about the time constraints that bind us in all parties and about the priorities put forward by the whips on both sides of the house <e> <s> of course i remain open to persuasion on that point <e> <s> however i should have thought it extremely unlikely that we shall be able to find time between now and the end of this session to take the bill through all its stages <e> <s> i cannot say definitely but having made all the research possible i think it most unlikely <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i made myself clear to the house <e> <s> i hope that i pointed out that it would be the obligation of the civil servant who put forward the public interest defence to prove that what he had disclosed was in the public interest <e> <s> that would be a very severe gravamen upon him <e> <s> merely to have gone through the official channels would not be sufficient <e> <s> he would have to prove to a jury that what he had done was in the public interest <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg the noble lord not to use the word courage again <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank all those who have spoken in this debate and in particular the two maiden speakers the noble and learned lord lord donaldson and the noble lord lord knights both of whom gave extremely urbane and interesting speeches <e> <s> my only regret is the fact that because these interventions were their first in your lordships house they were unable to go too far into the merits or otherwise of the bill <e> <s> however i feel confident that as both have shown an interest in this matter they will be able to participate in a full and frank way when it again comes before your lordships house after publication of the white paper which i trust will be before the end of june this year <e>", "<cs> thank you <e> <s> i am disarmed by the noble lords frank admission of that fact <e> <s> when noble lords opposite were in office this question could have been tackled <e> <s> in my file i have for instance a particularly illiberal document on the matter signed by that great libertarian the noble and learned lord lord gardiner who made what i regard as very unenlightened decisions on the question of the protection of information <e> <s> however i do not think we need go too deeply into even the <e>", "<cs> i can think of several reasons <e> <s> this government is the first government to have given an absolute undertaking with a time limit that they will bring forward proposals for legislation <e> <s> that is more than the liberal party which introduced the official secrets act in has done or the labour party has done <e> <s> at least under this conservative government we shall i am sure get a bill within a year and that is more than noble lords opposite have ever been able to say <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to join with others who have congratulated the government both on confounding their many critics in this area and also on showing comprehensively that one should not always believe what one read in the press <e> <s> the fact that the government are proposing not to introduce a ministerial fiat over official secrets will have a widespread welcome <e> <s> it is excellent that under the proposed legislation the courts will decide what constitutes damage to the national interest <e>", "<cs> my lords we must all he extremely grateful to the noble earl for introducing this debate <e> <s> he probably more than any of us knows the problems that prevail in the london borough of brent he lives there <e> <s> my noble friend lady cox lives there but unfortunately she is unable to be here this evening <e> <s> many however will be unaware of the enormity of the problem and of the fact that in a mere -minute drive from this great palace of westminster and this salubrious city of westminster on a trafficless evening it is possible to arrive at a veritable island of poverty and despair <e> <s> it is a place divided against itself by the profligacy and extravagance of a few people who were elected to run the borough of brent but who have failed dismally in their duty to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble earl <e> <s> i think he mentioned <e>", "<cs> my lords what the noble lord said just then is fair comment <e> <s> i urge him to follow the advice of the noble earl a moment ago and to withdraw what he said about a veneer of sympathy and about hypocrisy <e> <s> bearing in mind that the noble lord lord graham of edmonton may disagree with the noble earl and myself i do not think that he should accuse us of speaking with insincerity <e> <s> that is not correct <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to ask the noble lord again but i should like him to confirm that what he is alleging is that i am mistaken <e> <s> he is not alleging i trust that i am being deliberately deceitful or misleading <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> in the noble lords comprehensive defence of brent councils race relations policy does he include the appointment of mr kuba assegai as a governor of a brent school <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that answer but is she aware that in my local supermarket a dozen eggs which cost about a year ago now cost between and representing an increase of about one-third <e> <s> is she further aware that that compares with an increase in the price of butter of only one penny from pence to pence for grammes <e> <s> does she not feel that egg producers should try not to increase the price of their product by so much in one calendar year and that it would help to solve the economic problems which they have faced in recent weeks if they were to keep their prices down <e>", "<cs> my lords surely my noble friend would agree that an egg is an egg and that an increase of one-third in the price over one year is quite extraordinary bearing in mind the general level of inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that answer <e> <s> however is my noble friend aware that passengers crossing the atlantic can sometimes be kept waiting either at kennedy airport or heathrow airport for one or two hours at the height of the season and that it makes greater sense therefore to clear such people before a long flight rather than after it <e> <s> further would he not agree that if there can be any benefit in terms of saving lives or lessening the terrorist menace then that would be a very great step forward and not just an incidental benefit <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremly grateful to my noble friend for the courteous and lucid way in which he has introduced this private bill <e> <s> i should say at the outset that i agree per cent <e> <s> with the <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i understand that dobbie and company have proposed that the railway should go underground very shortly after leaving the main line at southall <e> <s> it should travel underground through agricultural land <e> <s> i am advised that the extra cost of adopting this route would be in the region of million or per cent <e> <s> of the total cost <e> <s> however i believe that the extra cost would be mitigated and perhaps my noble friend will care to comment on this later in the debate by the fact that there would be far less necessity compulsorily to purchase property in building this enterprise <e> <s> the tunnelling would be a major undertaking while the railway is being built but it would not require the compulsory acquisition of very much property <e> <s> perhaps my noble friend would care to indicate whether the compensation to be paid to owners of property and others who will suffer the loss of their amenities has been included in the estimates put forward <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend therefore reassure me i think i understood him correctly that the promoters of the bill have not wholly ruled out the dobbie route <e>", "<cs> my lords with the greatest respect to the noble lord these areas provide scope for a jury decision because in each case with the exception of matters of security and intelligence a jury will have to decide whether damage has been done to the national interest <e> <s> i believe that juries will take into account all the facts that are put before them in such a case <e> <s> in the example of stores which was raised by the noble lord lord hutchinson it will be perfectly <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> however with the benefit of hindsight does he agree that it was a serious error for the then government to have invited to this country someone whose government represented a regime with almost the worst human rights record in europe at that time <e> <s> does he agree that we should consider very carefully before allowing governments to invite someone like president ceausescu to this country on a state visit as opposed to a government to government visit <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend advise the house whether the romanian government have yet apologised for the beating up of the british ambassador in bucharest <e>", "<cs> my lords clearly i failed to persuade my noble friend of the merits of the amendment <e> <s> he outlined very fairly the dispute between us <e> <s> he indicated that in his view it was not appropriate for a jury to take into account the wider national interest when considering whether or not a person should be convicted of a disclosure relating to security and intelligence matters <e> <s> i believe that that is the gravamen of the matter <e> <s> i feel that the wider national interest can and should be relevant to this matter <e> <s> i do not see any reason for putting the security services so high on a pedestal that they are able to do almost anything under the sun without any disclosure about their activities being authorised in such a way as would cause their status to be called into question <e> <s> however it seems that i have not been able to persuade the government that that is correct <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe my noble friend is quite correct that those former members of the services should not be adversely affected by the bill provided that the criteria remain the same <e> <s> those who will be affected are historians who have had no connection with the services but who seek information on past events from former members of the services <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps my noble friend will give way <e> <s> i accept that in the case of former members of the services permission has been given only rarely <e> <s> however does he not agree that since there have been hundreds and maybe even thousands of books and publications based on disclosures made to non-former members by former members forming part of their work clearly permission for such disclosures must have been given not rarely in the past but extremely frequently to make up the body of work available on the secret world in the libraries <e> <s> can my noble friend assure us that that practice will not be changed and that permission for disclosures will be given reasonably frequently <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that very full explanation of why he feels unable to support the amendment <e> <s> i am grateful to him also for clarifying a number of points raised in my opening remarks and in the course of this debate <e> <s> i am particularly grateful to him for pointing out that historians and writers who are not former members of the services may go to the d-notice committee <e> <s> that will be of interest to many of my colleagues when writing history <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> however is he aware that last year tonnes of raw ivory were imported into hong kong <e> <s> does he agree with me that it is extremely likely that a large proportion of that raw ivory was poached through illegal killing in africa <e> <s> does he not agree that it would now be appropriate for the hong kong government to impose a total ban on the import of new ivory into that territory alongside the ban to be imposed by the united kingdom and other european community countries <e> <s> will the government encourage the hong kong government to impose such a ban <e>", "<cs> my lords i join with noble lords in welcoming the amendment <e> <s> it is thoroughly to be applauded from two points of view <e> <s> the first is from that of civil liberties <e> <s> it is wrong that someone who inhabits a private dwelling should be subject to search without a warrant <e> <s> that is particularly so because clause makes it clear that force may be used in carrying out a search <e> <s> secondly it is right that the normal rules which bind the police in such matters should be applicable to any search made of a private dwelling wherever that may be <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may detain your lordships because through absence elsewhere i was unable to take part in the previous stages of the bill <e> <s> again i declare my interest as a representative of the police federation <e> <s> i welcome this bill <e> <s> however i invite my noble friend to say a few more words about the wide powers which this bill confers upon ministers to appoint private security employees to various jobs in ports and airports <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to beg the houses pardon for intervening earlier <e> <s> i add my support to this bill <e> <s> i believe that it is important from the point of view of the police federation that as much attention as possible is paid to the guidelines mentioned by my noble friend at earlier stages <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to my noble friend for that very gratifying reply <e> <s> is he aware how particularly pleasing that will be to the polish community in this country many of whom lost relatives during the katyn massacre <e> <s> does the minister know how anxious they are that justice should be done in this terrible matter albeit years after the event <e> <s> i ask my noble friend or his right honourable friend to point out to soviet representatives that a war crime is a war crime whether authorised by hitler or stalin and that if we in britain <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that in parts of turkey political dissidents are frequently arrested detained for a few days beaten up tortured and then released without charge as a deterrent to their political activity <e> <s> does he share my judgment that turkey has probably the worst human rights record of any european country now with the possible exception of albania <e> <s> since turkey is our ally should we not urgently try to do something about it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that answer <e> <s> however is he aware that individual russians are now usually able to visit this country on a non-official basis for the first time since <e> <s> does he agree that this is a tremendous step forward in relations between the soviet union and this country and that it would be a terrible shame if that was spoilt by a lack of resources a lack of accommodation or any other bureaucratic problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend the minister for that reply <e> <s> however can he say whether his right honourable friend has pointed out to <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join those noble lords who congratulated the noble lord lord shepherd on his excellent report <e> <s> it is a true and exhaustive contribution to the long-standing debate on civil aviation policy and the controversy over the high cost of european air travel <e> <s> as one who has taken some interest in this question in recent years i <e>", "<cs> my lords i join with noble lords in congratulating the noble lord lord benson on his initiative in introducing this debate on a vital subject affecting every citizen in the european community <e> <s> the noble lord indicated that european community fraud could be as high as billion a year <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord templeman suggested that it might be as high as billion a year <e> <s> the discrepancy in the figures indicates the enormity of the problem and the fact that we do not know how large it is <e> <s> certainly however it is very large and every possible effort must be made to combat it <e>"]
