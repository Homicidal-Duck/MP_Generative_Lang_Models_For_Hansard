["<cs> my lords it is indeed a privilege for me to be able to make my maiden speech in this chamber by the side of my noble friend lord pitt of hampstead <e> <s> as he said we have been associated together for many years in local government if one can call the place across the way local and in other endeavours <e> <s> he speaks from an entirely unique position in this house <e> <s> he is probably as sorry as i am that it is quite so unique he would probably prefer it were less so and i shall have something to say about that shortly <e> <s> my noble friends words carry weight not only because of that but because of his long experience of the subject and i hope that the government have been listening to what he said and will take account of it when they reply <e>", "<cs> i hope it will not be felt indecent by your lordships if i add a few words on this amendment so soon after making my maiden speech <e> <s> my excuse for doing so is that in the other place i served on a committee dealing with a similar bill and thus became slightly engaged in the esoteric discussion which this kind of bill provokes <e> <s> it seems to me that your lordships should take advantage of the movers kindness in suggesting that the change might be made <e> <s> it seems to me that the word exposed has a more deliberate connotation than the word open <e> <s> the word open suggests an accidental display whereas the word exposed has a rather more deliberate connotation <e> <s> if your lordships feel that too then there is much to be said for the amendment and in view of the feeling which has been expressed by noble lords opposite perhaps your lordships will feel disposed to accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> i share the concern of my noble friend lord houghton of sowerby about the appropriateness of an attempt occurring in this type of offence <e> <s> i found him very persuasive when he suggested that the offence was either committed or not committed and that an attempt to commit was hardly appropriate in this particular context <e> <s> i was not entirely convinced by the answer and i hope that my noble friend will not be easily deterred from pressing his amendment <e>", "<cs> i also would like to add a few words in support of the amendment <e> <s> i was on the joint parliamentary committee which decided to abolish the role of the lord chamberlain as censor <e> <s> there was great concern among theatre managers at that time that the consequences of the abolition of the role of the lord chamberlain would be that a series of private prosecutions would be launched and that they would not know where they were anything could happen to anybody anywhere <e> <s> no one knew when a show went on the road whether if in this that or the other town it might suddenly be stopped <e> <s> it was then decided as the noble lord lord houghton has said that no prosecution should be launched without the <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government reconsider their position on this matter <e> <s> will they recall that the late lord louis mountbatten described the old roman precept <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government aware that their upholding of the right to strike will be widely approved <e> <s> are the government further aware that working peoples solidarity is as commendable in this country as it is in poland <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord say how many local authorities have made <e>", "<cs> my lords may i not <e>", "<cs> my lords i must record my regret at this and also my regret at the failure of the <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that his own estimate given on bbc radio last year of the effect of civil defence measures was that in the event of the kind of nuclear attack that he expects the number of survivors might rise from million to million <e>", "<cs> but my lords it was the noble lords own statement <e> <s> will he not confirm in this house what he is willing to say outside <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lady ewart-biggs has dealt most comprehensively with the substance of the bill as indeed have other noble friends on this side of the house <e> <s> therefore i shall not attempt to match what they have said <e> <s> however i should like to say one or two words about the form which the bill takes <e> <s> before doing so may i apologise to the noble lord lord belstead for the fact that i missed the opening sentences of his introductory speech which was very properly praised by my noble friend lord mishcon with the qualification that he felt and i think rightly felt that it was perhaps a rather low-level speech which sought to present a bill of very considerable importance as though it were a minor measure of no great consequence <e> <s> of course the noble lord lord belstead is an expert in this line <e> <s> he is capable of presenting a nuclear explosion as though it were a firework <e> <s> i have had occasion to criticise that on another occasion and i hope to do so again <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the statement that this green paper is coming will be very widely welcomed <e> <s> would he be so good as to say whether it is expected that the green paper will cover the recommendations of the whitford report and in particular their recommendations in relation to performers rights and to possible amendments to the performing rights act <e>", "<cs> my lords when the question of afghanistan comes under discussion will the noble lord the foreign secretary bear in mind that any successor rgime to the present soviet-backed rgime is not likely to be a democracy certainly not a western-type democracy but a type of rgime compared with which the present government in iran would be regarded as liberal and progressive <e>", "<cs> my lords i must offer my regret that my name does not appear on the official list of speakers <e> <s> that is due to a misunderstanding which was entirely my fault <e> <s> none the less i trust that your lordships will bear with me in the circumstances and allow me to offer a few observations on this difficult problem <e> <s> i say that it is a difficult problem but there is no real ideological difference here <e> <s> the labour party is not a party which is opposed to the development corporation as such <e> <s> indeed historically i think it can be claimed that the labour party is the father and mother of the development corporation <e> <s> so from that point of view the party is not in principle opposed <e> <s> the real question is whether this particular proposal is one which ought to obtain our support and i am bound to say that i was deeply impressed by the remarks made from our own front bench by my noble friend lady birk who seemed to me to put forward cogent reasons why this proposal is not one which ought to gain the support of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords may i deny that any statements made by cnd are false <e> <s> may i also ask whether it is the case that there is no effective defence against nuclear war and either we get rid of the bomb or the bomb will get rid of us <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for that explanation but i am still a little worried at the use of the word elsewhere <e> <s> the noble lord has explained that in this case elsewhere does not mean elsewhere and that what it means is not precisely what i have said it means or what the noble lord said it means but that it means something different from what the noble lord has said it means <e> <s> if the government were to say we recognise that the word elsewhere is altogether too wide and we will institute a form of words other than elsewhere which will mean what we say it means then i would be very happy not to press this amendment <e> <s> can the noble lord say that <e>", "<cs> then i wish to move my amendment <e>", "<cs> my noble friend has been so brief that he renders it possible for me to add a few <e>", "<cs> my lords the bill is unique in at least two respects <e> <s> the first is that the primary reason for the penalty which is adduced in the bill disqualification from standing for parliament is one which may be exacted in any country in the world <e> <s> in other words the guilt for which the penalty may be exacted may be found not only in this country but anywhere else in the world <e> <s> the word elsewhere means elsewhere <e> <s> therefore we in these houses of parliament are saying that in determining the question of guilt we shall allow the laws of any country to apply <e> <s> as i said at second reading this must be unique <e> <s> i cannot think of any other measure which has ever passed through parliament in which parliament has said that we shall decide that the guilt determined in any country whether we approve or disapprove of that country whether it be a dictatorship or any other kind of country will be the determining factor as to whether or not the penalty applies <e>", "<cs> my lords all of us i think or at least most of us are in favour of the basic objective of this bill though some of us have some worries about it in detail <e> <s> my main concern about it almost my only concern i think is the freedom it gives to the introduction of private prosecution <e> <s> i was a little worried that the noble lord lord nugent and i think the government take the same view felt unable to accept an amendment put down for the purpose of trying to limit the amount of private prosecution which was possible under the bill <e> <s> i myself intended to put down an amendment to that effect at report stage <e> <s> in fact i did put it down unfortunately i had to leave the house at oclock <e> <s> i had hoped that it would come on before that time but unfortunately it came on at past <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that in this establishment i have no cell in which to use my typewriter not even a share of a desk <e> <s> could he consider come reallocation of privileges or use his influence to that effect so that noble lords who are absentees of however ancient lineage are not given priority over working peers newly arrived <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble lord for the courtesy of his reply may i ask him to take note that once again he has simply failed to answer the question <e> <s> may i sit down and give him the opportunity to answer <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that while it is true that the soviet union has a preponderance in certain areas for example the ss and the so-called theatre nuclear missiles all over the preponderance is with the west rather than with the soviet union so that within that disproportion in that area the west is in fact more nuclear armed all over than is the soviet union <e> <s> may i further ask the foreign secretary to say that he will not be put off by any suggestion that his work has not been valuable and will he bear in mind winston churchills dictum that jaw-jaw is better than war-war and persist in pursuing that <e>", "<cs> my lords is this not an example of the undesirable legislation which traditionally stems from the eec <e> <s> would it not be a very good idea if we were to secede from this organisation and thus save ourselves all the consequences of belonging to it <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the noble earl have a word with the institute <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the noble earl agree that another way to tackle this problem would be by issuing a sort of reverse rights issue whereby you substitute one share for two <e> <s> by this means you halve profits and this makes the product more competitive in exactly the same way as the noble viscount proposes <e>", "<cs> my lords i think there are no differences between any of us on the desirability of the police being fully protected by all available means <e> <s> i think perhaps where the difference <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord to accept that there is no difference between us about the question of the complete desirability to provide the police with every possible protection <e> <s> there is however a difference of emphasis when we move on to the question <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry i ought to know this after years in another place <e> <s> may i ask the noble lord to accept also that there is a difference of emphasis between us when we move into the question of retaliatory action by the police <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that cs gas was abandoned some time ago in northern ireland because it was felt to be too dangerous <e> <s> is he further aware that water cannons were described by the northern ireland press office as being worse than useless <e> <s> is he further aware that people in northern ireland have been killed by plastic bullets <e> <s> when we move into this area is the noble lord aware that some of us feel that great caution needs to be used before any freedom of action is allowed in that way and that this is a matter which should remain firmly under the control of the government <e>", "<cs> if i may say a word in support of my noble friends amendment it seems to me that the object of all these amendments taken together is to strengthen the position so far as the applicant is concerned <e> <s> i believe the situation in which we are in in the country at the moment requires this to be done <e> <s> it seems to me that to place the applicant in the position of having to demonstrate that he is of good character places him in an extraordinary position <e> <s> what is of good character <e> <s> which of us here if required to prove that could not be found faulty in one respect or another by anyone who wanted to show that we are of bad character <e> <s> it seems to me that the reversal of the onus of proof to require the home secretary to show that the person is of bad character is a simple piece of justice <e> <s> it seems to me therefore taking the group of amendments and in particular the one moved by my noble friend unless the noble lord who will be answering is able to put up a very convincing case against these amendments among them are some which i think ought to be pressed in order to improve the bill <e> <s> otherwise we should be accused i think of going through some sort of stately saraband in this house while outside citizens are at this very moment living in something approaching a police state in a borough next to the one in which live <e> <s> this is a situation in which the people feel themselves to be living under that condition and whatever noble lords may think those people feel themselves to be living in that situation <e> <s> we have therefore a duty to look after this group as best we can and make sure that the conditions in this bill are such as to turn the scales a little bit for once in their favour <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that it is the official policy of the labour party that local authorities should reject the pretence of civil defence against nuclear war and should oppose nuclear weapons being deployed in their areas <e> <s> will he encourage his government to think again about their policy on this matter having regard to the considerable doubts that there are among many people about his governments nuclear weapons policy not excluding leading military figures <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may bring the house a little nearer to agreement on this point would the noble earl agree that this is a subject of immense seriousness which ought to be examined in detail by this house from time to time <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join in the congratulations that have been given to the maiden speakers today <e> <s> i must confess that i did not hear every word of them sometimes one has to leave the chamber but i heard enough to know that the congratulations which were conveyed to the maiden speakers were very well justified <e> <s> i should like to convey this warning to them however <e> <s> their future utterances in this chamber will not necessarily be followed by the same universal acclaim which always greets their initial statements so they must be prepared for the possibility in future that things may not go quite so smoothly as they have done on this occasion <e> <s> none the less i congratulate them <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord may say that but it is not exactly what he said before <e> <s> he is toning it down a bit because he realises that there is an intellectual argument here if only he will take it up and try to deal with it on an intellectual level and not go in for the business of smearing of which the noble lord lord chalfont gave us an example this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i will neither deny nor confirm what the noble lord said <e> <s> i have my own speech to make <e> <s> so far as mccarthyite tactics are concerned i do not play that game <e> <s> i will deal with what i have to say <e> <s> let me get back to a point on which perhaps there may be a little more agreement <e> <s> the usa and the ussr will keep their nuclear weapons until they agree a basis of mutual reduction <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord moves on and as he specifically referred to my speech does he recognise that the leader of our party in another place is himself a unilateralist <e> <s> who is he fighting <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that central governments often believe that local governments are in error whichever side is in power one way or the other <e> <s> if whenever that occurs central government overrules local government what is to happen to local government <e>", "<cs> i regard this bill as one of such complexity that i have tended on the whole to leave it to the experts but i feel i must comment briefly on the point now before the committee <e> <s> my noble friend lord pitt wishes to establish that the category of people with whom he is concerned in the amendment to which i have added my name have an ultimate right a residual right one might say not an immediate right so that it is recognised that they have a right over a period of time to acquire a residence in this country which they lack elsewhere in the world <e> <s> that is what my noble friend is seeking to establish and i should like the minister to address himself to that <e>", "<cs> my lords i want if i may to press the minister on his answer to the last supplementary question <e> <s> may i ask him to consider the possibility that in eliminating as it were the turkish government from this consideration altogether he is failing to use his good offices in a position in which if the government did exert a little pressure at the appropriate time a solution might be found <e> <s> so will he reconsider that answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble viscount agree that the british leyland subsidiary alvis appears to have been involved in this deal <e> <s> will he further agree that it appears to have gone ahead despite the governments embargo on such exports <e> <s> will he make it clear to alvis that they do not escape responsibility by dealing through an intermediary <e>", "<cs> my lords could i press the noble viscount a little further <e> <s> will he take up the point suggested by my noble friend on the front bench that is that at the end of the proceedings a statement will be made to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord not agree that his party is supposed to be the friend of the businessman <e> <s> would he not further agree that some businessmen are beginning to regret the money that they have poured into the conservative party <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for the informative nature of that reply <e> <s> further can he say whether any provision is made for the families of people who are provided with bunker accommodation <e> <s> can he also say what in the event of a nuclear war is to happen to the rest of the population <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord agree that although we might differ in the conclusions that we draw from the information by the comprehensiveness of his answers he shows that he at least agrees with me that the information should be made available <e>", "<cs> to underline the widespread support for this amendment i should like to say a word from these benches in favour of it <e> <s> various reasons have been given in different parts of the committee for supporting the amendment and i wish to go along with all of them <e> <s> the argument which has been put forward that if what has been decided in relation to gibraltar is correct then it is difficult to resist the propriety of this amendment seems to me to be extremely persuasive <e> <s> apart from the question distance the arguments which persuaded the committee in relation to gibraltar are even stronger in relation to the falkland islands <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to underline briefly what the noble lord lord swann has said with particular reference to the bbc transcription services <e> <s> my earliest personal experience of those services was back in when for a short period of time i was seconded to the government of burma and <e>", "<cs> my lords while concentration on the human rights aspects of these discussions is important may i ask the minister whether he agrees that the peace aspects are equally important <e> <s> will the government in giving due consideration to the matters raised by his noble friend not ignore the primary consideration raised by my noble friend lord brockway <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord lyell introduced this motion in such reasonable terms that one might have cause to wonder why it was that this order caused such an uproar when it was debated in another place <e> <s> i think it is rather unusual for the standing committee on statutory instruments to be the scene of such furious debate as occurred when this was debated in another place and for the motion to have gone to a division which as my noble friend pointed out was a pretty close-run thing <e> <s> therefore we need to ask ourselves why it is that a matter which has been put before us as a reasonable and proper thing to do should have caused such dissension elsewhere when it was examined <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord be so kind as to allow me to press him on one point with regard to this <e> <s> he spoke about the question of choice in relation to films <e> <s> will he agree that the <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government aware that there is widespread concern throughout europe at president reagans recent rearmament decisions and that there will be widespread opposition in this country if the government follow the same mistaken course <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord will be aware a number of the members of his party in another place have expressed concern about the course of government economic policy and have put forward a reasonable view that a change ought to occur quickly <e> <s> can the noble lord say what is the position in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that some of us are not particularly proud of the posture of this country towards saudi arabia in relation to the other incident which the noble lord lord chalfont mentioned and are rather glad that it has not been repeated on this occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords since the noble earl has given the figures about exports to the community would he care to give similar figures about our imports from the community <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that it might help to clarify the matter if i were to read to him what i hold in my hand <e>", "<cs> then i will paraphrase it <e> <s> it would be better if i were allowed to quote because what i want to do <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that what i should like to do if i may is to quote to him a statement made in county hall <e>", "<cs> my lords i stand corrected <e> <s> i should like to ask the noble earl whether he is aware that in another place in fact the county hall the chairman of the arts and recreation committee mr tony banks said that he was fully aware that kenwood was not in his own legal possession and that the glc <e>", "<cs> my lords being fairly fresh from another place i am wondering whether the advice which has been given to the noble lord on the difficulty of the proposed amendments is not a little bit heavy <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble lord might be able to go this far can he give us an undertaking that if he finds it possible he will substitute these amendments or will ask his friends in another place to substitute these amendments for the one now proposed <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that the soviet union and the united kingdom have signed the convention on chemical warfare and that the united states has not done so <e> <s> will the noble lord say what proposals the government have for ratifying the convention on chemical warfare <e>", "<cs> my lords when the government make their further statement on this matter may i ask whether they will be dealing not only with the case in point but with the whole question of relationships between central and local government <e> <s> is it not the case that over the years one central government after another have taken away powers from and sought to control local government and will not the government themselves reconsider their whole position in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that there is widespread concern about the spread of nuclear weapons both in the east and the west <e> <s> is he not further aware that the idea of a nuclear-free zone in europe has a respectable origin going as far back as hugh gaitskell and the rapacki plan <e> <s> would he not look again at the governments position in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that what has actually happened in the eight years is that while the discussions have been taking place armaments have proliferated and increased on all sides <e> <s> is it not the case therefore that if a discussion goes on and on and on eventually the inevitable nuclear explosion will occur in which we shall all be destroyed <e> <s> will the government take no action designed to break through the impasse <e>", "<cs> my lord i beg leave to ask the first question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount aware that to my knowledge the speech has not in fact been printed in full in any newspaper <e> <s> in order that noble lords may check for themselves whether or not the quotation accurately represents the speech i have placed copies of the full text of the speech in the library <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that in the speech to which i have referred lord mountbatten specifically condemned the exact quotation which the noble lord has quoted <e> <s> if noble lords doubt that i commend them to the library where they may see it for themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble viscount agree that it is regrettable that apparently arrangements are being made for the continuation of some form of government in the event of nuclear war <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount aware that as between according to estimates and a quarter of a million members or supporters of the campaign for nuclear disarmament gathered in london on sunday it might be difficult to accommodate them as the noble lord lord beloff suggested in the available shelter which the government have provided let alone the million people who are apparently not to be provided for at all <e> <s> is he finally and further aware that the purpose of these questions is to make the public aware of the dangers of nuclear war and of the fact that the government while themselves preparing to use nuclear weapons are making no provision whatsoever for the consequences of such use <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> i must tell the noble lord that what he has just said is quite untrue <e> <s> it is not the case that unilateral disarmament means what he says it means <e> <s> i shall hope to say later to the house what it does mean <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord gore-booth will forgive me if i do not follow him down the interesting paths which he has been outlining to us <e> <s> my reason for not doing so is not that i should not like to do it but that i have a lot to say about nuclear disarmament a matter which has been raised several times and a number of points which i should like to make <e> <s> since i do not want to take up too much of your lordships time i had better not get diverted on to anything other than that <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as could judge from the quotations which the noble lord made i could not offhand see anything to disagree with in the first quotation <e> <s> in regard to the second i am not quite so sure because it was rather interrupted <e> <s> so far as i heard it agree but i should like to qualify that by saying that i would rather read it in the morning <e> <s> so far as i could tell i did not see anything to disagree with in what the noble lord said <e> <s> but i do not know that any statement by a particular member on a certain occasion is necessarily to be regarded as the policy of an organisation <e> <s> we have things like annual general meetings we have documents which set out our policies formally and i feel sure that noble lords on both sides of the house will agree with me that if one takes a statement of any member of the conservative party or of the labour party and asks whether that represents the policy of his party one might find oneself in some difficulty in replying offhand <e>", "<cs> my lords i hear some enthusiasm for that part of my speech if for no other but i think noble lords will admit that i did have rather a lot to reply to and i hope therefore you will bear with me for another few minutes <e>", "<cs> my lords i was going to deal with that at some length as a matter of fact because the next item on my notes is the question should we secede from nato and the noble lord having encouraged me to do so i will spend just a few minutes on that point <e> <s> personally i think not <e> <s> there are some people who think that we should but in my own view our membership of the nuclear-free nations in nato and there are now quite a number of them would give us the collective right to take part in discussions with the warsaw pact countries designed to bring about a lowering of the number of weapons and the achievement first of a balance at the lower level as lord mountbatten put it and finally of a nuclear-free europe <e>", "<cs> my lords we must take governments statements at their face value <e> <s> we have the position at the moment in which as far as our own government are concerned as lord carver has <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that this view is not widely shared outside government circles and that there is growing a consensus of view quite apart from the question of unilateral nuclear disarmament that a first strike war is in being and that something will have to be done to arrest the process <e> <s> therefore is he further aware that it is for the european nations to take part in this matter and that it ought not to be left entirely to negotiations between president reagan and president brezhnev <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the governments apparently slavish addiction to the nuclear weapon is worrying a lot of people who do not share my views about nuclear disarmament <e> <s> therefore will he say whether there are any circumstances in which the government would decide that it was proper for them to consider getting rid of the nuclear weapon <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the noble earl agree that it is really quite scandalous that arrangements were made during the recent civil defence exercises for the evacuation of works of art whereas no such arrangements have been made for the civilian population <e> <s> despite the great reverence that we all have for our art treasures does not our own population deserve a higher priority than that <e>", "<cs> but my lords would not the noble earl agree that in the governments own pamphlet on this matter sweden and switzerland have been held out as examples of efficient civil defence and is not the reason why they are so efficient that they are spending on civil defence money that our government are wasting on nuclear missiles <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for the informative nature of that reply <e> <s> does the governments announcement that they are asking local authorities to look for suitable premises for shelter indicate a change of policy <e> <s> are the government no longer asking people to stay at home and face the consequences of their policies on their own hearths <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that in the event of nuclear war all of us in or out of bunkers will face the same consequences and that the purpose of these questions is to draw public attention to the inutility of the governments policy of depending upon the nuclear weapon for the salvation of our people <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e> <s> i am trying to follow his argument but he began by suggesting that the measures that he proposed would have the effect of increasing the independence of local authorities in relation to the central authority whereas he now seems to be telling us that when local authorities display their independence there is something wrong about it <e>", "<cs> is that really the case my lords <e> <s> would the minister not agree that the governments position in this matter is very inconsistent indeed <e> <s> on the one hand they do not recognise the government individually while on the other they support a completely incongruous decision by the united nations <e> <s> will they look at this again <e>", "<cs> my lords the word recognition was just used by the minister himself <e>", "<cs> no it was used by the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that in giving support to his tactics no one on this side of the house i think is seeking to take <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl give way <e>", "<cs> my lords i want only one moment <e>", "<cs> my lords the last two speakers have done something to rescue the debate from disrepute as a result of the manner in which the noble earl lord kimberley introduced the matter <e> <s> he did a disservice to his own cause and to this house <e> <s> it is not for me to assist his cause but i am concerned about the reputation of your lordships house and parliament <e> <s> the purpose of parliamentary privilege is not to enable noble lords to slander and attack people in a manner which they would not be prepared to do outside this house <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e>", "<cs> my lords in considering what help we should give to the british airports authority would the noble lord consider that it is desirable that further increases of flights into heathrow should be discouraged <e> <s> would he therefore encourage the airports authority to allow for cheaper landing charges at stansted and gatwick rather than heathrow <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords who have spoken in this short debate i appreciate the opportunity given to us by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the minister would take this into consideration that because one gets into the transmission business it does not necessarily mean that one also gets into the receiving business <e> <s> so far as radio and television receivers are concerned the failure of this country to benefit by the relative failure of our private enterprise to match the standards put out by our broadcasting organisations is lamentable <e> <s> our industry on the production and receiving side has let a situation develop in which many of the instruments we listen and view on are not made in this country at all as the noble lord is well aware <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the first question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that the worst fears of the arts organisations have not been realised and that it would be churlish to deny the minister at least two cheers for his achievement <e> <s> would he however ask his colleague to look again at the case of the theatres trust where a grant of has been cut to and an intimation given that next year it may be cut to nil <e> <s> is the noble earl aware that while i must declare an interest as the director of that trust it is the general view that that trust set up by act of parliament performs a very useful public service in safeguarding theatre buildings <e> <s> may i ask the noble lord whether he <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl agree that at this moment it would be appropriate for me to do no more than request him to ask his right honourable friends when the time comes to have another look at the problem of the theatres trust <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that last month the noble and learned lord lord gardiner asked a question on the subject and that the noble lord the minister wrote to him in a rather unsatisfactory way <e> <s> would he agree that this matter is now de-restricted and that noble lords who wish to know what the government say about it are i believe themselves able to refer to a copy of the circular <e> <s> is it not the case that the government must either spend thousands of millions of pounds in providing a proper civil defence or much better spend the money on conventional defence and abandon nuclear weapons <e> <s> will the noble lord at least suggest to his colleagues that this last option be examined <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that without being in favour of any kind of war at all it is possible to think that conventional war is somewhat preferable to nuclear war <e> <s> is he further aware that there are many people inside this house as well as outside it who take the view that the nuclear weapon is not a weapon of war at all <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that dr lunss remark is equally without foundation <e> <s> is he further aware that there is as much substance in these charges as there is in one which i have unearthed myself <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that i have in my pocket evidence of a dastardly red plot <e> <s> this monstrosity invented in hungary can in the hands of clever people be used to present an innocent blue facade to the public while concealing at the back a wholly red interior <e> <s> i refer of course to the dastardly rubiks cube which has diverted the minds of the young people of this country away from constructive thoughts about nuclear war <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord accept that this vicious thing is something which he ought to investigate with the same thoroughness that he would the other matters raised by his noble friends <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble earl for giving way <e> <s> on a point of clarification may i point out that the alteration of that word was made at the suggestion of what is called in the other place the table office i do not know what it is called in this house because they felt that the word impossibility was too contentious for the particular form of debate which was desired on that occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble duke able to answer one question to which i do not know the answer <e> <s> can he say whether his holiness the pope agrees that to threaten to use nuclear arms is not immoral <e>", "<cs> i do not know either <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a pleasure to follow the noble earl and i hope that he will forgive me if i do not follow him very far in the naval waters in which he is so much at home because were i to do so i should speedily find myself completely out of my depth <e> <s> perhaps i may also echo what has been said and thank the noble earl who initiated the debate <e> <s> we cannot talk too often about these matters even if from my point of view they sometimes seem to develop on lines which have a certain repetition to them <e> <s> i have found a tendency for these debates to centre to some extent on an attack on the campaign for nuclear disarmament of which i am the vice-president <e> <s> had i responded to the various things which were said about the cnd with which i did not agree during the course of this debate i would have been jumping up and down like a jack-in-the-box or a yo-yo <e> <s> so i have allowed many things to pass with which i profoundly disagree and i do not intend to try to pick up these points now <e> <s> if i were to try to do so my own remarks would lack any coherence <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor recommend my noble friend to read professor john griffiths <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble viscount for that answer may i ask whether he is in a position to assure the house that although the american weapons on british soil are under as it were american management the british government possess a dual key arrangement and that no such weapon can be fired without the active consent of the government <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that it probably would not comfort the noble lord much if there was a dual key arrangement on the warsaw pact side <e> <s> would the noble viscount confirm that in fact there is no dual key arrangement on this side so far as american nuclear weapons are concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord is aware the allowance is not payable at the later ages <e> <s> can he say whether there is any prospect of the allowance being payable to people of years or so which is not a great age as we now know in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords may i press the noble lord a little further <e> <s> is it not the case that no one over can apply for the allowance and is it not possible that the government might be prepared to receive applications for persons of a later age <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join in the tributes paid to my noble friend lord noel-baker for introducing this short debate and to say that i follow very largely what he had to say <e> <s> indeed if i may venture to do so i should like to strengthen his argument in one small respect <e> <s> he said that japans military and defence expenditure is about per cent <e> <s> of her gross national product <e> <s> in point of fact the expenditure is per cent <e> <s> and that makes my noble friends case even stronger than he had already made it <e> <s> i would not go so far as to say that there is a direct relationship but there can be no reasonable doubt as the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe has just suggested that military expenditure does in fact notably contribute to inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the director of this pro-bomb organisation mr alan lee williams is a defector from the labour party to the social democratic party <e> <s> is he further aware that mr alan lee williams has admitted that this organisation receives a direct grant from nato as well and that one of its main purposes is to campaign against the cnd therefore ought it not to be entitled the campaign for nuclear armament <e>", "<cs> my lords with great respect and some temerity may i ask that when the procedure committee consider this question they will consider the point made by my noble friend that is that the question of discussion might reasonably be separated from the question of decision <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that these terminologies are often used to disguise the <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> but was not the original estimate for this rather less than million and not million <e> <s> can the noble viscount say when the original chevaline decision was taken and by whom <e> <s> when parliament first learned of the decision to spend up to billion or more on modernising this weapon how long was that announcement after the original decision to go ahead with the expenditure <e>", "<cs> my lords was it not the case that the original decision to go ahead with a modification for polaris was concealed from both houses of parliament at the time <e> <s> considering that we have had to go ahead with this without an opportunity to discuss it this must raise the question of whether we are similarly tied in relation to trident <e> <s> the increase from million to over million is tied to some extent to american decisions and we are liable to be equally tied in relation to trident <e> <s> therefore will the noble viscount ask his colleagues to look again at the trident position which might involve us in a totally untenable position if we go ahead with it <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord reaffirm the governments commitment to dtente <e> <s> judging from the tone of some of the questions asked by noble lords sitting behind him not all of his noble friends retain that commitment <e> <s> it would be rather welcome to some of us on this side to know that in their zeal for human rights the government do not want to throw peace out of the window <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the leader of the house because it was precisely this point that my wife raised with me this morning <e> <s> she said if they had killed her they would have been prosecuted <e> <s> i think that my wife was right and although what noble lords have said here this afternoon may carry weight in this house there is a large amount of lay opinion outside the house which will not understand the position <e> <s> therefore i hope that in one way or another some way will be found to put the matter to rights <e>", "<cs> my lords i would agree with the select committee that perhaps some limitation ought to be introduced <e> <s> i come with fairly fresh experience of another place and on the whole i find the question procedure here rather preferable to that in another place but there are a couple of points i would have made i think had i had the opportunity <e> <s> i would have thought that perhaps four questions on the order paper rather than three would have been better <e> <s> it would have given one the chance of one a week <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble earl for that reply and i am glad to see that the relatively small amount which business contributes to the arts in this country is gradually increasing <e> <s> may i ask the government also to encourage local authority support for the arts in every way they can <e> <s> in particular will they consider offering to match local authority subsidy by an equal grant from government funds <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that the government have surrendered operational control over these weapons and have therefore ensured that in time of international crisis the people of this country could be sacrificed not by their own decision not even by a decision of her majestys government but perhaps by the decision of an ill-informed american president who would not himself suffer the immediate consequences of his own decision <e> <s> will the government tell the americans that united states forces on british soil and in british waters must operate under british command or not at all <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount the minister aware that quite a number of people who do not accept the unilateralist argument are none the less disturbed by the fact that we do not exercise operational control over a weapon to be fired within our own borders <e> <s> would he not agree that the decision in this matter should be based not on who pays for the weapon and what is its cost but on which country it is located in <e> <s> since it is located in our country would not the minister agree that we ought at least to exercise dual key control <e>", "<cs> my lords i would be happy to do so if unfortunately the sss were located in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that it would be equally wrong to draw the simplistic conclusion that all public expenditure is bad and that all private expenditure is good <e>", "<cs> my lords when the report has been studied will the government be bringing forward to the houses of parliament their comments and recommendations on the proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords speaking as one who from time to time worked with the american forces in the last war is the noble viscount aware that they are not immune to what used to be called a cock-up <e> <s> is he further aware that this cannot be afforded in the nuclear age <e> <s> in these circumstances will he discuss this matter again with his colleagues with a view to recovering operational control over american missiles in this country including a dual key arrangement <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that though the assurances here given by the government are no doubt well intentioned the arms <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name

representation made on its behalf by the independent broadcasting authority <e> <s> is it not desirable that before a decision is made at least a written submission should be received from the authority alleged to have offended <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the first question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the latter part of his answer will be warmly welcomed <e> <s> but is it not rather unfortunate that by its failure to give full information in its current report the authority has in fact invalidated the undertaking which the minister himself gave at an earlier date <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that in general his answers to this question are extremely satisfactory <e> <s> is he further aware that although it is known that the use of this money is generally and is intended to be devoted to good works it is desirable from everybodys point of view that full details of those good works should be widely and generally known <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware and i am sure that he is aware that what is called return and restitution of cultural property has engaged increasing attention in recent years mainly at unesco that many countries are asserting their right to have returned to them what they regard as <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that there was indeed a captain jenkins and there is now a lord jenkins <e> <s> as for a mr jenkins he belongs to a rapidly declining new party <e> <s> more seriously however can the noble earl say something about the governments attitude to the unesco report which has dealt widely deeply and i think intelligently with the subject which i have sought to bring to public attention in this rather sharp fashion <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may ask the noble lord a question before he sits down so that the house may be clear on it <e> <s> i think the noble lord is saying that he is ready to accept my noble friends bill and i understood the noble lord to say that the government were also intending to bring in their own legislation i think he said in due course <e> <s> i wonder whether he can give the house rather more specific information on that subject and also confirm that in the meantime the government accept my noble friends bill on second reading <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the widespread belief that her majestys government are more interested in nuclear rearmament than in disarmament will the noble lord take whatever steps he can to disprove that belief <e>", "<cs> my lords as my name has been brought into the matter is the noble lord aware that i am on the executive of the world disarmament campaign the multilateralist body as well as being connected with the campaign for nuclear disarmament the unilateralist body <e> <s> is he not further aware that this proves that multilateralism and unilateralism are complementary to and not in competition with each other <e> <s> as i cannot hope to convert the noble lord to unilateralism will he do what he can to convert some of his noble friends to real multilateral disarmament <e>", "<cs> my lords reverting to geneva will the government see whether it is possible to obtain some compromise position between the plan which they support and that proposed by the nations so that the talks do not bog down in an irreconcilable position between the two groups <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount aware that the whole house will be relieved to know that he does not go along entirely with the policy of mutual suicide advocated by his noble friend <e> <s> would he undertake that under no circumstances will the government agree to store american chemical weapons in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords has the minister read the interesting interview with the polish deputy prime minister in <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> is the minister aware that whether by a second runway at gatwick or by the development of stansted some relief is needed by the millions of people under the flight paths at heathrow <e> <s> the degree of nuisance which is suffered by those who live under the flight paths at heathrow is so great that some relief of one sort or another is urgently necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords what answer does the government have to the charge that they have double standards in this matter and that they bring quite properly a rigorous concern about abuses of human rights in communist countries but take very little notice and appear to be blind to abuses which take place in other parts of the world <e>", "<cs> my lords at the request of my noble friend lord molloy and in his unavoidable absence i beg leave to ask the question which stands in his name on the order paper <e> <s> may i also draw your lordships attention to a rather regrettable misprint <e> <s> in the first line of the question as printed on the order paper the word present should be prevent <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble viscount <e> <s> is he able to give to south-west london the same kind of assurance that he has given about west london <e>", "<cs> my

present government <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the annual cost is <e> <s> is he further aware that this is a fraction of per cent <e> <s> of the councils budget and would not help a great deal any of the causes which the noble lord who asked the question has raised <e> <s> is he further aware that one mans propaganda is another mans factual statement <e>", "<cs> my lords

government show some concern to those <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the minister aware of the letter in <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord give way on one point <e> <s> the noble lord making reference just now to a decision of the glc said that it had caused turmoil <e> <s> is it not the case that it was a decision of the law lords rather than the glc which caused the turmoil <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord not agree that in a multiracial and largely irreligious society the words religious education should be interpreted freely and widely <e>", "<cs> i should like to endorse the point that my noble friend made about local authorities which already have in existence powers similar to those which they would be obliged to undertake after the passage of this bill <e> <s> on the other hand i take lord belsteads desire for universality of endorsement particularly in relation to fire regulations which is important <e> <s> from that point of view i am with the governments ambitions in this respect but i think that if some assurance could be given to my noble friend on the point about those authorities which have already got the powers this would be satisfactory from my own point of view and perhaps too from that of my noble friend <e>", "<cs> i should like to follow the noble lord lord somers because it is time that somebody said he was not in favour of this amendment <e> <s> many of the things which the noble lord lord somers has said are incontrovertible are in fact controvertible <e> <s> to equate sex with burglary seems to be a somewhat false analogy <e> <s> i oppose the amendment but not because i am against the bill the purpose of the bill seem to me to be wholly admirable <e> <s> that these establishments should be brought under control is something with which we on this side of the house will i am sure wholly agree <e> <s> but what is proposed by the amendment is to change the nature of the bill <e>", "<cs> perhaps my noble friend will allow me to explain the difference between us on this point <e> <s> it is not that i wish to limit the powers of councils to do as they please it is that i do not wish to give them an overall power under which for reasons quite separate from those laid down as being appropriate under local government legislation they would be able to take steps on moral grounds <e> <s> that is not what we are about here <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord nugent has just referred to the fact that at an earlier stage i suggested that the whole of this discussion was outside the title of the bill <e> <s> i think that is the case but i have since understood that if we change the nature of the bill by carrying this amendment the title will be changed to meet what we have decided <e> <s> that is a somewhat peculiar procedure if i may say so because by taking this action it would seem that one could change the bill in almost any way and then <e>", "<cs> that reassures me to some extent because i always regard my noble friend as an extremist and he has confirmed once again that that is the right position for him to adopt <e> <s> therefore it seems to me that while any authority would be entitled to say so far as we are concerned we will not accept in this area any kind of sex shop or our area is such that no sex shops are desirable in it each application should be treated on its merits <e> <s> it seems to me that what is proposed here is for a blanket decision to be allowed so that we would be enabling local authorities to usurp the powers which rightly rest in these two chambers here <e> <s> that is what we are trying to do and while noble lords on another issue will try to hamper and interfere with a local authoritys activities in this case they are trying to ensure that local authorities usurp the powers that ought to reside here <e> <s> for this reason i regard this amendment and what has preceded it as wholly undesirable <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that the noble earl lord halsbury is coming close to saying if i dislike a thing then its prohibition is just <e> <s> but if i like it then its prohibition would be unjust <e> <s> what he said came close to saying that <e> <s> furthermore what he is going further to say is the appeal against what i dislike is something that i will not support <e> <s> but if a thing is in order as far as i am concerned then it is all right not merely to let it go on but to appeal against any decision against it <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to amend the

"<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble viscount for that answer may i ask him this question is it not the case that although the soviet union expenditure is a large proportion of a rather low gross national product in total the expenditure in the west is substantially greater than that of the east <e>

intending to demonstrate <e> <s> so would the noble lord agree that no one should in any circumstances be deported from this country to iran <e>", "<cs> if i may press the noble lord just a little further on this matter i think he will agree that the general impression rightly or wrongly is that the government are concerned only with human rights violations which occur in eastern europe and not so much with where most of the torturing and killing occurs which unfortunately is in the so-called free countries of the west <e> <s> will the noble lord do what he can to correct that impression making it clear that he is even more concerned about violations in the area of which we regard ourselves as a part than in those areas to which we do not regard ourselves as belonging <e>", "<cs> my

stewart of fulham a word of support <e> <s> it has become known that the canadian government are preparing legislation which is already in draft which gives either the federal or under certain circumstances a provincial government the right to expropriate <e> <s> there appears to be no appeal against this and no provision for an independent decision on the question of compensation <e> <s>

bill that they will exercise them with consideration for what has been said in both houses about the rights of the original inhabitants of that country <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord trefgarne replies may we ask him not necessarily to explain the bill appearently he cannot do that not necessarily to say anything against it but simply to say a few words for it before we come to the end of the proceedings <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness accept that a desire to abolish the house of lords in its present somewhat indefensible form does not necessarily indicate a devotion to

aware that the labour party is the only party that advocates this course and is it not to be hoped that this message has reached hillhead <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like if i may to add a postscript to what my noble friend has said and perhaps i might mention to my noble friend lord peart that although my name is not on the list it was given some time ahead and i think it might be appropriate if i were to say what little i have to say before the two front bench speakers wind up <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that at a rough estimate the number of days lost by the million unemployed is about million which of course is many times the number he quoted in his answer to earlier questions <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord lloyd of hampstead has done us a great service because he has enabled us to demonstrate in the house two very important things which have been revealed in this debate first a strong sense of urgency in the matter a strong feeling

recently because with the widespread development of home taping of both audio and visual character the subject has now acquired an extraordinary importance to such a degree that if it goes ahead

as minister for the arts at that time of introducing the first public lending right bill in another place <e> <s> my noble friend lord willis will remember the struggles we had in that earlier period to bring the idea of public lending right round to the position of general acceptability which it has now obtained <e> <s> in those earlier days the whole idea was strongly resisted and resented in library circles and it was not easy to get the general acceptance which now exists <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> this happens to be by chance the anniversary of the day on which i learned a year ago that i was to become a member of your lordships house but it is the first time on which i have ventured to introduce a bill into this chamber and i hope that i may crave for a little indulgence which might be appropriate for a new boy if in so doing perhaps i have failed to carry out all the preliminary work which might have been appropriate to introducing a bill which brings a rather complex idea before your lordships <e> <s> as a member of the government one goes into highly complex operations in sounding out all sorts of opinions all over the place and before introducing a measure one has white papers or green papers and goodness knows what else <e> <s> none of that has been done and therefore i come before <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord not agree that the government are already today heavily involved in broadcasting finance <e> <s> would he not agree that every year an argument goes on with the bbc as to how much the licence fee should be <e> <s> would he not agree that the government are taking large sums of money out of commercial television <e> <s> are not the government already in it up to the neck <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to your lordships for the attention you have given to this bill <e> <s> as has been said the quality of the contributions stems from their great experience in the media and i will in a moment refer to some of those contributions <e> <s> before i do that i would say that i am perhaps one of the very few people on this side of the house who welcomed the arrival of commercial television in the beginning <e> <s> i think that most of us on this side of the house are rather late conversions on this <e> <s> however the reason why i personally supported the arrival of commercial television was not that i am over-fond of capitalism but that i was at that time working closely for and with the british actors equity association and i saw here the arrival of a separate employer <e> <s> actors at that time were working wholly for the bbc as far as television was concerned and the bbc as a single employer will do held them down <e> <s> the remuneration that they received at the hands of the bbc was very small <e> <s> actors began to be paid decent money in television only when an alternative employer arrived on the scene <e> <s> from that time television instead of being a spare-time occupation for an actor gradually became something central to his economic life <e> <s> that is the background against which i see the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend and i must disagree on that point <e> <s> i think that it is the case and i do not think that anybody would disagree that one of the constant nags that members of parliament receive is complaints about the continual rise in the licence fee <e> <s> as i made clear at the beginning i personally do not believe that in terms of its cost and value this nagging is justified <e> <s> but that it is there and that it is a real hardship bending upon many people in the poorer sections of the community there can be no reasonable doubt <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that in this and similar problems a two-flag solution is probably the best answer <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount aware that what seems to be happening on both sides is that somebody makes an offer the other side ignores it and makes its own offer and that the other side then ignores that offer <e> <s> would it not be a good idea on some occasion actually to respond to an offer <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that while all of us will wish the foreign secretary every success in his endeavours the almost unconditional support that he has received from the opposition benches is not entirely reflected in the country <e> <s> is he further aware that the note of questioning which the noble lord lord gladwyn introduced into his question just now was a welcome development <e> <s> is it not the case that the foreign secretary must bear in mind when he deals with this matter that the falkland islanders have been misled over a period by <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware <e>", "<cs> that not all of us are content to leave it at that for the time being <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that the united nations resolution which the government claim as their licence for action calls upon both britain and argentina to refrain from the use or the threat of force <e>", "<cs> in the region of the falkland islands <e> <s> are not both the task force and the maritime exclusion zone in breach of that resolution <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that the draft contingency plans to which the noble lord has referred in fact envisage the death penalty being passed and carried out by persons other than judges <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that even those of us who have been critical and who remain critical of the governments policy in this matter must nevertheless admire the way in which this operation has been carried out <e> <s> may i follow a point made by my noble friend lord shackle-ton when he referred to the united nations <e> <s> may i ask whether the government will accept as an interim measure a united nations peace-keeping force on the falkland islands <e>", "<cs> my lords i must correct the noble baroness <e> <s> it was not the governments policies that i was praising but the operation which was carried out <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords nevertheless is the noble viscount aware that i am glad to receive confirmation of what he said the other day that is that nuclear weapons were to use the words i think he usednot applicablein the present case <e> <s> i take it that that is as near as he can go to confirmation of my question <e> <s> will he take this opportunity to reaffirm the governments intention to secure if at all possible a peaceful conclusion to the falklands issue <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a great pleasure for me to support my noble friend lord strabolgi in his unstarred question <e> <s> he and i had a very pleasant relationship when i was minister and he was the spokesman in this chamber and i was delighted to receive the generous comment from the noble lord lord vaizey who was kind enough to commend our efforts over that interesting period of two years <e> <s> he himself has made a valuable contribution to this discussion <e> <s> he has a special knowledge of the subject and of course he is married to one of our most distinguished art critics <e> <s> he moves in an artistic sphere and therefore is well able to contribute from a background of knowledge of the subject <e> <s> every noble lord who has spoken has contributed to the debate from specialised knowledge or his own area of appreciation <e> <s> in listening to it i certainly have benefited and we are all grateful to my noble friend for asking the unstarred question <e>", "<cs> my lords noble lords with experience of warfare will agree with the noble earl that there is seldom anything glorious about it <e> <s> it is usually boring generally disgusting and sometimes very frightening <e> <s> but i do not think i was ever more scared than when watching the prime minister on panorama on monday <e> <s> there was this clear one-track mind repeating and repeating the clichs of conflict quite oblivious to the possibility that there might conceivably he another point of view or that there might conceivably be an alternative course of action <e> <s> it was very alarming indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that we have responsibilities and we have duties but i rather agree with my noble friend lord noel-baker that the notion that these duties can only be performed can only be fulfilled by a display of military might and by the killing of people and the sustaining of casualties on our own side is simplistic thinking suitable to an earlier age perhaps but unrealistic in the world in which we are living at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords if i really thought that the silence of the government was agreement with what i was saying i should be expecting them to be popping up like jacks-in-the box all the time <e> <s> much of what i say must necessarily be unacceptable to the government i accept that <e> <s> that is what we are about here <e> <s> we disagree with each other <e> <s> we express our views and we must necessarily know that sometimes those views are unacceptable <e> <s> but the noble lord will i am sure know that whether my views are acceptable to the government or not i shall certainly go on saying them and whether he believes them to be correct or not i personally believe that there is in the statement which i am presenting to the house an aspect of the truth which i hope he will believe is at least worthy of consideration <e> <s> i ask no more than that <e>", "<cs> precisely my lords i was coming to that point <e> <s> of course the government have denied full british citizenship to the falklanders <e> <s> there were those of us who in this chamber tried to suggest to the government that just as they had been forced to give full british status to the gibraltarians they should do that to the falklanders <e> <s> but they would not have it <e> <s> they gave them a second-class status at that time and now they say of course that they are full british people they were not a few weeks ago but they are now <e> <s> this is not a very satisfactory situation and i think that the falklanders must be wondering precisely where they are <e> <s> i have heard one or two people in the falklands who have come back to these islands who have not been particularly grateful or thankful for the governments attitude <e> <s> one or two of them have taken the view that the consequence of the government rescuing them will be to create a situation in which it will be utterly impossible for them ever to return to their islands <e> <s> the power of modern arms is so great <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> i was <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i utter one word of complaint <e> <s> since he spoke about labour party defence policy may i say that neither from him nor from his noble friend lord gladwyn have we heard a word about liberal policy at all <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend give way <e> <s> would he agree that there is more than one way of defending people <e> <s> my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords since the noble lord mentioned a point that i made i would point this out to him <e> <s> like all of us i too want resolution implemented <e> <s> where we differ is in the methodology of implementation not in our desire that it should be implemented <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that by sinking the cruiser of our recent customer the government have committed mass murder on the high seas <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government further aware that this action has caused a massive swing of world sympathy towards argentina and in order to prevent further loss of life will the government call for an unconditional cease-fire without delay <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the noble lord accept that the worst possible propaganda for us at this time is excessive loss of life even if up to this moment that loss of life has been argentinian rather than our own <e> <s> will the noble lord he good enough to answer a question which his noble friend felt was inappropriate on an earlier occasion and that is will the government in order to prevent further loss of life now propose an immediate ceasefire <e>", "<cs> my lords may i add <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say something <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for settling a minor dispute between two members from this side of the house <e> <s> is the noble viscount aware that all of us whatever view we may take of this lamentable affair share the expressions of sympathy which have been given by my noble friend on the front bench on this matter in all three respects <e> <s> first i believe we all share his regret and sincere sympathy for those who have suffered those who have died those who have been wounded and the relatives of both <e> <s> his other two important requests were for a cease-fire and for simultaneous peace negotiations <e> <s> these two issues seem to go together <e> <s> there is a growing feeling not only in this house but outside this house and throughout the world generally that we should proceed along these lines <e> <s> may i ask the noble viscount specifically is it not the case that there these two tragic affairs demonstrate what weapons experts all over the world have been telling us that we have now reached the point where offensive weapons are so severe that there is no effective defence against them <e> <s> if this goes on shall we not have further casualties on both sides and is it not time to call a halt <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for that answer but will he say why it is that he appears to have so much confidence in the turkish junta <e> <s> is there not here a strong contrast in the governments attitude in that it seems <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that turkey remains in forceful occupation of that part of cyprus which she occupied by aggression and what does the noble lord say about that <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that the point made by the noble and learned lord lord scarman in that report is that there should be some element of local authority consultation in relation to the police <e> <s> is it not the case that some of his noble friends do not mind local authority domination of the police so long as it is conservative party domination <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not undesirable that parliamentary immunity should be used to intimidate broadcasters with the result that mr robert kee has felt it necessary to recant in <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord not reconsider the last answer and ask his right honourable and noble friends to do the same <e> <s> is it not the case that under all governments not only his government but previous governments this sale of arms internationally has grown up to an alarming degree to the extent that as we are talking during every minute of our discussion children have died of malnutrition and for each minute has been spent on arms <e> <s> is this not an unreasonable situation and should we not try to do something about it <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships have just listened to what was to me perhaps the most remarkable speech that i have listened to since i had the privilege of joining your lordships house just a year ago <e> <s> i think it only remains for me to underline some of the points which the noble lord lord hooson made <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the whole of latin america now appears to believe that this country does not want peace <e> <s> will the government disprove that belief by calling for a n immediate cease-fire <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that a number of us would like to emulate another place by voting against the governments policies on this issue <e> <s> will he ask his noble friend to provide an opportunity for that to occur <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount aware that while all of us share the admiration which has been expressed for the courage and skill of our forces the number of lives lost in this tragic affair if sadly things continue on their present course looks likely within a few days to approach the total number of the inhabitants of the falkland islands <e> <s> in these circumstances is he aware that those of us who disagree <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not be generally agreed that there now may well be a role for these services in the case of a conventional war <e> <s> but would not many people agree with the noble lord lord gladwyns interpretation of the probability of nuclear war and would not the conclusion that one would draw from that be that it would be best for us to opt out of the consequences by getting rid of our own nuclear weapons <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount aware that many hearts are heavy this afternoon <e> <s> is he further aware that although the government have been unwilling to listen to voices counselling moderation or a cease-fire or a negotiated settlement in this chamber or in another chamber these voices are now heard elsewhere <e> <s> has the noble viscount read the <e>", "<cs> my lords may i be permitted to say that my record against fascism is one which i should be happy to have compared with that of the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount says that he can

overlooked something which ought to be there <e>", "<cs> yes my lords that is what it means <e> <s> whether the noble lord thinks that the sentiment is nonsense or not it is undeniably the fact that that is what it was saying <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord is mistaken <e> <s> if he gives it a little thought i think he will discover that all society is founded upon the freedom of the group <e> <s> all of us exist together in society by asserting the right of the group to control the individual <e> <s> that is why we do not drive on both sides of the road <e> <s> the group decides that so far as this society is concerned we will drive on the left of the road and each individual has to conform <e> <s> the only way in which society can exist is by laying down rules which apply to the group as a whole <e> <s> that is what government and civilisation are about <e> <s> civilisation is founded upon the proposition that the group exists for the benefit of the whole and if noble lords do not think that it is then they ought to look up the companies acts they ought to look at barristers solicitors and so on <e> <s> all these arc founded upon the rights of the group and people are required to conform to those rights in order to exercise their abilities in those fields <e> <s> that is what it is about <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that what he says is rather disturbing that there is a widespread feeling that this matter has gone on for long enough and that the suggestion which is now being made that there is to be some further delay is one which i hope he will use his influence to prevent <e> <s> moreover i hope he will be able before very long to give the house an assurance that this long-awaited project will now continue without further prevarication or delay <e>", "<cs> my lords on a point of accuracy it is not the policy of the labour party to withdraw from nato <e>", "<cs> my lords i begin by thanking my noble friend lord brockway

speakers today of the realisation that we live in a new world and that we need a new perception of reality in order to encompass a way of dealing with our problems and of carrying mankind through the

other colleagues of the cloth that this is indeed a new world <e> <s> but of course it is difficult for people to break out of traditional ways of thinking <e> <s> the government have not succeeded in doing that and we cannot expect all members of the church to make the effort or if they make the effort to succeed and to understand that the values which they rightly hold must be dealt with in a new way realised in a new way and expressed in a new way if mankind is to survive <e> <s> i will say no more to the right reverend prelate <e> <s> i leave him in the hands of his right reverend colleague and let us hope they argue it out between themselves and arrive at a compromise <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that south africa which has a close alliance with argentina did not in fact join in sanctions <e> <s> is he aware that argentinian torturers including commander astiz were recently in pretoria introducing new methods of torture into south africa <e>", "<cs> my lords in conclusion if i may revert to the matter of the falklands which has been raised may i ask whether the minister is aware that many of us draw a total distinction between the incompetence of the government and the efficiency of our forces and that during the inquiry which the government themselves have agreed is necessary we shall continue to maintain that distinction <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that if my noble friend lord howie wanted to revive the motorway box he would be welcome to do so in troon but not in london <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl give way <e> <s> it happens that i know mr plesch personally and i can assure the noble earl that he is neither stupid nor dishonest

which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the labour party letter to which i have referred in my question also says that in the field of nuclear arms both the united states and the soviet union long ago passed the level of destructive power which might be thought necessary to deter an aggression by the other <e> <s> in these circumstances will he not think again <e> <s> is not the doctrine of parity of overkill a lunatic proposition whoever utters it <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that one of the qualities of the noble lord lord carrington which we lost when he left the front bench was that he was capable of dealing with these matters seriously <e> <s> will the noble lord endeavour to address himself to the proposition that overkill is an absurdity and that either side increasing the amount of overkill necessarily increases instability <e> <s> will he address himself to that question <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand

bill which i attended though i did not speak because i felt that everything that needed to be said at that stage had been said most adequately by those already taking part in the debate the noble viscount if he will forgive me for saying so displayed rather less certainty in moving his amendment than he displayed this evening <e> <s> it seems to me that his faith in his own amendment has firmed up a little during the interim period <e>", "<cs> and one wonders why that is because the contrary has happened so far as everybody else is concerned <e> <s> he said in the committee stage that

a word if i may in support of my noble friends amendment <e> <s> one of the difficulties about this bill i think and indeed about other legislation which noble lords opposite have put forward from time to time is the assumption which is implicit in the legislation that trade unions are more or less like one another and that one can legislate in a broad sense and cover all the possibilities in a single piece of legislation <e> <s> the difficulty that arises from this from time to time is due to the fact that trade unions are very different organisations indeed and a form of words which may reasonably apply to one organisation and its relationships does not apply to another <e>", "<cs> i wonder if the noble viscount will perhaps consider this situation <e> <s> the circumstances in which subscriptions lapse and are then recollected are various <e> <s> on the whole trade unions are anxious to provide the possibility for maintaining the universality or the per cent <e> <s> of their membership <e> <s> therefore they are usually ready to bend over backwards in order to ensure that a membership ready to be resumed is resumed on reasonable terms <e> <s> one knows of many circumstances in which perhaps during the course of a disagreement or dispute arrears will have mounted up sometimes to nowadays with subscriptions as high as they are or <e> <s> under these circumstances if a member indicates his readiness to return this amount quite often will be commuted a lump sum payment of perhaps or will be accepted and the arrears which have accumulated will be commuted <e> <s> the sum will be paid and the membership will be restored <e> <s> it seems to me that it is to provide for circumstances of that kind that my noble friend suggests this amendment <e>

decide that the amendment proposed by my noble friend should be accepted <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble viscount to clarify the situation further <e> <s> it is rather complex <e> <s> let us assume

my lords is the minister aware that he should not perhaps take refuge in secrecy in respect of a report of a discussion about which he said he was not fully informed <e> <s> is not the position rather that the government will wish to make public those things which they think should be made public while understandably wishing to keep secret those things which they consider it would be diplomatically unwise to reveal <e> <s> in these circumstances rather than write to my noble friend which he might otherwise do may i urge him to seek an occasion to make public the answer which he is now not in a position to give so that the whole house may be informed of exactly what the position is <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister able to say whether there is now any difficulty in getting aid in or has that problem been resolved <e> <s> is the aid therefore now getting to those who need it <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that if by their policies the government were to achieve an increase in the number of unemployed to million the productivity of those remaining in employment would be quite phenomenal but total production would continue to fall <e>", "<cs> are we not in a rather unsatisfactory position here <e> <s> apparently the government do not know what their own clause means and have been unable to elucidate what my noble friends questions are <e> <s> how can we decide

dismissed fairly or unfairly might be extremely difficult to determine in any particular case <e> <s> indeed it is the whole basis of the bill that this question is one which must be very carefully decided <e> <s> for any person in an employer-employee situation it might be very difficult to know in advance whether the dismissal has taken place fairly or unfairly it is not a matter that is immediately obvious in every case <e> <s> complex situations arise from time to time <e>", "<cs> i wish to clarify this point <e> <s> has the noble lord never been in the position when he was

depends <e> <s> i could spell that out in detail on this clause but i should prefer having regard to the time to do it on a later clause which is particularly relevant <e>", "<cs> i wish that i had been able to get in before the noble lord lord rochester and the noble baroness lady burton of coventry because i might conceivably have been able to explain one or two points in the clause which

as will all those people be who travel from putney bridge station <e> <s> for too many years as i think he will know passengers have been walking up one row of stairs only to watch a train disappearing from the further platform and then they have had to walk back again and sometimes watch another train disappear from the original platform as they do so <e> <s> this has gone on far too long <e> <s> i understand that the problem can be solved by co-operation between british rail and london transport and if the noble earls intervention has resulted in bringing that about a lot of people will be very grateful to him including myself <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that there has been very considerable disappointment at the relative lack of success of the second united nations session having regard to the unanimity which was achieved at the first session <e> <s> in view of this very great disappointment will the government see what they can do to take the world disarmament campaign very seriously so far as this country is concerned <e> <s> perhaps they will even go so far as to work together with my noble friend lord brockway who has this cause as all of us have very much at heart <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most gratful for what my noble friend has said <e> <s> perhaps it would not be out of order if i were to point out to the noble earl the minister that the difference drawn in the amendment between the district authority and all other organisations was indeed quite deliberate and was in fact the main purpose of the amendment <e> <s> on the other hand what is proposed here is in no way a precept <e> <s> the district council has no power to demand from the regional authority any particular sum <e> <s> the local authority as the noble earl the the minister quite correctly points out could make a token contribution of l and that would be that <e> <s> what was sought to be done here was to emphasise the importance of this type of grant in cultural activities theatres orchestras and so forth so as to give the regional authority a greater sense of obligation in respect to a request for a grant coming from a district council than it would feel to the generality of such requests <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that answer <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that while there has been some degree of reduction in noise there has at the same time been an increase in the number of aircraft <e> <s> therefore the nuisance is unabated <e> <s> will he be aware that this question is for the purpose of strengthening the governments hand in the matter and their resolution to stand by stansted and not to give way to the very heavy pressure which will be placed upon them to abandon this necessary project <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that authoritative and expert opinion has been moving rapidly in recent years and even in recent months towards the conclusion that there can be no effective civil defence against nuclear war and is not the cancellation of the governments hard rock exercise a recognition of this fact <e>", "<cs> but my lords is not the noble baroness aware that it is the government who are concentrating civil defence upon nuclear war and creating the reaction that has been mentioned <e> <s> can the noble baroness say however whether it is scientifi <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i should also like to join in the general welcome which has been given to these regulations and i join with the noble lord lord beaumont in feeling that it is rather sad that they represent a redistribution of a declining sum <e> <s> as he said this is particularly sad at a time when the british film is beginning to recover and many people would say that it has already recovered the artistic reputation which it enjoyed in the past <e> <s> at the moment the industry is receiving considerable acclaim in various parts of the world and one of our leading writers and actors colin welland announced in hollywood when he received his oscar for chariots of fire that the brits are coming a

museum in bethnal green as there is to the proposal not to proceed with the theatre museum <e> <s> is he further aware that the idea of introducing charges would be peculiarly repugnant in this delightful museum which is devoted to children <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl will perhaps forgive me if i do not follow him entirely except to say that i agree with him very much that there is such a thing as a non-nuclear deterrent <e> <s> the difference between us is that i hope to see the day when <e>", "<cs> in a moment <e> <s> i then asked the government to emulate the labour party by telling president reagan that such weapons would never be allowed to be stationed in britain <e> <s> a government supporter intervened to say that even to ask such questions was bordering on the subversive <e> <s> i shall not give his name because he is not present this afternoon and i do not think it would be fair to do so <e> <s> i was denied on that occasion the opportunity to rebut the charge there and then but i take this opportunity to refute it now <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i would quarrel with the noble lord on that point <e> <s> it seems to me that it is a part of the totality of nuclear weapons but i will not quarrel with the verbiage <e>", "<cs> more recently my lords there has been a change of view in these matters <e> <s> it seems to me that the modernisation as it is called of nuclear weapons is something which we ought to view very carefully and we should ask ourselves whether this is the sort of expenditure that is worthwhile in itself

other words as was suggested by the noble lord lord chalfont the effect of this so-called improvement in our security is simply to make our own destruction rather more certain <e> <s> on both sides the temptation <e>", "<cs> my lords i do think that there is a great deal to be said for what i described in my speech as true patriotism and if the noble lord will do me the honour of reading tomorrow what i said i think he will realise that my conception of a true patriotism is the people of our country operating at their highest and at their best the people of this country function at a level unrivalled throughout the world <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord lord glenarthur has been answering some other debate which took place in some other place on some other day <e>

word of general condemnation about what the governments intentions were <e> <s> i do condemn them but i did not do so on this occasion <e> <s> i simply sought to deal with the question of practicability <e> <s> my entire remarks were directed to the question of whether or not the clause was workable and the reason that i asked your lordships to reject it was not because i think it is wrong in principle although i do but purely because it is not practicable <e> <s> it will not work it cannot work it will create total chaos <e>", "<cs> my lords if indeed i have made a statement which was incorrect i unreservedly withdraw it <e> <s> however my strong impression is that equity have the idea rightly or wrongly that some kind of undertaking was given to them <e> <s> if however i am wrong i withdraw <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord the lord advocate places us in a very difficult situation <e> <s> he does not in fact say as i hoped he might that the government would see whether they could devise a form of wording which would exclude from the provision persons who although not contractually and legally in an employer/employee relationship had a relationship which was nonetheless that of an employer and employee <e> <s> this clause does not intend to catch people who are in that relationship <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that the government believe what they want to believe and that the reality of the situation is that there has been a fundamental shift in opinion not only in this country but also in europe in favour of the view <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that contrary to the opinion expressed by the noble lord lord annan i am not suggesting a referendum on the subject <e> <s> i am suggesting however that the government should not remain immune from the development and trend of a public opinion in many parts of the world and that a simple reiteration of the governments dependence upon nuclear weapons is not enough <e> <s> is it not the case that it is high time that the government expressed abhorrence of this weapon which is very widely shared and their determination in their own way multilateral whatever it may be to do their utmost to get rid of it <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that if the government were to abandon their ill-advised scheme to buy trident ii they would have much more money to spend upon conventional weapons for the royal navy and elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords the discussion that we had last week on the amendment which i put forward no <e> <s> is relevant to the present proposal <e> <s> as i understand this amendment its effect is to provide that a contract is voided by one of two things <e> <s> it may be voided by a recognition requirement or with the word or added it may be voided by a requirement to negotiate or to consult <e> <s> either of these two things becomes a cause for voidance of the contract and the contract is invalidated thereby <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend give way <e> <s> i wonder whether he is speaking to amendment no <e> <s> or possibly to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> we are on amendment no <e> <s> at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i find that answer profoundly disappointing because the truth of the matter is as i think the noble and learned lord will agree that lawyers differ in this rather complicated area <e> <s> there are those who take the view that a contract of employment is of necessity a contract of service <e> <s> there are others who take the view that a contract of employment can at the same time be a contract for the provision of services and that for example a variety artist making a series of engagements with a number of different employers in fact to each of the employers sells his services therefore he is not actually in the employ of any one of the employers <e> <s> yet the relationship between the two of them inasmuch as the employer has the power to direct is in fact a relationship of employer and employee <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that per cent <e> <s> of the labour partys income and per cent <e> <s> of the conservative partys income are not in fact comparable and that the conservative partys income is so much larger than the labour partys income <e>", "<cs> my lords i have played little part in the proceedings today saving myself for the amendment which is in my name and which is to follow the present amendment <e> <s> however i am prompted to intervene at this stage by the speech of the noble lord lord harris of greenwich <e> <s> i think it rather noteworthy that the hostility to the political levy system which has overcome members of the sdp is something that they have suddenly discovered since they left the labour party <e> <s> these people who have subsisted on the system enjoyed its fruits and benefits whose political lives have been built upon it have somewhat late in the day suddenly discovered that they do not like it at all that it contains great infairnesses difficulties problems and so forth <e>", "<cs> yes i did in fact sell them my lords but for the short time i had them before i got rid of the things i was contributing to the conservative party and the same applies of course to anybody who holds shares <e> <s> there is no basis whatsoever on which to contract out of paying towards the conservative party <e> <s> but of course it is worse than that <e> <s> nobody is compelled to be a shareholder but every time i buy a glass of beer the froth on the top is a contribution to the conservative party <e> <s> i may blow it off but they still get the money <e> <s> it may be only a farthing or something like that but there is no way out other than by giving up beer and this i do not intend to do even for the conservative party <e> <s> there is no way possible in which i can opt out of contributing to the conservative party because practically all the brewers contribute to them <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the reply of the noble and learned lord the lord advocate was somewhat legalistic <e> <s> in reality who is going to ask a jobbing gardener or a window cleaner to join a trade union <e> <s> the circumstances will arise only in the conditions which my noble friend and i have indicated where there is a contractual agreement between an employers association and a trade union that all persons working in that area shall join the appropriate organisation be it the employers association or the trade union <e> <s> the breakdown of that system would be disastrous <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the figure in my question appeared in an amnesty international report <e> <s> is he further aware that even if the figure is denied i think he will agree that it is incontrovertible that the dictatorship in pakistan has become increasingly cruel and barbaric in recent years <e> <s> why is it that the government appear to find this extremely repressive rgime more acceptable than the relatively mild military rgime in poland <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i could prevail upon the noble leader of the house to give my noble friend a chance <e>", "<cs> my lords the reason why he did not rise was due to the infirmity of deafness and i do not think that the house should take advantage of my noble friends deafness <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper about a comprehensive test ban treaty <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his answer <e> <s> during the previous question my noble friend asked the noble lord whether he could be a little more specific <e> <s> i wonder <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord confirm that the announced decision of the united states to proceed with the development of the neutron bomb is not part of the trouble <e>", "<cs> my lords one mans coercion is another mans loyalty <e> <s> the proposition which noble lords see is that coercion exists where there are rules and every group has rules <e> <s> noble lords are coerced to be here by a whip and the words used vary with the degree of coercion which is applied to noble lords <e> <s> on occasions they are requested to be here a rather light phrase on certain occasions they are required to be here <e> <s> if noble lords were to proceed to the other place they would find that the words used are even stronger than that <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a bad bill <e> <s> i believe that it might be appropriate if i were to speak <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord <e> <s> i think it is a thoroughly bad bill and i so think for a number of reasons <e> <s> it seems to me that we would genuinely be agreed that it is an anti-trade union bill <e> <s> it is a bill that seeks to weaken the trade union movement and it is i believe noteworthy that the only party which has consistently opposed the bill is the one to which i belong <e> <s> it seems to me rather sad that with some qualifications both the liberals and the sdp have found themselves ready to go along with what in the trades union congress is seen as such a had bill that it did not even want us to try to improve it <e> <s> i think it is generally known that the view in congress house is that the bill is so objectionable and will bring on to the statute hook laws which are so totally to be opposed that the only thing to do will be to refuse to obey them <e>", "<cs> my lords may i suggest just two things to the noble earl lord ferrers <e> <s> first in presenting his case he should try to do so without descending to personal insults <e> <s> secondly in presenting <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but may i ask the noble lord lord skelmersdale two further questions <e> <s> first is it not the case that the soviet peace committee seldom does or says anything that is not approved by the soviet government and therefore that anything in a statement entered into by the soviet peace committee and the world disarmament campaign may be taken as an official statement by the soviet government and will the british government look at it in that light <e> <s> secondly in a written answer that the noble lord was kind enough to give me he said that the government expected to have an opportunity in the near future to make known to the russians the governments views on their initiatives for a nuclear freeze and for a comprehensive test ban treaty <e> <s> is the noble lord now in a position to say what those views are <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that the fact that the proposals were originally drafted by my noble friend and were subsequently endorsed by the peace committee in the presence of a soviet minister indicates that the soviet government and my noble friend are in accord <e> <s> it only remains for the government to get into accord with my noble friend and then the government could find themselves in the search for peace with the soviet union <e> <s> is not that something devoutly to be wished <e> <s> is it not desirable that the government should find itself if it can on common ground with the soviet union so that the world becomes a more peaceful place <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord has mentioned the question i put to him the other day may i respectfully ask him if he has not misunderstood the purport of my noble friends question <e> <s> he is not suggesting that the function of negotiation on policy should be usurped <e> <s> the proposal as i understand it is that a factual attempt should be made to establish what are the real nuclear strengths on both sides <e> <s> is the noble lord not aware that my noble friend has pointed out that each side is saying that the other side is stronger and he is suggesting an attempt to establish the facts <e> <s> would the noble lord not agree that this is a good idea <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to prohibit by law the siting of nuclear chemical and biological weapons under the ownership or control or joint control of foreign countries within the united kingdom the british isles or british territorial waters or british airspace or bases and for purposes connected therewith <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords i will not seek immediately to follow the noble lord lord orr-ewing though i shall have some comments to make about the falklands later <e> <s> i find myself on this occasion much less in disagreement with him than i have on some previous occasions <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble viscount says that i would say that of course the suggestion carried in my question is that the government were in breach of their obligations under the treaty of tlatelolco which makes the south atlantic and latin american waters nuclear-free zones <e> <s> if the government say that we are not in breach of that undertaking we shall know that the whole thing is wrong but if the government refuse to say that can they wonder that they are losing out in world opinion <e> <s> is not world opinion entitled to say here is a state in breach of its obligations bringing the nuclear weapon into our waters <e> <s> if the government fail to deny that that is the case and take refuge in generalities can they be surprised that they are beginning to lose credibility <e>", "<cs> i shall give way to the noble viscount in a moment and i shall be happy to do so <e> <s> but before i give way to him i should like to say that it seems that we took nuclear weapons into the south atlantic on this absurd venture and in the absence of any denial it is not surprising that other countries take the view that that is what in fact happened <e> <s> now if the noble viscount wishes i shall give way <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not expect to receive a straight answer from the soviet government but i expect to receive one from the noble viscount <e> <s> this is an issue which is of very great importance because if it is the case that there is no effective political control over the movement of nuclear weapons in the world then the peril of the world is indeed great <e>", "<cs> well my lords i think that we had better allow the world in general and the people in general to make up their minds about that issue <e> <s> personally i take the view that it is in fact in the interests of our people to know to what degree their security and safety is being prejudiced by the government <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will be the first to agree that that constitutes no excuse <e> <s> perhaps we may turn to another question though i am perfectly willing to pursue this one myself <e> <s> in the interests of the government who are clearly embarrassed by it i shall move elewhere <e> <s> but i do not think that we have seen the end of this question <e> <s> i think that the world is turning against the government and i believe that that is a factor in the change of attitude towards the actions of this country in relation to the falklands <e> <s> it is i think only a matter of time before our own people begin to discover the truth and i believe that they will soon seek to dissociate our country from the self-righteous and repulsive jingoism which has characterised the british press during the period of the falklands <e> <s> the popular press did this country no good service during this period <e>", "<cs> i do not know what the view of my two noble friends is on the point my lords but the proposition which my noble friend lord stewart has just asserted is not one i have put forward neither do i believe in it <e>", "<cs> that is a different proposition <e>", "<cs> that is the difference between us <e> <s> my lords whether that is or is not a position of defencelessness <e> <s> i take the view which i tried to enunciate at some length that to de-nuclearise ourselves does not create a defenceless position <e> <s> that is not a position i support <e> <s> all i am wishing to do is to recognise the difference between myself and my noble friend but to state what the difference is <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a privilege to follow the noble lord lord annan whose expertise in this area is so well known as to need no support from me <e> <s> may i say that i found myself in a very great deal of agreement with what the noble lord had to say <e> <s> i also should like if i may to add my congratulations to the noble lord lord orr-ewing for introducing the debate <e> <s> i think he has benefited not only our house but in the end the government which he supports because this is a subject which i believe has been insufficiently examined so far and in starting that examination the noble lord has performed a service <e> <s> may i also add my commendation to the three maiden speeches which have added to this occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not lucky chance that the noble lord happened to have that answer so handy <e> <s> as his planting is so successful will he not transfer his attentions to horticulture <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that in this connection the proposals have commended themselves to successive ministers and governments on both sides of the house and that if one wished to examine in detail the reasons which one gives for this one would need to deal with the matter in debate rather than through question and answer <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl lord avon has been somewhat overworked today <e> <s> when i saw his name on the annunciator i believed that he was winding up the previous bill only to discover that he had already launched on this one <e> <s> therefore i arrived in the chamber having missed his first few sentences <e> <s> i apologise for that especially as i think that the bill was introduced in an exceptionally competent fashion leading me to believe that if the noble earl had not been a victim of the curious hereditary principle he would probably be here under his own steam if not in this place at least in another <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble lord for that answer and agreeing with its broad tendency may i ask whether he is aware that the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his answers but would he not agree that this idea of complementary or of pairing programmes takes impartiality to a new point <e> <s> is this not rather disquieting for other programmes quite apart from the content of the particular programme in question <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened to the debate with great care and although many hard and harsh things were said in it i managed to restrain myself from seeking to intervene at the time and at this late stage i shall not even attempt to reply to every point that has been made because many of the points have been the reiteration of familiar positions and have not in fact sought to reply to the points that i made when introducing the bill <e> <s> i therefore hope that under the circumstances noble lords will understand if i seek to complete my reply without in turn being interrupted and i hope that so far as i am concerned noble lords will exercise the same restraint that i exercised when they were speaking <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord repeat that <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that what the noble lord was saying was that we were all either fools or scoundrels <e> <s> i thought he was going a little further in what he says now <e> <s> but i can assure him that we are not useful fools and we are not scoundrels <e> <s> he is totally mistaken in his estimation of the nature of the opposition <e> <s> because it is not widely represented in this house noble lords may get a wrong idea of the real distribution of opinion in this country <e> <s> the distribution of opinion in this house is frankly totally unrepresentative of what happens outside <e> <s> if the noble lord will take a look at the opinion polls he will see how young people feel will see where they stand on these issues and he may come to a different conclusion <e> <s> it may be that in humility he may ask himself whether it can be true that all these people are wrong and he alone is right <e> <s> your lordships must make up your own minds <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that although i may have misdescribed the maps the sole means of obtaining geographical and other information and indeed nautical information about the falkland islands rests in the hands of her majestys government including all the nautical <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that although the nomenclature was wrong the reality of the question was right <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord was rather sheltering behind what was perhaps an error of wording in seeking to avoid the fact that it is the case that a large quantity of maps of strategic and tactical importance to the argentine forces were supplied not directly but indirectly by her majestys government a short time before the invasion <e> <s> is that not the case <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that on this occasion the tributes which were paid to the noble lord lord polwarth for introducing this debate were no ordinary customary statement <e> <s> i believe that they were deeply meant by everybody who has spoken in the matter and every noble lord who has spoken has paid that tribute <e> <s> it is the case that at the moment the arts are in a condition of crisis and therefore it is appropriate that at this point we should have however brief and short it may be a discussion upon them and the noble lord has done us a service in making that possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that out of london boroughs survivors could be expected in only approximately half of those boroughs <e> <s> is it not irresponsible to insist upon london boroughs carrying out full nuclear preparations and civil defence exercises when it is known in fact that the possibility of any reasonable survival rate does not exist <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noblelord aware that it so happens that i have asked the question suggested by the noble lord lord george-brown not in moscow but in leningrad of the city soviet which is in charge of that city <e> <s> the answer i received was that although there are military preparations for the possibility of nuclear war there are no civilian preparations as they take the view that any nuclear war would result in wholesale destruction and that there is so little possibility of human survival that it is undesirable unnecessary and indeed absurd to make preparations for it <e> <s> in these cicumstances would the government even if they wish to make a pretence of the possibility of survival at least refrain from enforcing upon local authorities an action to a pretence of survival in which they do not believe <e>", "<cs> answer the question <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble earl lord avon whether equally he will give an assurance to those of us who have continually tried to secure some relief for heathrow and who have believed for years that stansted is the best bet <e> <s> will he be good enough to give us some assurance as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord on the front bench might perhaps agree that the peace movement in this country does not as suggested by the noble lord lord beloff have serious ramifications in eastern europe <e> <s> what it has sought to do is to make contacts in that area <e> <s> is it not the case that peace cannot be assured unless such contacts are established both officially and unofficially <e>", "<cs> i was not intending to speak on this amendment but i venture to do so for two reasons <e> <s> one of the reasons why i was not proposing to speak is that for reasons outside my control i missed the noble viscounts opening statement on the amendment <e> <s> i know his points of view and like others who have spoken i very much respect them <e> <s> the reason i intervene is because the noble earl lord perth suggested that there was something outwith labour party attitudes and policy about the attitude that my noble friend lord strabolgi had taken up from the front bench <e> <s> i felt that perhaps he ought to have a word from behind to say that there is nothing at all in what he has said which is against the labour party attitude on this matter <e>", "<cs> i rise to suggest if i may to the noble lord lord montagu that although he indicated that he had no intention of pressing this amendment he is on the right lines <e> <s> one hopes perhaps that after further consultation he will pursue an amendment of a similar sort at a later stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend replies i should like to give him a word of support on his first amendment <e> <s> the noble earl lord avon has shown his wisdom and flexibility in accepting the second amendment and i had hoped that he was going to show the same attitude towards the first one <e> <s> in fact halfway through his speech i thought he was <e> <s> because what he seemed to be saying to us was on the whole this is a pretty good idea but it has not been done elsewhere and <e> <s> because of that we do not want to make a start here <e> <s> that does not seem to me to be a very good reason <e>", "<cs> in accepting the amendment i hope that the minister will be good enough to look at its wording that the prime minister shall give preference to those who appear to her <e>", "<cs> i am for it <e>", "<cs> one has to bear in mind that this is a transitional process and consequently the staff are entitled to know that as a result of the transition their terms and conditions of employment will not be worsened <e> <s> that being so one ought also to bear in mind that even a civil servant is not necessarily permanently employed <e> <s> he can be transferred to other employment <e> <s> that is one of the advantages of having a civil servant at one time if somebody was unsatisfactory in the v and a you could always shunt him off to somewhere else <e> <s> now you will not be able to do so <e> <s> i take the point of the noble viscount lord eccles <e> <s> the moment you take everybody on to a trustee basis the traditional way of getting rid of a civil servant is lost <e> <s> you can no longer shunt him off into some job in the des or something of that sort <e> <s> so there is a real point here <e> <s> if one is going to make this transition and it is no secret that i am unenthusiastic about it one has to take into consideration that when one makes a transition certain consequences follow from it and this is one of them <e>", "<cs> the generality of the opinion appears to me to be that we are worried about the wording as at present <e> <s> the intention of the wording is that the director shall be responsible to the board for the general exercise of the boards functions <e> <s> i think that perhaps the intention of the wording is to see that it is quite clear that the board is to retain policy and the directors are to carry it out <e> <s> nevertheless having said all that i go along with those noble lords who would prefer to have it much clearer <e> <s> all three noble lords who have spoken to this amendment are seeking the same end <e> <s> it is my hope that the noble earl lord avon will feel able to accept one or other of the amendments or at least the general sense of all of them <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness says that one should not line up these people with civil servants but they are civil servants <e> <s> that is the whole point of the issue <e> <s> at the moment the staff of the science and the victoria and albert museums are civil servants <e> <s> that is the basis of the departmental arrangement so far as these staffs are concerned <e> <s> for example roy strong has the position of assistant secretary which is a civil service appointment <e> <s> he can be hauled over the coals under the direct control of the minister as no other director can be brought under ministerial control <e>", "<cs> if i understood the noble earl correctly he was telling us that this amendment was unnecessary because either in other legislation or in existing practice elsewhere that which is asked for in the amendment is in fact carried out <e> <s> if that is the case it seems to me that if the amendment would reassure the staff enormously and if they are saying things which the trustees acting as the appointees of the government will in effect being carrying out where can the objection lie to having the amendment in the bill <e> <s> if it gives confidence to all concerned and the government are going to do these things anyway then why not accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> as i understand it the noble earl is saying that a member of the staff could say you have worsened my conditions of employment in such-and-such a way and therefore i object to that because my conditions of employment are not so satisfactory as they were when i was a civil servant <e> <s> i think the noble earl is telling us that that would be admissible <e> <s> but i believe the noble earl is also saying that if the member of the staff goes on to say i was a civil servant and am no longer and i therefore want a year or a year as compensation for the fact that i am no longer a civil servant then that would not be admissible <e> <s> is that so <e>", "<cs> we are asking the noble earl and i think he is going to write to my noble friend about it to consider the possibility of inserting arbitration machinery which is agreed with the recognised trade unions as a procedure which might precede any reference to an industrial tribunal <e> <s> i hope that is what the noble earl is taking on board <e>", "<cs> i also agree with the view that has been expressed that it is appropriate to pay a remuneration to the chairman but as regards the rank and file trustee it seems to me that the basis on which we operate in your lordships house in which there are one or two arduous paid positions and the rest of us subsist on an expense arrangement is probably the right one <e> <s> it is one which is followed here it is one which is followed at local authority level and i think that it will probably be the right solution in this case <e>", "<cs> i take very much what the noble earl has said <e> <s> particularly in relation to the victoria and albert museum it seems to me that there is a very special need to be specific on this point <e> <s> therefore with the agreement of my noble friend i shall not press this particular amendment but i should like to give notice that i shall discuss this matter with others with a view to perhaps including an amendment to clause making that clause more specific <e>", "<cs> may i express my appreciation of the assurance which the noble earl has given <e> <s> he will understand our anxiety when one considers that it was the policy of a previous government to require museums to charge and that legislation was carried in order to remove any impediments which made it difficult for them to do so <e> <s> therefore it is a little worrying that we are putting in a specific requirement that the museums may charge if they so wish <e> <s> nevertheless it does seem to me that the noble earl has gone as far as he can in this matter <e> <s> unless my noble friend disagrees it is not my intention to press the amendment having regard to the <e>", "<cs> i should like to emphasise that i take entirely the point made by the noble baroness lady airey of abingdon that when objects are given under certain conditions those conditions should always be observed <e> <s> at the same time i also share the view expressed by the noble viscount that there should be no unreasonable inhibitions upon a museum and upon this particular museum in exchanging disposing of or otherwise getting rid of property which it no longer wants including i may say the restitution of property which it may want to restore to a museum abroad <e> <s> i hope that when he comes to look into this question the noble earl will take this point into consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord not agree that a proposal emanating from the noble lord lord kennet would hardly likely be intended to aid the russians <e> <s> would he not further agree that the length at which these discussions take place and the total ineffectiveness of the multilateral discussions which have been going on for so many years in both the conventional and nuclear areas strengthen all the time the beliefs of those of us who believe in unilateral action <e>", "<cs> i find myself in favour of this proposal and at this stage i need not interrupt the noble earl but we shall see what he has to say about it first <e>", "<cs> i think it might perhaps be appropriate on this amendment to say a word about the question of appointments <e>", "<cs> i was referring to the question of appointments and whether they should be made by the secretary of state or by the prime minister <e> <s> i expressed myself in favour of amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> in doing so <e> <s> i was talking about the general sense of the amendment that is <e> <s> the appointment of a person having knowledge and experience of arms armour military history and so on <e> <s> it is generally-agreed that that would be a sensible thing to do <e> <s> in that i did not mean to express approval of the proposal which is part of that amendment to substitute the prime minister for the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> i hope the government will accept the sense of the amendment although they may not wish to accept the actual words <e> <s> they may have to make some qualification in the event of war occurring they must have special arrangements especially in the event of nuclear war for art objects to be removed from london into a bunker in wales <e> <s> i suspect perhaps the minister will tell us that the crown jewels are among those objects <e> <s> although the population itself is not to be evacuated art objects are <e> <s> what sort of judgment one makes of that is a matter for the government i think it is the case and the question is whether the crown jewels are among those objects <e> <s> if they are then in accepting the amendment the government would have to include words to provide for the eventuality of their movement to wales in the event of war <e>", "<cs> i too rather hope that the government will find a way of avoiding unnecessarily offending the scots <e> <s> the scots are fairly easily offended and to go out of our way possibly to offend them on this occasion would perhaps be misguided <e> <s> therefore whether or not my noble friend presses his amendment it is my hope that the government will be able to say a few words indicating that they take the sense of what he is seeking to express in the amendment <e>", "<cs> that is right <e>", "<cs> i think that i find myself on the side of the government in this matter <e> <s> it appears to me that the purpose of the subsection is to make sure that any question of increasing the fees charged would be subject to very careful attention <e> <s> i should have thought that if this subsection were left out it would leave the trustees a freer hand in the matter <e> <s> this is one point on which i feel they should not have that free hand <e> <s> if that is the purpose of the amendment i would be on the governments side rather than on that of the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is quite right <e> <s> what i said earlier related to the next amendment and not to this one <e> <s> therefore may i withdraw what i said and regard it as being said next time <e>", "<cs> it might be appropriate at this point if i were to repeat for the benefit of the minister and to follow up what i said just now in an out-of-order way <e> <s> the reason i think it necessary that subsection should remain in the bill is that as i said just now under the present control the ministerial control the entrance fee to kew has remained for a very long time at pence <e> <s> i think that is still the case <e> <s> that must have very considerable financial consequences and if you lift the responsibility from the minister and place it on the trustees the financial consequences of holding the level at pence will fall upon the trustees <e> <s> therefore since this is a ministerial action and since it is one of the very few actions of the minister which i approve of i should be very sorry to see this beneficent ministerial action removed from the minister not through lack of confidence in the trustees but since the financial consequences of holding the price down must necessarily fall upon the person who insists on such a holding down <e> <s> it seems to me appropriate therefore that the power should remain in the hands of the minister and that one should not saddle the trustees with the consequences of a policy which one hopes they would carry out but which they may not have the financial means to carry out if the burden were shifted from the minister and on to them <e>", "<cs> i think that my noble friend may want to put one or two further points of clarification to the noble earl before she makes up her mind whether or not to press this amendment <e> <s> one thing that occurs to me is what will be the nature of the proposed pension scheme <e> <s> it is the case that civil service pension schemes are unfunded <e> <s> there is no collection of monies which are built up in order to meet requirements of a current nature <e> <s> civil service pension schemes are met out of current revenue by means of government guarantee <e> <s> one of the great difficulties we are running into all over the place as a result of the creation of various quangos and public service corporations is the collection of vast sums of public money which are washing all over the place because all these pension schemes are <e> <s> in fact unfunded pension schemes and in my view this is undesirable <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble viscount agree that if the french were proved to be mistaken on this occasion it would not be the first time they had been wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords further to the question asked by my noble friend lord molloy is it <e>", "<cs> i have listened with interest to the debate on a number of amendments <e> <s> it appears to me that what is happening is that the secretary of state is rather in the position of a stand-up comedian who has decided that his act is getting a bit tired and frayed and that the best thing he can do is to go in for a ventriloquial act <e> <s> he has created the dummy which is the commission and is undecided to what extent his dummy is to be allowed to have a real life of its own <e> <s> in some circumstances he is uncertain to what extent the quango which he has created against the governments stated disbelief in quangos but none the less they create them should be allowed to spring to life <e> <s> every now and then the secretary of state says that the dummy must speak with his voice and with his voice only <e>", "<cs> i hope that i am not being obtuse but i cannot see how the insertion of the words in the first place shown in the marshalled list achieves all the beneficial effects which the noble earl has described <e> <s> is it really the case that this minor-sounding amendment removing these powers from the commission and placing them in the hands of the secretary of state or to use the analogy i employed earlier removing the powers from the hands of the dummy and placing them in those of the ventriloquist has these consequences <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl for clarifying that he was speaking to another amendment <e> <s> as i myself did the same thing on one occasion i understand how easily it can be done <e>", "<cs> i should like to support what my noble friend has said <e> <s> this schedule is pages long <e> <s> there ought to be a law against long schedules <e> <s> it will present those people who have to implement these provisions when the bill becomes an act with insoluble problems unless the government are subsequently to issue a series of clarifying pamphlets and leaflets <e> <s> one would have thought that <e>", "<cs> i find myself unattracted by the alternative preferred by my noble friend and the noble lord lord airedale <e> <s> it seems to me that the scots would greatly resent the notion i think for example of the scottish national party that the scottish nation embraced england <e> <s> i do not know why we should presume to suppose that the english nation embraces the scots <e> <s> i rather think they would reject our embrace so i do not think that that is much of a good idea <e> <s> the museums etc <e> <s> bill is very unattractive <e> <s> it seems to me that in order accurately to describe the bill we should call it the dogs dinner <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support what my noble friend has so eloquently said <e> <s> his question asks on what conditions the government have given permission to the government of the united states to have in this country an alternative command headquarters <e> <s> i hope that we shall be hearing from the noble viscount what those conditions are <e> <s> so far however there is one condition that the americans we know have not conceded and that is the condition that the prime minister asked mr schultz to concede recently when she suggested to him if newspaper reports are to be believed that there should be established a dual key operational control over american nuclear weapons in this country <e> <s> again if newspaper reports are to be believed mr schultz went away without having made that concession <e> <s> whether or not he said that he would put it to the american president we do not know <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble viscount sits down i would be very grateful if he would address himself to a single point <e> <s> is it not the case that greater accuracy of nuclear weapons has been occurring <e> <s> if it is being pointed out in different parts of the world that the greater accuracy of nuclear weapons can bring its own dangers this ought not to disturb the noble viscount but i suggest that he ought to respond to the increasing dangers which greater accuracy means and the fact that the americans have been talking in terms of counter-force strategy <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that to keep the dialogue going the best way is not to describe mr andropovs offer as bogus <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that the russians regard president reagans zero option as equally bogus and that if one merely trades insults that is not the best way of getting serious talks going <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise to the noble lord for having missed the first minute or two of his opening statement <e> <s> as a result i am not quite clear about the position relating to the cinematograph films council <e> <s> as i understood the noble lord he said that the council had been consulted but he did not say what its response was or whether it had agreed to the abolition of the quota as an immediate step <e> <s> if there was no immediate agreement to the abolition of the quota this would add weight to the view of my noble friend lord ponsonby of shulbrede that this measure may be premature and will best be dealt with as part of a general review of the film industry and film industry legislation something which one presumes is almost ready to be brought before both houses of parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord clarify that <e> <s> is he really telling us that the cinematograph films council was not unanimously in favour of this proposal <e> <s> is that what he is saying <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord thomas of swynnerton has told us that he thinks that president reagans zero option proposal is reasonable and acceptable and of course so it is from the purely western point of view which he adopted <e> <s> but if one wishes to reach an agreement on any subject and on any kind of debate one has to try and see the proposal as it appears from the point of view of the other side and not only from the point of view of those who may be regarded as belonging to the west <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may intervene if the soviet union were to accept the so-called zero option in the opinion of the noble lord would the government be prepared to suggest to president reagan that in return for that the west should be prepared to reduce our huge preponderance of submarine ballistic missile launching platforms which the soviet union obviously see as the reason why they need to have the sss <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that what my noble friend lord stewart said although it had the additional advantage of being amusing was entirely and exactly accurate <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that the conservative party cannot tolerate any greater london government which is not of its own political colour <e> <s> that is the object behind this question <e>", "<cs> my lords although i find myself in disagreement with the noble viscount lord trenchard over much of what he has said in reaching his conclusion i do not find myself quite so far apart from his final words as he might suppose <e> <s> there may be an opportunity on another occasion to examine the wider questions which he has raised <e> <s> perhaps however it would be better if at the beginning of what i have to say i addressed myself to the subject of the white paper the falklands campaign rather than to those wider issues <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down may i assure him that he did not in fact annoy me <e> <s> i shook my head in sorrow rather than in anger <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for that answer <e> <s> may i ask him whether he agrees that in spite of peaceful declarations on both sides the practical consequence of ineffective attempts to reach multilateral agreement has been a constant escalation of nuclear arms on both sides <e> <s> in this connection has he received the recent declaration of the warsaw pact states which i understand to be an attempt to arrest this situation and if the government have received the full text of the declaration are they now in a position to say what is their response to it <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that there has been quite a firm indication on the warsaw pact side that verification is now a possibility <e> <s> also is it not unrealistic to exclude british and french nuclear weapons when estimating the balance of terror between the warsaw pact and the nato powers <e> <s> having regard to all this would not the noble lord agree that some pressure should be put upon the united states to cease adopting so totally intransigent an attitude on these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that in time of war what really counts is not political control but operational control <e> <s> will not the government accept that until they re-establish operational control over the use of the weapons they will not be believed if they claim to be in control of the fate of our own country <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord proceeds will he permit me to say just one word <e> <s> as my noble friend on the front bench has said the question has been on the order paper for some time <e> <s> the preliminary part of it in fact consists of a quotation from a written answer given to me by the noble lord lord bellwin <e> <s> i would not dispute as to whether it is or is not in order and i rather welcome the idea that the question is going to be examined by the procedure committee so that the whole issue can be discussed <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble baroness for her suggestion and in the meantime i beg leave to be allowed to proceed with the question <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether or not he is aware that corruption is now becoming a way of life through the privatisation of refuse collection in wandsworth <e> <s> may i also ask him whether he is aware that traders have reported under their own names in the local paper that they are paying sums ranging from to a week to have their rubbish collected <e> <s> is the noble lord further aware that one trader who refused to pay any money has not had his rubbish collected for weeks and that he has complained bitterly since he himself is a tenant of grand met the private firm which is running the refuse collecting organisation <e> <s> in all these circumstances will the noble lord not ask wandsworth borough council to have another look at the matter and not to allow ideological questions to overcome their <e>", "<cs> it is an ideological matter <e> <s> it is a belief in privatisation <e>", "<cs> let me just finish <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord not therefore have a word with the wandsworth borough council about the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that as he suggests i shall send him details of the specific cases <e> <s> perhaps we may leave it at that <e>", "<cs> my lords as other noble lords have suggested the falklands story is the supreme example of the tail wagging the dog <e> <s> i do not know of any creature that keeps its brains in its tail <e> <s> i have never been an uncritical admirer of the foreign office <e> <s> we must take great care this afternoon to see that we do not convert the <e>", "<cs> my lords when the committee considers this matter will they bear in mind that in order to seek information it is first necessary to give information about the information one is seeking <e>", "<cs> we must hope that the substantial debate that we have had on this first amendment may serve to reduce the length of our discussions later in the bill <e> <s> we may hope that in vain but we must continue to hope it <e> <s> i have an amendment which follows this and which goes a great deal further than the amendment which was so eloquently moved by the noble viscount <e> <s> therefore i must support it because it goes a little way in the direction in which i want to go <e>", "<cs> my lords a couple of points <e> <s> first there is the general question of the desirability or otherwise of subsection a of the amendment which provides for a substantial number of women and also to include persons representative of ethnic minorities <e> <s> the question whether in any legislative or constitutional arrangement one makes provision for people who are not normally elected is always difficult <e> <s> it is not quite such a terrible thing to do as the noble lord lord beloff suggests <e> <s> it is often done <e> <s> one makes boxes in constitutions of different sorts to ensure that certain groups are represented <e> <s> i am used to this because i worked for many years with equity which has a whole number of different boxes to ensure that the various areas of the profession are represented <e> <s> there were arrangements for dancers chorus singers ballet dancers and so on to make sure that people were represented <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not exactly overwhelming is it <e> <s> what the noble earl has just said serves rather to confirm the desirability of some categorisation for women than otherwise <e> <s> it is done in the labour party <e> <s> the national executive committee of the labour party has a group reserved for women <e> <s> your lordships may not think this a particlarly good example but to us on this side of the house it is a good example and one which works <e>", "<cs> my lords the representations which i have received come from the civil service union branch no <e> <s> which is the branch based upon the victoria and albert museum and the letter i have is signed by its chairman whom i have met together with several other representatives of this grade <e> <s> therefore i do not think there is any doubt at all that these fears and this anxiety are genuinely held there <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl for that assurance <e> <s> maybe he could go this step further and say that when he or his colleagues have those further discussions which we envisage may take place in relation to the previous legislation he will be able in the event that he finds himself unable to accede to the best idea which is the inclusion of something in the legislation itself to give the sort of assurance which he has given in this house to the representatives of the staff <e> <s> they too may then understand that this does not mean what it is generally understood to mean which is that the only recourse is the ultimate recourse of reference to an industrial tribunal which is thought to be constituted as a final court of appeal in industrial matters <e> <s> if the noble earl were to say that <e> <s> i think that my noble friend on the front bench and i would be happier <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i saw a nod so having seen that nod i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i bow to the noble lords superior knowledge in these matters <e> <s> although that may be the technical reason it may also be that it has the practical advantage of allowing responsibility to be transferred from one department to another without having to amend the legislation which one would have to do if one spelt out for example the secretary of state for education and science although as the noble and learned lord says there may be that other historical reason as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not find the noble earls reason for refusing this amendment entirely convincing <e> <s> what he says in effect is that the secretary of state has always had the titular responsibility and of course that is true <e> <s> there have been some very peculiar changes in the responsibilities of the minister for the arts and in the location of the minister for the arts over the years <e> <s> the first minister for the arts the noble baroness lady lee was originally located in what was then the office of works <e> <s> presumably therefore the secretary of state would for a time have been the then secretary of state whoever he was who was responsible for that sub-department in the office of works i think it would be the minister we now call the secretary of state for the environment <e> <s> then there was a period during which the arts were the direct responsibility of the treasury <e> <s> whether the secretary of state under those circumstances would have been the chancellor of the exchequer or the chief secretary i am not really sure <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not feel very happy about that reply and i hope that the matter will be taken up in another place <e> <s> but in all the circumstances and having regard to the lateness of the hour and one thing and another i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a most disappointing reply <e> <s> far from opening up to the possibility which this probing amendment might have made for the serious examination of this matter as was suggested by the noble lord lord donaldson the noble earl has simply reiterated the wholly negative attitude which the government have held in this matter until now <e> <s> some of the objections which are made are totally invalid <e> <s> i repeat that a separate application must be made in each case <e> <s> the application has to conform to the rules which are laid down <e> <s> only objects which are of major importance to the cultural identity and history of the countries having been deprived thereof can be asked for <e> <s> the request having been made it is entirely up to the institution and the government to decide whether it should be accepted <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord not gravely mistaken in this matter <e> <s> should he not reconsider his answer <e> <s> is he aware that i have here detailed cartographical information upon which the invasion was based <e> <s> is he aware that the argentines could not have carried out the invasion without the material provided to them from government sources <e> <s> will he not look again at his answers which suggested that all that was available to them was tourist maps <e> <s> is it not the case that he would do himself greater credit if he were to admit that he made a mistake <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that i will seek to place these maps in the library so that noble lords can see them and make up their own minds about them <e> <s> is he further aware that at long last we seem to have extracted something in the nature of an admission of error from him <e> <s> would it not have been rather better if he had done that in the first instance <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that many people are worried about the governments proposal to undertake what would seem to be party political propaganda at the public expense <e> <s> is he also aware that the exclusion of british french and other nuclear weapons from balance calculations gives rise to false comparisons between the east and the west <e>", "<cs> moved amendment no <e>", "<cs> my lords i would be ready not to press the amendment if the noble earl had felt able to be a little more forthcoming than he was in his answer <e> <s> but it is the fact that many of the staffs of these museums will remain civil servants and there are considerable problems as to where the line shall be drawn at that level <e> <s> some of the staffs will remain civil servants and will be transferred to other branches of the civil service <e> <s> there is no alternative given to the others they are to be given an offer and if they refuse that offer there is no alternative in the bill as to what will be the result <e>", "<cs> my lords having regard to that more specific assurance i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that the government are elected by only a minority of the population and equally is it not very undesirable <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for that answer but is it not the case that within a short time of this negative answer being given the government changed their mind and decided that they would after all look into the matter and have a survey <e> <s> is it not therefore the case i am not suggesting any personal turpitude so far as the noble viscount lord trenchard is concerned that perhaps he was not adequately briefed on that occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that in view of the successful claims prosecuted by australian and american service personnel the government have very little alternative but to institute a survey and will he say when the report is to be expected <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord answer the second part of my question <e> <s> when is the report expected <e>", "<cs> rose to ask her majestys government whether they do not agree that it is undesirable to spend public money on party propaganda bearing in mind that the publication of the joint declaration by the soviet peace committee and the british peace delegation involves no such expenditure <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord not aware that the noble lord lord zuckerman who was chief scientific adviser at the time said that the white paper made it clear that there was in fact no civil defence against nuclear war <e> <s> however in view of the rumours will the noble lord say whether it is the case that the government are now reconsidering their civil defence policy and are contemplating whether to revert to a policy of evacuation and of public shelter <e> <s> has any decision been reached <e>", "<cs> my lords in their anxiety to retain the nuclear weapon must not the government take great care that they do not seek to condition the people of this country into a frame of mind in which they are prepared to accept it <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that this dreadful uht stuff ruins any cup of tea into which it is put and will he do his best to keep it out <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that a growing number of people regard the cruise missile as increasing the threat of extinction rather than as being a means of defence <e> <s> in the circumstances would it not be better if it were not deployed at all <e>", "<cs> my lords do the government not realise that the case for trident has in fact evaporated <e> <s> will they not listen to the noble and gallant lord lord carver who described it as being of no bloody use <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that it is not in fact customary for ministers to ask questions of opposition back-benchers <e> <s> but since he has done so i will tell him that the reason why the soviet union <e>", "<cs> my lords i was asked a question <e> <s> is the minister aware that the reason why the soviet union obviously want to include all weapons systems in any negotiations is that these weapons systems are targeted upon them <e> <s> just as we want to include weapons which are targeted upon us so obviously they want to include weapons systems which are targeted upon the soviet union <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord not aware that sometimes there have been cases in which missiles have almost been launched as a result of false information given by computer or by other means <e> <s> therefore what is intended to be a second strike can become a first strike <e> <s> is the noble lord not aware of the fact that there is an increasing feeling in the country that it is a gross dereliction of duty by the government to allow a position to arise in which a matter of life and death to the people of this country can be determined by the action of a foreign national <e>", "<cs>

earl unaware of the fact that there has been considerable criticism in the united states on a number of grounds <e> <s> is he aware of the fact that the quality control of the manufacturing company general dynamics has been subject to very heavy criticism <e> <s> is he further aware that in the rush to produce these weapons at a particular time for political reasons much of the work on the software for example has been scant and done rather hurriedly <e> <s> that also has been the subject of criticism in the united states <e> <s> in the circumstances is it not a matter of simple precaution for the safety of our own people quite apart from the undesirable characteristics of the weapon itself that we should have our own team to verify whether or not these criticisms in the united states are valid <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl permit me through him to tell my noble friend that the objection to the cruise missile is that it is essentially a destabilising weapon and that to have it unreliable as well makes it not only destabilising but could also accidentally plunge us into serious nuclear damage if not worse <e> <s> under those circumstances will the minister discuss with his colleagues the possibility that they look at this whole question again if for no other reason than the safety of themselves and their families <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords who have spoken i congratulate the noble lord lord nugent of guildford upon introducing this short debate <e> <s> however in contradistinction to the noble baroness lady lane-fox who has just spoken i find myself not in total disagreement but in substantial disagreement with the noble lord <e> <s> lord nugent <e> <s> i believe that at present the standards of the bbc in respect for

all playwrights must be allowed to hold up a mirror to reality even when that reality may be distasteful to some viewers <e> <s> on another point i believe that there is no justification at all for lord nugents fears about the theatre <e> <s> the abolition of the censorship powers of the lord chamberlain has been beneficial and has removed what had become a total absurdity <e>", "<cs> my lords it is indeed a privilege to follow the noble lord lord hunt and also the noble lord lord hanson in this debate <e> <s> however although it is a privilege it is a rather daunting one because i suspect that both noble lords who have spoken before me know on the one hand a good deal more about the bill and on the other hand a good deal more about its background than most of us in the chamber <e> <s> i rather suspect too that if the whole process had stemmed from a hanson committee rather than from the hunt committee we would have a rather different bill before us this evening <e> <s> therefore i hope that we shall not only hear further from the noble lord lord hanson in general but i hope also that we shall hear further from him in the later stages of this bill when we shall all seek to improve it <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord not aware that it is perfectly possible for the government to maintain their mistaken policies about limiting government expenditure without dismantling big city government <e>", "<cs> i agree with my noble friend and i disagree with what the noble lord opposite has just said <e> <s> it seems to me that the secretary of states hands ought to be tied considering the things they get up to when they are untied <e> <s> so far as my noble friends amendment is concerned all that it seeks to do is something which is very customary that is

very customary and reasonable thing i should have thought <e> <s> it is applied in many bills and i see no reason why it should not apply in this one <e>", "<cs> i should like to apologise to the noble baroness for the fact that in the interests of brevity i failed to pay tribute to the notable part she played in these proceedings a few years ago <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it the noble lord the minister is not saying that he does not like the amendment because it seeks to prevent something happening which is going to happen <e> <s> he does not like the amendment because it seeks to prevent something happening which is not going to happen anyway <e> <s> would i be correct in reading the ministers view along those lines <e> <s> if i am and the minister has nodded vigorously i can take it as sufficient assurance to enable me to withdraw the amendment which without further ado i now seek the leave of your lordships to do <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord not agree that the consequences of rapid deployment have usually been unfortunate if not disastrous for whichever country carries out such a deployment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the

nuclear exchange between the soviet union and the west <e> <s> finally is he aware that the stockholm conference can be the start of this process if it is treated seriously on both sides <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that the american nuclear posture is of great concern to many reasonable people throughout the country and that if any noble lord translates a concern of that sort into a pro-soviet position it is merely evidence of a closed mind which itself is dangerous <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord but i wonder whether he has fully taken on board the conclusion of this high level world scientific conference including four nobel laureates that if even a small proportion of the present stock of nuclear arms were launched it might well bring about the extinction of humanity in the northern hemisphere in any event and possibly even in the world <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that although this report has received wide coverage elsewhere and is believed by some to be one reason for president reagans recent change of tune it has had very little coverage in this country <e> <s> will he make the report available in the library to noble lords and in particular the transcript of the satellite television dialogue which took place between american and soviet scientists which ended by the vice-president of the soviet academy describing nuclear weapons as <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord the minister be good enough to explain to his noble friend lord orr-ewing that this matter is not assisted by name calling on either side <e> <s> will he further recognise that the main issue here is not so much the preponderance of weapons on either side but the fact that even a small proportion of either the soviet or the american weaponry could virtually destroy mankind <e> <s> is that not a fact which ought constantly to be borne in mind <e>", "<cs> the difficulty in dealing with this schedule and indeed with the bill as a whole is that none of us knows what we are talking about <e> <s> that is a common criticism of this chamber <e> <s> it is true particularly of this bill and also it is true of every other bill which has ever been introduced concerning the creation of television services in this country <e> <s> if one examines for example the act which set up the independent television authority one finds that the shape structure and nature of the authority as we now know it simply was not envisaged in the legislation itself <e> <s> it has arisen by a strange combination of pressures and on the whole i think the results of that have not been too had <e> <s> but we are now attempting to create a structure in a situation in which television is already established and so our position is even more difficult than it was in those days <e> <s> the existing structures are bound to condition to some extent the new structure that we

their minds and will not in fact abolish the glc <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> but my lords does the noble lord realise that in addition to his other duties the secretary of state has been acting very successfully as chief recruiting agent for the campaign for nuclear disarmament <e> <s> in view of that is the minister aware that a number of conservatives who have recently joined the campaign have paid tribute to the efforts of the ministers right honourable friend <e> <s> in these circumstances and even more seriously will not the minister suggest to the prime minister that the time may now be right to appoint a minister for disarmament <e> <s> the minister will recall that this was a position previously

clauses <e>", "<cs> may i be one of those who want a small second bite at the cherry <e> <s> i think that the answer to the eloquent reply which the minister has given is contained in the notes on clauses <e> <s> the notes on clauses say that under clause the cable authority are to ensure so far as they can that all licensed services comply with certain requirements <e> <s> the notes go on to point out that the reason for the proviso so far as they can is that the authority does not have the same degree of control over the situation as do the two existing authorities <e> <s> that is precisely why we want it in the legislation <e> <s> the cable authority will not have the powers that the two existing authorities have <e> <s> therefore if the authority wanted to do this it could

amendments together <e> <s> although the noble lord lord buxton said that our approach to the problem is different nevertheless i think that i was correct in saying that the objective that we seek is

point it would be illegal for a non-profit making organisation to pass anything to a profit-making organisation <e> <s> i know this full well from the operations of the theatre where non-profit making organisations associated with profit-making organisations are entirely forbidden in law from passing effectively from one to the other <e>", "<cs> before passing on or reaching a decision on the matter which my noble friend lord mcintosh may wish to do i wonder whether the noble lord lord elton will be kind enough to answer a question <e> <s> in the event that in some part of the world a serious atrocity were to take place and it was desired by some group somewhere or other to draw attention to it vividly by illustrating it showing the reality of the event on the screen and producing

the decision <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount aware that the percentage increase in bankruptcies under the governments aegis since greatly exceeds the increase in the number of small

agreement with him <e> <s> but before i know whether or not i am in agreement with him i have to understand what the amendment is about <e> <s> i am sorry to say that at the moment i do not understand

i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord not aware that on occasions the prime minister has seemed to go further than that and to assert the existence of a british veto <e> <s> is he not further aware that no american official has confirmed the existence of such a veto <e> <s> indeed it has been specifically denied on a number of occasions by the secretary of states department by among others mr paul volcker <e> <s> is it not the case that the prime minister went to the united states of america for the purpose of obtaining a twin-key arrangement and failed to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords may i perhaps conclude this matter by asking the noble lord whether he is aware that in the television interview to which he referred the american president did not in fact confirm the right to veto <e> <s> what he said was that constitutes referring to the agreement a sort of veto doesnt it <e> <s> he was subsequently told by his own officials that it did not constitute a veto <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord for that

by the sheffied city council in sheffield town hall on th june so that the official can bring back a report to the government on the findings of this conference and the government may be further informed on the matter <e>", "<cs> is the noble lord aware that his own attitude to these matters has shown greater realism in recent weeks and will he therefore not put his head back into the sand as is being encouraged by his noble friend <e> <s> will he address himself or ask his right honourable friend to address himself directly to the washington conference and make his own assessment of this matter if he distrusts the findings of the british conference in oxford <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government agree at least to enter into discussions on the matter <e> <s> putting on one side the

move the situation in the direction of peace <e> <s> for example will the noble baroness say whether it would not be desirable at this point to approach the soviet union on the question of the gulf war before the situation deteriorates further <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the americans could learn to do the same <e> <s> will the noble baroness not address herself this morning to the most immediate threat to peace which has arisen since this question was put down that is the threat of escalation of the gulf war into an international conflict <e> <s> will she not say as i suggested in my earlier supplementary question whether it would not be a very good idea to approach the soviet union on this question before the situation gets completely out of control <e>", "<cs> my lords would

safeguard against irresponsible private prosecution <e>", "<cs> i have listened with great care to the response of the noble lord lord nugent to my noble friends amendment but i do not feel happy about it <e> <s> a justice of the peace is possibly not the right person to make this kind of decision <e> <s> it can be an individual justice of the peace <e> <s> the bill does not require that a bench of magistrates takes the decision <e> <s> if it did i would feel happier <e> <s> there are a number of justices of the peace or at least one who voted against the last amendment <e> <s> this

from the benches on my right that the consequence of carrying this measure at this time would be very peculiar indeed <e> <s> i am not sure on which side i stand on this issue <e> <s> i am not at all sure that intrinsically the clause is necessarily wrong <e> <s> i should like to consider it at greater length and in context <e> <s> this is exactly what we are not doing here this afternoon <e> <s>

actually ask for the same video classification as the noble lord just suggested <e> <s> it asks for a similar video classification recognising that it is not absolutely certain that the authority will

say this to my noble friend but i do not feel entirely happy with that suggestion for the following reason <e> <s> both our names are attached to this group of amendments <e> <s> i think that they are all alternative <e> <s> on the one hand the first series of amendments suggests the substitution of <e>", "<cs> my lords if that is the general wish of the house i would see no objection to a general debate covering the whole field but i think it ought to be agreed that if the position arises in which the matter is put to the question then the amendments would be separate and would not form part of the whole <e>", "<cs> my lords i find that entirely satisfactory and as i have already moved the amendments in my name perhaps it would be in order for someone else to proceed to move subsequent amendments or to take part in the debate which i have initiated on my amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords it might be convenient then if before i hear other views expressed i were to say why at the moment it seems to me to be better to deal with the point in the way i suggest rather than in the way that my noble friend subsequently suggests <e> <s> one of the reasons why it is better to deal with it in the way i suggest although my noble friend and i are close together on this as has been seen by the fact that our purpose is identical because we have signed each others amendments and are therefore involved in suggesting alternatives is that my amendment is simpler <e> <s> it removes the sex shop from the scene and simply substitutes the words premises licensed for the purpose <e> <s> in some cases it may be decided that the premises will be a sex shop <e> <s> in some cases it may be decided that they will be some other premises <e> <s> that seems to me to be simpler than the other method which is more complicated of introducing the words <e>", "<cs> my lords before i briefly give the further views to which i believe i am entitled i should like to say to the right reverend prelate that i do not go along with him in his wholesale condemnation of sex shops <e> <s> i just see no reason at all why they should be selected out for special privilege in this fashion and given a monopoly of a new development which will no doubt increase their prosperity enormously <e> <s> for that reason i think this matter must be persisted with <e> <s> but between them my noble friends and the noble lord lord nugent have convinced me that there must be a schedule to the bill <e> <s> one cannot provide for licensing without providing the means whereby the licensing may be carried away <e> <s> i am therefore persuaded having listened to the discussion that my noble friends amendments are more compatible with the schedule because they were designed with the schedule in mind than are my own amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper and i hope that the noble lord knows the answer <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord unaware that he himself in this chamber said on th may that the government preferred to rely upon the words of president reagan rather than on mine <e> <s> we are all entitled to know upon what words the government are relying <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that everyone would like to believe what he says <e> <s> but since the two parties concerned the president and the prime minister refuse to confirm publicly that they mean the same thing by the agreement the public must conclude that they mean different things and that therefore although the prime minister may claim a veto she does not actually possess one <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the agreement does not give this country a veto and that nobody other than the prime minister in either of our two countries has ever said that it does <e>", "<cs> my lords i am privileged to follow the noble baroness lady airey of abingdon for whose late and sadly lamented husband i entertained warm personal affection combined with total political disagreement <e> <s> however i cannot follow her altogether in her remarks concerning the role of the press <e> <s> one can understand the fear expressed by men

government have no intention of putting vat on books <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord nevertheless agree that there is no intellectual basis for civil defence and will he in these

perhaps that the two were not unrelated to each other and that it might have been desirable to defer consolidation until any legislation arising from the film policy white paper had been decided <e>

the government on this occasion to come over to the view which i think they will eventually that the oppositions opinion about this matter is right <e>", "<cs> my lords is the refusal of the noble baroness to give any further figures because the figures are not available or because she deems it unwise to give us those figures <e> <s> is she aware that the confusion of the governments interest

facts <e> <s> is he aware that general meyer the united states chief of staff has said to congress that the operational concept for cruise missiles is quick launching at the direction of the theatre commander <e> <s> it would seem that the statement that has been made and now repeated that the prime minister holds a veto over the firing of these missiles is once again not in accordance with reality <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether he himself will not look again at the answer <e> <s> i think he will see that as has happened in another place once again his department is carrying out the operation of deceiving this house and the people of this country <e>", "<cs> rather than dealing with the reality as it really is <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord advise the noble lord lord winstanley that if he wishes to persist he can change the name of the organisation to doctors spouses association because the husbands of woman doctors are surely equally entitled to benefit from any advantages they may gain <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> but my lords is the noble minister not aware that

"<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that this report excludes altogether any consideration of the noise and number index and that if that factor is taken into consideration then the argument in favour of a reduction rather than an increase in heathrow movements becomes over-whelming <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that it is becoming increasingly apparent to more and more people that trident is an expensive mistake and that the government should change their mind about this before they get themselves involved in a situation in which they cannot escape from a project which is of no value whatsoever and which is a profound waste of money which could be well spent elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will permit me to do so i invite him to come in in a moment <e>

general operation of the system we currently have for the purchase of works of art <e> <s> there is a strong feeling that the state organisations are being exploited <e> <s> i suggest that as part of the examination i am proposing to the minister in this motion one matter which ought to come under scrutiny is the operation of that system <e> <s> not its operation in any particular case necessarily

councils drama panel and the uncertainty as to whether any of the other panels consider it worthwhile was sufficient evidence of the proposition which is widely held in the council that the situation has changed that the minister responds to the cabinet the cabinet responds to the chairman and the chairman hands onto mr luke rittner who represents it <e> <s> the point here is this <e> <s> it is not whether or not this <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl is giving us a wonderful history and a list of all the artistic achievements in the country <e> <s> i hope that he is not personally taking

the same undesirable practice on this point <e> <s> i am in favour of sponsorship and as chairman of the battersea arts centre i am also in favour of small-scale sponsorship because we have done quite well out of business <e> <s> the problem with business sponsorship is that it is unreliable <e> <s> american experience shows that in the long run one has to be very careful that it does not have a bad or deleterious effect on public sponsorship <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl the minister in his typically comprehensive and capable response to this debate on one or two points tempted me to break our custom that the mover of such a debate as this does not himself attempt anything in the nature of a detailed reply to it <e> <s> noble lords will perhaps forgive me if i refer to a couple of points before asking the permission of your lordships to withdraw the motion <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord lord annan has not understood at the end of this debate that in the minds of many members of this house there has been a change in the position of the arts council then he has not been listening very closely to the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that whether one takes this stage by stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the airland battle concept is an offensive all-purpose attack idea including nuclear conventional and chemical weapons that it has no part in nato doctrine and that it has no relationship to the original notion of strategic nuclear deterrence <e> <s> bearing that in mind is the noble lord quite sure that the american suggestion that the cruise weapons on our soil would be used under these circumstances is entirely wrong

geneva <e> <s> possibly following the example set opposite i could with your lordships permission leave the matter at that and hope that we shall be able to celebrate an improved relationship before very long <e>", "<cs> my lords as even a cruise missile is times more destructive than the weapons used on hiroshima and since any one of them could destroy a city the size of london and all its inhabitants is not questioning the numbers rather a lunatic exercise <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that in regard to chemical weapons indeed the same may apply to some other weapons as well it is somewhat difficult to know whether the research and development that is being carried out is being carried out for defensive or offensive purposes <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that one of the problems here is that civil defence organisations are required to take part in the pretence that it is possible to provide civil defence against nuclear war <e> <s> if the government were to make it clear that their function was other than that and that they had a function relating to civil emergencies in the unlikely eventuality of a non-nuclear war something of that sort the organisation would be easier and more people would join <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord fails to distinguish between what is humane and what is inevitable <e>", "<cs> my lords i venture to suggest respectfully that the choices before us are not quite so bleak and so harsh as the noble duke has just suggested <e> <s> he says that we have a free choice between on the one hand unrestricted information open to anybody and on the other a totally secret state <e> <s> as in most political matters and whether or not we like it we have to strike a compromise and discover a happy medium <e> <s> the noble lord lord wigoder in his very impressive opening speech suggested that that line is drawn in the wrong place on the side of excessive secrecy <e> <s> the noble duke the duke of portland has just suggested that the position we have at the moment is ideal but i believe he may not have considered the full implications of our excessive devotion to secrecy <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord give way <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the shortage of demand in this area is <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that a number of important organisations

house on this matter and since my noble friend has received no help whatsoever <e> <s> i hope he will decide that this is a matter on which the house ought to decide <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that while it seems that any wish expressed by president reagan is the prime ministers command the foreign secretary does not seem quite so eager <e> <s> is it not the case that so far as

participating in research we have no intention of going any further <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that this question illustrates the problem which has arisen by reason of the fact that although he does not accept the figures the figures are generally accepted and are nonetheless there <e> <s> the noble earls failure to accept them does not abolish the situation which at some time someone must deal with <e>", "<cs> my lords on the question of a nuclear freeze while it is understandable that the government do not wish to reach a freeze on intermediate range land based nuclear

americans have said that they have the intention of commandeering areas three miles beyond their existing perimeters in the event of an emergency occurring <e> <s> in these circumstances are not those

cover their needs in this matter to enable them to do the job that they are required to take on under this bill is about million <e> <s> they have said that they want twice as much as that <e> <s> that is the reason why we are here that is the reason why this amendment is on the marshalled list and that is precisely why i say that unintentionally perhaps the noble earl has misled the arts council in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that a congressional report reports it

the noble baroness for that informative and accurate answer <e> <s> would she not agree on reflection that to circulate a comment on a hypothesis without circulating the hypothesis itself is perhaps

the noble baroness i think it would be appropriate to leave this matter at least for the time being for a few days if perhaps not a little longer <e>", "<cs> my lords in so far as the message of the noble viscount lord mersey was that we must do everything in our power to avoid war altogether any sort of war i could find myself in agreement with him <e> <s> but he will forgive me if i do not

not initiate legislation they will at least not oppose it <e> <s> is he aware that the wider question of voluntary euthanasia and the rather narrow one of mercy killing are in fact two different issues <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord answer the second part of my question that he understands that the narrow issue of mercy killing on which the government have replied is a different issue from the wider question of voluntary euthanasia <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that i personally think that a quota based on air time is probably better than any alternative for

expressed himself with cogency and with an ease which many of us might envy and i am sure that all of us will welcome his further contributions to our discussions in the months and years to come <e>",

of people for the development will be very much less than it is at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord leaves the aircraft noise problem will he recognise that while it is true as he says that by various means the contour has been improved if under these proposals heathrow is allowed to continue to grow the improvement which has been secured will once again be threatened and

washington in order to dispel some of those doubts <e> <s> will the noble baroness agree that if the object of the exercise is to make it clear that the west is equally keen to reduce nuclear arms to

her visit to washington <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that the noble baroness is nonetheless aware

most serious that this country has to face in the world today <e> <s> in the circumstances is it not the case that the vast majority of the people of this country desire a ban on nuclear testing and

earl lord ferrier and myself will the government look again at the whole matter <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the prime ministers famous four points inadequate though they were

noble lord say why this memorandum has to remain secret <e> <s> is he aware that this secrecy has never been really fully justified and that a reversion to secret diplomacy in such a key area needs public justification if the government are to give or carry conviction on the point <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that there are widespread fears in many countries not even excluding our own about taking the arms race into space <e> <s> is she not further aware that there are apparently members of her own government who are apprehensive about american domination in

allowed to increase <e> <s> has not this policy been very effectively introduced with the result that british industry has gravely declined and unemployment has increased <e> <s> is this not an integral part of the governments policy <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that if we could achieve a single weekly publication in which we could have the itv the bbc and radio programmes in a single magazine it would perform a service which would be appreciated by all noble lords in this house and i think by people outside it <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that i have down a question on that subject and that i shall not expect her to answer it now <e> <s> in reply to what my noble friend on the front bench has said will she be a little more specific about what precisely is intended to be happening in geneva in the resumed talks which i believe are taking place just now <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that his last remark about the admission charge is the only unwelcome news we have had on this subject so far <e> <s> will he say that it is his hope that the funding will be on a basis on which the museum will not be forced to have to charge the public for entry <e>", "<cs> but my lords has the minister not been told that the arts council has written to the governors of sadlers wells saying that it has no intention in future of funding what it calls a receiving house an extraordinary phrase to use in respect of such a theatre <e> <s> it appears therefore not only to have failed to shoulder the responsibility which the government placed upon it but to have changed its policy so as to remove not only the substitution of the glc grant but its own grant as well <e> <s> the sadlers wells theatre is therefore in the frightful position that it will have to close down on th may unless something is done <e> <s> will the noble lord ask his right honourable friend to look urgently into this question to see whether funding can in the circumstances be taken upon the budget of his own department and if the arts council is unwilling to act as a conduit in the matter to find some other means of making sure that this

noble lord permit me to say that i have been interested in the defence of this country ever since the last war <e>", "<cs> my lords the speech that we have just heard from the noble lord lord montague is indeed reassuring <e> <s> many of us have felt grave anxiety about this subject but what he has said helps to put that to rest <e> <s> whether it is entirely capable of doing so is another question and i was glad to hear that he raised no difficulty about the question of making the governments present good intentions more specific in the legislation <e> <s> that i think is a helpful attitude and i hope the government may follow along those lines because in legislation one not only expresses ones current good intentions but one expresses something which is binding upon the future and no one can guarantee that current good intentions will be carried out in years to come <e> <s> therefore it will be much better for everybody for the government for the commission for the museum and certainly more satisfactory for the opposition as my noble friend has indicated if those things which the noble lord has indicated it is the governments intention to do are made more specific <e> <s> this is one example which will be very welcome <e>", "<cs> my lords it was stated that as a consequence of the decision in future the money raised by the museum will be able to be used by it for its own purposes and will no longer be automatically deducted <e> <s> i was not so much expressing my fear but the fear held in museum circles that an end consequence may be that museums in endeavouring to maximise their income and possibly accompanied by a reduction in government contributions may find themselves forced in the direction of admission charges <e> <s> i am glad to hear the minister is doing what he can to reassure us that those fears are unworthy and can be set at rest <e> <s> i am sure that that is a genuine assurance from him and i hope that it is correct <e>", "<cs> my lords since the noble lord has chosen to cast an aspersion on islington local authority will he not agree that one of the consequences of abolishing an all-london authority is to place upon borough authorities responsibilities which they are ill-fitted to assume <e> <s> is it not the case that if islington were to fund to the extent which has been suggested it would probably be in trouble with the auditor because it would be said that only a very small proportion of the audience at sadlers wells actually comes from islington <e> <s> so the government hit it both ways they are critical if it fails to fund and they shoot it down in flames if it does <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that it is somewhat urgent that the prime minister should now do so <e> <s> is the minister aware that mr gorbachev in his speech yesterday seemed to be deeply depressed by president reagans response in so far as there has been one from his point of view <e> <s> he said as i understand from the press notices that western politicians will have to answer the question are they prepared to part with nuclear weapons at all <e> <s> is it not the case that the suspicion is arising that so far as the west is concerned there are no circumstances in which they would be prepared to part with nuclear weapons <e>

the house is entirely mistaken <e> <s> is he aware that the soviet union has imposed upon itself for several months a unilateral test ban which has not been followed in the west <e> <s> does he not agree that the best way of resolving this matter would be to ask the west to imitate the soviet union in this respect <e>", "<cs> we are told that when appointments are considered at a high level in

whether clause shall stand part of the bill <e> <s> it was my intention to table an amendment to the bill <e> <s> this arose from a discussion which took place on second reading when the noble lord and i had a little chat about the question of museum charges not i hasten to say the question in general that is a matter which those noble lords who are in a position to stay late on wednesday may have an opportunity to discuss but in relation to this particular museum <e>", "<cs> i think that my noble friend wishes to add another point but perhaps it would be appropriate for me to conclude my own point here <e> <s> i am sorry that i have been unable to clarify the noble lords mind on this issue <e> <s> since i do not wish to employ the methods advocated by dr johnson in difficult cases i think i shall have to move an amendment on report <e> <s> that more specific method will enable us to see the point even clearer although such an amendment might well be attached to a different clause from the one we have been discussing <e> <s> i take that point <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness appreciate that in following these exchanges it is very difficult to discover whether the government agree or do not agree that there has been a refusal by the american government to discuss space-based nuclear weapons <e> <s> could the noble baroness at least clarify that point <e> <s> do the government agree that the americans have refused to discuss these matters in the sense that the question poses <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now read a second time <e> <s> may i say in moving the second reading of this bill that i very much regret its necessity <e> <s> in as minister for the arts it was my privilege to abolish the admission charges which then prevailed

indicating in doing so that he thought that it would be very undesirable indeed that such charges should be re-introduced <e> <s> i said that legislation was unnecessary but events have shown that i was wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord would give way i should like to correct him on a point of accuracy <e> <s> it would be very kind indeed and i should <e>", "<cs> my lords may i assure the noble lord that on this point if on no other we are entirely at one <e> <s> i have no objection whatsoever to exit charges <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships would not welcome my replying or seeking to reply at any length to the debate at this time of night <e> <s> i shall content myself with thanking those noble lords who have contributed and even those who have not seen wholly eye to eye with the views that i expressed in moving the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords may i intervene on a point of fact <e> <s> the noble and learned lord will be aware that it is not unusual for legislation to contain recommendations that bodies shall consult this that or the other body before deciding what they do <e> <s> it is a practice which seems to me to have many advantages <e> <s> it at least gives those bodies the assurance that what they put forward is likely to be considered <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that i am not advocating a unilaterial reduction in our armaments at the moment although that might be a good thing to do at some other time <e> <s> at the moment is it not the case that the prime minister has just rejected an offer from the soviet union to follow the example which they themselves have unilaterally given already which is to discontinue testing nuclear

testing a declaratory gesture is to murder the english language <e> <s> in the circumstances will he not make a similar declaratory gesture if that is what it is and decide that this government too will stop testing <e> <s> if a unilateral decision to stop testing is a declaratory gesture then a large number of us on this side of the house will welcome it <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that we on this side of the house support all methods of fund raising including business fund raising which i was instrumental in starting when i was minister for the arts <e> <s> is he also aware that we are wholly opposed to charges for entry to museums and that such charges should not be associated with fund raising <e> <s> there are the two things to be considered on the one hand fund raising by all legitimate means but on the other charges for entry to museums and even invitations of a semi-compulsory nature of that sort <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am in the hands of your lordships house <e> <s> if the view expressed by the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale is widely held in the house it would perhaps be more appropriate if i sought to bring the matter forward on another occasion <e> <s> however it seems to me to be essentially a matter for the house more than for me personally to decide <e> <s> i merely say that if the house is persuaded by what the noble and learned lord lord simon said i would not seek to persuade your lordships to go ahead at this time if

learned lord lord simon of glaisdale <e> <s> in all the circumstances it seems to me that unless there is a widespread view that we should not proceed on balance and with due deference to what he said

him for agreeing not to press this motion further <e> <s> i think there is a slight difference between us on the question of what actually was the effect of the act <e> <s> i think it was rather more substantial than he imagines <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls knows that just as i could be required reasonably to take another look at his opposition to clause it would not be proper for me to give a similar undertaking on this amendment <e> <s> i shall explain why <e> <s> the noble lord indicates that he has this knowledge because he made what amounted to a second reading speech

noble lord aware that i am sorry to hear of his profound disagreement <e> <s> i had hoped that he would say that the prime ministers intervention to prevent american aircraft flying from bases in this

bases in the united kingdom <e> <s> is it not relevant to draw attention to the prime ministers decision to forbid the flying of american aircraft from bases in this country which suggests that at long last the government are realising that the presence of american aircraft in this country can be a danger rather than a defence <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to acquaint the noble lord with the point that the document was signed on behalf of the parliamentary labour party by our defence spokesman in the other chamber mr denzil davies and that that parliamentary labour party will i hope long include mr denis healey who is in a position to speak for himself on all occasions <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords

<e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that although the noble viscount the leader of the house objected yesterday to my use of the word accomplice it exactly applies to those who facilitate the murder of civilians <e>", "<cs> my lords it is understandable as the noble lord lord broxbourne has so ably demonstrated that this debate in parliament should confine itself very largely to the immediate questions was the american raid justified <e> <s> was it justified in law <e> <s> was it justifiable homicide or a murderous crime <e> <s> these are the issues to which this chamber and the

"<cs> my lords in considering this order will the government take particular note of the arts support organisations which seem to have fallen out of consideration in this matter <e> <s> the government

missiles which are based on our soil <e> <s> in those circumstances without agreement within the parties on whether there is or is not a veto in the event of a dispute the assurances that the minister and the prime minister give to the british people are entirely worthless <e> <s> furthermore is the minister aware that without operational control in a crisis political control is quite useless <e>

from what mr mcnamara the defence secretary said <e> <s> he said that there is no veto <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that it has been said by successive american secretaries of state for defence that as far as they are concerned there will be discussion and there will be consultation but that the final decision rests in the hands of the firing authority which is the united states

office has never been as good as it was when under direct ministerial control <e> <s> will the minister do a reverse privatisation so to speak and bring the post office back under direct control of

to the two members of your lordships house in question <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the minister agree that even by its political opponents it is generally agreed that the glc made a great success of the improvements which they carried out at the royal festival hall <e> <s> would the noble lord also agree that the south bank board would be well advised to follow up or to carry on that policy

his own front bench <e> <s> he failed to secure the support of the noble viscount lord eccles who was the architect of theatre charging <e> <s> if anyone is enthusiastic about theatre charging it is the noble viscount <e> <s> the reason is that the amendment is a nonsense <e> <s> i hesitate to suggest to the noble lord that it is deliberately a wrecking amendment however i have not heard anything

the representative body of museums has carried out a survey of its membership <e> <s> by an overwhelming majority it has decided to support the bill <e> <s> it decided to do so because it regards what

signature of the united kingdom was conditional upon what she calls this understanding <e> <s> the effect of that is precisely the same as a reservation <e> <s> therefore if the government are relying

both these companies have been rigorously examined by the noble lord lord rayner and mr clive priestley and have been given a clean bill of health <e> <s> is that scrutiny not to be valued more than the so-called investigative journalism which is really a form of disguised philistinism <e>", "<cs> my lords as the matter is highly important and extremely controversial can the noble viscount go a little further <e> <s> is it not normal and can he not assure us that a decisior will not be taken by the government before the opportunity has been given for a full debate in both houses of parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for that comprehensive information <e> <s>

lords would it not have been better had the director expressed himself in less controversial terms <e> <s> is the minister aware that there is a wide body of opinion in favour of the return of the marbles to greece <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord accept that i shall do my best to go in the direction indicated by my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in these circumstances i would not press the main point of the question <e> <s> it may be however that the noble and learned lord feels able to answer the second part of the question <e> <s> this asks why other newspapers may publish that which the two newspapers referred to the <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for that information <e> <s> can he tell the house what the situation is since that report <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the information which i have given is not rumour but comes from the governments own report on the subject <e> <s> is it not the case that the last report on these so-called incidents at dounreay said that there were such incidents most of them admittedly of a minor character <e> <s> however there was a large number of incidents <e> <s> that is why it is highly desirable to know about these matters as soon as possible <e> <s> will a further official report be made about what has happened between and today <e>", "<cs> my lords as the prime minister will not be present at this meeting are not the questions about her qualities about which there may be more than one opinion somewhat irrelevant to the question on the order paper <e> <s> is it not the case that <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that one is inclined to forget that there are two parties on the alliance benches with different policies <e>", "<cs> my lords on the question itself <e> <s> is it not the case that a simple and non-controversial way of dealing with the matter would be simply to leave out clause and put nothing back in its place <e>", "<cs> my lords every nuclear power station must necessarily be a potential hazard of great consequence and also an inviting target <e> <s> one of the assurances given by the secretary of state for energy recently was to say the least of it a bit glib and possibly even verging on the mendacious <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness agree and will she explain it to my noble friend that when democracy produces a form of government and there is no doubt that this is a genuinely elected government in nicaragua no other country however large however important and however near is entitled to destablilise it <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the only comment i have read in any section of the british press concerning this proposed conference has been extremely hostile to it <e> <s> is it not extremely hard for anyone in this country to discover anything anywhere mentioning it in favourable terms <e> <s> your lordships may therefore rest easy in your beds <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of that answer would it not be improper to pursue the matter further except perhaps to say that when the judgment is issued it may be legitimate to hope that it will be in general terms and will not refer to specific newspapers <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for that reply <e> <s> but is it not a case in which the government should intervene <e> <s> is it not a case in which a multinational has taken over a small company the multinational has no understanding of the business and it has acted with the utmost brutality by dismissing the workers out of hand in what my conservative successor as member for the constituency mr david mellor who is a member of the government has described as a gross over-reaction to a minor dispute <e> <s> as a result of that brutal lockout men are out of work and the amputees in the area are suffering severely <e> <s> is it not a matter in which the government should intervene to bring to an end an unnecessary dispute which if the parties could get round a table reasonably could be settled overnight <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not clear from what the noble baroness has just said that the government are definitely quite involved in the matter <e> <s> they must be involved because of their concern for the amputees <e> <s> i believe that if the noble baroness were to look further into this issue she might find that the situation is not precisely as she has just said <e> <s> there is a very serious question <e> <s> it could be resolved very easily <e> <s> the amputees are in fact suffering <e> <s> if she would be good enough to take note of what has been said by my noble friend and from elsewhere on this side of the house and give the matter a little further thought i believe that a little intervention by the government at this point could bring the matter to an end to the benefit of all concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not permissible and not at all hypothetical to ask the noble baroness whether the government might not be well advised to change their policy <e> <s> is their present policy not quite incredible <e> <s> there is no possibility if nuclear weapons were not used that we would be the first to use them <e> <s> in those circumstances if we are not going to use nuclear weapons what the devil is the use of having them

"<cs> i add one word to this subject before we have the reply <e> <s> it is my hope as in the case of the noble lord lord hutchinson that we are knocking at an open door <e> <s> i hope that we are but in case an extra word would be helpful in getting the answer which i believe we are entitled to expect i add that unless we have the words taken as a whole we shall be in great difficulty <e> <s> i cannot see that it would be possible to put on any future performance of othello for example without being in danger of serious trouble <e> <s> it is only the whole of the situation which emerges at the end of a play that enables one to say that this is a great play and that it is not morally contemptible <e> <s> we must be careful about this <e> <s> my noble friend lord strauss who introduced the theatres act was wise in taking the right advice <e> <s> he was told that the words taken as a whole were the right words to ensure that the thing went far enough and not too far <e>", "<cs> i find myself equally puzzled about this matter <e> <s> i have no knowledge of the source of the amendment or anything of that kind but i ask why is the director thought to be in need of special protection <e> <s> one can see that a director might falsify the intention of the writer and therefore one might perhaps wish to protect the writer who writes words but in the hands of a wicked director finds <e>", "<cs> may i explain for the benefit of the noble lord lord hutchinson why i am worried about this <e> <s> i am not worried because the director has protection <e> <s> i think that is very reasonable <e> <s> i am worried about the picking out of the director for protection which is apparently not afforded to others <e> <s> the noble lord believes that it is but i venture to suggest that for every occasion on which an actor does something which a director does not want him to do there are many occasions on which an actor is required to do something which he would rather not do unless the director had told him to do it <e> <s> this draws special attention to amendment no <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may take a leaf out of the book of the noble lord lord beloff and say that on this occasion i am persuaded by the arguments put forward by the government and i hope that my noble friend will not press his amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the fact that one of the major parties contesting the next general election has said that it will re-acquire the building for public use in the event of its coming to government would not anyone be extremely ill-advised to put in a bid for this building at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of what the noble baroness has said does she not congratulate the noble baroness lady cox on her unexpected tribute to radio moscow <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand and accept what the noble earl has just said but as i said at an earlier stage i am a little uneasy that this protection is provided only to directors and not also to actors or to writers <e> <s> i should like to have further thoughts on this subject but if i reach the conclusion that the protection here given to directors ought to be extended i think there is good reason for doing so and i shall not go into it now as i have said it before it may be that i shall ask the noble earl to have another look at the matter in the form of an amendment on third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord agree that human error is often an element in these accidents and it is the fact that human error is not confined to any particular part of the world that makes it impossible to say that such a disaster might not occur in this country <e> <s> in the light of that ought we not to view the development of further nuclear energy with very grave doubts <e>", "<cs> my lords let me briefly say that i dislike this bill very much indeed <e> <s> my role in it has been to follow my noble friends through the lobbies in their endeavours to make it less bad than it otherwise would have been <e> <s> as my noble friend has shown we have not alas been as successful as we should have wished on all occasions <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble viscount agree as i am sure he will that one of the strongest arguments in favour of the advocates of nuclear energy is that it is not labour-intensive <e> <s> is not the truth of the matter particularly in relation to coal that the number of people employed is many times greater than the number employed in the nuclear industry <e> <s> therefore there is not the slightest substance in the argument put forward by the noble viscount <e> <s> does he not agree that there may be other reasons for being for or against nuclear power but that the labour argument does not stand up <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope your lordships will permit me to make a brief intervention <e> <s> my name should have been on the list but because of inadvertence and an error it was missed off <e> <s> nevertheless i will endeavour not to detain your lordships for too long <e> <s> i should like to join those who have congratulated my noble friend on introducing this subject <e> <s> it is an important one and she has performed a service in bringing it before us this evening even if we are getting towards the end of our present session <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not agreeing <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> the noble lord will forgive me if i do not follow him down that path <e> <s> the text for my own observations on the gracious speech comes from an address by mr harold pinter when earlier this year both he and his wife antonia fraser were honoured by hull university <e> <s> mr pinter said <e>", "<cs> indeed my lords <e> <s> i think it is right that we should reflect upon what has happened on our own soil in our own country by the action of a person in the libyan embassy <e> <s> but the fact that a man of that country behaved in that fashion in no way excuses the great civilised nation the great leader of the christian tradition in the world behaving in an even worse way <e> <s> i shall not go on i think the point is obvious <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount aware that human error occurs all over the world and in all types of technology and that regard to it cannot be excluded from nuclear energy <e> <s> that is one reason why nuclear energy is so much more dangerous and so much more alarming than other forms of energy and should be avoided as much as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness will forgive me if i do not follow her along that scottish path <e> <s> however i make this general comment on what she said <e> <s> i think that noble lords with experience of the matter on the other side of the house will agree with me that one must take a little care about becoming over-dependent on the search for private support <e> <s> there is a retraction from that in the united states of america <e> <s> my american friends tell me that organisations were becoming primarily fund-seeking in nature and that the quality of their theatrical output has declined because they were <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that so far from its being premature we are almost at the eleventh hour on this issue <e> <s> will she not show some sense of urgency in the matter when an opportunity is before the government at the moment which may not recur <e> <s> if the arms race is to be arrested some action by the government has to be taken <e> <s> it is no use them sitting around doing nothing as they have been for so long <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount aware that with nuclear energy there are even more serious intrinsic problems than those which have been referred to already in relation to coal-fired energy <e> <s> these problems might be described briefly as chernobyl problems three mile island problems and windscale problems <e> <s> does the minister agree that those problems have not yet been solved that they are <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that while we can perhaps appreciate that he was unable to give an affirmative answer to the question posed by the noble lord lord grimond he should at least not have given an absolutely negative answer <e> <s> might he not have said that the government will look into the question or some such thing <e>", "<cs> my lords is this not utterly useless <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i can explain to the noble lord that he shares some beliefs <e>", "<cs> my lords although i found much of what the noble lord lord bruce-gardyne said very persuasive he will not expect me to follow him long down that particular path <e> <s> instead i should like to say that this motion moved with such patent sincerity by the noble lord lord thorneycroft calls attention to the case for retaining a nuclear deterrent <e> <s> this is equivalent to calling attention to the charms of death as against those of life <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the minister says that he is going to deploy a weapon which he pretends may be used although it never will be used <e> <s> as it will never be of any use would it not be better rather than bothering to arm the weapon to carry on with some kind of pretence <e> <s> the noble lord could then save the money and use it for some more useful purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems to me to be a pity that this debate which has been carried out on a very high level i thought most of us appreciated that we were trying seriously to deal with the nature of the problem should have been terminated in a way not up to that level <e> <s> that seems rather sad <e> <s> that is the only thing i wish to say <e> <s> it is not our custom for the mover of a short debate to be given permission to reply <e> <s> therefore i shall not attempt it much though i should like to <e>", "<cs> my lords did the noble lord say that there were prosecutions <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord be a little more precise about this matter <e> <s> what proportion of that total relates to motor cycle noise or is the noble lord giving us a total <e> <s> i am not quite sure that i understand him very clearly on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord recall that he said the reason for not building a second runway at gatwick was environmental <e> <s> when he considers questions of environment will he not realise that a second runway at gatwick might do something to relieve the very severe pressure that there is upon heathrow with its noticeable impact upon those who happen to live under the flight path <e> <s> will he not agree that the environmental pressure on people living under the flight path is so great that if environmental considerations count this must lead to the construction of a second runway at gatwick <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble earl should give way to the suggestion made by the noble lord lord diamond would he not at the same time think it proper to introduce legislation that would lay down that the possession of an hereditary peerage does not connote the right to sit in this chamber <e>", "<cs> my lords the speech which my noble friend lord brockway made in asking his question would have been a remarkable speech from anyone as was one from him at any time during his long life but made as it was in what i think is approaching his th year it was little short of miraculous <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord lord trefgarne will celebrate that fact when replying by on this occasion actually trying to answer the question not only the general question but possibly one or two of the supplementaries as well <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that if what the americans are doing was being done by the soviet union the americans would declare that it was in breach of the abm treaty <e> <s> is he further aware that support of star wars is incompatible with a genuine search for peace <e> <s> will the noble lord look again at the governments policy in this respect <e>", "<cs> my lords the ministers answer to the original question consisted of nothing but vague generalisations <e> <s> will he spell out a little more the purpose of trident <e> <s> is not the idea behind trident that it should be able simultaneously to kill a large number of people in a large number of soviet <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that while there is something to be said for that point of view the viewers power to switch off is not sufficient <e> <s> is he aware that the cultural integrity of the british broadcasting system has been under heavy pressure and will come under increasing pressure in the future with the technological developments to which he has referred <e> <s> in all those circumstances are the government fully aware of the need to resist those pressures and to retain what i have already referred to as the cultural integrity of the british broadcasting system <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the purpose of this question is to ascertain whether or not trident is to be acceptable to the alliance <e> <s> it would seem that if the minister can give the noble lord a satisfactory answer the alliance will be able to support him on trident <e> <s> therefore he will possibly try a little harder <e> <s> is the minister also aware that on the question of trident there is no halfway house one is either for it or against it <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish i could believe what the noble lord lord hooson quite sincerely believes that it is the nuclear weapon that has kept the peace <e> <s> quite other factors have preserved us from war and we might perhaps remember in passing that in this so-called peaceful era million people have been killed in wars all over the world <e>", "<cs> and that the nations participating in those wars in spite of the fact if i may refer to the seated interjection that some of them have been armed with nuclear weapons have not used them <e> <s> they have not stopped the wars and they have not stopped the killing <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful but it is an unfortunate drafting error because it seems to me to have spiked the noble lords argument <e> <s> i am sorry that in introducing the debate he did not make it clear at any rate to me that the motion contained a drafting error <e> <s> he seemed to me to go out of his way to emphasise the error and to talk about labour party policy and about the labour party as though it believed and perhaps it would be a good idea if it did but it does not in the policies advocated so eloquently and movingly by the noble lord lord soper <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will be so kind as to take the matter seriously is it not the case that the consequence of what the government are about to do is to create in this country an ability to inflict damage which is even greater than that possessed already <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that since we can already destroy the enemy five times over there is absolutely no point in this waste of money <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may i should like an answer <e> <s> is there no answer <e>", "<cs> my lords do not the latter remarks of the noble baroness cast a little doubt on her earlier welcome to mr gorbachevs initiative <e> <s> if as she said we are relying in all circumstances upon the nuclear weapon our readiness to participate in and encourage negotiations for a reduction of nuclear weapons must surely be brought into doubt <e> <s> will she endeavour to remove that doubt because until now there has been at least a welcome unanimity of hope throughout the house <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact that i agreed with practically every word that the right <e>", "<cs> my lords i can indeed <e> <s> the point i am making is on the question of secrecy and whether information on this subject can be trusted <e> <s> if noble lords will bear with me a little longer i shall show that we are still not being told the whole truth that if we were told the whole truth even the government would probably be taking a different decision about layfield and that layfield himself would have taken a different decision <e> <s> i rather suspect that without any other information layfield would take a different decision now merely because of chernobyl <e> <s> this is uncomfortable information and i dare say that your lordships do not like to hear it but it is there it is all part of the story and ought to be taken into consideration in making up our minds on this vital matter <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not be a considerable contribution to achieving satisfactory arms control if the americans were to decide to help the proceedings by accepting the rather strict interpretation of the abm treaty which the noble baroness and the government accept <e> <s> then perhaps we could have a little more harmony in the west <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not clear that quite apart from the legalities which confused many of us and certainly confused me the government are entirely mistaken on this whole operation which has brought them nothing but discredit <e> <s> should not they admit that and withdraw the whole thing right away <e>", "<cs> my lords if the government intend to continue with the idea of supplying that information to schools and other bodies for educational purposes will they at least undertake not to seek to prevent other bodies providing informa-tion which may express a contrary view <e>", "<cs> my lords is the reason that the government will not make this suggestion because they have a shrewd suspicion that the ussr would accept and the united states would refuse <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister agree that it is not a question of the unseemly nature of bringing this matter to the order paper but of the unseemly nature of what appears to have been happening <e> <s> in the circumstances will the minister publish his reply to mr rowlands somewhat vituperative correspondence <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness agree that whatever mr gorbachev may think on the matter or even whatever the noble lord lord chalfont may think of it the government have embarked upon a course which her own chief the foreign secretary has described as leading to something which if my memory serves me correctly is not affordable or prudent <e> <s> why are the government persisting in a policy so described by a leading member of the cabinet and widely thought to be undesirable throughout the west <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount aware that there was no reference in the statement to the question of human error <e> <s> is he further aware that there was insufficient reference in the layfield report to that question <e> <s> in these circumstances have not the government come to this conclusion without giving sufficient weight to that factor considering the various disasters which have occurred since the report was published <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for the attention she has given to her answer but is she aware that this stoppage is totally unnecessary <e> <s> is she aware that it is a classic example of the disasters which can follow from the taking over of an important small firm by a large and ruthless conglomerate <e> <s> is she aware that the multiple which has taken over hangers has no knowledge of the business and of the impact upon the limbless of a dispute which it generated among the workforce <e> <s> is she aware that the men are not on strike for

these circumstances <e>", "<cs> finally my lords <e>", "<cs> if your lordships will permit me finally are the government aware that hangers is the chief indeed the only contractor in this field and

about not merely monitoring but actually intervening in this matter <e> <s> is it not the case that the men are eager <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that i cannot bring to the interesting speech which we have <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the noble baroness agree that the question is about arms control <e> <s> is she aware that there has been no arms control but only talk about arms control <e> <s> does not the noble baroness recall that the noble and gallant lord lord bramall reminded us yesterday that there are nuclear weapons situated throughout the world doing a job which could be done by <e> <s> will the noble baroness consider arms reduction instead of arms control <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that in order to satisfy the noble lord lord chalfont section would need to be replaced with the stocks or possibly the re-introduction of the thumb screw <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble lord forgotten that on th march and several times subsequently he said and i quote him <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may return to the reality that mr caspar weinberger said quite recently to congress that following agreement at montebello neutron weapons had been deployed that is to say he mentioned enhanced weapons and gave the actual numbers of those weapons <e> <s> that was the substitution of a non-neutron weapon by a neutron weapon <e> <s> in these circumstances i repeat once more is it not the case that the minister has inadvertently or otherwise been misleading members of both houses <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that if either he or his noble friend are prepared to point out specific occasions on which i have gone astray i shall be glad to correct them <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that the governments professed devotion to multilateral nuclear disarmament is not borne out by their reactions to this proposal <e> <s> is she further aware that if the public become convinced that the government want no nuclear disarmament of any sort under any circumstances the consequences of that may well be that they lose the coming election <e>", "<cs> my lords what does the noble lord have to say to those members of the public who in endeavouring to follow the governments advice in this matter have lost their money as a result of investing in shares which are supported by the government because the money has fallen into unreliable and dishonest hands <e> <s> can the minister comment on that <e>", "<cs> my lords has the minister been in touch with the british film institute to discover whether or not they have expressed an interest in acquiring this addition to their library <e> <s> presumably it is the case that they would be the best body to have charge of the library which has now become available for acquisition <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for that answer and for previous answers to written questions <e> <s> is he aware that these recommendations appear to be unknown to the police generally <e> <s> two friends of mine suffered a great tragedy when their daughter disappeared seven years ago she has never reappeared but they have no complaints against the police at eastbourne where the tragedy occurred <e> <s> however on looking into the matter they discovered that there is no generality of understanding or general policy operating in police forces in different parts of the country <e> <s> as we are a party to these recommendations and as they lay down specific procedures to be followed it is suggested not only in this country but in europe generally would it be a good idea at least to make police forces aware of the recommendations especially as they are so complicated and so detailed <e>", "<cs> my lords nevertheless will the noble earl be good enough to discuss this matter within his department in order to see if some general procedure can be adopted <e> <s> i believe he will discover on looking into the matter again that it would be much more satisfactory not only to the police forces but also to the salvation army if some general procedure could be adopted which operated throughout the country <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord be prepared to discuss with his noble friends the possibility of introducing legislation to forbid local authorities from selling their electoral registers <e> <s> that enables any kind of organisation to distribute widely circulars which most of us would much prefer to be without <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that a local authority which makes it clear that there is no such thing as civil defence against nuclear war is merely telling the truth <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that civil defence volunteers are chiefly to be found in rural areas and that there are hardly any in urban areas <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount aware that as the matter rests in the hands of the president of the united states of america in reality the government are unlikely to have any opportunity to consult anyone <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble baroness will forgive me if i do not follow her down the common market trail <e> <s> many years ago in another place when there

honourable friend to take great care that abuse does not occur because the system cannot be sustained if it is abused <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the noble lord agree that the problem is the depletion of the ozone layer <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that his answers so far seem very satisfactory and may lead to the withdrawal of my written question on the same subject if he maintains

it might be necessary to cease production altogether of these substances <e> <s> does not the minister agree that the present decision is only partially satisfactory and that the problem needs a close

to quite opposite conclusions as to what the situation really is <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that i am very glad to hear that the government are pursuing the matter <e> <s> does he agree in the meantime that the question of living near nuclear reactors is open to serious doubt if no more than that <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that while it is quite right to warn the public against reaching false conclusions it is equally right to warn them against being satisfied with false reassurances <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that answer <e> <s> does he agree that this matter appears to have taken an unconscionably long time especially having regard to the fact that the original protocols protected civilians generally and therefore the additional protocols to protect them against nuclear weapons hardly seem to have been necessary <e> <s> what was the reason for the long delay and the great difficulty in coming to a conclusion on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that a speed limit of mph is enforced beneficially in the united states of america and would it not be a good idea to introduce a similar limit in this country with a view to reducing accidents <e> <s> is the noble earl aware that if the police in this country are unenthusiastic about enforcing even the present limit it would probably be a good idea to create a special national traffic police authority <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord say

that force ourselves to bring our minds to it on occasion can perhaps understand the fact that the television companies have decided to protect the wider audience from the subject <e> <s> they would

lords i am grateful to the noble lord for that reply <e> <s> is he aware that his confidence may be misplaced <e> <s> the information contained in the programme was of a factual nature and it seems

quantity of this material falls into the hands of iran iraq or israel as has been asserted already to have taken place the situation could be serious because it is only one stage from that to the hands of terrorists <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that the amount of processing now going on and the amount of plutonium that is passing around the world as a result of reprocessing in

to be endorsed by the american congress <e> <s> i should not entirely exclude the possibility that there may be a last minute attempt in congress to negate what has occurred <e> <s> that would be a tragedy and a disaster and i hope that there will be no such development <e>", "<cs> i hesitate to suggest that the noble and learned lord lord denning is totally mistaken but for the fact that on more than one occasion in the past legal luminaries have reached a similar conclusion <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord denning will agree that in the past he has been mistaken as happens to us all from time to time <e> <s> it is therefore conceivably possible that he may be mistaken on this occasion and i am sure that he will be ready to accept that <e>", "<cs> i was in my place in time to move my amendment to clause <e>", "<cs> i can see that i was mistaken and i withdraw <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord capable as i am sure he is of entertaining the possibility that the government may be mistaken in this matter <e> <s> is it not the case that they are bringing themselves into world-wide derision by their attempts to shove the cat back into the sack in various parts of the world <e> <s> would it not be much better if they were to take a new line on this and decide that where matters are not of vital national interest they may be discussed <e> <s> is it not the case that the governments <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord take on board the point that this matter was first stated publicly by a supporter of the government in another place <e> <s> in these circumstances would it not be right for the government to take account of the fact that it is already in

about <e> <s> therefore i believe it is important to have a written consent not only for the sake of the performer but for the sake of those who are utilising the performance <e> <s> from all points of view the government will be well advised and i hope will be persuaded to accept this amendment <e>", "<cs> as i have an amendment in this section may i perhaps add a word at this point <e> <s> i

point and that is why i ventured to intervene in this matter <e> <s> i was not addressing myself to the identical point of my noble friend <e> <s> the point i am seeking to make is that a consent given relates to that usage and consent to a single usage does not embrace further uses which may follow <e>", "<cs> yes certainly <e>", "<cs> i should like to point out that my agreement is entirely subject to the consent of other members of the committee because in some cases the other amendments do not go to the same clause <e> <s> although i am agreeable i think that one should not take my consent as being generally applicable without others indicating that they consent <e>", "<cs> i should very much like to review what the noble lord has said because the question of where the line is drawn between a criminal offence and a civil offence seems to me to be rather a difficult one <e> <s> in those circumstances if the committee will permit me i should like to withdraw <e>", "<cs> i am

seek leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> as i understand it the minister is saying that the civil remedy remains <e> <s> in those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>",

friend has said that the purpose of the civil defence act is entirely different from that which it originally had <e> <s> the original purpose was to offer some degree of protection to the population for example in nuclear war <e> <s> that purpose has been admitted since then to be entirely fallacious and is impossible <e> <s> as the act therefore is not the act that it pretended to be in the first instance would it not be a good idea to bring it back possibly refashion it and rename it as well <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the noble lord admit that all these artificial measures could be avoided if he were to take the simple act of not privatising a public monopoly <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl will agree that some of the revelations which have been made from time to time by civil servants and others have been revelations of misdemeanours sometimes amounting to criminality by the secret services <e> <s> have the government any plans to get to the root of the matter <e>

more anxious to get on with the bill than i am as i am waiting to move an amendment which stands in my name <e> <s> however i believe it is rather serious that we are proposing to leave in a matter of ambiguity on this question of intention <e> <s> as my noble friend said by whose intention <e> <s> if the local authority is not only to be the arbiter so far as itself is concerned as to what it thinks but is also to determine what a series of very distinguished authors they may be distinguished as well as the porn people may think we shall be putting a local authority in an absolutely

question i put to him <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord lord denning will not object to my saying that he did not agree with the master of the rolls <e> <s> indeed he has expressed that view pretty cogently as is his custom not only in his report on the subject but more recently in the <e>", "<cs> my lords we have used up our time and therefore i cannot reply to the points which have been

agreeable i should like to say a word in support of the amendment of my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord unaware of the fact that like many of the governments so-called improvements

welcome the more constructive tone which has characterised this answer from the replies we received on previous occasions <e> <s> i take that as a response to the improving international situation in

effective non-proliferation and ultimately perhaps to the number of missiles being reduced <e> <s> will he give a little further thought to that point <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may begin by expressing my appreciation to your lordships for allowing me to intervene in what i believe is called the gap of the debate <e> <s> i did not put my name down to speak because i have an important engagement this evening in putney and i did not realise that the debate would take place early enough to enable me to fulfil both obligations <e> <s> i hope that noble lords will return my impudence

points which have been made <e> <s> it is the case that a number of regional theatres which depend heavily on school visits are complaining that they are already feeling the draught <e> <s> therefore from the other side of the picture as well as the educational side this is a matter of some urgency <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that answer <e> <s> is he aware i am sure he is that since this question was tabled it has become even more apparent that even when the treaty has been signed as in the case of iran it is not being enforced <e> <s> what steps are the government intending to take to ensure more universal extension and more importantly the enforcement of the non-proliferation treaty <e>", "<cs> my lords in my first supplementary question i believe that i referred to iran when i meant so say iraq though the difference between the two countries is not all that great in this respect <e> <s> is the noble lord aware of the old adage that example is better than precept <e> <s> the governments efforts might be more successful if we were to show ourselves that we are not very enthusiastic about nuclear weapons and are ready to begin the process of divesting ourselves of them <e> <s> would it not be a good idea not to proceed with trident <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount aware that while his reply is obviously the case the organisation to which i refer has for a considerable time been misinforming employers <e> <s> is he further aware that a well-known solicitor was described as an anarchist when in fact he was a member of the conservative party <e> <s> while recognising that those two descriptions are not entirely incompatible is it not the case that the employer concerned was seriously misinformed <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government express some preference in this matter in favour of the rothschild scheme despite the fact that it involves government expenditure <e> <s> will the government further examine the scheme with a view to ascertaining whether or not this item can be brought within the customs and practises which have existed hitherto <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness is to be congratulated upon raising the question and i support her from this side of the house <e> <s> there is a mistaken philosophy which until recently was popular on her side of the house <e> <s> except for a few

unrivalled <e> <s> no doubt she will agree with me that the contribution that private investment can make to the arts must always be the icing on the cake <e> <s> it cannot and is not intended to replace the fundamental role of the state <e> <s> i am glad to note from the ministers report which is basically what we are discussing today that he does not take the view anywhere in his statement

noble lords will be grateful to the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale for introducing this discussion <e> <s> although i am grateful to him for introducing the discussion i found myself disagreeing with much of what he said <e> <s> it is the subject for which i am grateful rather than the content of what he had to say <e> <s> however he said it extraordinarily well <e> <s> the fact

have a full-scale debate on this subject in which our two front benches may becone engaged <e> <s> we shall perhaps in a longer period of time be able to deal more fully with some of the points raised

wedded to the nuclear weapon as he suggested why do they not withdraw honestly from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty denounce it and say that they are no longer a party to it <e> <s> why do they pretend internationally to be anti-nuclear and here to be pro-nuclear <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that salary inflation at the highet level is at a much higher rate than ordinary rates of inflation <e> <s> will he not therefore speak to some of his friends rather than always addressing the trade union members who are the least offenders in this respect <e> <s> the offence is

be too unkind to secretaries of state <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that in the united states a speed limit of mph is in force on all turnpike roads and that it is enforced without difficulty by the employment of a special traffic corps of policemen many of whom ride motor cycles <e> <s> is it not the case that the law in this country will not be enforced in that area until we do the same <e>", "<cs> my lords can the leader of the house confirm that rules in this matter exist in relation to senior civil servants <e> <s> does not recent experience suggest that it would be a good idea if similar rules were published and were adopted by ministers <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that there have always been elements in the conservative party who have objected to

friends on the opposition front bench mentioned two of the qualifications instead of all three to take that up is being pernickety and neither here nor there <e> <s> we are supporting proposals in the amendment which have stood the test of time over the whole of this period <e> <s> therefore from this side of the committee we are seeking to maintain what has worked well over the years <e> <s> i hope that the committee will support the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord said that this amendment seeks to tell the authority what should be included in the report <e> <s> it seeks to place a requirement upon the authority <e> <s> that requirement will be welcomed because it will publicly strengthen the authority and all concerned including advertisers will know that it is there <e> <s> that is the important point <e> <s> as members of the committee opposite have said the amendment strengthens the position of the authority <e> <s> the noble lord lord thomson said that this is no longer a regulating authority but is a licensing body <e> <s> anybody who knows anything about the business will know that such a body needs all the strength it can be given from a legislative point of view <e> <s> i hope that the government will see that there is force in this argument and that they may be prepared to consider the amendment <e>", "<cs> the debate has been monopolised by those

of a free approach to monopoly <e> <s> we have listened to the murdoch magnificat and the hallelujah chorus <e> <s> why do those noble lords who are normally believers in freedom seek to establish a

noble earls position i might be prepared to consider the noble lords argument <e> <s> i can understand how the noble earl feels about the matter <e> <s> however i should have thought that he might be prepared to look at the amendment of the noble lord lord birkett <e>", "<cs> it is notoriously difficult to draft wording that would deal with this problem <e> <s> if one gives any body the judiciary

at the appropriate time i shall move that the clause does not stand part of the bill <e>", "<cs> my noble friends have persuaded me that in view of the improvement made to the clause by the excellent amendment motivated by the noble lord lord campbell of alloway it would be undesirable to press my intention to oppose the question that clause stand part of the bill <e> <s> i should like however to place it on record that i am firmly convinced i believe that after further consideration other members of the committee may come to a similar conclusion that as presently worded the clause invalidates the right to strike and is therefore illegal <e> <s> i shall not again go into my reasons for believing that <e> <s> i shall have an opportunity to do so at report stage when it is my hope that we shall quite firmly oppose the clause in its present form <e> <s> if we are then unable to amend it i shall then propose that the clause should not stand part of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords in a previous contribution to this annual ceremony i used the text of a remarkable article in <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl be so good as to say a word about the comprehensive test ban treaty <e> <s> as he knows we already support a partial test ban treaty but one hopes that we are now ready to move forward to a comprehensive test ban treaty if one is proposed by the soviet union with suitable verification on both sides <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord be more specific about our position in the matter <e> <s> is it not the case that the report which seems to be reliable indicates that the united states of <e>", "<cs> can the noble lord make it clear that he is not talking about the amendment <e>", "<cs> i wish to add a postscript <e> <s> the noble earl lord ferrers paid tribute to this side of the committee for our great reasonableness in accepting the good amendments that he has put forward <e> <s> i believe that this is an opportunity for the noble earl to reciprocate <e> <s> he could say that he is so impressed with these amendments and the good sense with which they have been moved that the government have decided to change their mind and will not proceed upon the course they have chosen <e> <s> in the feeling that that is likely to happen i shall not say more but simply sit down <e>", "<cs> if i may i should like to give a little back bench support to the amendment <e> <s> it may generally be argued that a radio programme supported by advertising is necessarily and inevitably inferior to public service broadcasting <e> <s> however i suggest that that is not necessarily so <e> <s> it has certainly been so in this country so far but i should like to see the bill make some attempt to raise the level of commercial broadcasting <e> <s> on the whole it has been abysmally low <e>", "<cs> i should like to add a few words in support of the amendment that we are discussing <e> <s> i believe it is the case that broadcasting or any reproduction of performance can be either an extremely good thing or completely destructive <e> <s> i should give the example of the bbc whose contribution to music in this country has been tremendous <e> <s> i do not think anyone would dispute the fact that the pre-eminence which this country now enjoys in the musical field is in no small degree due to the work of the bbc over the years particularly in sound radio but also to some extent in television <e> <s> the bbc has always recognised that it is not sufficient to <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that that is a better answer than i have had for some time on this subject <e> <s> however the government still seem to be a little confused <e> <s> does he know that on the one hand they declare themselves i am glad that they have done so because they do not often do it to be ultimately wishful to be rid of nuclear weapons but on the other hand seem ready to commit themselves freely to them on all occasions <e> <s> does he agree that it would be very welcome if we were to hear from the government more often on the subject of nuclear disarmament and less often on the subject of nuclear modernisation <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not finished my question <e> <s> i have one final question to put <e> <s> on the one hand the noble lord says that the government will rely on nuclear weapons as far ahead as they can see whereas on the other hand they are committed to the nuclear non-proliferation agreement which envisages total nuclear disarmament <e> <s> are those statements not incompatible <e> <s> the government on the one hand are committed internationally to one aim and continually utter another across this chamber <e>", "<cs> it would certainly liven proceedings up if it had been the pornographic performance society <e> <s> the governments amendment already goes far enough <e> <s> one could argue that it goes a good deal too far <e> <s> equally it could be said that it is already if not in breach very nearly in breach of the rome convention as it stands <e> <s> the amendment would blow a hole right through it and remove all protection <e> <s> it therefore cannot in my view be supported and i hope that the noble lord will withdraw it <e>", "<cs> my lords i have thrown away the first part of what i was going to say partly because other people who are much more qualified than i have already said it and partly because i want to refer to one or two cuttings in the newspapers <e> <s> your lordships may hope that because i have thrown away the first part and shall be referring only to cuttings my speech will be shorter <e> <s> i hope that that will be the case but i cannot guarantee it although i shall not speak longer than my allotted minutes <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount aware that the project is totally opposed by all local authorities <e> <s> is it not a little odd to give planning consent so early to a proposition that necessarily depends upon investment consent being given at a much later date <e> <s> will he state when that investment consent is likely <e> <s> is it usual to give planning consent so far ahead of a possible investment consent <e> <s> i believe that everyone in the area and a large number of people in this house hope that it never will be given <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that there is always the danger that military action may lead to a full-scale war <e> <s> that is why such action always has to be considered with the utmost care <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount aware that it is natural that the financial advantages of those transactions will be appreciated in the area which is beneficially affected by them <e> <s> is he also not aware that there is an increasingly influential view that the idea of this country becoming a sort of nuclear dustbin for the deposit of all nuclear waste is inherently undesirable <e> <s> there is a view that until one knows what is the long-term situation that should be looked at with great care <e> <s> the view that each nation should be responsible for the disposal of its own nuclear waste in its own country is one which is widely supported <e>", "<cs> my lords as the main amendment has not been moved an amendment to it also cannot be moved <e>", "<cs> my lords i have been waiting the whole afternoon to speak <e>", "<cs> my lords amendment no <e> <s> refers to impartiality which also featured in our previous discussion <e> <s> i agree with mr david mellor who incidentally was my successor as member of parliament for putney and is now my successor as minister for the arts <e> <s> that fact ought to go in the <e>", "<cs> my lords did not the government abolish the glc because they could not face the possibility of an authority in london whose policies may conflict with theirs <e> <s> is it not useless to expect the government to create such a body unless they intend to bring into being yet another quango on top of all the other quangos so that ultimately they can all be one of us <e> <s> the governments policy of centralisation is madness <e> <s> we know that <e> <s> but they will not change it because it is a central part of their philosophy <e> <s> is that not the case <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that it was widely reported in the french press that work had started on rebuilding the reactor <e> <s> have the government no knowledge of that <e> <s> is it not in the interests of our forces in the gulf that the government should have that knowledge even if they are not ready to express it <e> <s> i understand that the minister may not wish to give an answer but the house is entitled to know whether the government are aware of what is going on <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not agree that although there is inspection of the international spread of nuclear energy and some attempt to control the spread of nuclear weapons there is an inadequate connection between the two <e> <s> is he aware that material which is ostensibly related to nuclear energy is being used in relation to the production of nuclear weapons <e> <s> is it not therefore desirable that more adequate international inspection should be focused on that area <e>", "<cs> my lords at this stage in the bill we are bound to consider what the government might conceivably accept rather than what we might like best <e> <s> from that point of view alone i feel that we must come down in favour of amendment no <e> <s> rather than amendment no for the reasons put forward by the noble lord <e> <s> it is not that i believe the noble earls reasons to be valid but i fear that they are the kind of reasons that may impress the front bench <e> <s> although from many points of view the more comprehensive approach of the noble earl has much to commend it and although i personally always hesitate to mix public and private money under a single control because of the problems which can arise under those circumstances i should have gone along with the proposal if i felt that it had a chance <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i understand the reasons why the noble earl has tabled this amendment <e> <s> i am not absolutely sure but i think i do <e> <s> my understanding of the position is that the aim <e>", "<cs> my lords i support this highly desirable amendment <e> <s> it seems to be clear which is a great merit and desirable which is another one <e> <s> i can see nothing against the amendment and everything in favour of it <e> <s> i hope the noble earl will find it possible to accept it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl for that answer <e> <s> will he tell us precisely what the government are doing to pursue that article in the treaty which requires existing nuclear powers to disarm in respect of nuclear weapons <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have the treaty before me but i think article vii specifically requires nuclear disarmament by those states which already possess nuclear weapons <e> <s> irrespective of the comprehensive test ban treaty what are the government doing about implementing that article <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister not aware that the majority of people in the south east believe that we need additional runway capacity as much as we need a hole in the head <e> <s> i ask him to bear that group of people in mind <e> <s> can the minister tell me whether representatives of the groups opposed to additional runways as well as those in favour of them will be in the group <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord recognise that renewables are certainly expensive and difficult to start up but that nuclear power is <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a most unusual situation in any country in which to say the least of it the majority of the people living in the country are not nationals of that country <e> <s> is it not the case as is suggested in my question that that consideration must affect the question of whether it is possible to launch a successful military attack <e>", "<cs> my lords while we are all agreed that the iraqis must be forced to withdraw from kuwait the question sought to point out the difficulties of bringing that about by military attack <e> <s> it was intended to suggest to the government that they should persist with sanctions and other means rather than begin a military attack the consequences of which might be much worse than is now appreciated <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl for that informative answer <e> <s> will he address himself to the question and particularly that aspect of it which asks for an estimate to be made <e> <s> he said that it depends upon the circumstances but is it not possible for him to answer more fully than that <e>", "<cs> my lords in the <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that there is an increasing tendency on the government front bench for questions to be avoided rather than answered <e> <s> will the noble lord endeavour to avoid that tendency in future <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his explicit answer which clarifies the present position that although the forces are deployed under an article of the united nations charter there is no united nations command in the gulf <e> <s> having regard to the danger of the present forces being regarded as wholly western in command have the government considered that it might be better to examine the possibility of an ultimate united nations command <e>"]
