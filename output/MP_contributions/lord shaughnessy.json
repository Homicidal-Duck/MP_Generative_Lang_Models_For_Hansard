["<cs> my lords as a canadian i am grateful for this opportunity to take part in the debate on the second reading of the canada bill <e> <s> although i have been a member of your lordships house since i have lived in canada for all my life until about a year ago and regrettably there has been no previous occasion on my visits to this country when i could have taken part appropriately in one of the debates in your lordships house <e> <s> perhaps in the circumstances rather than a maiden speech this might be termed a spinster speech <e> <s> at any rate i apologise for the long delay in addressing your lordships for the first <e>", "<cs> in view of the general dissatisfaction that appears to have been experienced in the past on the allocation of radio frequencies and in view of the admonishment of the noble lord the chancellor the duchy of lancaster lord cockfield that the duties of the secretary of state and the director should be strictly defined <e> <s> i should like to support the amendment proposed by the noble lord lord mottistone as an appropriate inclusion among the duties of the secretary of state and the director general <e> <s> i urge her majestys government if not to accept this amendment as drafted at least to provide for the inclusion of the intention in this legislation in some fashion <e>", "<cs> with some misgivings about the specifics of the amendment proposed by the noble lord <e> <s> lord lloyd of kilgerran i think that the intention of the proposal to establish a council would have two beneficial results <e> <s> one of the problems that the director general of oftel is bound to encounter is that he will be so involved in administrative and monitoring duties that he will not be accessible by the public and by that i mean the consumer the subscriber or the supplier to british telecom or any other company operating where complaints can be brought forward <e> <s> therefore a mechanism such as the council proposed in this amendment would provide that access and be a support to the director general in dealing with the mass of administrative and consultative problems that will inevitably be brought before him <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment and to endorse what has been said by the noble earl lord halsbury the noble viscount lord trenchard and the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran <e> <s> the concept of the words free and fair is so important in the context of a bill of this complexity which has far reaching implications for all people in the united kingdom that it is beyond question i believe that this amendment which has proper implications for the carrying forward of this great enterprise should be agreed to by your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to echo the sentiments expressed by other noble lords in commending the sound broadcasting committee for its thorough and meticulous examination of this question <e> <s> i do not propose to detain your lordships very long but i should like to deal briefly with the matter of editorial control which i think is of considerable importance <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord the minister sits down he commented on one of the parts of the th report of the joint committee on statutory instruments but he neglected to say anything about the second point raised in that report <e> <s> i wondered whether he would care to comment on it now <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord lord rodney for his able introduction of this small but important bill <e> <s> the noble lord quite properly avoided using statistics but there is one figure i should like to relate to your lordships that is that from to according to the figures of the home office of the registered new addicts in each year and it is well known that the registered addicts represent only a fraction of the actual numbers of drug addicts in the country between per cent <e> <s> and per cent <e> <s> were heroin addicts <e> <s> it is interesting to note that yesterday the home secretary in his announcement which included the number of new addicts registered in which was made known that per cent <e> <s> of the new addicts were heroin addicts <e> <s> i think that indicates that the major menace the number one menace of heroin is increasing at exponential proportions <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may suggest in opposing this amendment that it is more than likely that anyone sentenced on conviction to life imprisonment is guilty of multiple murder at least indirectly <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask the noble viscount the leader of the house whether he is aware that at least one professional public opinion survey has been conducted on televising the proceedings of the house <e> <s> can he say whether the results will be available to the select committee and when they might consider them <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment under discussion <e> <s> i was under the impression that we were here to deal with the shops bill but i understand that we are back to the tunnel again according to the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale <e>", "<cs> i acknowledge my error and apologise to your lordships committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i too along with other noble lords acknowledge our debt to my noble friend lord seebohm for bringing this important report of the national federation of housing associations to the attention of the house and also for his very articulate summary in his introduction of its content and purpose <e> <s> the report is both comprehensive and incisive <e> <s> furthermore as stated by other noble lords it could be considered a model in its form and in the language in which it has been presented <e> <s> i endorse the congratulations to the committee and to the staff who produced such a cogent document <e>", "<cs> my lords my greatest concern about the events that have occurred since last monday night is the effect that they may have upon the future of the anglo-american partnership and the north atlantic alliance <e> <s> i leave it to others more qualified to judge the validity of the united states action in self-defence under article of the united nations charter and the quality of intelligence on past and future libyan involvement in terrorist activities <e>", "<cs> my lords with a suitable degree of trepidation i join this debate following a galaxy of noble lords of unequalled distinction and experience in the world of banking and finance <e> <s> but as the noble lord lord wolfson said perhaps there is still room for the views of a businessman and an investor <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord the minister tell us what progress if any is being made in combating the production and trafficking of illegal drugs in the source and transit countries before they reach these shores <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not have my name down to speak but i ask the indulgence of your lordships in hearing me for a moment <e> <s> i am impressed with the concept of confusion involved in this discussion in the application of the securities and investments board under polarisation <e> <s> the brief states that <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to second the congratulations of the noble lord lord mcnair and my noble friend lady saltoun to our two maiden speakers on such a splendid initial presentation to your lordships house <e> <s> i am sure all your lordships hope that we shall hear frequently from both of them in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords it is quite obvious that the noble earl is agonising over some of the semantical problems in this clause <e> <s> we started out originally with if i recall correctly the promotion of homosexuality <e> <s> that was amended by a government amendment to intentionally promote <e> <s> in amendment no <e> <s> it is to be amended again at the behest of the government to intend to promote <e> <s> this indicates to me that there is a certain difficulty and second thoughts on the part of the government about the actual application of the words promote or promotion <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down may i ask him a question about the remarks he made about my intervention <e> <s> i hope that i did not imply that the government had any intention of promoting ambiguity <e> <s> i suggested that the ambiguity of the subsection would be removed or at least modified by changing the abstract word homosexuality to the words proposed by my noble friend lord henderson of brompton <e>", "<cs> my lords i can claim no professional knowledge of space technology but in entering todays debate on the select committee report on united kingdom space policy introduced so ably and with such unrivalled experience by its chairman the noble lord lord shackleton i am motivated by a deep interest in the commercial and technological relations between the united kingdom and canada <e>", "<cs> in associating myself with the amendment proposed by my noble friend lord hayter i hope that there will not be any implications of constitutionality involved because the proposed amendment is simple and humane <e>", "<cs> my lords the bill before us today represents the governments proposals to inaugurate radical changes in housing policy designed to eradicate some of the anomalies that cast a wholly undesirable shadow upon an otherwise affluent society <e> <s> in a prosperous and expanding economy homelessness remains a festering social problem a wide disparity in the cost of housing in different regions continues to restrict the mobility of the work force and above all the spectacle of old and infirm people condemned to live in dilapidated and often unheated accommodation persists <e>", "<cs> my lords having spent the greater part of my business life in the oil and gas sectors i have experienced a variety of royalty regimes <e> <s> despite the noble baronesss view that this is an uncontroversial bill i think that there are some important implications which could have far reaching effects as has been suggested by the noble lord lord williams and the noble lord lord ezra <e>", "<cs> my lords as a member of the joint committee on statutory instruments i should like to endorse the remarks of the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey both in the substance and in the particulars <e> <s> it is extraordinary that with legislation of this magnitude and importance the regulations have been found by our committee to be defective in at least three instances <e> <s> i should like to hear the ministers comments on why they have had this rather slipshod treatment from the point of view of drafting and other points of view <e> <s> why were they not more carefully addressed in relation to a bill which has attracted as much attention and controversy as the water bill has <e> <s> perhaps the minister will address that point when he comes to reply <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down perhaps i may say that i am grateful to him for his remarks about any inconvenience that may have been caused to the joint committee on statutory instruments <e> <s> no great inconvenience or extra work has been caused to me <e> <s> the point i tried to make was that speeding through regulations of this order with these consequences resulted in anomalies which as has been mentioned are reported in the th report of the joint committee on statutory instruments in respect of statutory instruments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> i hope that i can speak generally but i am also speaking specifically to amendment no <e> <s> a <e> <s> as i understood it the minister wants to hear the arguments and discussions concerning the generality of the proposed amendments <e> <s> i hope that i am in order in speaking a little more generally as he did <e> <s> i support the noble lord lord seebohm in his amendment or at any rate in its intention <e> <s> i can understand the point which the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter made that a specific cut-off age might create difficulties <e> <s> i hope that the minister will take into account special consideration for people of a greater age let us say or of advanced years who have misgivings about whether it is right or proper or whether they have the capacity financial or even emotional to set about renovating their premises which badly need it <e> <s> the litany of bureaucratic procedures which the noble earl outlined in the discussion of amendment no <e> <s> j was quite frightening to me possibly because i did not understand the procedures <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord rippon has done the house considerable service in initiating this debate on the need for scrutiny of bills to come before parliament in the interests of eradicating or at least modifying the granting of powers to ministers which could infringe the rights and liberties of citizens and erode the legislative power of parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords it is little wonder that we on the joint committee on statutory <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord the lord advocate sits down i do not know whether i heard him correctly earlier in his remarks <e> <s> did he say that regulations governing the community charge which is payable almost without exception by every citizen of england and wales need not be written in language which is understandable by the general public <e> <s> i may have got this wrong but i wonder whether he can clarify it <e>", "<cs> my purpose in moving the amendment is to address and remove what appears to be an anomaly in the qualification standards and requirements for solicitors from commonwealth countries who apply for qualification in england and wales <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for accepting the principle involved here <e> <s> i quite agree that it is complicated and requires certain redrafting and reconsideration <e> <s> i am happy on the undertaking that the noble and learned lord has given to beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords when i put down my name to speak in this debate i planned to raise two matters which were of anxiety to me and which i thought had a bearing on the bill before us <e> <s> the first concerns the scope of the bill <e> <s> the report of the inquiry is directed exclusively to those war-time atrocities committed under the nazi regime in europe <e> <s> the terms of reference required the commissioners to consider <e>", "<cs> my lords what facilities and friendly associations are being encouraged by her majestys government in respect of the large number of tibetans particularly tibetan buddhists who are settled in this country to perhaps give them some encouragement about ever returning to their homeland <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure whether the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor spoke to amendments nos <e> <s> and in connection with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> if this is the appropriate time i should like to refer to those latter three amendments which cover the qualification of commonwealth solicitors <e> <s> i am somewhat baffled by the cross-references in the three amendments and i should like to ask the noble and learned lord whether the amendments give effect to the new rules for qualification of commonwealth solicitors on which i tabled an amendment at report stage on st march and to which the noble and learned lord agreed in principle subject to further consideration of the language proposed in that amendment <e> <s> i should be very happy to hear that that was the case <e>", "<cs> my lords the last general debate on the commonwealth in your lordships house was held more than years ago in march <e> <s> that is an inordinately long interval as the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter said and i should like to join in expressing gratitude to my noble friend lord greenhill of harrow for giving us the opportunity to discuss what has transpired in commonwealth affairs during that long interval <e>"]
