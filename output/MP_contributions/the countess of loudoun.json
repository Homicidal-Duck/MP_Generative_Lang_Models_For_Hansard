["<cs> my lords i am very pleased to be the first to congratulate the noble lord lord galpern on his most interesting maiden speech <e> <s> i hope that it will be the first of many <e> <s> i wonder whether many of your lordships realise the extent of the financial burden on a family with a handicapped child either physically or mentally handicapped or both <e> <s> many of these handicapped are unable to move around quickly hence more heating is necessary than for a normal child <e> <s> they may need a special diet and we all know how expensive that can be <e> <s> children grow out of their clothes but the handicapped both adults and children wear out theirs much more quickly through sitting and rubbing due to wheelchairs and perhaps calipers <e> <s> there is always extra washing and bedding needed caused through incontinence plus the wear and tear on furnishings caused perhaps by a hyperactive child <e> <s> these are not luxuries they are necessities <e>", "<cs> my lords services for the elderly are one of the current national health service priorities along with those for the mentally ill the mentally handicapped and children and it is about this first group the elderly that i should like to say a few words <e> <s> the major problem of mental illness is now the dementias of old people and it is therefore impossible to plan services for the old and the mentally ill separately <e> <s> as people grow older certain organs in particular the brain tend to lose a number of cells <e> <s> in most people this gradual loss has no effect at all but dementia occurs in elderly people whose brain cell loss is abnormally heavy <e> <s> this may take the form of depression which is a psychotic disorder where the sufferers mood sinks to a level not experienced by someone who is mentally healthy and can lead to suicide or paraphrenia a form of schizophrenia in elderly people which is likely to affect those suffering from loneliness poor vision or deafness <e> <s> this is a feeling of not being wanted a type of persecution mania <e>", "<cs> my lords efforts to find a peaceful solution to the problem of cyprus are still being pursued and i should like to think that there was a slight glimmer of light in the darkness <e> <s> therefore i hope that nothing we say in this debate will help to extinguish that glimmer <e>", "<cs> my lords section of the education act was introduced at report stage in this house by the government of the day <e> <s> this section marked the parliamentary and public acceptance of the criteria that no child should attend a special school if his or her needs could satisfactorily be met in any ordinary one but it has never been implemented <e> <s> the warnock report which accepted the provisions of section was published in may <e> <s> it is now the end of february <e> <s> so it was with some relief that those of us involved with the handicapped read in <e>", "<cs> my lords prior to april there had been several informal discussions on the question of a disablement costs allowance with disablement groups together with the then minister for the disabled the right honourable alfred morris and officials from the department of health and social security <e> <s> preparations for issuing a green paper were in hand and i understand that considerable progress had been made but of course that all ceased when the present government took office <e> <s> all three main parties are on record as agreeing that a disablement costs allowance should be introduced in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords i too welcome this international year of disabled people and join with other noble lords in hoping that the efforts made during this year may help no matter in how small a way to change the attitude of many members of the public today towards the disabled both the physically disabled and the mentally handicapped <e> <s> i hope that <e>", "<cs> my lords it astonishes me that at a time when construction and expenditure on roads is at a minimum there appears to be a policy encouraging an increase in road transport <e> <s> despite all protests our roads remain the same size but the volume of traffic increases in the carrying capacity of lorries and in the competition that is being encouraged between long-distance bus services and the train <e> <s> when there are say or so trains a day going from london to glasgow there is still an enormous volume of traffic roaring northwards up the mi floated there on a river of oil <e>", "<cs> my lords when the idea of discharging mental patients into the community was decided on a few years ago it being a very new idea at that time not enough thought was given to the follow-through by the community services with the result that was a near-disaster <e> <s> many ex-patients found themselves much worse off in the community than they had been in the long-stay wards of mental institutions <e> <s> yes they were provided with shelter but that in itself would not solve their difficulties <e> <s> for a return to normality they needed the availability of good daycare access to work and the support of friends and neighbours this latter in an uncaring and often hostile community <e>", "<cs> my lords over the weekend i received my local inspectors report from the national society for the prevention of cruelty to children that is for the burton-on-trent branch for the period st december to the end of february <e> <s> during that period from december to the end of february new cases were reported to him involving children of whom were under the age of five years <e> <s> so as your lordships can imagine i too favour any initiative which will promote the interests of children and at first glance the concept of a co-ordinating minister seems attractive <e> <s> but let us look for a moment at the present position <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that expert resuscitation is vital to save oxygen being cut off from the brain which causes mental handicap <e>", "<cs> i too should like to support this amendment <e> <s> there is concern about the increasing emergence of monopoly situations within the port industry and the measures proposed in the bill will hasten this process <e> <s> did not the national ports council in their report to the secretary of state in recommend that the two functions of harbour authorities relating to dock operations and conservancy should be separated <e> <s> the conservancy functions would be taken over by a non-commercial organisation thus ensuring that unfair biases against estuarial and inland waterway transport are not introduced by the provisions of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords coming as i do towards the end of this debate i find that most points have already been covered by other speakers <e> <s> there are only two matters on which i wish to comment today <e> <s> from the moment they are born all <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> there is a good deal of concern about the increasing emergence of monopoly situations within the port industry <e> <s> this amendment would extend the provisions of section of the act so as to bring within it all charges raised by a port authority <e> <s> it would through the secretary of state as successor to the national ports council help to protect the interests of the private sector companies and the british waterways board and thus help to allay <e>", "<cs> my lords the prison population is too high <e> <s> that is a definite fact which has been confirmed by all speakers today <e> <s> many of those prisoners are social rather than criminal cases for instance prostitutes and alcoholics <e> <s> they can and should be dealt with outside the penal system <e> <s> these people are socially inadequate and ill and their treatment in other institutions and by other means would be more beneficial to them and less costly to us <e>", "<cs> my lords like my noble kinsman lord st davids i should like to say a few words about water transport <e> <s> in the united kingdom the various modes of inland transport road rail waterway and pipeline have developed separately <e> <s> waterway transport was the first method of moving goods on a large scale but with the advent of rail and good roads little further investment was made in waterways to enable them to compete <e> <s> as a result the potential of waterway transport has been virtually ignored <e> <s> the past few years have shown a welcome change of approach by government <e> <s> in the first major improvement to a waterway for freight transport purposes since was authorised <e> <s> the scheme for the sheffield and south yorkshire navigation is due for completion early in and will facilitate the passage of craft to rotherham in the heart of the south yorkshire industrial conurbation <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble baroness lady faithfull has said there is a great deal of disquiet over the legislation or rather the lack of it for private childrens homes as it stands at the moment so i very much welcome this bill <e> <s> it will protect children from those who use these homes purely for monetary gain as well as regulate how such homes should be run and the minimum standards of care that must be provided in them <e> <s> there are many of these homes throughout the country <e> <s> along the south coast alone there are about private childrens homes <e> <s> many of them are satisfactory but others have caused considerable concern about the welfare of the children living in them <e> <s> the position at the moment is that the local authorities do not in general have the right to inspect them and the secretary of state has no power to close any private home or to require changes to be made <e>", "<cs> my lords it is now over three years since i visited rampton with the all-party parliamentary mental health group since which time the staff there have been coping with the difficulties caused by the continuing police inquiries and the court cases some still in progress <e> <s> rampton has an enormously difficult and demanding task to fulfil <e> <s> it has to deal with a population that almost all other institutions and services have failed <e> <s> on june st there were still people on the approved for transfer list at rampton despite there having been a more positive response from local hospitals recently patients having left the hospital in <e> <s> rampton has its eastdale unit for rehabilitation which could offer eleven more places were the funds available but there is no similar unit at all for female patients and the other special hospitals have none either to my knowledge <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to say what pleasure it gives me to see the noble earl lord snowdon on our benches as the interest that he takes in the disabled is well known <e> <s> since the middle of the last century our society has attempted to help the mentally handicapped by providing long-term care in a mental hospital <e> <s> although such institutions started out with high hopes of therapeutic endeavour many rapidly deteriorated into offering only custodial care <e> <s> such is the inherent nature of psychiatric disabilities that if a vigorous active policy of care is not maintained patients tend to get worse <e> <s> this fact has been clearly appreciated over the last years and attempts have been made to provide care which is based not on the mental hospital but on services set up outside it in the community <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> is he aware that the complexity of the conditions and regulations which are attached to the making of grants under section is an inhibiting factor in the submission of a successful application for grant <e> <s> am i right in thinking that the draft memorandum prepared by the department of transport for those seeking to apply for these grants has yet to be approved by the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords although the private sector is more likely to be concerned with acute surgery than with chronic illness there is clearly a certain amount of private enterprise in caring for the elderly and mentally ill <e> <s> there are a few voluntary and private homes caring for a considerable number of these patients <e> <s> due to the failure of the national health service to provide sufficient beds many elderly people or their families are making their own arrangements to use private nursing homes <e> <s> but statutory authorities are also using these places sometimes at the clients or patients own expense owing to this lack of sufficient nhs hospital beds <e> <s> according to the most recently published figures from the dhss in there were more than elderly people living in registered voluntary homes and a further elderly people living in registered private homes <e>"]
