["<cs> my lords we have had a valuable and as the noble lord lord irving of dartford has rightly noted wide-ranging debate <e> <s> i am conscious that i am a newcomer to the field of foreign affairs

central america with the united states administration and they are fully aware of our views <e>", "<cs> my lords as i told the noble lord on rd july it has been the practice of successive administrations not to comment on matters of this kind <e> <s> but i can confirm that no serving british military personnel are presently engaged in foreign wars <e>", "<cs> my lords as at st august states had ratified one or both of the protocols additional to the geneva convention of and a number of others had acceded to them <e> <s> i have arranged for a complete list to be placed in the

ratification of the protocols <e>", "<cs> my lords the modernisation of the ballistic missile early-warning radar at fylingdales as agreed between ourselves and the us government conforms fully with us obligations under the anti-ballistic missile treaty <e>", "<cs> my lords we will all be grateful to the noble lord lord kennet for asking this question <e> <s> it concerns a subject of fundamental importance and enormous topical interest which reaches to the core of our own security and that of the western alliance as a whole <e>", "<cs> my lords we have played a leading role in discussions of iran/iraq at the united nations security council <e> <s> the conflict is also discussed regularly within european political co-operation and bilaterally with a range of countries <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord knows nato is a defensive alliance and is committed against the first use of any weapons <e> <s> we would only respond if attacked <e> <s> it was to this that i intended to refer <e> <s> natos strategy for use of nuclear weapons has been and remains based on flexible response <e>", "<cs> my lords we are aware of the programme but we have no evidence to support allegations in it of a black market in weapons grade plutonium or enriched uranium <e> <s> we have full confidence in the present system of controls on such material <e> <s> there is a long history of hoaxes in this field <e>", "<cs> my lords her majestys government will be represented at official level <e> <s> the exact composition of the delegation will depend on the contents of the conference papers which have not yet been received <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos has secured todays debate in a historic week and we are all grateful to him not just for giving us another opportunity to review progress in arms control and disarmament and in east-west relations but also for the balanced way in which he has introduced a most important subject <e> <s> i was able in answer to the unstarred question of the noble lord lord kennet on th november to set out the governments position on and our hopes for a start treaty <e> <s> we also discussed the possible relationship of such a treaty to developments in the field of ballistic missile defence <e>", "<cs> my lords we already play an active part in informal discussions between nato and warsaw pact representatives in vienna seeking to agree a mandate for conventional stability negotiations in the atlantic to urals area <e> <s> progress has been reasonable and we hope that formal talks can begin later this year <e> <s> the elimination of the conventional imbalance in europe is one of the governments central objectives <e>", "<cs> my lords her majestys government will continue to work for an international conference as the framework for negotiations to bring about a peaceful settlement of the arab-israeli conflict <e>", "<cs> my lords we support the efforts of the ugandan government to restore peace and stability

of the subject have been very valuable indeed <e> <s> we have all <e>", "<cs> my lords we have received a proposal from the bbc external services to establish a world television news service which could be broadcast worldwide including to commonwealth countries <e> <s> examination of the complex issues raised in the bbcs proposal is not yet complete but it is being given considerable attention and priority <e>", "<cs> my lords nato last week concluded its consideration of the proposal <e> <s> the alliance would be ready under certain conditions to address the question of military doctrine in discussions with the warsaw pact <e>", "<cs> my lords we have told professor mayor that we would be happy to meet him should he decide to come to london <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat a statement which has been made in another place by my right honourable and learned friend the secretary of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs about the white paper on hong kong <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall continue to support all efforts aimed at achieving a settlement of the arab-israeli dispute <e>", "<cs> my lords we support united nations security council resolutions of th november and of rd december both of which called for the immediate withdrawal of south african troops from angola <e> <s> we continue to urge this upon the south african government <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord kennet has raised an important matter and one in which i know he has a great deal of interest <e> <s> i must say that i was somewhat astonished by his claim that defence research and development defence land and so on in some way represent negative value which was the term he used <e> <s> i find that astonishing when one considers the important part that this country has played as a member of nato in securing the peace which has existed in europe for the last or more years <e> <s> i do not think that it is a valid claim in any sense to say that all the research that has been done can represent lost value <e> <s> i would have thought that it was probably the best possible value that could be bought <e>", "<cs> my lords yes but we adhere to the agreement by european council foreign ministers in september and the commonwealth accord of the same year which ban the export of oil to south africa <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe we all agree that the question of the noble lord lord mayhew is timely <e> <s> it is taking place at a time of intense diplomatic activity on the subject and against a background of disturbing events portrayed in almost nightly reports on our television screens <e> <s> i am grateful to him for enabling us to discuss a matter of considerable international concern <e> <s> one matter which this evenings interventions have made clear is the deep interest which your lordships have in a part of our history in that part of the world and the deep concern we all feel about the situation in the occupied territories and the need for early progress towards a negotiated settlement of the underlying arab-israeli conflict <e> <s> perhaps i may make it perfectly plain at the outset that the government fully share that concern <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that the noble lord is most enthusiastic about this proposal but i wonder whether he intends to develop a theme devoted entirely to the bbc and television <e> <s> if i had known that i would have come to this house prepared to answer him <e>", "<cs> my lords we continue to believe that civil trade with other countries including namibia should be determined by commercial considerations <e>", "<cs> my lords no properly formulated proposal has been submitted to the security council <e> <s> however those western countries which already have a naval presence in the gulf have given no indication of being willing to subsume their national efforts in a united nations force <e>", "<cs> my lords the joint declaration of nd december establishes the political basis for practical co-operation between britain and spain over the use of gibraltar airport <e> <s> if the arrangements are accepted by the people of gibraltar there will be further consultations at central government and local levels on their implementation but no sharing agreement is planned <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will already be familiar with the governments views on the complex and challenging problems facing south africa and the south african region <e> <s> but it can do no harm whatever to restate them again <e>", "<cs> my lords we have no plans to do so <e> <s> we have accepted the optional articles of the european convention on human rights which recognise both the right of individual petition and the compulsory jurisdiction of the european court of human rights <e> <s> we do not believe that becoming a party to the optional protocol would enhance the protection of individual rights in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords over the years we have made numerous representations <e> <s> most recently my honourable friend the minister for overseas development took the matter up with the ethiopian deputy prime minister during a visit to ethiopia in january <e> <s> we shall continue to raise the subject at every suitable opportunity <e>", "<cs> my lords progress has been significant <e> <s> we have extended the list of potential suppliers to include more new firms advertised contracts more widely and continued support for companies from the small firms advice division <e> <s> as a result in the year to

law and human rights standards in their administration of the occupied territories <e> <s> we shall continue to take appropriate opportunities to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords as a distinguished spiritual leader committed to the cause of non-violence the dalai lama is welcome to visit this country <e> <s> when his recent visit was proposed assurances were from the outset offered on his behalf that his visit would be pastoral in character and that he would not make political statements while he was here <e> <s> in these circumstances no consideration was given as to whether such assurances should be insisted on as a condition of this visit <e>", "<cs> my lords we have good relations with the republic of fiji and with other south pacific island states including kiribati tuvalu and vanuatu <e>", "<cs> my lords the airports authority of thailand officially announced on th april that its investigation had shown that weapons used to hijack the aircraft were not taken aboard the plane at bangkok airport <e> <s> we are pressing in icao summit seven and the ec for a team of international experts to be set up under icao auspices to investigate future hijackings <e> <s> we always seek to improve international co-operation against terrorism <e> <s> the five-point plan which my right honourable and learned friend the foreign secretary put forward on th april contains concrete proposals to that end <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> current discussions on nuclear disarmament are bilateral and her majestys government fully support the goal of a us/soviet agreement to reduce strategic nuclear weapons <e> <s> it is natos policy that any arms control agreement must have effective verification arrangements <e> <s> but verification regimes must be tailored to suit each agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords a recent influx has brought the total number of vietnamese boat people in hong kong to <e> <s> the existing closed centres are very crowded and emergency facilities are being established to accommodate recent arrivals <e> <s> we are pursuing our own programme of resettlement and continuing our diplomatic campaign to persuade other governments to follow suit <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for setting out his approach to the problem and for acknowledging the fact that the governments approach has been on broadly the same lines to achieve the same ends although perhaps along a slightly different route and with one small difference which he has highlighted <e> <s> i am also grateful to him for acknowledging the fact that the governments amendments stem from our willingness to listen to arguments constructively put forward in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords this report is a valuable analysis of the relationships between population resources the environment and development <e> <s> her majestys government will continue to deliver a substantial and effective aid programme designed to stimulate economic and social development and alleviate poverty <e> <s> our support for population-related activities will remain an important part of that work <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord cledwyn has brought us back to an issue of great international concern at as he indicated a particularly sensitive and important moment <e> <s> i am grateful to him for his constructive approach and for the careful and interesting interventions of other speakers from all corners of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords precise figures are only available for the eight european community countries that belong to the development assistance committee of the organisation for economic co-operation and development <e> <s> the figures which show net official development assistance for as a percentage of gnp are as follows belgium denmark france germany ireland italy netherlands and the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am grateful to the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos for giving us a further opportunity to discuss developments in hong kong <e> <s> i must begin by assuring the house of our responsibility for hong kong and of the fact that its future is a matter of the highest priority for her majestys government <e> <s> my right honourable and learned friend the foreign and commonwealth secretary made that plain when he visited the territory only very recently <e>", "<cs> my lords it is for the gibraltar house of assembly to decide whether it wishes to amend gibraltars legislation to permit the implementation of last decembers joint declaration on gibraltar airport <e> <s> we firmly believe it is in its interests to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords we have joined in appeals for clemency by foreign ministers of the twelve on th june by the security council on th june and by heads of government at the toronto economic summit on th june and at the european council on th junerecently we have again raised the issue directly with the south african government <e>", "<cs> my lords it would not be appropriate to comment on turkeys application for membership of the ec while the european commission is still preparing its opinion <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all most grateful to the noble baroness lady serota for introducing this subject so clearly for the other useful interventions that we have heard today and for the care with which the committee of the noble baroness approached its task <e> <s> i wish to say at the outset that the government very much welcome this penetrating and timely report on an important matter <e> <s> i am not sure that i am qualified to answer the points of the noble lord lord ardwick on the style of the report itself <e> <s> it certainly uses familar terms with rather unfamiliar applications <e> <s> i am thinking of such terms as <e>", "<cs> my lords much western credit to the soviet union comes from commercial sources <e> <s> support by her majestys government is only provided in order to encourage trade beneficial to british firms <e> <s> it would not be appropriate to respond to encouraging developments in the soviet union by imposing new restrictions <e>", "<cs> my lords we believe that an international conference under un auspices can provide a suitable framework for negotiations between the parties to the arab-israel conflict <e> <s> we shall continue to work for such a conference to be convened <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not customary practice to comment on confidential discussions between the twelve in political co-operation <e>", "<cs> my lords we deplore romanias policy of systemisation which will apparently involve forced resettlement on a nationwide basis and the destruction of thousands of villages <e> <s> the head of our delegation to the csce follow-up meeting in vienna referred to the issue in plenary

international arrangements for providing emergency assistance for natural disasters are working well <e>", "<cs> my lords we are aware of the suffering of the kurdish people in iraq and of the kurdish refugees in turkey as a result of military operations by the iraqi government <e> <s> we have made clear to the iraqi government our total opposition to these actions <e>", "<cs> my lords in opening this part of the debate on the motion for a humble address i should perhaps begin by saying that i shall concentrate on foreign rather than defence policy questions leaving the latter for my noble friend lord trefgarne to deal with when he winds up <e>", "<cs> my lords we have never recognised <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall continue to work for an international conference on the arab-israel dispute as a framework for direct negotiations between the parties <e> <s> the principles stated in the venice declaration and the proposal for a conference command widespread international support

africa from the rights and privileges of membership of the international atomic energy agency <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord hatch of lusby has given us an opportunity once again to debate the important topic of southern africa <e> <s> it is a part of the world which has caused great anguish to many <e> <s> it still does as this debate has shown <e> <s> but it is one where we have seen significant developments in recent weeks <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mayhew has again demonstrated his deep knowledge of the middle east let alone his skill in timing in drawing our attention today to the question of the israeli practices in the occupied territories <e> <s> i am very grateful to him for giving me notice of many of the points he covered in his speech and the questions he asked <e>", "<cs> my lords mr shamir has been invited to visit britain <e> <s> we look forward to discussing with him how we can help achieve a peaceful settlement of the arab-israeli
