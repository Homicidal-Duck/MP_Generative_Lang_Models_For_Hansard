whether i have ever served in the territorial army the answer must be no <e> <s> it is true that in i considered the idea but when i discovered that the colonel was a man known to me and that i was known to him because i used to weed his garden every saturday for half a crown and as i further considered that was only years of age at the time and he knew it i thought perhaps i had better not entertain any further the idea of joining his battalion <e> <s> so i went down the road and joined another battalion of the same regiment of the line <e> <s> it happened to be the royal warwickshire regiment and sometimes now i sit and reflect that a regiment that can produce such soldiers as field marshal montgomery field marshal slim and company sergeant major leatherland was not such a bad crowd after all <e> <s> i was about to say that although i was never in the territorial army myself i did come into contact with territorials down on the somme in <e> <s> i found that they were real soldiers <e> <s> so it was with very great pleasure indeed that for over years i sat as a member of the territorial army association of my county <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble and learned lord

notification to the local authorities will specify particular cuts for particular services <e> <s> may i also ask him whether he will circulate this information to the local authorities as early as possible because it is my recollection as a former county council chairman and a former county finance committee chairman for many years that it was sometime in november when we used to get down to the job of planning the coming years estimates <e>", "<cs> my lords do i understand from the ministers reply that a quango has been set up to consider the question of empty beer bottles <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister and i do so as a former university treasurer whether it is a fact that as a result of these people being educated in britain and then going back to their own countries

not be sitting on friday <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister to ask his noble friend lord boyd-carpenter how it is possible for alarm and despondency to prevail under a conservative government

indeed <e> <s> the object of the bill is to transfer some of the functions of the present lieutenant governor to other authorities and i completely agree with that <e> <s> i would only add that i am rather glad this was not done years ago because in the year the lieutenant governor of the isle of man then bore the very honoured name of leatherland <e> <s> i understand he was a very worthy person

epping forest <e> <s> epping forest is a very well-managed slice of woodland which in addition to being very well-managed is allowed to remain virtually in its natural state and i would hesitate to see any interference with the manner in which the city corporation now exercises its functions over the forest <e> <s> with particular regard to the roadworks which are now proposed i think it is fair to say that the road does not go very far through the wooded part of the forest but largely goes over grass-surfaced fields <e> <s> therefore i have no fears whatsoever as to the future beauty of the forest if these proposals are allowed to go through <e>", "<cs> my lords following the noble lords supplementary question may i ask the noble earl and i do so as one who very frequently slept in french cowsheds in and onwards whether it is a fact that milk from french farms is likely to be contaminated because the cows are kept in most insanitary cowsheds <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree that this plan will alter the whole face of a very wide picturesque and peaceful countryside <e> <s> would he also agree that accommodation either in some kind of new town or otherwise will be needed for at least people <e> <s> in view of the widespread objection there is in many parts of essex to this proposal may i ask the noble lord whether he will arrange for a public inquiry to

what will it involve and will there not be a public inquiry on the proposals that have been outlined to us today <e>", "<cs> my lords does that mean there will not be a public inquiry prior to stansted becoming a very much busier airport than it is today <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that if hostilities broke out fighter aircraft could be shot down and destroyed in half an hour <e>", "<cs> my lords that is so <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not in opposition to the introduction of the tachograph <e> <s> i think that it is one of those things which we must accept in these days when lorries undertake <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister agree that a good deal of public expenditure is expenditure on goods and that this raises production and keeps unemployment down and to that extent is it not a worthy object <e>", "<cs> my lords may i <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lords answer mean that the government have it in mind to have a major enlargement of stansted that is to say something above million passengers a year <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give us an assurance that the government will consult tate lyle with whom the government party has been in close contact over the years <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord and the government take steps to see that whatever information they distribute on this matter they do not create unnecessary panic

quite appropriate in all cases <e> <s> let us take that famous work of art the statue of venus the lady who seems to have everything except her two arms <e> <s> would this amendment require her majestys government to restore the two missing arms to the statue of that lady <e> <s> i hardly think that it would <e> <s> therefore i think that the inclusion of the word restore here might do more

rights <e> <s> we are now discussing one of the most fundamental human rights of all and i feel that that is hardly the subject for a quick decision on an amendment which has been before us for a few days <e> <s> on the other hand i feel there is a need for a statutory commission to be set up to inquire into the whole question of sex education <e> <s> it is not a matter to be decided after a few hours consideration <e> <s> the right reverend prelate talked first about sex education and then about playing the violin <e> <s> in my younger days i had many lessons in the playing of the violin and

lords the noble baroness lady young is quite correct in what she says but the rateable value is also cumulative and is going up year by year so that the stated stable number of pence in the pound of the rate will bring in an increasing income every year <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl tell us what proportion <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to enter into an argument about the real

noble lord tell us what will happen if these gentlemen find themselves thirsty and want to buy a bottle of lemonade <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government consider keeping secret the name of the

declare <e> <s> it is my good fortune that i shall be years old on friday so i think that i am outside the boundary of those who are likely to be penalised by the earnings rule <e> <s> but when i retired from work years ago the earnings rule certainly penalised me despite the fact that i had paid my contributions for the whole of my working life <e> <s> i should have thought that that was one side of a contract which ought to have been honoured by the other side <e> <s> i feel very deeply that i had a very raw deal on that occasion and i am quite sure that there <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government aware of the fact <e>", "<cs> my lords in order to keep a proper sense of balance can the minister tell us how many british people are working abroad particularly as with a tory government in office so many people are eager to leave the country <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government bear in mind the welfare of the coalmining industry because what might be a convenience to some districts here might spell disaster for some mining communities <e>", "<cs> before it gets to that stage may i ask a question about clause <e> <s> may i ask the minister how many extra civil servants will be needed to fulfil the functions set out in that clause <e> <s> if no extra civil servants will be needed do not the presence of this clause and the duties flowing from it indicate that the civil servants are not now fully employed <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will recall that he made use during his earlier reply of the letters sssi <e> <s> can the noble lord tell us what organisation or animal they represent <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not hear the minister comment on <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister express the view that in <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble

proposals the noble lord lord rochester has put forward <e> <s> that method of consultation already operates in many industries and in many firms <e> <s> it operates very successfully <e> <s> it

showing department by department what reductions are being made <e> <s> will it show whether any reductions are being made for example in the number of income tax collectors <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble minister tell us whether these fishery protection vessels in addition to protecting our fishing rights also do anything to protect defend or safeguard our oil rigs in the north sea <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister bear in mind that when chairs become surplus to requirements and are to be sent for sale by auction it would be a nice idea if members of this noble house were themselves invited to tender for some of them <e> <s> i believe that many of us would like to have a house of lords chair in our own homes so that we could sit in it occasionally when our years are farther advanced <e>", "<cs> my lords in these days of sexual equality will the noble lord do all he can to discourage the belittling of women <e> <s> is he aware of the fact that in the days when i used to go out fox hunting the women were at least equal to the men and i never saw a woman jib at a jump <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware of the fact that on this side of the house it is

stock of them for my old age can he tell us what they are <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord tell us by what percentage rents of houses have increased since last may when the government came into office <e> <s> can he tell us whether it is more or less than the general per cent <e> <s> increase which has taken place in retail prices since the government came into office <e>", "<cs> my lords

ourselves in this way may i ask the noble lord whether he can tell us how many miles each of these two sites will be from the nearest well-populated town <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that salmon is now between and a pound and as one who likes it may i ask whether he can do anything to bring down the price <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that this is not a very important matter because the scottish witnesses would not trouble to claim their expenses <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl arrange for a prominent position in this display to be reserved for the poster which says keep left <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say a word or two about the economy that is proposed at the expense of the maternity benefit <e> <s> at the age of i have no personal interest to declare but it is generally known that keeping a family in these days is expensive and as each week goes by it will become more expensive still <e> <s> there are many very heavy household expenses to be borne at the time when a new baby arrives so everything that has to be purchased for that occasion is now more expensive than it used to be and becomes more expensive with every month that passes <e> <s> this is rather a miserable economy so could not the government drop it and just make an exception to their economy drive in this respect <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord an easy question <e> <s> as the economy is now showing a red light will the government take a left turn in its policy <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell us to what extent his governments policy has resulted in the reduction of inflation during their first months of office <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that to keep left is a motto which might well be followed in all walks of life <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has told us that he had been indulging in a great deal of heart-searching <e> <s> i wish he would search his heart a little more <e> <s> i have been doing a little simple arithmetic as distinct from making a long speech about the unimportant matters in the bill and the one very important matter <e> <s> that very important matter is contained

lords <e>", "<cs> my lords before the house agrees to that can the noble lord tell us by what coincidence it is that he always rises to make that proposal at the same time as i rise <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl tell us which particular kind of pest this advisory committee deals with <e>", "<cs> my lords as in describing certain things and situations the scottish use different words from the english for example they say outwith instead of outside will the noble and learned lord arrange for this document to be printed in both languages <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has given us some dramatic examples of the heavy burden which the local rates impose upon both landlords and tenants <e> <s> i should like to ask him therefore whether her majestys government intend to take any action to fulfil the promise which they made at the last general election namely that local rates should be abolished <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that the burden of this service might be reduced if in cases where a person has perfect sight in one eye and defective sight in the other it would be much cheaper to issue him with a monocle than with an ordinary pair of spectacles <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say whether it is a fact that the british gas industry is making very large profits probably of million a year <e> <s> if that be so would it not be possible for the gas industry to reduce its prices both to industry and to the household consumer <e>", "<cs> my lords if there have been such cuts in respect of the expenditure of the equal opportunities

but may i also ask him to tell us by what percentage inflation has risen since the present government came into office <e> <s> is it not about per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords my concern being with the five young ladies who are engaged to the british troops when the troops return to britain will permission be given to the five young ladies to accompany them <e>", "<cs> i find myself uttering the same kinds of words as those spoken by my noble friend on the front bench <e> <s> we have to beware of asking councils to take on more and more <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister consider that a mission of ministers might be sent to outer space to investigate this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that the gas industry is making an enormous surplus every year <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl please answer my question <e> <s> it was as follows is it not a fact that the gas industry is making an enormous surplus year by year <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that the gas industry is making a profit of about million a year <e>", "<cs> my lords in case the noble earl did not hear me before may i ask him whether it is a fact that the gas industry is making a profit

answer that there is a suggestion of buying us out of your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords as the nationalised gas industry is making a profit of about million a year will the minister consider reducing the price of gas to both domestic and industrial consumers <e>", "<cs> my lords am i to gather from that reply that we may shortly expect a reduction in the price of gas in view of the fact that the industry is making million a year profit <e>", "<cs> my lords did i understand from the noble lord that the list of transgressions is to be placed in the library <e> <s> does he not think that it would be better if it were issued publicly not only to members of this house but to the press and the general public <e>", "<cs> my lords it is with great joy that i rise to support the spokesman of the government <e> <s> it is perhaps hardly to be expected that on the question of refuse collection and refuse disposal i should rise to speak in your lordships house but it so happens that over half a century ago i was the chief cost accountant of the refuse disposal department of one of the biggest cities in this country and in those days i learned quite a lot about rubbish which has served me in good stead since taking up political activity <e>", "<cs> my lords does not this show how very badly indeed the government have looked after the nationalised industries during the last months <e>", "<cs> my lords i suppose that i am one of the very few members of your lordships house who have served in the capacity of a professional newspaper reporter in the press <e>", "<cs>

less than hours <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down may i say that she mentioned a handbook that she said would be placed in the library <e> <s> i wonder whether copies of it could also be placed in the printed paper office so as to be available to any noble lords who wish to study the matter more closely <e> <s> i also wonder whether a simple pamphlet could be issued before th november so that ordinary members of the public can apprise themselves of the new regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord not agree that we have a conservative government whereas some of those other countries have not and that therefore we should be very much better off than they are <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister and the government bear in mind that they have just heard the liberal party say that it wants to reduce peoples wages <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the noble lord and i do so in order to get a proper balance of things whether he can tell us that it is true that during the past month the number of unemployed has risen by <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord tell us whether these area health authorities were set up by a conservative government and that it is a <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord not feel that the whole of this expense ought to be borne by the central government as part of our national defence undertakings <e> <s> and would he not agree that in places like london essex surrey and other thickly-populated parts an elaborate system of civil defence has to be set up with part of the cost borne by the local ratepayers whereas in distant in thinly-populated parts of the country they need to do hardly anything at all <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord take steps to see that widows are informed that they ought not to be in a position where they can claim maternity benefit <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of what the noble lord said about the cheapness of travelling in paris would the government consider saving government money by holding the meetings of this house in paris <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the fact that many people who wear glasses have one good eye and one defective eye would it be possible for monocles to be prescribed on the national health service <e>", "<cs> may i say a few words on behalf of courting couples <e> <s> of course my memory is not what it used to be but i believe sometimes these well-intentioned young people sit under hedgerows at night and they want to be able to sit there peaceably and be uninterrupted <e> <s> just think what

at night and sometimes other people who are shooting go nearer to the public roads than we normally think they would <e> <s> i think that there is a great danger <e> <s> shooting at night ought to be prohibited <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that increasing numbers of our people are now living to a ripe and happy old age <e> <s> is this not in fact largely due to the national health service <e> <s> therefore should we not stop nagging about it <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister said he would be happy if there were fewer unemployed in the country <e> <s> can he do anything to make himself happy by persuading the government to reduce the number of unemployed <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl tell me whether these areas declaring themselves nuclear free zones have notified moscow to that effect <e>", "<cs> my lords may i suggest to the noble viscount that that factor is already taken into account with the monthly unemployment figures where the number of people who have new jobs is subtracted from the large and ever-increasing number of people who have lost their jobs to give us finally a net figure for lost jobs <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord advise local authorities to set up costing systems as a result of which they could probably save a great deal of money as the birmingham corporation did years ago when i was put in charge of their costing system for a big department <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that one of the difficulties of implementing a scheme of this kind is the mobile nature of the services a man is here today and gone tomorrow <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister as he cannot tell us how many new businesses have been started during the year whether he can tell us how many businesses have gone bankrupt during the year as a result of the governments economic policy <e>", "<cs> my lords does this mean that the conservative party no longer believes in free competition <e>", "<cs> my lords i have nothing in the way of argument to add to the three highly intelligent speeches that we have had from noble lords <e> <s> i merely wish to ask two questions <e> <s> in his opening speech the noble

paragraph of the bill where it says <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord agree that if the tax on alcoholic beverages were not so high more people might be inclined to be satisfied with the mild stimulation of those beverages without being driven to buy drugs <e>", "<cs> my lords while the government are considering improving the pay and allowances of that particular group of public servants can the noble lord think of another very dedicated group of public servants to whom an increase would also be welcome <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not be cheaper and more beneficial than the
