["<cs> i wonder whether i may ask the minister a question <e> <s> this seems the right time to do it <e> <s> i certainly do not agree with the amendment <e> <s> i am not at all sure that i agree with the government either <e> <s> there has been a lot of talk about small schools and as far as i can make out it is agreed on all sides that this means those with under pupils <e> <s> in my own authority we have only out of a total of primary schools with more than children <e> <s> we even have secondary schools out of with fewer than on the roll and i know that we do not have a single special school with more than pupils or anything like it <e> <s> a great many of our primary schools are two teacher schools <e> <s> the head can choose whether he or she wishes to be a governor under the new legislation <e> <s> what about the wretched assistants <e> <s> so far as i can make out if the head says that he does not want to be a governor the assistant has jolly well got to be whether he wants to be or not <e> <s> what sort of punishment will be inflicted on them if they decide they do not want to be a governor <e>", "<cs> in large rural areas the schools are many miles apart <e> <s> when it comes to grouping first the villages are not speaking and secondly we are going to have a discussion on rural transport and i cannot see how the governors will get to the meetings because there are no bus services and i do not think they could afford the petrol <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble lord lord davies of leek will withdraw this amendment <e> <s> i have great respect for the noble lord but i could not follow his reasoning on this at all <e> <s> it is perhaps fair enough in a large comprehensive school where you have several to choose from but the noble lord cited the moorland schools <e> <s> the moorland schools i know mostly have one or two teachers and at the very most three <e> <s> the one non-teaching member of the staff is the caretaker-cum-dinner lady who is a most worthy person and the salt of the earth but the last thing she wants to do is to become involved with the managing <e>", "<cs> it cannot be said that the party opposite has the sole right for a noble husband to support a noble wife <e> <s> i do not always agree with mine which is why she sits on the cross-benches and i sit firmly on this side of the house but i agree with her on this point <e> <s> very sensible words have been spoken by lord taylor opposite <e> <s> this amendment one must be very wary of <e> <s> lord stewart made much about the prefectorial system <e> <s> that is the way to do it <e> <s> there are prefectorial systems within the maintained system which have much more to be said for them than the very nasty prefectorial system which was in operation when i was at school when boys flogged other boys <e> <s> thank god nothing like that happens in a state school <e> <s> there are plenty of opportunities for older pupils to shine at that and to contribute to school councils but i do not think that the right thing to do is to put them on governing bodies <e>", "<cs> i applaud what my noble friend the minister has said but he did not mention the subject of expense <e> <s> i do not know what expense would be placed on local authorities in these hard times to produce all these papers <e> <s> and what about the sheer <e>", "<cs> i am very glad to hear what the noble lord lord alexander has said <e> <s> i must apologise for not having spoken at second reading because i was away <e> <s> this was a clause that was going to take up a lot of my time <e> <s> in mitigation may i say that i wrote at some length to the noble baroness lady young both before and after second reading about this <e> <s> i am worried about the cost of these measures <e> <s> i think to a large extent they are unnecessary <e> <s> having served myself as chairman of an appeals committee i know that there are areas in which these appeals committees are working extremely well now <e> <s> it is nothing whatsoever to do with my chairmanship but i remember during my time that we even had letters of congratulation from people whose appeals we had refused that the appeal had been so fairly considered <e> <s> we did not normally ask the parents to come and appear in front of us <e> <s> we did on occasions where we thought this was necessary <e> <s> it was mostly done by writing <e>", "<cs> it came as a complete and utter surprise that the noble baroness was going to quote this article by my own county education officer <e> <s> there has been no collusion or collaboration <e> <s> i think she gave a slight misreading where she said that there has been a handful of appeals <e> <s> i remember that we had several handfuls of appeals to deal with at a time <e> <s> i think dr owen referred to a handful of dissatisfied customers who felt that they must go on to the des about it <e>", "<cs> i must interrupt <e> <s> we have harrogate with five cornprehensives and a free choice for parents <e>", "<cs> must say that at this hour i find myself confused by all the legal argument <e> <s> earlier my noble friend baroness young paid a tribute to my authority not that it does us much good <e> <s> that authority produces for prospective parents literature on special schools and we also have a procedure involving a panel to which parents can appeal <e> <s> am i to understand that if this legislation goes through we shall not be able to take such action and indeed will be breaking the law if we do so in future <e>", "<cs> i hope that the government might feel able to accept this amendment <e> <s> there are as my noble friend lord ridley has said a number of schools in my area where just by one or two families moving out in the course of their occupations numbers attending the school can reduce drastically the high percentages of the school turnover <e> <s> i hope that this fairly simple amendment might be the one that we have been waiting for all evening when one of my noble friends on the front bench leaps up with glee and says we accept it <e>", "<cs> i put my name down to this amendment but may i counsel my noble friend the duke of norfolk not to press it <e> <s> i put my name to it because i did not want it to be thought that it was a purely roman catholic affair <e> <s> i do not see a plethora of reverend prelates in the committee to support it so i do not think my church is entirely behind it <e> <s> i have one slight objection to what my noble friend lady young has said in reply on the question of expenses <e> <s> much was made of expense on the last debate particularly by the noble lord lord thorneycroft <e> <s> it is my view that this bill is nothing but expense a lot of it unnecessary <e> <s> that is why i voted against the government and i am not ashamed to say so <e> <s> i spent long hours of the night before last on this beastly appeal procedure which puts enormous expense on the local authorities <e> <s> therefore to be coerced into coming here to support the government in order to keep expense down seems to me to be unnecessary <e> <s> this bill is so expensive in many ways i am not referring to just the assisted places scheme that the government ought not to stress this particular point <e> <s> i ask my noble friend not to press the amendment <e>", "<cs> if the government are going to reconsider this matter there is one further point that i should be grateful if they would look at and that concerns what i would call the rather transient population of some school children <e> <s> in my own area there is a large military camp at catterick garrison and we sometimes find that before we get their records both on education and on health children arrive and then leave because their parents have been stationed elsewhere <e> <s> there is sometimes a borderline between the two where you have a child who may be slightly deaf or have visual difficulties <e> <s> there is little one can do about that if the records listing those difficulties arrive after the child has gone elsewhere <e> <s> i do not know whether it is interdepartmental with the educational authorities themselves with the army with the liaison or even <e>"]
