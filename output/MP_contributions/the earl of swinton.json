["<cs> my lords there was a headmaster of a grammar <e>", "<cs> as my name was mentioned by the noble baroness lady bacon i think that i might be allowed to speak <e> <s> at this stage i was not going to speak but the noble baroness made a great point of the fact that i came out as pro-comprehensive and yet i support the bill <e> <s> i support the bill because with all respect when the noble lord lord peart rises and says that his side would not produce a bill such as this i would point out that he did produce such a bill <e> <s> that is why i support this bill <e> <s> the previous government introduced a bill to compel local authorities to go comprehensive <e>", "<cs> they introduced a bill to make local authorities go comprehensive <e> <s> this bill simply repeals that action <e> <s> i would get up in front of anyone and say that in an ideal world i should like a comprehensive system of education but it is not right to say to every local authority that every school must be compelled to go comprehensive <e> <s> surely they can judge for themselves what is right for their area <e> <s> that is why as an ardent supporter of comprehensive education and i see the noble baroness lady bacon nodding i have no twinge of conscience whatever about supporting the bill <e> <s> it is absolutely right and i am delighted to support the government <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may ask the minister a question <e> <s> this seems the right time to do it <e> <s> i certainly do not agree with the amendment <e> <s> i am not at all sure that i agree with the government either <e> <s> there has been a lot of talk about small schools and as far as i can make out it is agreed on all sides that this means those with under pupils <e> <s> in my own authority we have only out of a total of primary schools with more than children <e> <s> we even have secondary schools out of with fewer than on the roll and i know that we do not have a single special school with more than pupils or anything like it <e> <s> a great many of our primary schools are two teacher schools <e> <s> the head can choose whether he or she wishes to be a governor under the new legislation <e> <s> what about the wretched assistants <e> <s> so far as i can make out if the head says that he does not want to be a governor the assistant has jolly well got to be whether he wants to be or not <e> <s> what sort of punishment will be inflicted on them if they decide they do not want to be a governor <e>", "<cs> in large rural areas the schools are many miles apart <e> <s> when it comes to grouping first the villages are not speaking and secondly we are going to have a discussion on rural transport and i cannot see how the governors will get to the meetings because there are no bus services and i do not think they could afford the petrol <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble lord lord davies of leek will withdraw this amendment <e> <s> i have great respect for the noble lord but i could not follow his reasoning on this at all <e> <s> it is perhaps fair enough in a large comprehensive school where you have several to choose from but the noble lord cited the moorland schools <e> <s> the moorland schools i know mostly have one or two teachers and at the very most three <e> <s> the one non-teaching member of the staff is the caretaker-cum-dinner lady who is a most worthy person and the salt of the earth but the last thing she wants to do is to become involved with the managing <e>", "<cs> it cannot be said that the party opposite has the sole right for a noble husband to support a noble wife <e> <s> i do not always agree with mine which is why she sits on the cross-benches and i sit firmly on this side of the house but i agree with her on this point <e> <s> very sensible words have been spoken by lord taylor opposite <e> <s> this amendment one must be very wary of <e> <s> lord stewart made much about the prefectorial system <e> <s> that is the way to do it <e> <s> there are prefectorial systems within the maintained system which have much more to be said for them than the very nasty prefectorial system which was in operation when i was at school when boys flogged other boys <e> <s> thank god nothing like that happens in a state school <e> <s> there are plenty of opportunities for older pupils to shine at that and to contribute to school councils but i do not think that the right thing to do is to put them on governing bodies <e>", "<cs> i applaud what my noble friend the minister has said but he did not mention the subject of expense <e> <s> i do not know what expense would be placed on local authorities in these hard times to produce all these papers <e> <s> and what about the sheer <e>", "<cs> i am very glad to hear what the noble lord lord alexander has said <e> <s> i must apologise for not having spoken at second reading because i was away <e> <s> this was a clause that was going to take up a lot of my time <e> <s> in mitigation may i say that i wrote at some length to the noble baroness lady young both before and after second reading about this <e> <s> i am worried about the cost of these measures <e> <s> i think to a large extent they are unnecessary <e> <s> having served myself as chairman of an appeals committee i know that there are areas in which these appeals committees are working extremely well now <e> <s> it is nothing whatsoever to do with my chairmanship but i remember during my time that we even had letters of congratulation from people whose appeals we had refused that the appeal had been so fairly considered <e> <s> we did not normally ask the parents to come and appear in front of us <e> <s> we did on occasions where we thought this was necessary <e> <s> it was mostly done by writing <e>", "<cs> it came as a complete and utter surprise that the noble baroness was going to quote this article by my own county education officer <e> <s> there has been no collusion or collaboration <e> <s> i think she gave a slight misreading where she said that there has been a handful of appeals <e> <s> i remember that we had several handfuls of appeals to deal with at a time <e> <s> i think dr owen referred to a handful of dissatisfied customers who felt that they must go on to the des about it <e>", "<cs> i must interrupt <e> <s> we have harrogate with five cornprehensives and a free choice for parents <e>", "<cs> must say that at this hour i find myself confused by all the legal argument <e> <s> earlier my noble friend baroness young paid a tribute to my authority not that it does us much good <e> <s> that authority produces for prospective parents literature on special schools and we also have a procedure involving a panel to which parents can appeal <e> <s> am i to understand that if this legislation goes through we shall not be able to take such action and indeed will be breaking the law if we do so in future <e>", "<cs> i hope that the government might feel able to accept this amendment <e> <s> there are as my noble friend lord ridley has said a number of schools in my area where just by one or two families moving out in the course of their occupations numbers attending the school can reduce drastically the high percentages of the school turnover <e> <s> i hope that this fairly simple amendment might be the one that we have been waiting for all evening when one of my noble friends on the front bench leaps up with glee and says we accept it <e>", "<cs> i put my name down to this amendment but may i counsel my noble friend the duke of norfolk not to press it <e> <s> i put my name to it because i did not want it to be thought that it was a purely roman catholic affair <e> <s> i do not see a plethora of reverend prelates in the committee to support it so i do not think my church is entirely behind it <e> <s> i have one slight objection to what my noble friend lady young has said in reply on the question of expenses <e> <s> much was made of expense on the last debate particularly by the noble lord lord thorneycroft <e> <s> it is my view that this bill is nothing but expense a lot of it unnecessary <e> <s> that is why i voted against the government and i am not ashamed to say so <e> <s> i spent long hours of the night before last on this beastly appeal procedure which puts enormous expense on the local authorities <e> <s> therefore to be coerced into coming here to support the government in order to keep expense down seems to me to be unnecessary <e> <s> this bill is so expensive in many ways i am not referring to just the assisted places scheme that the government ought not to stress this particular point <e> <s> i ask my noble friend not to press the amendment <e>", "<cs> if the government are going to reconsider this matter there is one further point that i should be grateful if they would look at and that concerns what i would call the rather transient population of some school children <e> <s> in my own area there is a large military camp at catterick garrison and we sometimes find that before we get their records both on education and on health children arrive and then leave because their parents have been stationed elsewhere <e> <s> there is sometimes a borderline between the two where you have a child who may be slightly deaf or have visual difficulties <e> <s> there is little one can do about that if the records listing those difficulties arrive after the child has gone elsewhere <e> <s> i do not know whether it is interdepartmental with the educational authorities themselves with the army with the liaison or even <e>", "<cs> my lords may i support what has been said from the opposite bench <e> <s> this also frightens me because i assume that if an appellant has a legal representative then the county council or whatever it is the education committee will have to have one as well <e> <s> i understand these appeals take place somewhere near the schools not near the education offices so it probably means a whole day of travel which is going to put a great deal on the rates <e> <s> with all respect to members of your lordships house who are lawyers we know how they do go on at each other <e> <s> i see the noble lord lord mishcon glaring at me across the chamber <e> <s> it tends to drag out the proceedings <e> <s> if this amendment were pressed to a division and if these words do mean legal representation i would have been tempted to follow the noble baroness into the division lobby <e> <s> i feel rather less enthusiastic after the nonsense that was made of the last division <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to support what the noble baroness <e> <s> lady david said on this amendment <e> <s> i find myself very much in sympathy with her on this schedule <e> <s> i remember one occasion when i was sitting on an appeal committee and believe it or not a parent was appealing against a choice of school because it was the school to which the sibling in this case the older child was going <e> <s> the parents did not want the younger child to go there because the older child had some very nasty personal habits which we were all told about in full detail <e> <s> i am quite sure that that influenced us greatly and we granted the appeal <e> <s> i am quite certain that if the public or the press were sitting in we should never have been told those rather nasty basic details <e> <s> it might have spared our blushes but i cannot believe that a parent who wants to bring out such matters would be very pleased to do so as it were in open court <e>", "<cs> my lords may i begin by thanking my noble friend for those last amendments <e> <s> i had not realised that we had finished before we had scarcely started <e> <s> i did support my noble friend lord ridley i have not spoken to him but i am sure he will be as grateful as i am for the amendments the noble baroness has moved <e>", "<cs> my lords i am bound to be in trouble here <e> <s> whichever way i go i shall offend on this occasion either my noble friend lady young or the equally noble lady my wife <e> <s> i will take my courage in my hands and say that i side completely with my noble friend lady young <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that whatever your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of what my noble friend has said about the differences between northern ireland and this country may i ask under what category somebody falls who owns an irish setter in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend agree that it is very often the case that farmers and others who live in the countryside show a great deal more concern for wildlife and improving the conservation of the landscape than those who come into the countryside masquerading under the name of conservationists <e> <s> i am particularly thinking of the case of the yorkshire dales national park where the buildings that the farmers have put up over the years the little barns in which to keep the hay are one of the most attractive reasons why the area is one of such outstanding natural beauty <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend not agree that perhaps in some ways animals are rather better off in northern ireland than they are here as some of us learned last night during an order which was debated in this house in regard to the penalty in northern <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether if my noble friend is taking this matter back she can consider this at the same time <e> <s> i have obviously been under a strong personal lobby for the past few weeks about this point and i still feel at the end of this debate that doctors are doing jolly well out of this <e> <s> i am thinking of rural areas where there is perhaps a clergyman and a solicitor who does a lot of work under legal aid <e> <s> they do not get a per cent <e> <s> grant for having a secretary <e> <s> would it not remove discrimination entirely if we did away altogether with the per cent <e> <s> grant and then the wives would be in the same position as everybody else <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i was going to say that i was grateful to my noble friend for that helpful reply but i do not think that i can <e> <s> may i ask whether he might not persuade his colleagues at the manpower services commission to look at this point <e> <s> does he not think that agriculture is unlike other industries where one can learn a trade in six months <e> <s> it takes a year to learn all the variations of seasons and the other work involved <e> <s> i am not thinking here just of rural children but of children from town areas who perhaps seek some form of new life in the country and might this not be of benefit in the present conditions <e>", "<cs> my lords it gives me particular pleasure to congratulate the two maiden speakers this afternoon <e> <s> being a third yorkshire earl after hearing my two brother earls from yorkshire i feel that on this occasion i can rather bask in reflected glory <e> <s> if i may describe my noble friend lord halifax as a yorkshire earl i am sure he would take that as a compliment and not an insult <e> <s> i think it was the noble lord lord hunt who congratulated the noble earl lord peel and said that he made a very brave speech <e> <s> he is a very brave man indeed because he moved into yorkshire from lancashire and it takes a very brave man indeed to do that <e> <s> so i am sure that he will show no fear in your lordships house in future and we look forward to hearing both of them again <e>", "<cs> i find it very difficult to follow that one especially if they were out on the mud flats <e> <s> that would soon dampen down their amorous activities <e> <s> i should like to take up one point which the noble lord lord melchett made <e> <s> he read out a most impressive list of countries <e> <s> i cannot remember them all but i think i heard switzerland and austria included <e> <s> i do not think they have very large shorelines anyway <e> <s> but i do not think any of the countries on the list that he read out were islands <e> <s> we have a particular habitat in this country thank goodness with a foreshore such as is not enjoyed so much by other european countries <e> <s> so we are in a special position <e>", "<cs> i should like strongly to disagree with the noble duke <e> <s> here i must declare an interest because my wife is very partial to snipe when she is not debating disablement problems in your lordships house <e> <s> i am always greeted in great triumph when i come back from the moors as i do occasionally with a snipe <e> <s> probably only one snipe during the course of a day because that is all we get <e> <s> i would echo the point that my noble friend lord gibson-watt made we can only shoot them in august because they go <e>", "<cs> i agree with my noble friend the impression i have is that there is not an enormous difference in argument between the wildfowl associations and the conservation societies over this <e>", "<cs> i feel i should go into the history of this a little because the season has been curtailed over the years <e> <s> under the wildfowl protection act the close season was from th february to th july <e> <s> it was altered in from nd march to st july but giving county councils the power to alter dates in their areas <e> <s> in the wild bird ducks and geese protection act was introduced and the close season was made from st february to th august but it gave maritime counties power to extend the season to st february <e> <s> the important date is and the wildfowl protection act in which the inland close season was from st september to st january with the foreshore shooting continuing to th february for ducks and geese only and i stress ducks and geese only <e>", "<cs> i was very glad to hear that last remark from the noble lord lord kilbracken because i was going to say a few words before a tide of euphoria swept over the committee and we agreed to these amendments without their being looked at at all <e> <s> a very valuable point was made by the noble earl lord onslow when he stressed that what as sportsmen we must look at is the conservation side <e> <s> i do not think it is for us to judge whether something is a suitable target to be shot or whether it is good to eat or nasty to eat <e> <s> people have strange tastes in their feeding habits and they may find that a bar-tailed godwit is to them rather as an oyster is to some of us or on the other hand it may well turn us off <e> <s> we cannot judge on that what we have to judge on are the conservation measures <e>", "<cs> i should like to say a few words on behalf of the canada geese <e> <s> i would hate to see them classified as pests <e> <s> i am afraid that i have much to answer for because swinton was one of the places where they were introduced in this country and some time after the last war sir peter scott came and netted i suppose that that would be illegal now a great many of swintons geese and introduced them to the serpentine <e> <s> those original swinton geese have multiplied in all the london parks in the thames valley in sussex and goodness knows where and are now wreaking havoc on the land <e> <s> so if only very indirectly perhaps i ought to take responsibility for them <e> <s> even though they come and eat my corn and the local farmers corn i still look upon them as a lovely bird <e> <s> i love to see and to hear them <e> <s> i should hate to think of them as being classified with rooks grey squirrels and goodness knows what else as a pest <e>", "<cs> may i ask the minister one question <e> <s> i find myself totally and absolutely confused by the debate on this matter and perhaps the minister will write to me about it <e> <s> i refer to the answer that he gave when my noble friend asked about moving capercaillies <e> <s> i receive demands from friends some of whom are members of this house and their relations for some of my canada geese to be put on their lakes <e> <s> if this proposal goes through will i be breaking the law if i meet these demands <e> <s> it would not be any skin off my nose since i do not charge and it would save all the trouble of catching and driving them over in the back of my car <e> <s> so i should personally be delighted if it were the case it would be a very handy answer to give <e> <s> perhaps the minister will write to me about it <e>", "<cs> my lords a lone voice i rise to oppose this amendment <e> <s> for the benefit of the noble lord lord melchett i would say that yorkshire north riding and yorkshire west riding sadly have not existed since the local government reorganisation which is a thorn in the side of many of us yorkshiremen who like that name <e> <s> i am not certain that i agree with the noble lord that this does not rule out pest species and i look forward to hearing what my noble friend on the front bench has to say about that <e>", "<cs> i accept that my lords and so far as birdwatchers are concerned i think it would be easier for them to see the birds if they were disturbed and flying around having been put up by a shot than all tucked away in the reedbeds and marshes <e> <s> i hope the government will not accept the amendment <e> <s> the people we are speaking of are not cowboys but are organised they all belong to clubs which have very strict rules and this is one of the few chances they have to go shooting <e>", "<cs> i was not suggesting that bird-watchers wanted to watch birds being shot my lords <e> <s> i was suggesting that if a shot went off a lot of birds that would otherwise be hidden away in the rushes and reeds would get up and fly around and they would then have a better chance of seeing them <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord donaldson made a point <e> <s> i am quoting from a letter from sir peter scott and i certainly would not want to criticise in any way anything that sir peter has to say <e> <s> he said that there was a deal i think it was the act and that was the reason <e> <s> of course there was a deal because the wildfowlers were losing so much at the beginning of the season and this was agreed at the end <e> <s> i shall not repeat all the arguments which i put forward in committee <e> <s> the noble lord lord melchett made a very strong point on amendments nos <e> <s> a and b but what we must do is to support what the advisory committee said and i think they made absolutely no point about the numbers of wildfowl decreasing <e> <s> the numbers of geese in particular have risen enormously especially the quarry species of geese <e> <s> i really cannot see any conservation grounds at all for supporting this amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to support what noble lords have said about this <e> <s> it seems that the chronically sick and disabled persons act has failed very largely because of the words practical and reasonable and anybody who does not want to make the facilities available says that they are not practical and are not reasonable because they cannot afford to provide them <e> <s> that seems to be the reason why they get away with it all over the country <e> <s> here i should have thought where it is a question of grant <e> <s> it is an entirely different ball game <e> <s> they are given the money to do something and the money can be given on these conditions <e> <s> therefore they cannot use it as an excuse that the provision of these facilities are not practical or reasonable <e> <s> i hope the government will have another look at this <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to get involved in a lib-lab battle rather than a lib-lab pact <e> <s> the chief whip is glowering at me but i can take that because the other day he gave me a rocket for not having spoken on one amendment <e> <s> something very much attracts me about lord sandfords amendment <e> <s> this is something which has not been discussed at any time it is on moorland conservation and on the over-stocking and over-grazing of heather <e> <s> in our part of the north yorkshire national parks we could swallow up many times the whole of exmoor in the amount of white land which used to be moorland and which has been over-grazed <e> <s> i do not think that this is the fault of the farmers <e> <s> all you can do if you are a hill farmer and times are hard is try to produce more and more sheep and lambs <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to echo that <e> <s> to say that a wildlife and countryside bill is not the right vehicle for providing protection for wildlife in the countryside seems a most extraordinary answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i must confess an almost total ignorance of deep sea fishing matters unlike some of my noble friends who have spoken this afternoon <e> <s> in fact i think my only experience was twenty-four very happy hours that i once spent as i am looking at my noble friend lord campbell of croy i think the technical term is a seine netter out of wick <e> <s> so i shall concentrate very much on the fresh <e>", "<cs> i have put down my name to this amendment <e> <s> i am very sorry that the noble viscount lord thurso is not here <e> <s> i imagine that he is still waiting at wick airport until the current dispute is finished and he can get an aeroplane south <e>", "<cs> if my noble friend will read what i have said he will see that i did not say anything of the sort <e> <s> i merely asked my noble friend how one could discern between the two <e> <s> i was in no way asking that aid should be given to producers of fish for sporting purposes <e> <s> i was trying to find out how one differentiated between the two when they were swimming around in the same tank <e> <s> i certainly was not asking for aid either for myself or for anyone else to produce fish for sporting interests <e>", "<cs> my lords when the secretary of state is considering this matter will special thought be given to the needs of rural areas where casualty departments are often a very long way from the scene of the accident and ambulances must travel enormous distances before arriving at the place where the patient is suffering and is in need <e> <s> is the minister therefore aware of the very special need that exists in some of the isolated parts of the country <e>", "<cs> my lords first i wish to congratulate my noble kinswoman on the excellent way in which she has introduced the bill today but of course i am a little biased <e> <s> i should also like to congratulate the honourable member in the other place who presented the bill <e> <s> we have been told by the noble viscount lord ingleby that the bill is like a baby and it is growing and growing <e> <s> this is much to be welcomed <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment and having been thinking about the matter since second reading i feel that perhaps it would be wrong to try to penalise people who after all have tried hard to <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble baroness will withdraw the amendment <e> <s> i am very sympathetic to what the noble baroness the minister said <e> <s> i think that the way to do it is by circular <e> <s> however i still do not know whether my particular point has been covered <e> <s> i have in mind buildings where wheelchair signs are displayed but it is impossible to get in with a wheelchair <e> <s> i want to stop this kind of thing <e> <s> it is extremely frustrating time-wasting and annoying <e> <s> i certainly do not feel that the imposition of a penalty would be the way to deal with it and i am equally fairly certain that the amendment is not the right way to deal with it either <e> <s> there are circulars and circulars and i feel that a fairly strong circular must be the answer <e> <s> i hope that the noble baroness lady darcy de knayth will withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i start by offering my congratulations too to my noble friend lady lane-fox <e> <s> i have known her for many years and i know that what we have heard this afternoon is just a preliminary to what we hope to hear over the years from her because she speaks equally well about the disabled and about a number of things <e> <s> she will be a great asset not only to this house but also to the mobile bench <e> <s> as my noble friend lord vaizey said with her splendid electric chair she will not only be inflicting mental anguishes upon successive front benches of varying shades of political opinion but i know that they may also be in danger of suffering some damage as her machine goes zooming along the front of them <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i am going to be most unpopular here with the mobile front bench but i should like to support what my noble <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to oppose the motion proposed by the noble lord lord melchett <e> <s> the noble lord has given us some of the arguments which he puts very reasonably as always and which he has produced in your lordships house before <e> <s> i do not have very much more to add to that which has been said in your lordships house before but i should like to make the point most strongly that the time when wildfowlers go out tends to be at dawn and at dusk <e> <s> those are the times when the ducks are fighting and this tends to be either before the birdwatchers have arrived or sometimes after they have gone home <e> <s> if one bans shooting on a sunday one is going to put an awful lot of pressure on saturdays <e>", "<cs> my lords i too welcome this bill <e> <s> i make no apologies about speaking on one subject which has not been considered very much in any of our debates <e> <s> i think that it should be mentioned even though i am interested as many other members of your lordships house are in the business which is to follow <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support noble lords who have spoken in defence of the commons amendment <e> <s> the noble lord lord houghton asked what is a wildfowler <e> <s> i was glad to get support from a very unlikely source here <e> <s> having said he was going to vote the other way i am not surprised that he is moving out of the chamber <e> <s> i think it was the noble lord lord melchett who described the wild-fowler as the common man the ordinary chap who goes down and shoots below the tideline where he does not have to pay the large rents which certain noble lords on this side of the house can afford to pay for their shooting <e> <s> he is not some terrible character who goes out and shoots everything that moves <e> <s> i put it to your lordships that if there are a number of wild-fowlers who do not wish to shoot the curlew there is <e>", "<cs> my lords whatever legislation is framed would my noble friend not agree that there is nothing to stop people giving money if they so wish to any deserving or undeserving case such as the bankruptcy celebrations of sir freddie laker recently <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i could briefly say something supporting my noble kinswoman and the noble baroness lady faithfull on the intermediate treatment centres <e> <s> i would disagree with my noble kinswoman when she says that they are often funded on a shoestring <e> <s> they seem to me to be funded on thin air <e> <s> i was recently appointed by my local bench as a member of the support group of the centre from which the children she mentioned came <e> <s> they had managed somehow to get hold of an old rectory from the roman catholic church who kindly let them have it <e> <s> they managed to get it done up and painted by young people on community service orders and this is a good thing and just the sort of thing that they should be doing <e>", "<cs> it gives me great pleasure for i think the second time in one day in your lordships committee to rise and support my noble kinswoman <e> <s> again i do not support her completely i think <e> <s> i was going to query the wording of this amendment <e> <s> i do not mind whether it is called a board of visitors managers governors or whatever it is <e> <s> i was going to take the example of the ordinary school <e> <s> i am delighted to see my noble friend lord elton on the front bench and i think of the education act introduced by the present government and the amount of work that went into that to make sure that every school in the country should have a board of governors <e> <s> it seems to me extraordinary that you can have boarding schools which is what community homes or some of them come down to without any member of the public represented <e>", "<cs> yes <e> <s> officially one saw them once a month and we often went to the school i call it a school two or three times a month and chatted to them <e> <s> you had detailed papers put before you about their progress and so on and it was a useful thing <e> <s> somebody must carry out the review <e> <s> if you had the board of visitors or managers or governors call it what you will on a fairly widely based representation you could have people capable of doing that <e> <s> the juvenile magistrates could be involved and it would save calling perhaps a special meeting of the juvenile magistrates <e>", "<cs> i know of two community homes neither of which has a board of governors <e> <s> these are two in my own authority <e> <s> on the first one members of the social services committee were appointed <e> <s> i was reliably informed that in due course they were told by some of the social services staff that they interfered and they have not been near the place for years <e> <s> in another again various members from the social services committee were appointed <e> <s> after a year they thought that they were doing so little and they became so frustrated that they have not been near the place since <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware with regard to what he said about planning and local authorities and i am thinking of the national parks that in order to get over this problem people who put up large agricultural buildings particularly those made of asbestos were encouraged to spray them with farm slurry in order that in the course of time lichens and mosses would grow and they would blend in with the countryside <e> <s> i do not think such plans would be very popular with people living in the caravans at the time the slurry was put on <e>", "<cs> i should like to support my noble friend lord elton <e> <s> i do not know a great deal about drugs but have always understood that starting with what is supposed by some to be a relatively innocuous drug is but a step to a very much worse and harmful drug such as heroin <e> <s> therefore i believe that the use of cannabis should be discouraged as much as possible <e> <s> it has also been said that this amendment does not prohibit the prosecution of those who are selling the drugs <e> <s> but neither does it prohibit the prosecution of those who have the drug for their own use but who as a number of your lordships carry cigarettes in their pockets and offer them as a free gift to friends would introduce the drugs gratuitously to young people which would then lead the young people on to very much nastier and more unpleasant drugs in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to hear that reply and even more delighted to see sitting on the front bench my noble friend the leader of the house <e> <s> i recollect the education act going through and the stress that was laid upon bringing governing bodies into line and making sure that the best practices were established <e> <s> i can absolutely assure my noble friend the minister because i have checked on this since committee that in two community homes in my area there has not been a member of the social services committee near the places for at least six years <e> <s> they establish as their governing body the social services committee and not one elected member has been near either of the two community homes in my area for six years <e> <s> so i do not know who is preparing the written report i suspect that it is probably one of the social services workers and maybe they can get away with it <e>", "<cs> my lords for the second time this evening it must be a record i am actually supporting something proposed by my noble kinswoman and that gives me pleasure <e> <s> i am fairly satisfied with my noble friends answer but there are two small points i would mention <e> <s> first i think that there should be a close liaison <e> <s> obviously these children are coming from school when they go into ches and they will probably go back into school when they go out so there needs to be a strong link between the schools they have come from and the schools they are going back to <e> <s> secondly some form of career for the teachers would be welcome to ensure that they did not go into this form of teaching as a dead-end alley as it were <e> <s> there should be some way in which they could get back into the service perhaps with promotion prospects having done their spells <e> <s> i hope my noble kinswoman does not press the amendment because i am glad the government are aware of the problem and are keeping it under review <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend lord cockfield i beg to move that this debate be now adjourned until later this day <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the house do now resume in order to discuss the statement <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords the government recognise that the encouragement of young people into the engineering professions depends crucially on what schools can do to arouse pupils interests and ambitions and to equip them with the right range of knowledge skills and attitudes <e> <s> direct responsibility for this rests in england and wales with individual schools and their local education authorities <e> <s> nevertheless in their guidance document <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for the kind remarks which he has made <e> <s> i think it is one of the main objectives of the government in the field of education to improve standards in all subjects and english must be one of those <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that that is somewhat wide of the subject <e> <s> but the better trained and educated they are the more chance they will have of finding the jobs that are available <e>", "<cs> my lords this obviously crosses the line between where education finishes and training begins but i would not agree entirely with what the noble lord has said <e> <s> it is important to have a good grounding especially in view of what the noble lord said about there being fewer and fewer jobs <e>", "<cs> my lords this is one of the problems that we need to get over <e> <s> up to now an education in technology and in industry has not perhaps been considered as much a status symbol as education in some of the social services in the law or in medicine <e> <s> this is something which the government are trying to get over with their various initiatives <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness very much for her kind words <e> <s> i am glad she agrees with me that i am definitely in need of some education and i hope that i may get it at the des <e> <s> as i am sure the noble baroness is aware the government issued a statement in may on the new -plus examination <e> <s> this is intended primarily for those young people who wish to continue their full-time education in school or in further education and who have set their sights on employment rather than higher education but have not yet decided on a particular job <e> <s> it is very important that the arrangements for <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware of that <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder if i may interrupt the debate for a moment to say that my noble friend lord kimberley has decided in view of the likely late hour at which it would take place to postpone his unstarred question on alcoholism from this evening until some other day <e> <s> i understand that all those due to speak have agreed to this change but i thought that the house should know of it at the earliest possible opportunity <e>", "<cs> my lords the government would deplore any attempt to undermine the authority of teachers and we look to schools and local education authorities to take action to deal with any such attempt <e> <s> we have at present no plans to introduce additional powers in this field but if my noble friend has specific proposals in mind we should be glad to consider them <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not surprised that when violence takes place in schools that is the sort of thing the media cotton on to because there is not an awful lot of newsworthy material in a school that is working peacefully with the pupils sitting happily doing their lessons and where all is well <e> <s> i do not mean to be flippant because of course we are concerned about any school where violence occurs especially towards teachers <e> <s> i do not think there is a particular amount of violence at the moment <e> <s> each case must be looked at on its merits and it is up to the local education authority to deal with it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not here to defend my noble friends question but i am afraid unfortunately that it is not a figment of his imagination <e> <s> if the noble baroness cares to go to the library i am sure she will find reports of violence in schools unfortunately occurring from time to time <e>", "<cs> my lords that question was not a plant <e> <s> i agree as i do occasionally with my noble kinswoman <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that is very much the case <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble baroness for pointing that out <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think it is up to me to produce the literature <e> <s> that is for the noble viscount who asked the question <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we are getting into great troubles if we start raising questions on an unstarred question when the minister has sat down <e>", "<cs> because my lords i think it is against the best traditions of this house <e> <s> i stand to be corrected if i am wrong but i am sure that i am right <e> <s> on an unstarred question when the minister sits down that is the end of the debate <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the house do now resume for the statement <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a long wide-ranging and interesting debate as i am sure your lordships house will agree <e> <s> it is fair to say that perhaps we have not always agreed with everything that has been said but i pay tribute to the noble lord lord glenamara for raising the subject of the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand the situation it will still remain part of the thames polytechnic and the whole thames polytechnic is not disappearing <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that they will have to find something else to do with the building <e> <s> we heard a very interesting speech from the noble lord lord stewart of fulham who particularly concentrated on adult education although his speech ranged over a large number of subjects <e> <s> the government continue to attach importance to a viable adult and continuing education sector <e> <s> it has played a valuable role in the past and will make an increasingly important contribution in the future in helping individuals to develop their own potential whether in personal or vocational terms <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give a date for this statement but it should be possible soon <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not altogether surprised that the noble baroness was somewhat disappointed with my original answer <e> <s> however i would deny that the government are taking it lightly <e> <s> it is just the opposite <e> <s> they are very conscious of how complex this matter is and the review that was sent in attracted a great many comments from many interested bodies <e> <s> there is a lot of very careful consideration being given to this and that is the cause of the delay <e> <s> indeed my right honourable friend recognises the considerable interest in this matter <e> <s> i cannot commit him to a precise date but it really should not be very much longer <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said this is a very complex matter <e> <s> it certainly has not been neglected and the minister is deciding when he will make his statement <e>", "<cs> my lords i will certainly give my noble friend that undertaking <e> <s> in fact some work has been done on this already <e> <s> the largest group of handicapped students are those with moderate learning difficulties <e> <s> there is a need for curriculum development supplemented by staff training for teachers who work with these students <e> <s> the department and the further education unit have taken steps to respond to this need <e> <s> the further education unit is publishing guidance on a curriculum framework directed at meeting the educational needs of students with moderate learning difficulties <e> <s> the department is to finance a project which is to be commissioned by the further education unit to assist the wider dissemination of good practice among teachers of the handicapped in further education and the production of teaching materials <e> <s> these steps should help to improve the provision <e>", "<cs> my lords soon is as soon as i said it was to the noble lords friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to commit the government to a definite statement on whether soon is sooner than shortly or shortly is sooner than soon but i think that soon is probably as shortly and as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i indeed agree with noble baroness lady darcy de knayth on that point <e> <s> the review recognised that existing legislation makes no specific reference to the needs of handicapped students <e> <s> the white paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly bring that point to the attention of my right honourable friend and also to the attention of the department <e>", "<cs> my lords most secondary schools already provide opportunities for pupils to engage in community service and in both primary and secondary schools pupils are encouraged to show consideration for other people and for their environment <e>", "<cs> my lords i would be sorry if what my noble friend has said were so <e> <s> i have had inquiries made and i am not aware of any evidence that such an effect is at all widespread <e> <s> the arrangements for community service by offenders are well established and have a most valuable part to play <e> <s> voluntary community service by young people has a splendid record in this country <e> <s> however i do not wish to appear complacent and if my noble friend has specific instances in mind i would be very glad to look into them if she would let me have the details <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said to my noble friend lady trumpington i really have not had any evidence that community service is looked upon as a punishment putting off younger children who wish to do it <e> <s> of course there are a number of factors which contribute as children grow up they tend to have boy and girl friends motor-bikes video players and so on <e> <s> all those things rather put them off community service as they grow older <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that there is a great deal more that i can say to my noble friend but perhaps if she will give me the name of the school of which her husband was the headmaster we could take some action <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that is somewhat wide of the question <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i am very well aware of the enormous amount i had better be careful with my words of i was about to say community service but i will now say service in the environment that is done by young people <e>", "<cs> my lords this is positively embarrassing and looks like a plant and a put-up job because i am sure that my noble kinswoman is aware though members of the house may not be that i am county president of the duke of edinburgh award scheme in north yorkshire and very well aware of the amount of work that it does <e> <s> i should like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to all those the teachers assessors adjudicators and others who give help in this way <e> <s> but i should not like to pick out in particular the duke of edinburgh award scheme because there are many national voluntary organisations which include community service within their activities <e> <s> i cannot mention them all but to name just a few there is the national association of youth clubs the national youth bureau the scouts association the british red cross society and st johns and two which i should particularly like to single out which are solely concerned with this aspect of work are the community service volunteers and the youth volunteer force foundation <e> <s> i should like to pay tribute to those many thousands of people throughout the country who give their spare time to help in this sort of work <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs for drawing our attention to that work in northern ireland <e> <s> i have just given a very long list of organisations that help and i think that throughout the country there is a splendid record of help to the community through these voluntary organisations <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that by way of grants the government indeed help a number of these bodies <e>", "<cs> my lords as to the first part of the supplementary question asked by the noble lord lord hatch yes i think that the words voluntary service have much to recommend them <e> <s> as regards the second part and the worldwide aspect of voluntary service i think i am right in saying that the community service volunteers are similar to voluntary service overseas <e> <s> i think the latter tends to go more into the foreign aspects whereas the community service volunteers are more concerned with community service in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords as far as the first part of the noble lords question is concerned this information is not collected <e> <s> as regards the second part of his question open university students are eligible for awards only at the discretion of their local authority <e> <s> where this is insufficient the university itself may offer assistance <e> <s> the government made available to the university in and an earmarked grant of million specifically to assist unemployed students <e>", "<cs> my lords coming to the third of the noble lords questions no i have not read that <e> <s> so far as the fees are concerned i am not quite so good at my sums as the noble lord but i can give him the fees <e> <s> in they were and this is the tuition fee for a full credit course in they were and in they are <e> <s> i think that this last rise is just about the per cent <e> <s> which refers to inflation <e> <s> the noble lord had a third supplementary and i have forgotten what it was <e>", "<cs> my lords this is quite a difficult question to answer because people are not asked the exact reason why they have not taken up their places <e> <s> the university carries out some form of survey <e> <s> as i understand it it is rather like one of those surveys where you get a list of columns and you tick things off <e> <s> there are a number of reasons and a number of reasons are given <e> <s> i will try to help the noble lord if i can but the drop-out from the open university is a difficult situation to discuss <e> <s> it is not like a normal university where you suddenly give up <e> <s> obviously you can stop in the middle of a course at the open university where you are gaining credits and take a year off if you want to <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i would say first of all that awards given to students to study at open university are made entirely at the discretion of the local education authorities <e> <s> it is therefore inevitable that the practice will vary between authorities <e> <s> each authority will need on the one hand to balance the case for each applicant and on the other the need to keep its expenditure and rates at reasonable levels <e> <s> constraints on public expenditure in recent years have caused some local authorities to reduce the level of assistance they give under the discretionary awards arrangement but this is a matter for authorities to decide for themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i would accept that point from my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept part of that <e> <s> on the other hand i cannot resist telling the noble baroness that the open university as a direct grant institution receives the major part of its income from central government in the form of an annual recurrent grant <e> <s> i am sure she is aware of that <e> <s> further whereas in it received about million in it is receiving nearly million so i do not think it is doing too badly <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that if the noble lord lord brockway were to become a student and give up part of his time in this house we should all miss him immensely <e> <s> i suppose the answer is that if you are unemployed it does not matter what age you are <e> <s> i give that off the cuff <e> <s> i think he would have to write to me for an answer in this case <e> <s> i am sure that we should miss him very sadly if he were to go there too often <e>", "<cs> my lords it is very difficult to answer the noble lord because he asks so many supplementary questions at a time that by the time he gets to the last one one has forgotten what the first one was and vice versa <e> <s> perhaps it is easier to concentrate on the middle one but i have even forgotten what that one was <e>", "<cs> my lords i think in all fairness to those who are to take part in the debate that is to follow we have probably gone far enough with this bill tonight <e> <s> i therefore beg to move that consideration on report be now adjourned <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are at present considering the possibility of changing from a system of student support based wholly on grants to one involving a mixture of grants and loans <e> <s> there are many complex issues to be looked at and no decisions have yet been taken <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i made it quite clear in my original answer that this is not a proposition <e> <s> i repeat that the government are at present considering the possibility of changing <e> <s> i do not think that is a proposition <e> <s> obviously when the time comes that is if the time comes there will have to be innumerable consultations but the government have not committed themselves to this in any way so far <e>", "<cs> my lords i really cannot go on repeating that the government have not yet come to any definite conclusion <e> <s> when the government themselves make up their minds what they are going to do that will be the proper time for consulting everybody <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful for those remarks from my noble friend <e> <s> there will obviously be consultations and i imagine that some people will be in favour and others violently opposed <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i can only repeat once more that we are considering the possibility of a change but the details have not yet been agreed or thought out in any way <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise <e> <s> i should have said if the government decide rather than when <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that is a matter of opinion <e> <s> the noble lord is entitled to <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give a categorical promise but i imagine they would be consulted <e>", "<cs> my lords i am absolutely sure that the government are going to consult very widely on this <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord lord alexander for what he has said <e> <s> this is one of the reasons why the government are considering these possibilities <e>", "<cs> my lords i am quite certain the government are looking into measures which are used in various parts of the world <e>", "<cs> my lords the british antarctic survey receives

clear when the act was going through parliament <e> <s> if i may answer some of the questions the noble baroness lady david made a lot of points about what was happening in cambridgeshire as regards the sixth forms <e> <s> i really cannot answer as to what is happening in cambridgeshire at the moment <e> <s> but i would stress again that there are only some eighty or so children involved in the

the cypriots to work out how they are to spend that money <e> <s> as the noble lord has said cyprus is a special case because not only is it a member of the commonwealth without a university of its

-hour course i think there may be some negotiation between them and the dhss <e> <s> as i understand it the part-time students on the -hour courses will not be affected by this <e> <s> it is simply that the government take the view that young people remain at school until they take their examinations at the end of their course <e>", "<cs> no my lords this is not the position <e> <s> the answer is that the young person who is ambitious and wants to take his exams will stay at school and do them <e> <s> that is what we are trying to encourage <e> <s> we are not trying to encourage people without jobs to leave school early and come back on the off-chance that they might achieve some exam <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know what the national association of head teachers have done but i can say that the changes which we bring in have been sought for many years by the cse boards which include representatives of teachers and local education authorities among their members and the

carpet <e>", "<cs> i think the committee has made enough progress for one night and i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords the government do not accept that the method for

overspending <e> <s> that was why the cuts were down so much <e> <s> regarding his other question about the special responsibility of the minister for merseyside may i say that the special responsibility which my right honourable friend the secretary of state for the environment has had for merseyside does not relieve the local education authority from complying with national policies for higher education which entail substantial reductions in expenditure <e>", "<cs> i think that we have made enough progress for this evening <e> <s> therefore i beg to move that the house do now

standards were restricting innovation and preventing local education authorities from providing the type of food which pupils wanted <e> <s> this led to a lot of waste and wasted food clearly has no nutritional value whatever <e> <s> one of the things that arises is that under the new cafeteria system which many local education authorities have adopted there is far far less waste and in fact at places where the pig swill man used to come round local authorities are now having to pay him to come and take away the little that is left over <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the decision was taken only last night so i really cannot say whether the borough of merton is covered by the <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that that is a somewhat different question from the one on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord hatch is quite right <e> <s> in fact since this government took office it has been their policy to halve net expenditure on meals and milk in real terms so as to protect provision in the classroom <e> <s> a number of local education authorities have responded positively to that policy and have attained expenditure levels consistent with the governments plans <e> <s> i myself live in a rural area where schools have gone over to the cafeteria system <e> <s> not only is it saving money but it is also enormously more popular with the children who take the meals <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that it is up to the local education authorities themselves as to who they employ or do not employ in their services <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure of the figures for which the noble lord is asking but i shall read with interest what he said in <e>", "<cs> my lords this government have shown considerable concern about the quality of training provided for potential teachers <e> <s> in england and wales they have received advice from her majestys inspectorate of schools and from the advisory committee on the supply and education of teachers on ways in which such training might be improved and a consultative document has also been issued on the question of qualified teacher status <e> <s> the current reorganisation of the training system in england and wales is being implemented in such a way as to provide a sound institutional base for the system <e> <s> the government are now considering what changes if any might be proposed which would affect the selection and assessment of potential teachers and the content of the courses provided for them <e> <s> in northern ireland similar initiatives have been undertaken <e> <s> for scotland an announcement was made recently about major changes in primary teacher training <e>", "<cs> my lords in recent years there has been a welcome increase in the time given to the practical aspects of teaching during initial teacher training courses <e> <s> additionally it is the governments intention that experienced practising teachers should be encouraged to take a more active part in training students and that more of the students training should be classroom-based <e> <s> i believe that these developments will help with the problems which my noble friend has mentioned <e> <s> however i am sure that my noble friend will agree that in these matters as in many others there is no substitute for experience <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not in fact aware of the feelings that the right reverend prelate has just enunciated and i am very grateful to him for his remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to that question is no he has not but he will certainly write to his noble friend with them <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that there are any courses dealing with that matter that are run in any institutions that i know <e> <s> i have also noticed in your lordships house that there are some strange forms of dress which creep in from time to time but they do not seem to lower the standard of debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have any figures available on that but in may advice from the advisory committee on the supply and education of teachers pointed to a considerable reduction in the overall need for newly trained teachers following a sharp fall in the school population <e> <s> the primary and secondary intakes now proposed for england and wales for the years and will produce a total number of places in which will be about per cent <e> <s> less than was intended when the present system was designed <e> <s> it is not acceptable that the reductions should be absorbed by leaving the same number of institutions to provide the same number of courses but with smaller groups of students <e> <s> even in there were several course options followed by only one or two students and that cannot make educational or economic sense <e> <s> we believe that it was right to create larger teaching groups in some institutions even though that meant that others would lose courses or cease to provide initial training altogether <e> <s> so the noble lord lord hatch is quite right it is the governments intention to cut down as indeed the school population falls <e>", "<cs> my lords the school admission provisions of the education act apply to all local education authorities in respect of admissions in september and subsequently <e> <s> while some complaints alleging that the act was not being operated properly have been received by the government none has so far been found to be substantiated <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only repeat that none of these allegations has in fact been substantiated <e> <s> obviously in the first year of any new plan there are teething troubles and i hope that these will be sorted out in future years <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is fair to say that every single possible closure is treated on its merits <e> <s> some schools obviously will have to be closed because of falling numbers and some may well stay open <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is a fairly obvious point that in any rural area there is going to be a lot less choice than in an urban area <e> <s> obviously i do not know the details but most local education authorities probably agree that if there is a place in the school and if the parents are prepared to take their children there then they will make parental choice available but they are not very often prepared to transport the children to schools beyond the one that is the nearest <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord lord wallace has any details of individual cases i shall be interested to hear them if he will write to me <e>", "<cs> my lords if there were to be pupil choice i do not know whether you would have toddlers of two or three saying that they did not like to go to their particular playgroup <e> <s> presumably when the parents do go they talk to their children and i should imagine try to ascertain which school they would rather go to <e> <s> it would be difficult to bring in legislation where you had the pupil choosing the school rather than the parents <e>", "<cs> my lords the government do not collect detailed information about the curriculum provided in individual schools but we have made it clear that we expect local education authorities governing bodies and schools to live up to their statutory responsibilities for the provision of religious education <e>", "<cs> my lords her majestys inspectorate of schools are extremely busy <e> <s> i think that there are some schools or is it <e> <s> i shall have to write to my noble friend regarding that figure <e> <s> the inspectors gets round on average to each school about every years so it would take them an awful long time to find out what is happening <e>", "<cs> my lords i can tell the right reverend prelate that there is no such grant for producing a new syllabus but many authorities are doing it at this very time and i think a number of authorities are engaged in producing new agreed syllabuses <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to say that i found myself in the same position as the noble lord lord blyton in that i also was involved in getting an agreed syllabus when i was a member of an education committee <e> <s> it was a long and complicated task <e> <s> but i understand that things are a bit easier these days and it is something which is not too difficult to obtain now <e>", "<cs> my lords i suppose that that could be the case <e> <s> i should like to say that every school in england and wales does provide religious education <e> <s> on the other hand the government very much hope that they will <e>", "<cs> my lords the government consider that moral education is an essential constituent of the school curriculum <e> <s> perhaps i might be permitted to quote from the school curriculum document which says <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for making that point my lords <e> <s> i think that perhaps we should be careful when using the word christian in this context it is not in the act <e> <s> religious education is but christian education specifically is not <e> <s> i would say that what my noble friend says is obviously very true that the example of a teachers behaviour particularly applying to moral perhaps rather more than religious education is most important <e> <s> as for training i understand that last october there were about newly-trained religious education teachers without posts which shows that if there are vacancies they can be filled by appropriately qualified teachers <e>", "<cs> i am no lawyer my lords so i think it would be best if i read from the act <e> <s> section refers to religious instruction and says <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we shall get very involved if i try to answer two questions at once <e> <s> to answer my noble friend lord eccles i was not here in and i was not responsible for the wording of the act <e> <s> whatever the spirit of the act we have had this argument many times in relation to many measures in your lordships house when certain words are not included in an act the statute can be interpreted only in the way it is worded i personally would love to see christian education taught in every school in the country but whether or not that is practicable i do not know <e> <s> of course the choice is open to many parents to send their children to an aided school where they can get the teaching of their particular denomination <e>", "<cs> my lords there seems to be an awful misunderstanding about what the act actually says <e> <s> it does not say that all children in every school should be taught religious education <e> <s> it says that religious education shall be taught in every school and it does not specify the amount of hours or number of children who will be taught it <e> <s> it is easy to ask me why i cannot produce the figures <e> <s> somebody could get up next week and ask me how many schools in the country are teaching german french spanish or whatever we should need an army of civil servants going round every school finding out these very detailed facts <e>", "<cs> that is a very fair question my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord lord alexander of potterhill for saying that which is of course true <e> <s> i think that what my noble friend lord sandford is saying is that not every child in every school is being given religious education but that is really not the point <e> <s> it is very difficult to prove or disprove whether religious education is playing some part in the curriculum <e> <s> there may not even be a class for religious education but it may come into the teaching of morals english or history <e> <s> it would be very difficult to prove in a court case that religious education was not given <e> <s> however if any noble lord wishes to bring forward examples of schools where it is not taking place i should be delighted to take them up with my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat a statement being made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for education and science <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful both to the noble baroness lady david and to the noble lord lord beaumont of whitley for the way that they have received this white paper <e> <s> i was particularly pleased about the way that lady david began her remarks <e> <s> she asked me a number of questions in fairly rapid succession <e> <s> i apologise if i do not have the answers to all of them <e> <s> i shall certainly write if there are some that i miss out <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord kilmarnock for those remarks <e> <s> i really do not have any more to say about the million which as i mentioned to the noble baroness lady david is being specifically spent for in-service training <e> <s> so far as teachers in the rural areas are concerned i really cannot give an undertaking as regards that <e> <s> there are some scattered rural areas where however much the numbers go down we must have a school and where we have a school we must have a teacher <e>", "<cs> my lords my chief memory of that interview is that i was absolutely terrified and the noble baroness lady bacon as always was absolutely charming and put me at ease <e> <s> but to spring that one on me at this stage is something of a fast ball <e> <s> again as i have said the pupil/teacher ratios have in fact never been better than they are at this moment <e> <s> obviously numbers are falling and teachers have to go but the ratios are better than in the days when i came to see the noble baroness in her office <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend lord eccles for those remarks <e> <s> yes the facts he gives are absolutely right <e> <s> as i have said there are in england and wales teachers <e> <s> it is to try and improve the standards that this white paper has been produced <e> <s> it is very much the policy of this government to try to improve the standards in our schools and one of the ways in which to do this is to try to improve the standards of the teachers in those schools <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord davies of leek could never have taught me because i would not have understood half the words he used he is way above my head <e> <s> but yes i think that there is a great deal of sense in what he says <e> <s> having read this white paper and like other noble lords i have not had very long to study it as i understand it the aim is to try to teach teachers how to teach <e> <s> i think that that is a very important point <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord nugent for raising that point <e> <s> yes this is very much some of our thinking <e> <s> in fact i was aware of some of the things that were to be included in the white paper but i was not allowed to mention them <e> <s> one thing i wanted to say then was that the whole area of teachers and what they teach is a matter that will be closely examined as will be the subject matters that teachers will teach <e> <s> the whole idea of this is not only to improve the teaching of religious education but to improve the quality of teaching of all sorts of subjects <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i shall have to write to the noble baroness on both those points <e> <s> as i understand it consultation has taken place and is continuing to take place <e> <s> as regards the extra million i shall have to write to the noble baroness about that <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said to the noble baroness lady david in answer to a supplementary question which she asked me on th march it is no part of government policy that the school meals service should be abolished <e> <s> public expenditure forecasts adequately provide for its continuation <e> <s> it is however a matter for individual local education authorities to determine whether they wish to provide a paid meals service <e> <s> equally it is for individual authorities to determine what arrangements are made for the supervision of pupils at midday in the light of their general responsibilities <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the provision of school meals is concerned to date only three local education authorities dorset herefordshire and worcestershire and lincolnshire have abolished paid meals and then only in primary schools <e> <s> the merton authority plan to abolish their paid meals service in both primary and secondary schools as from september of this year <e> <s> however the government are not aware of any other authorities which intend to abolish paid meals <e> <s> so far as concerns the question of dealing if that is the right word with the children who get free meals obviously this is a sensitive issue <e> <s> it is for individual schools to work out how they are going to do it <e> <s> again it is up to the local education authorities themselves to say how the children are supervised during meal times <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously children go and find their meals elsewhere even where education authorities are providing a full school meals service <e> <s> a survey of the school meals service is being conducted but which authorities have taken part is confidential <e> <s> i could not say whether the survey includes the three authorities i have named which have cut down on their school meals service <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a statutory duty on all authorities to provide free meals for those entitled to them <e> <s> as to whether packed meals are cheaper or more expensive than centrally cooked meals i am afraid i am not in a position to answer but presumably merton think that they must be otherwise they would not be doing it <e>", "<cs> my lords this is very much up to the mothers <e> <s> in fact before they made this decision the majority of school children in merton were bringing their meals with them anyway <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that we went over this ground about a fortnight ago <e> <s> the whole idea is that poorer children are provided with free meals <e> <s> that is the whole reason behind the governments thinking <e>", "<cs> my lords it is up to anyone to suggest that if anything is cut pressures are bound to be there <e> <s> it is the feeling on our side of the house that cuts have to be made in some shape or form and this is one of the alternatives available <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a matter of the noble lords opinion as opposed to my opinion <e>", "<cs> my lords it does not permit the ending of school meals to children who deserve them most <e>", "<cs> my lords i really must argue this with the noble lord lord glenamara <e> <s> it will cost about million to introduce free school meals for every child in the country and i do not think that even the noble lord lord glenamara is suggesting that <e> <s> there is money available for local education authorities who wish to provide a meals service <e> <s> in fact some two-thirds of local education authorities in this country are providing a school meals service free even to children above the base limit <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that i answered this on th march when i said two things <e> <s> first that there is a survey being done on this which will be available next year <e> <s> also there is no nutrition in food that is being wasted and a great deal of food was being wasted before this legislation was passed <e>", "<cs> my lords as my right honourable friend the secretary of state has said elsewhere he is considering vouchers as a means of extending parental choice and responsibility in education and has yet to reach any conclusions <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the voucher scheme is still very much in the preliminary stage and i would not like to say if my right honourable friend has considered whether or not the private sector would come into it <e> <s> but of course i would say that any voucher scheme would require amending legislation and obviously would also cause additional expenditure <e> <s> the matter of additional expenditure must be considered in the context of any commensurate benefits that it would bring <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that that is a somewhat hypothetical question as i do not believe there are any proposals at this moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that my noble friend has made a very valid point <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that that is yet again a hypothetical question <e> <s> as i said in an earlier reply i imagine that legislation would be needed <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the act has gone quite a long way in providing parental choice <e> <s> whether it has gone far enough is i think one of the questions being looked at <e>", "<cs> my lords her majestys government support the plowden committees views on the value of nursery education <e> <s> as was the case with our predecessors the economic circumstances that have prevailed since the mid-s prevent us from achieving the committees targets <e> <s> nevertheless the number of children in nursery schools and nursery classes in england has continued to grow from some in to over in and the proportion of three and four year-olds receiving nursery education in was per cent <e> <s> the highest ever <e> <s> the governments expenditure plans continue to allow for a gradual increase in the number of places available <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that i told the noble lord in my original answer that the proportion of three and four year-olds receiving nursery education in was per cent <e> <s> i am quite certain that the plowden committee when it made its report could not have foreseen the oil crises that hit us in the s and the consequent fact that we had to cut our cloth to suit our condition in life <e> <s> the public expenditure white paper assumes a fall in total provision for under-fives in england from in to in <e> <s> an underlying assumption is however that numbers of nursery pupils will rise slowly <e> <s> numbers of under-fives admitted early to primary infant classes are expected to fall quite steeply in fact they have fallen each year since and to outweigh the expected rise in nursery pupil numbers <e>", "<cs> i would certainly agree with that my lords and that is very much being encouraged at the present time <e>", "<cs> the wisdom of my right honourable friend the prime minister is great indeed but i believe that even she could hardly have been expected to have seen in what was going to happen to oil prices and the world economy during the s <e> <s> the noble lord lord hatch of lusby has asked so many questions that it is difficult to answer them all <e> <s> he has been on again about the expenditure plans in the white paper <e> <s> the expenditure plans provide for some fall in the total expenditure on all provisions for the under-fives <e> <s> this reflects the current fall in the number of four year-olds being admitted early to primary schools and does not have to mean a drop in the level of nursery education provision <e> <s> as i said in my original answer there is a gradual increase in the amount of nursery provision being provided in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge for affording us an opportunity to discuss this very important question of the level of library provision in universities colleges and polytechnics and in the public library service <e> <s> i think that at the beginning the noble lord lord donaldson said that this was not to be a battle tonight but perhaps a preliminary skirmish where we see where the troops are deployed <e> <s> i am not going to take any of the lines of defence which the noble lord thought that i should be taking <e> <s> i am going to produce some figures of my own which i think show a slight difference from what he and the noble baroness lady david and the noble lord lord wolfenden mentioned <e> <s> if he thinks that this is something of a display of the ammunition that might be used in a future battle i hope that he is wrong and that the future battle does not take place <e>", "<cs> no my lords i am not saying that that is true <e> <s> there is a trend and it may well be downwards but i would take issue with whether it is quite so downwards and quite so steep as some of the figures mentioned by noble lords would suggest <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that i take the noble baronesss word for that <e> <s> i hope she is not trying to blame that on this government <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord kilmarnock for affording us this opportunity for a brief exchange of views on a subject continuing education which is rightly of concern not only to this house but to many well-informed interests outside it <e> <s> social and economic changes largely related to the accelerating pace of technological development have brought about a much wider recognition of the need for education to be seen as a process which should continue in one way or another throughout adult life and not as a once-for-all process to be cut off abruptly when the individual reaches some point in his mid to late teens or if he is relatively lucky his early twenties <e>", "<cs> my lords i am always very baffled about this because summertime started yesterday and it rather intrigues me therefore as to whether we only get six days of spring but i do not think that the beginning of summertime necessarily heralds the beginning of summer <e> <s> i cannot give a more definite answer than that to the noble lord i am afraid <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the university grants committee has decided to make an adjustment in its grant allocations to seven universities in the light of their levels of student intake <e> <s> the government are content that the committee should take what action it considers necessary to protect academic standards and the overall balance of provision <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it and i have no reason to doubt it all the universities were informed <e> <s> in fact ugc wrote on th december to universities and the other three obviously met the criteria <e> <s> i understand that all the seven i mentioned in my original answer were written to on th december <e> <s> as far as government policy is concerned it is to try to provide education at this level for everybody but a lot of people find difficulty in getting into the first university of their choice <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it they were indeed warned that this would happen that the fact that they were prepared to take this number of extra students would obviously have an effect on what was going to happen to them for the next three years <e> <s> i think it fair to point out that there is a lot of talk about penalties and fines but in fact the ugc has decided to make an adjustment in grant which will not be more than the additional fee income the universities concerned are receiving in respect of the extra students they have admitted <e> <s> so i do not think it can be described as anything too punitive <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no evidence of the letter to which my noble friend refers but although i am not in a position to dispute this i should be very surprised because one of the points of the ugcs letter was that the whole point of this was to aid research <e> <s> i hope that they took this into account <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think it is a question of a few extra students <e> <s> in fact the degree to which each university is over-recruited above the steady-state intake that the ugc estimates each institution needs in order to reach its target varies from per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said earlier i do not think that every student in this country can get into the university of their first choice <e> <s> this happens on a very large scale <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i shall have to write to the noble lord with that information <e>", "<cs> my lords it might be a disadvantage to them <e> <s> i would go as far as saying that <e>", "<cs> my lords this decision has been taken by the university grants committee and not by the government <e> <s> but i think we should get this into perspective <e> <s> i think it is per cent <e> <s> of the age range of to years old who are participating in higher education <e> <s> this rate has increased steadily under this government despite the fact that the size of the relevant age group has been increasing <e> <s> i think that it might not be a bad thing to point out that spending on higher education and research in was about billion <e> <s> i use the expression billion as meaning one thousand million <e> <s> the departments programmes provide for billion more to be spent on higher education and research this year than was spent in <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos i really thought i had answered the question <e> <s> the ugc wrote on th december <e> <s> it then considered the responses that <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the whole thing in fact arose from what the numbers were going to be in or was it <e> <s> i think it was <e> <s> the ugc wrote to the universities concerned at the end of seeking information about their intakes for and their plans for reducing their and intakes consistent with achieving their targets by <e> <s> having considered the universities responses the ugc decided that the intake patterns for these universities indicated that they were likely to exceed their targets by a substantial margin <e> <s> the committee therefore decided to make a small adjustment in their grant <e> <s> however the ugc has said that it will be studying the intake numbers for october before making any revision of the recurrent grants announced in february <e>", "<cs> my lords this is not collected centrally <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the vandalism is really the responsibility of the individual local education authorities <e> <s> i should have thought that at the present time they would be rather loath to part with any of their money in order to sponsor anything in the local media <e> <s> but i thoroughly agree with my noble friend that any good publicity about things that are going right is very worth while <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord has hit one very good point on the head in that the figures referred to in the question are not collected nationally because it is very difficult to establish first what is and what is not vandalism and secondly who is responsible <e> <s> i can draw your lordships attention to a very useful document entitled <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is rather sad that i have to wait until the last day before the recess before i can say that i agree wholeheartedly with every word that the noble lord lord molloy says in one of his supplementary questions <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i have not the least idea of the answer to the supplementary question of my noble kinsman nor can i give any undertaking to write to her because as i said in my original reply these facts and figures are not centrally collected <e>", "<cs> my lords at a convenient moment after pm <e> <s> i shall with the leave of the house repeat a statement to be made in another place on overseas students awards <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat a statement being made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for education and science <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble baroness lady david and the noble lord lord gladwyn for listening to this statement <e> <s> i am rather surprised by the attitude which the noble baroness took about this <e> <s> the advice to local authorities on the interpretation of ordinary residence which the house of lords rejected was in fact given in by the previous administration <e> <s> i did not expect

<s> only the courts can provide an authoritative view of the law <e> <s> this the house of lords has now done overturning along the way not only the departments advice of but also the views of lower courts in the same cases <e> <s> i do not think there is anything for either the department or for this government to apologise about <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have thought that parents who could afford to send their children to eton or harrow could probably well afford to pay the full prices of further education in this country <e> <s> we must bear in mind that mainly it is children of this type that we are talking about <e> <s> we are talking about pupils from abroad i see the noble baroness lady jeger shaking her head but yes this is what this is about <e> <s> this is about the parents of children who have decided to send their children to be educated privately in this country mainly and have then decided that because of this they are entitled to get mandatory awards for their children <e> <s> the fact that they can afford to send their children to school here must mean that they can afford to pay their fees and the small amount of money that we can afford should go to those who are in greatest need <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear that my repetition of my right honourable friends statement must have been incomprehensible or badly put because the one thing that this judgment is not doing is saving us money <e> <s> it is costing us a lot of money because until the judgment it was considered that students who came over here for school and a-level courses were not ordinarily resident in this country and therefore they were not entitled to the mandatory grants <e> <s> now we find because of the house of lords judgment that there may be considerable and i say considerable i do not know the details of figures claims for money that they should have been paid at the time <e> <s> i fear there is not going to be anything in the kitty to distribute <e> <s> it is going to be a question of trying to find something in the kitty to pay for these students <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i cannot answer that <e> <s> this is quite different <e> <s> we had a long debate on this and my noble friend lord belstead answered for the government <e> <s> this is a completely different set of circumstances <e> <s> this is to do with people living abroad who choose to

reports are being published <e> <s> i think they are a very splendid body of people and thank goodness they are independent <e>", "<cs> my lords i think if that were the case the answer is that it

opportunities outside the governing body for the student-pupil voice to be heard in committees and elsewhere <e> <s> in many secondary schools for example there is a school council <e>", "<cs> my

increase in the efforts to ensure that governors are well versed in their responsibilities <e> <s> as a contribution towards this the department of education and science sponsored an open university

parcels of land which the tenant rents perhaps from different landlords which i believe is the very case my noble friend was mentioning <e> <s> i should have thought that in that situation it would be wrong to interfere in a way which would make the total holding non-viable <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will withdraw his amendment <e> <s> i shall have to read what was said because although i stated that i found his explanation very helpful it has confused me all the more <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to ask the noble lord to give way but i am sure that if he and i travel in the same

not sure about the curriculum but i can assure the noble baroness that one of the ideas behind continuous assessment is that when pupils do not attain any sort of qualification their progress through

lords i must tell the noble lord lord shinwell that that is well wide of the original question <e> <s> the question is about the <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i will give that undertaking <e>", "<cs>

requests for special treatment for handicapped candidates <e> <s> their guiding principle is that the needs of the individual must he taken into account in each case <e> <s> so far as special arrangements are concerned for candidates who suffer from such things as dyslexia deafness or blindness this will depend to some extent on the board concerned and the subject being examined <e> <s> some examples of special arrangements include the use of an amanuensis a typewriter braille tests reading aloud in tests for lip reading and provision of extra time to complete papers <e>", "<cs> my lords i repeat that this is a question about and year-olds and i think that the noble lords question is very wide of what is on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a very interesting point which i shall bring to the attention of my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> because of the way in which ec education grants are disbursed the information is most conveniently given for the academic years august to july <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for not asking a supplementary question <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not i am afraid have that information <e> <s> either i can write to the noble baroness or if she wishes to put down a question for written answer i shall be happy to reply <e>", "<cs> my lords i imagine that is the case but if i am wrong i shall write to the noble lord about it <e>", "<cs> my lords the united kingdom participates fully in the eecs education co-operation programme and receives its full share of the allocations <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i must point out to the noble lord that it is quite in order to ask questions of a minister after he has made a statement but it is not in order to turn the matter into a general debate <e>", "<cs> my lords we are running into great trouble here as i said earlier to the noble lord <e> <s> lord molloy it is quite in order to ask the minister questions on the statement that he has made

suggest that we do not resume the committee stage of this bill before oclock <e> <s> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now adjourn during pleasure until eight oclock <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> lord john-mackie for explaining the purpose of this amendment and i am also very grateful to my noble friend lord middleton for pointing out the tax disadvantage as regards vat <e> <s> i feel that while the regulations prescribe an allocation of liability between landlord and tenant for maintenance repair and insurance of fixed equipment the question of any variation from that allocation of liabilities is a matter for negotiation between landlord and tenant <e> <s> also the terms of the contract of tenancy are a relevant factor which must be taken into account in any arbitration on rent <e> <s> i am sure that we should not interfere with the provisions in the legislation by a departure from the terms of the regulations and i hope that the noble lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> until the noble lord <e> <s> lord northfield got up i really thought that i would simply have to get up and say that the government agree with what everybody else has said <e> <s> but i see that now i shall have to take a little time <e> <s> i have of course listened most carefully to the reasoning of my noble kinsman lord caithness in introducing this amendment but it seems to me as it does to a number of noble lords who have spoken in this debate that the amendment has some highly undesirable features <e>", "<cs> if i may deal with the noble lord lord northfield first <e> <s> basically yes he is correct in what he says but i shall not give any undertaking to consider smallholdings in any great detail before report <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> this amendment has at first sight a good deal to recommend it and indeed the last part was an agreed proposal of the ministry-nfu-cla-rics working party <e> <s> however as my noble friend lord stanley of alderley said on close examination practical difficulties over timing make the realisation of this proposal difficult <e> <s> in the case of some tenancies particularly michaelmas tenancies there may well be insufficient time for the tenant to make proposals for cropping in the final year for the landlord to have a chance to consider them and for an arbitration to be arranged and take place bearing in mind that days must be allowed for delivery of statements of case alone unless the notice to quit is given well ahead of the beginning of the final year of tenancy <e> <s> but i believe that the landlord will usually for the sake of good relations delay giving notice until the last year is about to begin <e> <s> it is likely therefore that the crops will often have to be planted i am thinking particularly of winter wheat barley and oil seed rape before the arbitrator can make his award <e> <s> this leaves the only remedy as monetary compensation for the tenant should his proposals be upheld which is not a matter referred to specifically in the amendment and which may seem a rather severe penalty for a landlord who has done no more than rely on the terms of the tenancy agreement albeit perhaps an old-fashioned one <e>", "<cs> while i applaud my noble kinsmans search for clarity in legislation i feel that the present wording in the bill is clear enough <e> <s> surely if the landlord and tenant agree there is no dispute and therefore no need for arbitration <e> <s> i hope my noble friend will withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i will read from the <e>", "<cs> my lords before i move the adjournment of the house i am sure that it will be the wish of your lordships that i on behalf of all noble

lords my first and very pleasant task at the end of what i think everyone will agree has been a most interesting debate is to congratulate the noble baroness lady lockwood on her performance from the dispatch box opposite <e> <s> the noble baroness lady david was kind enough to congratulate me on starting on my first bill in this house <e> <s> i think life is seldom fair <e> <s> when i look across and see the two charming and eloquent noble baronesses both speaking against me from the dispatch box i think that perhaps i have a very good case to take before the equal opportunities commission and i think it might well come down on my side <e> <s> however it is a pleasure to see the noble baroness lady lockwood and i hope she enjoys her work on the other side of the table <e>", "<cs> you asked for it <e> <s> this bill should not be taken to imply a desire to impose central governments views on local government that is not its purpose <e> <s> it really is not some vehicle for my right honourable friend to achieve that <e>", "<cs> my lords section of the education act requires local education authorities to secure the provision for their area of adequate facilities for further education in accordance with a scheme of further education <e> <s> section requires that they secure provision in schools for full-time education suitable to the requirements of pupils up to the age of other than such full-time education as <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree at least partly with what the noble baroness has said <e> <s> i accept that the position of the to year-old further education student is anomalous in that the home authority is obliged to pay the cost of provision at a college maintained by another authority only if they have given prior approval for that provision <e> <s> the government are committed to increasing freedom of choice wherever possible <e> <s> this is one of the matters which are being considered by my right honourable friend the secretary of state in response to the review of further education law <e>", "<cs> my lords i could press for all i am worth but whether or not anyone would take any notice is another matter <e> <s> there are other priorities for legislation as i indicated in response to a question from the noble baroness on th october <e> <s> however my right honourable friend is addressing the underlying issues of the efficiency and effectiveness of the further education system by other means <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot tell the house how and in what form my right honourable friend will make his statement <e> <s> however if it is in the form of a statement in another place it is customary that i should repeat it in this house <e> <s> i can give no undertaking however on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords if i suggested that the position was going to be changed i gave the wrong impression <e> <s> i did not say that <e> <s> i said that my right honourable friend was looking at the possibility of change which is a different matter <e> <s> yes i agree that the position is anomalous and that it is difficult <e> <s> at the same time the system is working <e> <s> i do not believe that there are any very great difficulties <e> <s> that is the only undertaking i can give to the noble lord and to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords local authorities are expected to assess the individual needs of each handicapped young person and to take into account special factors that refer to that individual young person <e> <s> they have the power to provide for young people beyond the age of as well as for those up to that age and they have discretionary powers to provide financial support for any student in further education <e> <s> whether authorities send them in fact elsewhere i should not like to say <e> <s> there are local authorities and local authorities <e>", "<cs> i think that this might be a convenient time to take the statement and so i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords individual schools have a duty in law under the education school information regulations to provide parents and others with information on examination results and other matters <e> <s> if my noble friend is aware of any schools failing in this duty i hope that he will bring them to my attention <e>", "<cs> my lords i should think rather a long time <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> of course the original question is very much part of this <e> <s> a requirement to publish information is part of the package of measures intended to help parents make informed choices in regard to schools for

do not think i can help the house <e> <s> if the noble lord lord alexander does not understand it i am quite certain i do not <e>", "<cs> my lords something i must admit straight away is that it comes as no surprise to me whatsoever that these regulations have been received quite as they have by noble lords opposite <e> <s> i am rather surprised though that they persist in their opposition to this scheme <e> <s> it is now into its third year and its success and popularity are transparent <e> <s> noble lords opposite have often enough complained about the exclusivity of public schools <e> <s>

additional million next year <e> <s> if i am wrong i will write to the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord prys-davies for his question and to the other noble

speech that he did in the circumstances i am most grateful to him <e>", "<cs> my lords i think if the noble and learned lord listens to the rest of my speech he will find out what i think about these matters <e> <s> my right honourable friend thought for a long time before he accepted the abrcs advice and i think as my noble friend lord selborne said there was no great outcry when that advice was tendered to my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall have to write to the noble lord on that <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall come to cutting out the barley if the noble lord lord hooson will bear with me <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall have to have another look at my figures <e> <s> as i shall say in answer to a question later the savings in barley will be used to support new work on hill farms <e> <s> if the noble lord will be patient again all will be explained <e> <s> perhaps i am turning into a conjuror as the noble viscount said and at the end everything will come out <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord doubts it <e> <s> several noble lords have mentioned the fact that the principality is famous for its hill farming <e> <s> i think that my noble friend lord gibson-watt and the noble lord lord hooson declared an interest in that both benefit from it <e> <s> i think that the noble lord lord hooson said that it is a country that depends so much on grasses

powys <e> <s> the farm will be used for new work on pastures animal performance and systems studies jointly with the hill farming research organisation in edinburgh <e> <s> the importance which the council attaches to this new initiative is evidenced by the supplementation of the stations budget this year by for setting up costs together wth for farm buildings <e> <s> in further sums are being allocated for these purposes <e> <s> i understand that the ministry of agriculture also intends to redeploy money saved from the cessation of the stations spring barley programme to support this new programme <e>", "<cs> my lords the importance that the afrc attaches to the new work on hill and upland pastures is evidenced by the supplementation of the wpbs cash limit by for setting-up costs together with an additional for farm buildings <e> <s> similarly in the sum of is being allocated for further setting-up costs and about for farm buildings roadways <e>", "<cs> yes my lords from the facts that i have given that seems to be the case but i am not absolutely certain <e> <s> i may be wrong in which case i will have to write to the noble lord <e> <s> the figures that i read out seemed to be more of a capital nature <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i think i was <e> <s> in trying to answer noble lords questions i have got into a bit of a muddle here with all the papers <e> <s> i think that i have answered the first and second questions of the noble lord lord prys-davies <e> <s> thirdly he asked when the budget-led cut decisions were proposed <e>", "<cs> my lords the afrc and maff are fully committed to the wpbs new initiative on hills and uplands <e> <s> any requirement for expertise in animal nutrition <e>", "<cs> no my lords i am not going to give way <e> <s> the idea of an unstarred question is that the minister may reply at the end <e> <s> if the matter is put down in the form of a question at question time then i understand that the minister may answer supplementaries <e> <s> but this is being turned into a mixture between the two and i will not give way again <e> <s> i am doing my best to answer the noble lords questions <e>", "<cs> my lords this is one of the first questions i asked when i received my briefing and i found out the reason <e> <s> the reason why there are nine institutes in scotland and only one in wales is mostly historical <e> <s> it was only the good and great sir george stapleton who started one in wales whereas there were nine just men and good who did the same in scotland and in england and that is a fact <e> <s> people may not think it very equitable but had there been some rather more generous landlords or landowners in wales the situation might have been the other way round <e> <s> that is the reason for the budget <e> <s> if you only have one institute you cannot expect to have the same percentage as the in england or nine in scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps some of the reason for this debate is the fact that it was i and not my noble friend lord belstead who spoke about scarcity and appreciable scarcity at the committee stage <e> <s> if noble lords care to consult <e>", "<cs> my lords in fact appreciable scarcity is not in the scottish bill so we are not going the same way <e> <s> it is appreciable in england and wales and just scarcity in scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house as this is the first amendment for which i am responsible there is nothing i would like to do more than give way <e> <s> but i think that this amendment would drive a cart and horses through this bill and i simply cannot give way <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble kinsman for raising this point at committee stage and putting down this amendment again today <e> <s> he is absolutely right <e> <s> it is something that had escaped us <e> <s> clearly where the landlord and tenant agree a reduction in rent in the way suggested by my noble kinsman this should not count for the purposes of the three year-old rule on rent reviews and i am happy to accept this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords this might be a convenient if rather late time to adjourn the report stage of the agricultural holdings bill <e> <s> may i suggest that further consideration on report of the bill shall not be resumed before ten minutes to nine oclock <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to be more helpful to my noble kinsman but i really do feel that the ball is still very much in his court <e> <s> when considering his amendment no <e> <s> a during committee stage it was suggested that if my noble kinsman could indicate what additional factors the tribunal should be expected to take into account the point would be considered further <e> <s> i understand that he wrote a letter to my noble friend lord belstead but he did not produce any more evidence or suggest what additional factors could be taken into account <e>", "<cs> yes my lords the door is always open so far as my noble kinsman is concerned and i am sure we can discuss this further <e> <s> however we should like to have some evidence and hard facts on where it is going wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with interest as always to the noble lord lord northfield but he will not be surprised to learn that i cannot accept his amendment <e> <s> if the proposal is to have any significant effect it would involve substantial government expenditure in the form of purchasing land at vacant possession value for the purpose of letting <e> <s> the governments policy in relation to land held by government departments is to dispose of it where it is not required for departmental purposes very often by sale to the existing tenants <e> <s> therefore there would be little purpose in handing land over to the crown estates <e> <s> it conflicts with the governments policy of disposing of land assets and of not increasing public ownership of land <e> <s> while i realise that the objective is the laudable one of making more land available for letting the noble lords method is i would say almost one of desperation <e> <s> i think the noble lord used the word desperation more than once in introducing the amendment <e> <s> it is very near to land nationalisation and i do not think that at this late hour of the night i need detain your lordships with the governments views on why that is totally unacceptable to the government <e>", "<cs> my lords the government set out their plans for improving the quality of newly-trained teachers in england and wales in the white paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of my noble friends keen interest in the ethnic minorities from her membership of the swann committee <e> <s> she will know that some newly trained teachers are well prepared for teaching in a multi-ethnic community others are less so <e> <s> the draft criteria stressed that potential students should be selected on the basis of personal as well as intellectual qualifications and that courses should prepare them to teach the full range of pupils with their diversity of ethnic and cultural origins <e>", "<cs> my lords it is hoped that advice back from the various bodies concerned will be received by the middle of this month <e> <s> it is also hoped that the new advisory committee will be established as soon as possible after april this year <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble friend lord renton for drawing my attention to that fact <e> <s> i shall indeed take special note of what he has said and see what i can learn from it <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that this is very much the reason for these proposals and consultations <e> <s> the government are determined that the standards shall improve greatly in the future <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> in fact my right honourable friend mentioned this in his much-quoted speech at sheffield in january <e> <s> indeed my right honourable friend intends to ask local authorities in the near future to review the priorities and approaches of their education welfare services <e> <s> these <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give a detailed answer on whether there are more or fewer foreign language teachers <e> <s> i

or to amendment no <e> <s> which has not yet been moved <e> <s> either way he is probably out of order <e>", "<cs> my lords when this was considered in committee my noble friend lord belstead undertook to approach my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor to see whether we could adopt an arrangement on the lines proposed in this amendment <e> <s> i am glad to say that agreement in principle has been reached on this with my noble and learned friend and an amendment will be tabled as soon as possible <e> <s> my noble friends amendment now before the house has certain drafting defects and i hope that in the meantime i can persuade my noble kinsman to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not be tempted to follow the noble lord lord john-mackie and to a certain extent the noble lord lord hooson in another second reading speech in this debate <e> <s> i will just say that as a result of the report stage the bill is now studded with good amendments and improvements made to the bill due to suggestions by noble lords on all sides of the house <e> <s> the main purposes of the bill remain <e> <s> we are ending the iniquitous three-generation succession

amendment very little changed from amendment no <e> <s> moved in committee by my noble friend lord dilhorne <e> <s> as i explained on that occasion the government do not argue with the principle of what my noble friend is attempting to achieve but there are flaws in the method that he proposes to adopt <e> <s> the matter has been given a great deal of thought by the department and by parliamentary counsel and it has not been possible to find a simple formulation which would be equitable to both sides <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will recognise that it is not desirable to add to the complexities of the legislation <e> <s> i hope in the light of these remarks that he will withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may first of all answer the last point raised by the noble lord lord stewart of fulham <e> <s> the whole object of the consultations that are taking place and which it is hoped will take place under the bill and my right honourable friend has already had three meetings with the local authorities associations is to try to reach an agreement on the purposes for which the money should be used under the bill <e> <s> there are so many purposes <e> <s> we shall later come to an amendment which if approved would commit all the money straight away <e> <s> there is no shortage of purposes at all <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble friend for what she has just said <e> <s> one of the dangers of leaning over backwards is that you can get a kick on the backside from time to time and i think that perhaps that is what is happening here <e> <s> this amendment seeks to extend the involvement of the local authority associations in the process of defining what activities will attract education support grant <e>", "<cs> i think the noble lord cannot move the amendment at this stage but he may speak to it <e>", "<cs> these amendments would alter the provision in the bill regarding the rate at which education support grants would be paid <e> <s> it may be helpful if i explained the thinking behind the present provision <e> <s> the bill provides that grants shall be payable at such a rate not exceeding per cent <e> <s> of approved expenditure as may be specified in regulations <e> <s> the bill sets no lower limit on the rate but during the debate on second reading i indicated that the rate is unlikely to be set below per cent <e> <s> so in practice the rate of grant is likely to be in the range between per cent <e> <s> and per cent <e> <s> of the expenditure to be supported <e> <s> the bill allows for the possibility that different rates of grant may be paid on different activities <e>", "<cs> i thought i made it clear in my speech that there will be different rates envisaged for different projects under the regulations <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend once again for pointing that out <e> <s> i must say i was rather intrigued when the noble baroness lady lockwood spoke about a blank cheque of per cent <e> <s> if i was offered a blank cheque of half of one per cent <e> <s> i would not think it was a very good blank cheque <e> <s> i certainly would therefore totally refute the idea that this is a blank cheque <e>", "<cs> it seems common sense when embarking on a new scheme to go fairly softly at first <e> <s> on the other hand this is primary legislation and if we did not have the whole one half of one per cent <e> <s> it would obviously mean coming back with further legislation when the scheme is fully operational <e> <s> i do not see any harm at all in the softly softly catchee monkee approach <e>", "<cs> i am sorry but i think that is rather unfair <e> <s> the noble baroness says that if we ask for consultation and say we want to find out what people want to spend the money on then we have not got any definite plans <e> <s> on the other hand if we do not consult we are told that we are not consulting people and our minds are firmly fixed <e> <s> i do not think the noble baroness can have it both ways <e>", "<cs> the purpose of the noble lords amendment can be met without the need for a special statement by the secretary of state <e> <s> the noble lord is concerned that parliament should know how much had been spent by local authorities on esg activities in say year one when towards the end of year two the rate support grant settlement is considered for year three <e> <s> the rate support grant report for year three will include a figure for the amount of education support grants to be paid in year three and this amount will be deducted from the total amount of exchequer grant in order to calculate the balance of rate support grants <e> <s> from successive rsg reports noble lords will be able to compare the figure for education support grants for successive years as annex b of the rsg report has traditionally listed the totals for each of the specific grants <e>", "<cs> i think we are getting into slightly troubled waters <e> <s> as i understand it a sum of money will be made available for the education support grant scheme <e> <s> money that is not claimed by local authorities for the use of that scheme will go back into the general rate support grant <e> <s> what we are talking about here as i understand it is money that authorities say they will spend on the scheme <e> <s> then for some reason they change their mind and find they cannot <e> <s> i believe that is what we are arguing about <e> <s> i am trying to catch the eye of the noble lord lord kilmarnock to see whether he would nod at me or shake his head but i cannot do it <e>", "<cs> i can assure the noble lord lord alexander of potterhill that whatever it was he said has been done to the act has not been done to it <e>", "<cs> this amendment would ensure that expenditure supported by education support grants should be disregarded when comparing an authoritys total expenditure with its expenditure target <e> <s> noble lords will be aware that under the arrangements proposed for if an authority exceeds its target it will incur penalties by the hold-back of block grant <e> <s> however i should remind noble lords that the government have not yet decided about the future of expenditure targets beyond <e> <s> the earliest date for the introduction of education support grants is <e> <s> therefore it is a little premature to consider the relationship of education support grants to targets and penalties <e>", "<cs> during the debate on second reading the noble baroness lady david referred to what she considered to be the general shortcomings in the use of secondary legislation and her noble friend has referred to them again this evening <e> <s> as i said in my speech on second reading i could see their point but this is a fact of life <e> <s> if the unfortunate position ever arose and one of the noble baronesses found herself speaking from this dispatch box i am sure that she would be stating my point of view which is that it is a fact of life and it is one of the avenues that is open to the government <e>", "<cs> i cannot add very much to what i have said which is that the statement will set out in more detail the activities it was proposed should be supported and the reasons behind the proposals <e> <s> that is all i can say on that <e>", "<cs> we have had a full debate upon the role of the educational interests in the planning of education support grants <e> <s> i hope i have made clear that my right honourable friend will consider carefully all points which may be put to him <e> <s> however the present amendment would go further than this by establishing the right of other bodies besides the local authority associations to be formally consulted before regulations are made <e> <s> i do not believe this is necessary <e> <s> the local authorities have a special position as the recipients of the grants and their interests are safeguarded in the bill <e> <s> i have made clear the governments readiness to consider views from other quarters but to establish the general right of consultation envisaged in the amendment would go too far <e> <s> i should remind noble lords that such provision does not appear in legislation governing other specific grants involving considerably larger sums of money <e> <s> i would ask the noble lord to withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> this has been a very interesting debate <e> <s> i think that i need hardly add to what noble lords have said that the effect on the bill <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble kinswoman for that advice <e> <s> i am also very grateful for the compliment that she paid me earlier on <e> <s> i thought that it might look like a put-up job so i was not going to say anything about it <e> <s> but of course i shall draw her points to the attention of my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> if i may deal with the last question first i believe it is fair to say that our children take after their mother rather than their father when it comes to mathematics <e>", "<cs> like my noble friend lady cox i understand the intention behind the amendment which i take to be the desire to make education support grants as effective as possible by involving all interested parties in the administration but i do not believe that an advisory board is necessary or desirable <e> <s> during the course of these debates this afternoon i have repeated over and over again the assurance that the government will listen to the views of all those who have responsibilities within education <e>", "<cs> i am enormously impressed by the ingenuity of the noble baroness opposite who has somehow managed to get a debate on all sorts of mandatory awards on what is after all a pure and simple technicality in clause <e>", "<cs> my lords between and pupil to teacher ratios within primary schools in the united kingdom improved from to to to and the pupil to teacher ratio within secondary schools improved from to to to my right honourable friends expect the figures for to show a further slight improvement <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful for my noble friends first supplementary question <e> <s> i think it deserves to be more widely appreciated that the ratio of pupils to teachers has improved in every year since this government took office <e> <s> to answer my noble friends second supplementary question i think that the standard of teaching depends on many other factors besides the pupil to teacher ratio <e> <s> in restructuring the teacher training system the government sought a closer match between the qualifications of new teachers and the needs of schools <e> <s> we have made additional provision for the further training of serving teachers <e> <s> we propose to raise standards in initial training through the establishment of a council for the accreditation of teacher education and through criteria against which the council would assess training courses <e> <s> i hope that all this will equip teachers to teach everything better including the three rs <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure what the noble lord lord taylor of blackburn is asking for <e> <s> if he is asking for the ratio in private schools i shall have to write to him <e> <s> i do not have those figures with me <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but against that must be considered the far fewer numbers of pupils in school <e> <s> we cannot employ every trained teacher that would cause no end of problems and some of those teachers may be less well-equipped to teach than others <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i could give that commitment <e> <s> wherever possible the government are committed to getting children with special educational needs into ordinary schools and that we shall continue to do <e> <s> but there will obviously also be a need to allow those children who for some reason or another are not fit to attend ordinary school to continue to be educated in special schools <e>", "<cs> my lords i could not confirm that without notice <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord would like to contribute to that in some way perhaps we could follow his example <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe it is true that the fall in the pupil population since has itself required some improvement in pupil to teacher ratio in order to sustain a constant staffing standard in the schools <e> <s> but the improvement which has actually taken place is more than enough for that purpose <e> <s> therefore in spite of the falling rolls the pupil-teacher ratio is better <e> <s> i am afraid that i have no knowledge of any particular authorities and how much they are doing <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it all depends on individual circumstances <e> <s> there is going to be no block move as it were to take them all into employment as teachers <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i can give that assurance <e>", "<cs> yes my lords they do indeed <e> <s> i have full details here and i could read them out but that would take rather a long time <e> <s> historically overall pupil-teacher ratios have been lower in scotland than in england and the governments expediture plans envisage some convergence <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that information <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it will be a mixture of both <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord for offering a helping hand but i think that the helping hand is unecessary <e> <s> i shall once again try to explain to him just what the situation is and i apologise for the fact that i was unable to satisfy him during the committee stage that his amendment is unnecessary <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house yes the noble baronesss first point is quite true <e> <s> if million is put aside and only million is put in for by the local authority that will go back into the rate support grant in general and into the pool <e> <s> as regards the carry-over there is a distinction between the grant payable in respect of a year and the grant payable in that year <e> <s> this is because we envisage that grants will be paid in arrears for example at the end of each quarter <e> <s> this would mean for example that the final instalment of grant in respect of would be paid in the following financial year but this will not affect the total amount of education support grant payable in respect of <e>", "<cs> my lords i must begin by disagreeing with the noble baroness lady lockwood who said that this subject was touched on briefly at the committee stage <e> <s> i seem to remember that the rate at which the education support grant should be paid was discussed at length during the committee stage <e> <s> i stressed then that setting the rate involved striking a balance between different considerations <e> <s> in the governments view an upper limit of per cent <e> <s> would strike the right balance <e> <s> the noble baroness may prefer a different figure but at the end of the day the choice of an upper limit is a matter of judgment and is necessarily arbitrary <e>", "<cs> my lords at the committee stage we had five new clauses which each proposed that per cent <e> <s> of the expenditure should be <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not going to be drawn tonight into an argument either pro or against comprehensive or selective education because i think that is really with due respect to noble lords opposite pretty well irrelevant to this particular amendment <e> <s> but i should like to remind noble lords that it is neither immoral nor illegal for an authority to have a selective system of secondary education <e> <s> it is for local educational authorities in conjunction with the governors of voluntary aided and special agreement schools to take a view on the form and pattern of secondary education best suited to local circumstances and the preferences of parents <e> <s> if they wish to propose any of the steps set out in sections to of the education act they must publish proposals and go through the relevant statutory procedures <e> <s> subject to certain exceptions those proposals are decided by my right honourable friend <e> <s> in other words the lea proposes and my right honourable friend decides <e> <s> his is a purely reactive role <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord also agree that we should not help those children who are in those schools if they are in need of the money <e> <s> because that is what the amendment proposes <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said when this new clause was debated in committee i understand the intention behind the amendment which i take to be the desire to make education support grants as effective as possible by involving all interested parties in the administration <e> <s> but i do not believe that an advisory body is necessary or desirable <e> <s> the noble baroness lady david asked me how the government intend to find out what people want <e> <s> i can give her an assurance that the government will listen to all those who have responsibilities within education <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house as i said in committee evaluation will be an ongoing concern with much depending on the projects <e> <s> it will be built into the mechanism and that that will take care of itself <e>", "<cs> that will depend on the various projects and in what way the evaluation takes place and whether it will be through research at a university or by a local authority <e> <s> i am speaking again of some million <e> <s> it is not a vast amount of public money <e> <s> the accounts will be there for all to see and i would have thought that it was hardly necessary to produce further details in order to cover the points that the noble lord lord beaumont makes <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness complaining because i did not say that <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a matter for individual local education authorities to determine whether they wish to provide a paid school meals service <e> <s> the government could only intervene if they were failing to comply with the duty placed upon them by section of the education act to provide free of charge in the middle of the day what they consider requisite for pupils whose parents receive supplementary benefit or family income supplement <e> <s> they must also provide without charge facilities for people to consume their own food <e>", "<cs> my lords i said originally that this is a matter for local education authorities <e> <s> as far as hertfordshire is concerned i understand that yesterday they decided to retain their school meals service and to make the necessary savings by changing the conditions of staff by reducing holiday pay <e> <s> the staff have until th april to decide whether to accept the authoritys proposal <e> <s> savings will also be made by reducing pupils entitlement to free school meals to the statutory minimum of receipt of supplementary benefit or family income supplement by the parents <e>", "<cs> yes my lords they do <e> <s> a survey of the dietary intake of schoolchildren has been commissioned by the department of health and social security <e> <s> the result should be available later this year so we shall see <e>", "<cs> my lords that question was more a statement of the personal view held by the noble baroness lady fisher of rednal and does not require my comments upon it <e>", "<cs> my lords if the government were to act then it might be said that we were taking away the right of local authorities to exercise their discretion <e> <s> noble lords opposite cannot have it both ways <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware that this is the th anniversary of that event but i believe that conditions were slightly different so far as childrens health was concerned years ago <e>", "<cs> my lords were we to take away the freedom from local authorities to do what they like with their school meals services we should be open to further accusations <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i do not have any figures about the number of children who arrive at school without having had breakfast <e> <s> i have figures for children who are taking free school meals if that is of interest to my noble friend but i know nothing about their arrangements for breakfast <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble baroness lady david said this amendment differs from those moved at earlier stages in that it defines more precisely the purposes of the advisory body namely to give advice to the secretary of state about the areas of education to be supported by education support grants <e> <s> however i have to say that i still do not regard an advisory committee as necessary or desirable <e> <s> in explaining why this is so i am afraid that i must once again cover ground which i covered at earlier stages <e>", "<cs> my lords i really do not think that i can go over all the arguments again <e> <s> there have been many safeguards written into this bill on all sorts of matters which were worrying local authorities and i do not think that it is necessary to have this extra body and quite honestly i do not think that it would achieve anything <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> this bill has been carefully considered by the house <e> <s> by my reckoning it had been the subject of debate for nearly nine hours before todays proceedings began <e> <s> three former secretaries of state have participated in the debates and for that we are grateful <e> <s> i should express my thanks also most warmly to my noble friend lady cox who have been such a staunch pillar of support at my back <e> <s> i should also like to thank the noble lord lord alexander of potterhill from the cross-benches who with his enormous knowledge of matters educational has lent his weight to the debate <e> <s> it would be churlish of me not to thank the noble lord <e> <s> lord kilmarnock and the noble lord lord beaumont of whitley on the alliance benches who have taken part and finally and certainly not least <e> <s> the two noble baronesses on the front bench opposite who have been so courteous <e> <s> though we disagreed at times as the noble baroness lady david said we seem to have got on fairly amicably across the table <e> <s> my thanks and congratulations too to the noble baroness lady lockwood on this her first effort on a bill from the dispatch box opposite <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the secretary of state for education and science has announced a programme including proposals in relation to the curriculum examinations and teachers designed to improve standards in both primary and secondary schools <e> <s> it is the governments intention to seek a broad consensus about the objectives of each phase and of each subject area of the curriculum what in each needs to be learnt by all pupils and what should additionally be attempted by some <e> <s> my right honourable friend is now discussing these matters with the governments partners in the education service <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree most strongly with what my noble friend says <e> <s> indeed my right honourable friends programme has generally been welcomed by parents employers and the education service <e> <s> i believe that this is because it is the governments overall purpose to seek higher standards <e> <s> our specific target is to bring to per cent <e> <s> of all pupils to the level now achieved by pupils of average ability across a number of subjects <e> <s> a clearer definition of the objectives of the curriculum has an important part to play in that process as do our proposals for an examination system which reflects more closely than the present one what pupils can actually do <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that there is any discrimination in regard to a childs background <e> <s> the curriculum caters for all children <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not altogether agree <e> <s> my right honourable friend has made it clear that we want pupils to be able to demonstrate knowledge skills understanding and judgment in a word competence across a broad curriculum <e> <s> that goes for the working-class child i personally do not like the expression working class and for every type of child in any of our schools <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend is in no way interfering <e> <s> as i said in my original answer his proposals have been generally welcomed and he is consulting with local authorities <e> <s> i do not think that he needs to use any powers whatever to try to encourage a higher standard of education in our schools <e>", "<cs> my lords health education has an important place in preparing young people for personal social and family responsibilities <e> <s> it is for the schools themselves to decide what to include in health education courses what materials to use and what teaching methods to employ <e> <s> before embarking upon particularly sensitive areas of health education such as sex and drug education as my noble kinswoman has mentioned schools are recommended to consult parents <e> <s> indeed the regulations made under the education act require schools to publish details of the sex education which they provide <e>", "<cs> yes my lords that is why the government are very interested in also producing a system of records of childrens achievements at school <e>", "<cs> my lords at a convenient moment after this afternoon my noble friend lord trefgarne will with the leave of the house repeat a statement that is to be made in another place on the foreign affairs council on thth march <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord annan for giving this house the opportunity to debate this most important topic of the nature and development of higher education <e> <s> i think its importance is emphasised by the phenomenally long list of speakers that we have this afternoon <e> <s> like other members of your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be for the convenience of the house if i announce that dinner will be available at the usual time of this evening <e> <s> the report stage of the telecommunications bill will be adjourned at approximately half past seven for about one hour <e> <s> during this adjournment the <e>", "<cs> my lords for the convenience of the house before we resume the debate of the noble viscount lord massereene and ferrard i can inform the house that this debate should now end at six minutes past six <e>", "<cs> my lords the programme will seek to improve educational provision for unemployed adults largely by providing advice and information about the most effective ways of meeting their varied needs <e> <s> some innovative and developmental provision will be sponsored but responsibility for ensuring adequate educational provision for unemployed adults will continue to rest with local education authorities <e> <s> while the government hope that many students will benefit from the programme it is not possible to identify them separately and to provide estimates of numbers <e>", "<cs> my lords we do not collect statistical information on unemployed students in further and adult education but the indications are that participation by the unemployed is substantial <e> <s> some adult education centres in areas of high unemployment estimate that per cent <e> <s> or more of <e>", "<cs> my lords this government just as much as members on the other side of the house would like to see all the unemployed in jobs and our economic policies are designed to secure that lasting recovery which alone can make the jobs available <e> <s> meanwhile the unemployed can be helped by education in various ways not least in terms of improving their employability <e>", "<cs> my lords this involves both the des and the msc and their interests in this field are complementary <e> <s> for instance the msc are not concerned with non-vocational education while the des programme will not focus on job-specific training <e> <s> between these poles there is an area where interests overlap <e> <s> i am satisfied that the des programme will establish its own identity and this is why in order to ensure fruitful collaboration the msc are represented on the des programmes steering committee <e> <s> i am sure that this will help in both types of education <e>", "<cs> my lords they would help in that sort of case <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have thought that the more employable they were the more chance they would have of finding a job <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that one of the reasons for the setting up of this steering committee is to investigate what is happening and to see where the money can be spent for the greatest benefit and in the most cost-effective way <e>", "<cs> my lords as my right honourable friend the secretary of state for education and science said in his recent speech about peace studies parents who believe that they have grounds for complaint about a schools or a teachers treatment of the issues of peace and war should not hesitate to take the matter up with the school and if they do not receive satisfaction from the school with the local education authority and ultimately with my right honourable friend himself <e> <s> this advice applies equally to anxieties which may be felt by parents about biased teaching in other areas of the school curriculum <e> <s> all such complaints are always taken seriously and are raised with the local education authority concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend for drawing attention to the speech of my right honourable friend about the teaching of peace studies and to endorse all that he has said about that <e> <s> as regards the possible victimisation of parents all i can say is that i hope parents will not be afraid of complaining to my right honourable friend if they feel strongly about this <e> <s> as my right honourable friend suggested in another speech and indeed in this speech if they do feel they are likely to be victimised they should get together with other parents who have the same fears and go ahead with a joint approach <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know the areas they came from but between st january and nd march complaints about peace studies were received from six correspondents <e>", "<cs> my lords we believe that pupils should be able to discuss important issues like peace war and disarmament <e> <s> indeed as the noble lord said such issues can hardly be avoided in the teaching of such subjects as history religious education physics english and so on <e> <s> but when such interests are being discussed it is important that the teacher should deal with them in a fair and impartial way encouraging pupils to weigh the evidence and to arrive at their own conclusions <e>", "<cs> my lords yes this is one of the matters which should be taken into consideration but what is worrying my right honourable friend is when a teacher perhaps inadvisedly tries to stamp his own feelings on peace studies rather than having a balanced and fair discussion <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord opposite for his question <e> <s> no the government say that it is equally wrong to preach war as to preach peace <e> <s> the point my right honourable friend and i are making is that it is not right for a teacher to preach anything unless he is a reverend teacher <e>", "<cs> my lords the government do not collect information centrally about the movement of individual children <e> <s> it is however possible to gain some impression of what is happening <e> <s> there would appear to have been no large-scale transfer of children from special to ordinary schools in the months since implementation of the act <e> <s> nevertheless there is an increasing demand from parents of children with special educational needs particularly young children for admission to ordinary schools and a growing trend for local education authorities to make the first placements for such children in ordinary nursery schools or classes of ordinary primary schools <e> <s> it seems likely that the integrated system will develop from the early years of childhood rather than by the large-scale transfer of older children from special schools <e> <s> it is important to recognise that full integration needs considerable preparation and is not simply a matter of placing children in ordinary schools <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that anybody can predict the rate of transfer <e> <s> at the moment the local authorities are preparing figures which will be available later in the year <e> <s> however i do not believe that they will necessarily show the rate of transfer <e>", "<cs> my lords the great bulk of these recommendations have been carried out <e> <s> the white paper was the governments response to the warnock committee <e> <s> this legislation is based on both the white paper and the warnock report <e>", "<cs> my lords this is very much a matter for the local education authorities who when they decide which school a child should go to under the new act have to take into account not only the special educational needs but also the medical needs and the wishes of the parents <e>", "<cs> my lords all this is taken into account when the children are placed <e>", "<cs> my lords this is the original question in reverse as it were <e> <s> no we have no such figures <e>", "<cs> my lords in the case of children formally assessed under section of the education act the statement should include the medical and health care needs as well as the educational needs <e> <s> i think that i made that point to the noble baroness lady fisher <e> <s> it is hoped that district health authorities will be able to meet those needs <e> <s> however it is realised that the problems of providing services to a population dispersed across a range of ordinary schools are greater than when providing similar services to pupils grouped together in a special school <e> <s> this is one of the factors that should be considered by the lea when determining the appropriate placement for each child <e> <s> also the parents are of course consulted a great deal on where the children go <e> <s> they may decide that they would <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree entirely with the noble lord there will always be special schools and there will always be special children who need special treatment <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be a very complicated programme indeed if that was undertaken <e> <s> the records which the local education authority has to send in during the course of the year to be analysed just refer to children with statements made under the education act <e> <s> because of changing definitions and procedures information will not readily be comparable with statistical data produced for earlier years <e>", "<cs> my lords i see the noble lord lord mishcon on the front bench opposite and so i should like to thank the noble baroness for that question <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not know about james <e> <s> strangely enough i do know about a great many children at some of the special schools in north yorkshire <e> <s> i am very delighted to hear that james is being well looked after <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the commons reason for disagreeing to the lords amendment be now considered <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this house doth not insist on the amendment to the bill with which the commons have disagreed <e> <s> your lordships will see from the paper that the commons <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i must answer one point that the noble baroness made about this matter and i am very glad to hear that she is not going to press it <e> <s> she said that there are only grammar schools in the country <e> <s> that i think is the case but even though there are only there would be quite a lot of children who would be debarred if the opposition decided to press this point <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> the government have initiated a wide-ranging public debate on how higher education should be developed into the s and my right honourable friend the secretary of state for education and science announced in another place on th march that he hopes to bring forward his own proposals before the end of the year <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i agree with what the noble lord lord mulley said about the debate <e> <s> it was an excellent debate <e> <s> it is because of the need for urgency that both the university grants committee and the national advisory body are instituting these reviews and it is because of the need for these reviews to be completed before the end of the year that it would not be a good idea to appoint a royal commission <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that my right honourable friends the secretary of state for scotland and the secretary of state for education and science have been giving most careful consideration to the merger proposal which was made last year by the principal of the university of aberdeen <e> <s> i can assure my noble friend that my right honourable friend the secretary of state for scotland intends to issue a substantive reply to that proposal in the very near future <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe i can confirm that on behalf of the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not agree with the noble lord that the examination which is <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot tell the noble lord whether it will be in the form of a green paper or a white paper but my right honourable friend intends to publish the university grants com-mittees submission on the future development of higher education which he expects to receive from the committee this summer <e> <s> this will contain a summary of the responses received <e> <s> he will then take the committees advice as to whether this should be supplemented by placing any individual responses in the libraries of this house and another place <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend welcomes any evidence which the universities wish to present <e> <s> i hope that they are now taking the opportunity to do so <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i think i do <e> <s> i believe there is quite a lot of collaboration between the ugc and the nab <e>

"<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now adjourn during pleasure until oclock <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat the answer being given to a private notice question in another place on the teachers pay dispute <e> <s> the answer is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble baroness lady david and the noble lord lord kilmarnock for the way they have received this statement <e> <s> but i must say that i really cannot agree with either of them <e> <s> looking back in retrospect if the employers had put on the table their final offer of per cent <e> <s> it would have been received badly <e> <s> after all when one is going into negotiation one does not start off with ones final offer <e> <s> the whole point of negotiation is that one negotiates <e> <s> there have been six meetings of the burnham p and s committee this year and although no advance on the th february formal offer of per cent <e> <s> was made until yesterday in the interim there were lengthy and substantial private discussions about hypothetical figures so there have been negotiations going on throughout the length and breadth of it and i cannot accept that this matter has been handled ineptly <e>", "<cs> my lords her majestys government intend in principle that the proceeds of sale of the leases of the bedford college buildings will be devoted to the costs of the transfer of the college to egham <e> <s> the whole of the proceeds will therefore be used for the benefit of the college which is part of the university of london <e> <s> final agreement to this arrangement is subject to the demonstration of the cost effectiveness of the proposal <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give any details of the negotiations taking place but i can say that i understand the negotiations taking place are satisfactory in regard to the kind of point about which the noble baroness asks <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give the noble baroness lady wootton any details of what the site is going to fetch but i can say the proposal was based on the need to rationalise the accommodation of the two colleges in such a way that they could keep within their advised lower level of funding without damaging their academic strength <e> <s> the proposals will have been subject to a full investment appraisal by the university <e> <s> so far as this lovely site is concerned i think it is important to remember that only a -year lease remains on the buildings in regents park <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it i think it is unlikely there will be much of a surplus <e> <s> how the money will be spent and whether it may all be spent is of course a subject for negotiation with the university authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for drawing the houses attention to that point <e> <s> i should have explained that when i answered an earlier question <e>", "<cs> my lords support of research on cancer by the public sector is mainly the responsibility of the medical research council which receives a grant-in-aid from the department of education and science <e> <s> i understand that in the council spent approximately million on cancer research through research grants to universities work in its own establishments and in the institute of cancer research and the united kingdoms subscription to the international agency for research on cancer <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding of the developments in cancer research is completely and utterly different from that of the noble lord <e> <s> in fact in the medical research councils total grant-in-aid will be million which compares with million in <e> <s> i think that that is just about level funding so there is no cut <e>", "<cs> my lords this noble lord gives long answers when he is asked long questions <e> <s> to give a short answer in reply to the noble lord i can only repeat that in the councils total grant-in-aid will be million compared with million in <e> <s> that in my figures is million more and not million less <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend lady macleod for drawing our attention to the work that is done <e> <s> the two largest charities in this field are the cancer research campaign and the imperial cancer research fund each of which spend approximately million annually <e> <s> i know that the government are most grateful to all those many people who give their time to these excellent charities and others concerned with cancer <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether the members of the medical research council are more or less capable of doing their sums than i am <e> <s> but of course i hope that they will see this question <e> <s> i received a mild ticking off from the noble lord lord ennals for giving too long an answer so perhaps i could explain that there has been trouble this year with the medical research council because it is having to accommodate within its cash limits some unavoidable increases in expenditure <e> <s> these involve such items as an actuarial increase in the employers superannuation contribution and an increase arising from the formula for calculating subscriptions to international bodies such as the european molecular biology laboratory <e>", "<cs> my lords as i say i have no details on this particular unit but i shall certainly draw my right honourable friends attention to what the noble lord has said <e>", "<cs> my lords there are times in life when things go wrong and things have gone wrong with the mrc <e>", "<cs> my lords yes but as i have explained in some detail i think it is unfortunate that these things have happened <e> <s> however i see no reason why they should happen again in future years <e> <s> it is up to the mrc how they spend their money and they are taking short term measures regarding funding <e> <s> this is one of the cases where they were not to blame they did not know these things were going to happen <e> <s> they are at the moment a little short of cash but i think that with luck the situation will soon be rectified <e>", "<cs> my lords these modest reductions are part of the governments general strategy to constrain public expenditure <e> <s> fees paid by the students concerned average little more than pence per hour and meet only a small proportion of the total costs <e> <s> with increased fee income from those who can afford to pay and some marginal improvement in cost effectiveness the adult education programmes of these bodies should not need to be cut back <e>", "<cs> my lords i would disagree with the noble baroness on that matter <e> <s> after all we are talking about fees which average little more than pence per hour <e> <s> do not think that one could go to the cinema a football match or anywhere else for that expenditure <e>", "<cs> my lords i must disagree with the noble lords final point about the vicious cut <e> <s> expenditure on grants to the wea districts and extra-mural departments in the financial year totalled million at price levels a grant of million is planned for the academic year that is a reduction averaging less than per cent <e> <s> per year <e> <s> that can hardly be described as a vicious cut <e> <s> the government are extremely concerned about the adult education programme generally and they have to target limited

majority <e> <s> as to particular powers it is proposed generally to define these more clearly than hitherto so that governing bodies can co-operate effectively with local authorities heads and other

make contributions towards the cost of necessary restructuring at the afrc and nerc during and <e> <s> final advice on the allocation of the science budget in will be given by the abrc later this year <e> <s> in the light of that advice my right honourable friend will make an announcement on allocations <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend lord renton but i cannot make the statement that he wishes because as i said in my original answer the future of a number of units is being considered <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure about that <e> <s> as i understand it one of the points that the medical research council is making is that it is determined to increase its support for more high-quality research in universities <e> <s> that is one of the reasons why it is making some economies <e>", "<cs> my lords a large impact on research is made by a number of bodies quite apart from the medical research council <e> <s> biomedical research is carried out by the universities and medical schools using the funds provided for teaching and research through the university grants committee <e> <s> i ought also to mention the extremely valuable contribution that is made by the private and charitable sectors <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure from where the noble lord lord todd obtained his figures about four units closing this year <e> <s> as i understand it the three units which are due to close shortly are the dental unit the unit for the laboratory studies of tuberculosis and the tuberculosis and chest diseases unit <e> <s> the last two are to be replaced by a new tb and related infections unit which is due to open in october <e> <s> as to the other units there is no definite decision to be made until october <e> <s> i know that my right honourable friend the secretary of state for education and science is very well aware of the financial difficulties which the council face <e> <s> i should however emphasise that no decision on the level of funding for the council for the next few years will be made until later this year <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware that any cut in medical research is an unhappy state of affairs because of the amount of valuable work which is done <e> <s> at the same time i should say that medical research is a very emotive subject and the amount of money which can be spent on it is bottomless you can go on researching for ever if you wish <e> <s> i know that my right honourable friend is concerned about this matter and i shall certainly draw his attention to the questions which have been asked in the house this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certainly not aware of any such proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords with all due respect to the noble lord lord kilmarnock i have undertaken to do that and i think i am a man of my word at any rate i like to think so <e> <s> when i say that i shall do something i like to think that i will do it <e> <s> as to this great fuss about the cuts i must point out that the councils grant-in-aid is million compared with million in <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that is just about level pegging <e>", "<cs> my lords before i move the adjournment of the house may i take the opportunity from this dispatch box of wishing all noble lords and ladies in all parts of the house a very happy and peaceful summer break <e> <s> i think everyone would agree on all sides of the house that we have had a very busy and lengthy session it has been one of the busiest for some time <e> <s> again i am sure that all noble lords and ladies on all sides of the house will join with me in paying our tributes and offering our thanks to the staff who have really made life very tolerable for us in extremely difficult conditions <e> <s> to those we see and to the many behind the scenes whom we do not see i am sure noble lords would wish to say thank you very much indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be for the convenience of the house if i announce that dinner will be available at the usual time this evening <e> <s> the third reading of the police and criminal evidence bill will be adjourned at approximately pm for a short period <e>", "<cs> my lords at a convenient moment after <e> <s> this afternoon my noble friend lord trefgarne will with the leave of the house repeat a statement that is to be made in another place on the hong kong agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we are all grateful to the noble baroness lady david for raising in this place an important area of education policy and one which we have not for some time had the opportunity to discuss as fully as we have today <e> <s> may i first apologise for the delay which the noble baroness quite rightly mentioned at the beginning of her speech <e> <s> i shall try to explain the reasons why these mandatory grants regulations were not laid before parliament until the last minute <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly do that <e> <s> i regret that this story has appeared in some sections of the press <e> <s> so far as i know there is absolutely no truth in it <e> <s> ministers also appreciate that <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord lord graham of edmonton will bear with me for a minute i hope to be able to offer a fairly satisfactory answer to his question <e> <s> inevitably any change in the system of reimbursing actual cost to a more broadly based approach will mean that while some students will gain others will lose <e> <s> ministers understood and acknowledged this when they first put forward their revised proposals but they were aware too that very many more students would gain under the new proposals by the increase in the grants to which i have referred than would lose <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be for the convenience of the house if i announce that dinner will be available at the usual time of pm <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i can certainly give an assurance on the latter point <e> <s> in fact it was this government who ensured that those reports were published and the government intend to go on doing so <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to give comfort to the noble lord and indeed to the noble baroness in what i have said today <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that my right honourable friend did just that in a debate in the other place the other day <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know honestly how many more commitments i can give <e> <s> as i said before this government introduced the publication of hmi reports and i think it is something in which we can take great pride <e> <s> we intend to go on seeing that this happens <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord about a strong and independent inspectorate but i am afraid i have no details about the numbers of inspectors <e> <s> if the noble lord puts down a question on that i should be delighted to answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are anxious to encourage more girls to pursue studies in mathematics and the physical sciences <e> <s> these subjects are key areas in terms of employment opportunities and preparation for new technological skills <e> <s> i am glad to say that participation by girls in post- mathematics and physical science courses is already growing <e> <s> we shall continue to do what we can to stimulate that growth <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are conscious that many job opportunities will be in science and the new technologies and in this context noble lords will no doubt be aware of the equal opportunity commissions current campaign supported by the government and the manpower services commission to encourage girls into science and engineering careers <e> <s> in fact this is the women into science and engineering year <e>", "<cs> my lords yes there have already been two research projects on girls into science and technology and girls and technology education <e> <s> these have helped to identify ways in which curriculum content and planning in schools and the organisation of the option system often fail to meet the needs of girls in science <e> <s> particular attention needs to be given to the style and methods of teaching to the curriculum content to timetabling arrangements and finally but most importantly to careers advice <e>", "<cs> my lords my original reply was not meant to be complacent it was supposed to be encouraging which i hope it was <e> <s> yes there are a number of practical measures that we can take to try to increase the number of girls studying a-level physics <e> <s> one thing we must do is to increase the number of girls studying science before they reach <e> <s> the government have already made clear their view that all pupils including all girls should be properly introduced to science in the primary school and should continue to study a broad programme of science throughout the first five years of secondary education <e> <s> there are a number of other measures such as in-service courses for teachers of these particular subjects and the introduction of computers into schools <e> <s> these are among a number of things that we are doing to try to help with this problem <e>", "<cs> yes my lords and my experience of intelligent women is that they tend to take their own line of country and you cannot coerce them into doing otherwise <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i shall have to write to my noble friend about that <e> <s> i have no statistics on single or multi-sex schools <e>", "<cs> my lords again as i said i am not sure of the difference between girls-only schools and schools for both boys and girls <e> <s> we are endeavouring to bring teachers up to a higher standard than that at which some of them are at this moment <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i shall certainly write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that is a very different question <e> <s> if the noble baroness wishes to put down a question on those lines i shall be delighted to answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have thought that was very much a question for individual establishments and the way that they are run <e> <s> i would agree with the noble baroness that the way through must be first of all to encourage them to start studying science from an early age <e> <s> then it is to be hoped they will go into that branch of learning <e>", "<cs> my lords i am listening <e>", "<cs> my lords like noble lords who have already spoken the government are grateful to the noble lord lord sherfield for initiating this debate <e> <s> his contribution and those of other noble lords have been thoughtful and of great interest <e> <s> i look forward to reading what they said in my own time and i shall also draw my right honourable friends attention to the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords mandatory award rates and conditions are reviewed annually <e> <s> the first stage results of the review for were announced by ministers two weeks ago <e>", "<cs> my lords i am a little puzzled by the remarks of the noble baroness because she said she wants a major review <e> <s> then she seemed to say that this was a major review and therefore should not have been carried out <e> <s> it is not government policy to consult in full before making financial decisions such as this <e> <s> there is continuing correspondence and indeed consultation with all the bodies to which the noble baroness referred and this goes on the whole time <e>", "<cs> my lords student awards must be determined in the light of both the needs of students and the sums that taxpayers and ratepayers can reasonably be asked to contribute towards student <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the banks themselves go touting very much for their business and i do not think that the blame for this can be laid entirely with the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord lord alexander of potterhill for making that very important point which is absolutely true <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think young people who are refused a grant by their parents have any right to appeal except to their parents <e> <s> i suggest that they appeal to them very strongly and i hope that in support they may produce their teachers their career officers and anyone else in evidence <e> <s> i am sorry to say that this problem occurs i think that is a fact of life <e> <s> none of us can choose which parents have us and as they say in yorkshire <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful <e> <s> as i have said for various reasons the government are not preparing to proceed on those lines <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that when those students grow up and become taxpayers they would probably not prefer that line of country <e> <s> i think that on the whole parents would prefer to pay less tax generally and to pay more towards their childrens education <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> the government hope that the parents will meet their full responsibilities <e> <s> there are ways of helping in that respect for example deeds of covenant and we hope that parents will pay what they should pay towards their student offspring <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a continual study of the data about the access that students have to higher education and yes it will indeed be studied <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the secretary of state for education and science intends to bring forward the governments proposals for the future development of higher education in the form of a green paper in the early part of next year <e> <s> the paper will take account of the published advice of the university grants committee and the national advisory body for local authority higher education including that contained in their joint statement <e> <s> noble lords will understand that i cannot anticipate the governments proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords both the university grants committee and the national advisory body have published reports of their working parties on continuing education and have incorporated some aspects of their conclusions into their strategy advice to the government <e> <s> the response to this advice is currently under consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said we are going to publish a green paper on this matter <e> <s> but i should point out to the noble baroness that since when the previous conservative government took office the number of home full-time and sandwich students in higher education in great britain has increased from to in <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that your lordships will have to wait very long because we are nearly in december and the white paper is expected to come out in the very early part of next year <e> <s> so as i said previously i cannot anticipate any of the governments proposals <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i think that that is very much in the forefront of my right honourable friends mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry i must make it absolutely clear that it will be a green paper <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the secretary of state for education and science will make an announcement on as levels in due course after considering the responses to the governments proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the response from universities and for the most part from the rest of higher education has been extremely favourable <e> <s> the examination boards employers independent schools and sixth-form colleges have generally responded favourably <e> <s> however as i think the noble baroness said among other schools there have been considerable misgivings about the proposals in their present form and indeed opposition to them <e> <s> of course all these matters are just what my right honourable friend is at present considering <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very flattered by the noble lord promoting me to right honourable but i am afraid i am not right honourable i am just an ordinary common or garden noble like others in this house <e> <s> the noble lord has made a very fair point it is the resource implications which are worrying schools <e> <s> again this is what my right honourable friend is considering <e>", "<cs> my lords yes all these matters are being considered by my right honourable friend at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords there was a chapter in the consultation document on subject coverage and if this is the sort of question which has been answered then i am sure that my right honourable friend will consider it <e>", "<cs> my lords at a convenient moment after this afternoon my noble friend lord lucas of chilworth will with the leave of the house repeat a statement that is to be made in another place on the british telecom flotation <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that all the teams involved in this audit commission review took as their starting point a study carried out by the former audit inspectorate entitled <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i have already said that the audit commission has been concerned to ensure as consistent an approach as possible <e> <s> i believe that auditors bring their own valuable skills to their audits and the issues they raise and the conclusions they reach must be taken seriously by all concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords it is for the audit commission themselves to decide where they go and <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat a statement on student awards which is being made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for education and science <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both the noble baroness lady david and the noble lord lord kilmarnock for the somewhat muted welcome that they have given at least to part of the statement <e> <s> i am delighted that we are all in agreement on tuition fees anyway <e> <s> i was also very grateful to the noble baroness lady david for drawing attention once again to the possibility of parents using covenants as a form of easing their burden over student grants <e> <s> i think that we would all agree that the more publicity that can be given to this the better <e>", "<cs> my lords i would agree with the noble lord lord mulley in endorsing the only thing that i think we are all in agreement about <e> <s> i think i really must defend the treasury a bit <e>", "<cs> well my lords they have to have a champion somewhere <e> <s> they have agreed to meet million which is nearly half the extra cost <e> <s> i must also again point out to the noble lord lord mulley that to talk about a cut in the research councils budget when they are getting an extra million is not right <e> <s> i cannot agree that that is a cut <e>", "<cs> my lords if you get million extra and i should not mind if somebody gave me million i would not say that that was a cut <e>", "<cs> my lords if i remember correctly this is going to be used for laboratory equipment <e> <s> in fact it is going to be million in the first year and million in the subsequent two years so that it is going to be million in total <e>", "<cs> yes there will be reductions my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble baroness has made a very valid point <e> <s> as i tried to explain the research councils were told they were going to get an extra million and they have now been told they are going to get an extra million <e> <s> that is million less than they thought they were going to get but it is still extra money <e> <s> however the noble baroness is absolutely right about the million <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i can give a commitment as such but there is going to be a green paper in the new year <e> <s> in it there will be a chapter on student grants and i think that this will probably provide for the consultations which the noble lord requires <e>", "<cs> my lords i remember extremely well that very interesting debate which i think was introduced by the noble lord lord sherfield <e> <s> yes i feel extremely sorry about this and i know that my right honourable friend does too <e> <s> as i say they are getting an extra million <e> <s> of course they want more money but again who does not <e>", "<cs> my lords i seem to be repeating this over and over again but it is not a cut <e> <s> it is million less extra money than they thought they were going to receive <e> <s> they will still receive million extra money <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i suppose it is technically <e> <s> but if somebody offered me million and then said im very sorry it is only going to be million i should still be jolly glad to receive it <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> i think that this might be a convenient moment to take the statement <e> <s> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> i think this might be a convenient time to take the dinner break <e> <s> before i beg to move that the house do now resume may i suggest that we do not return to this committee stage before oclock <e> <s> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for explaining the reasons for this amendment <e> <s> we are advised by our legal experts that in this context the word sale includes the concept of exposure for sale and thus already meets my noble friends concern <e> <s> to deal with the point of the advertisement which he mentioned any person who supplied a prohibited pesticide in order that it might be offered for sale would also be committing an offence under clause and so we are doubly protected <e>", "<cs> i shall take account of what my noble friend has said <e> <s> if necessary clause l <e>", "<cs> i have finally got up my lords <e> <s> i am very grateful to the noble baroness lady nicol for bringing forward the amendment <e> <s> it gives the government a chance to put forward what they feel about this matter and to correct several misapprehensions that both she and her noble friend lord melchett have mentioned <e>", "<cs> the power is available in clause <e>", "<cs> i think it is the information <e> <s> i must make it absolutely clear to the noble lord lord melchett that the powers in clause require such information from exporters of pesticides as will allow us to fulfil our international obligations <e> <s> this is that we will tell everybody what these pesticides are and what they contain <e> <s> surely it is up to them to decide whether or not they will deal with the problem in their own country <e>", "<cs> i really cannot go further than to thank my noble friend for that comment <e> <s> the situation is absolutely clear <e> <s> if your lordships look at clause you will see that it says <e>", "<cs> i am not certain whether it is my noble friend who has misinterpreted the noble lords amendment <e> <s> i certainly do not see it as to do with bits and pieces in bottles but it may well be <e> <s> however it arises i appreciate the desire to ensure that surplus or unwanted pesticides are disposed of safely <e> <s> this point was considered when the bill was drafted <e> <s> in fact the powers to set conditions on the supply and use of pesticides afforded by clause <e>", "<cs> this time i show a great deal of sympathy for the noble lord lord melchett <e> <s> i can confirm to him that earthworm killers and rodenticides will be controlled under the regulations as indeed will aphicides nematicides herbicides insecticides fungicides algicides and acaricides etc <e> <s> i am relieved that the noble lord has not asked me to list all those as well <e>", "<cs> not at this late hour of the night <e>", "<cs> i think the answer is that that is absolutely the case <e> <s> however i should have to confirm this and let the noble lord know if i am wrong <e> <s> certainly i can say that it is not permitted as a sheep dip <e>", "<cs> i am indeed most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> as i in fact said on amendment no <e> <s> i think i have better news on this one <e> <s> i understand <e>", "<cs> i think that this might be a convenient moment to take the first statement <e> <s> i therefore beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> this might be a convenient time to take the second statement <e> <s> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> i can say in all honesty that i share every concern that has been expressed by noble lords who have spoken in this little debate <e> <s> i personally take great pride in saying in front of your lordships that i share a widely held principle that land and when we think of land we include the soil obviously is something that should be handed on in a better condition than that in which it was received <e> <s> i share very much the sentiments of the noble lord lord northbourne <e> <s> having said that i can certainly assure the noble lord that our intention is so to control pesticides as to avoid unacceptable effects on soil flora and fauna and the environment generally <e> <s> these are the factors which are always considered when a pesticide is proposed for application to field crops or the soil <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend lady carnegy for answering the question of my noble friend lord swinfen <e> <s> the answer is that if any farmer knows that a pesticide will do this to the soil he will not use it <e> <s> not only will he not use it but under this bill we shall make jolly sure he is not able to use it <e> <s> that is what the whole bill is about <e> <s> it would be extremely difficult to follow the line proposed by my noble friend lord swinfen <e> <s> there are so many difficulties as i have tried to explain <e> <s> there are so many factors such as the type of soil and the weather conditions that all affect what the residue levels are <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble baroness for raising this issue <e> <s> obviously it is an issue that has had a very good airing today and it is one in which many of your lordships are interested <e> <s> it <e>", "<cs> i can really only repeat what i have already said <e> <s> i should stress that we propose to approve products individually and that formulations can affect safety as much as individual chemicals <e> <s> i do not know whether or not the manufacturers are aware of this <e>", "<cs> yes and volatility has in the past been taken into account <e>", "<cs> i sometimes wish that my officials could write a little better than i write myself <e> <s> let me say to the noble lord lord melchett that in a way he has hit on the whole advantage of this bill <e> <s> it does give us power statutorily to consider the environment generally in dealing with chemicals <e> <s> we cannot give a clear indication of the practical effects but volatility is a fact to be taken into consideration <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble lord lord melchett <e> <s> i must say that if i wrote to him never in a million years would he be able to read it i shall make sure that it is typed <e> <s> of course i shall write to him but i am not prepared to take this particular amendment back and look at it again because i do not think that it is necessary <e>", "<cs> this amendment would require the removal of very specific and clear controls on the use of cruel poisons such as strychnine and on the use of warfarin to control a recognised agricultural <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may answer first the two explicit questions from my noble friend lord stanley <e> <s> the minimum dilution rate states that <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for saying that <e> <s> unfortunately i do not know <e>", "<cs> not necessarily <e>", "<cs> i think i shall have to keep the noble lord in a state of

may i suggest that we do not return to this committee before pm <e> <s> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for proposing this amendment which on the face of it would appear to save money <e> <s> however i do not think that the amendment is necessary though the aim undoubtedly is <e> <s> clause which deals with the provision of information by manufacturers and others is already broad enough to permit ministers to require an applicant for approval to carry out tests under the observation of a government representative if ministers felt that was necessary <e> <s> the option which the noble lord proposes as an economy measure is therefore already available to us under the bill <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for explaining this amendment <e> <s> it is common to member states of the european community to levy a fee for the registration of pesticides <e> <s> in fact with the exception of the united kingdom and the republic of ireland all other member states charge for this service and it is my understanding that the irish intend to change their system in due course <e> <s> the charges raised by our european neighbours vary considerably and so do the services provided by their pesticides approval schemes <e> <s> i am sorry but we do not have details of precise charges just the general information that they vary widely from country to country as to the services which they are designed to pay for <e> <s> however i could endeavour to get the information and write to my noble friend if that would be helpful <e>", "<cs> i understand it is either the minister of agriculture or the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> i really do not think i have anything to add to what my noble friend said on amendment no <e> <s> when the noble lord moved a very similar amendment <e>", "<cs> this amendment would severely inhibit enforcement officers in their first duty to prevent and remedy dangers

impossible <e>", "<cs> my lords the government hope shortly to conclude their consideration of the way ahead in the light of the responses to the consultations and will make an announcement as soon as possible thereafter <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not hesitate to agree with the noble lord that a lot of the replies were hostile <e> <s> but of course the green paper made proposals on many matters other than a parental majority on governing bodies <e> <s> it should be noted that very many respondents agree that the present arrangement for school government could and should be improved on green paper lines and that there should be scope for parents to involve themselves more in their childrens education <e>", "<cs> my lords the closing date for written comments was over four months after the

governments concern about the non-agricultural use of agricultural pesticides <e> <s> i think we can concede that they have a very good point <e> <s> we feel that the best way to deal with this issue is to give the assurance that regulations under the bill will produce this or a similar provision about the labelling of pesticides and indeed will also place restrictions on the supply of more toxic pesticides to domestic users <e> <s> the powers to do these things already exist in clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that this might be a convenient stage at which to adjourn consideration on report of this bill <e> <s> before doing so may i suggest that we do not return to this bill before half-past eight <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for tabling this amendment <e> <s> i am advised that the phrase without reasonable excuse is wider than the general defence of due diligence so it would be rather illogical to apply both defences to the offences in clause <e>",

know of any league tables as it were of the amount of computers in other countries but i can say that we have far more microcomputers than people think <e> <s> for instance a recent survey has indicated that secondary schools have on average microcomputers and we estimate on the basis of reports some microcomputers per primary school <e> <s> i would agree entirely with the latter question that my noble friend asked i am sure that this does indeed equip youngsters for employment in some of the newer industries <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware of that <e> <s> it would surprise me if

own resources <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i would agree with that <e> <s> in fact much of the spending on equipment purchased for projects under the tvei is for new technological devices <e>", "<cs> yes

microcomputer can help <e> <s> they are the physically handicapped by enabling them to produce texts for the first time and also those with severe learning difficulties those with severe mental

minority children raises difficult and sensitive issues <e> <s> therefore it is not surprising that the committee should wish to deliberate on them at some length <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we must wait for the outcome of the report to see what it includes <e>", "<cs> my lords i think editorial means editorial <e>", "<cs> my lords again i think we shall have to wait to see what the report has in it <e>", "<cs> my lords the committee has been sitting for some five years so i think it has had ample opportunity to look into all sorts of things <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the secretary of state for education and science has agreed to the request from the association of polytechnic teachers for a ministerial meeting at which they can explain the case for such an inquiry

to take action against the national front organiser patrick harrington under the polytechnics disciplinary code and that he thought such action might place him in contempt of court <e> <s> mrs morrell

what the noble baroness said about the impartiality and the <e>", "<cs> my lords if i did not give as long as long an answer as perhaps i might have done to my noble friend lady cox it was because she

the government might consider it appropriate to constrain expenditure by student unions they will propose to transfer any savings that might arise into the grants made to individual students to enable them to choose individually whether or not to spend the money on excluded activities <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know any details <e> <s> i shall have to write to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my

average of four sabbatical officers each <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that there are a number of statistics which are not known and that is one of them <e>", "<cs> my lords i would go some way at least towards agreeing with what the noble baroness lady lockwood has said <e> <s> i think that the proper work of student unions is in organising student services and facilities and that this may well require the attention of full-time officers <e> <s> however whether there is a need for so many officers as there appear to be in order to manage unions efficiently is a question which the government will raise in their consultations with higher education interests to which i referred in an earlier question <e>", "<cs> my lords these figures i think may not be very accurate anyway because they were collected by the students association at edinburgh university on behalf of the student union senior officials conference in and so they are slightly out of date <e> <s> i understand

noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords the government do not collect information in this form but my right honourable friend the secretary of state for education and science has made it clear that he looks to local education authorities and schools to ensure that the requirements of the education act on collective worship are met <e> <s> the act does not extend to scotland or northern ireland where separate legislation applies <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> the religious education provisions of the act including the requirement for daily collective worship by all pupils in maintained schools

propose any changes in those provisions <e>", "<cs> my lords there may well be schools in different parts of the country where the letter of the law on collective worship is not obeyed <e> <s> we are anxious about this and we look to local education authorities and to the schools themselves to ensure that daily worship is in fact provided <e> <s> indeed any parent or any member of the public and i would say any clergyman or perhaps any right reverend prelate who is unhappy about what is provided in a particular school should not hesitate to take up the matter with the school and if necessary with the local education authority and if he or she gets no satisfaction ultimately with my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i can only repeat what i said to the right reverend prelate the bishop of norwich and that is that anyone who has any reason to understand that this is not being carried on in a school is quite entitled to go and complain to that school and if they get

lot of money <e> <s> i should have thought that this was something the general public and parents of children at schools could look after very well <e>", "<cs> my lords it is difficult enough answering questions but to have to try to work out what their purpose is as well is beyond me <e>", "<cs> my lords at a convenient moment after this afternoon my noble friend lord avon will with the leave of the house repeat in the form of a statement an answer given to a private notice question in another place on the finances of haringey borough council <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will not mind giving way i should say that we have had minutes gassing on this subject <e> <s> the noble lord lord stoddart asked a great many questions at the beginning and had quite a lot of time

already take into account the report of the visiting committee <e> <s> they are however indications rather than firm grants and are subject to review in annual public expenditure surveys <e>", "<cs>

grant from level funding between and making allowance for treasury assumptions for inflation is million <e> <s> this figure has been accepted by the university <e> <s> the universitys figure of million did not purport to be a measure of the cut in grant <e> <s> it was a measure of a cut in the expenditure which the university otherwise believed it should be making <e> <s> it was clear from the differences between the figures that the university was planning for substantial increases in expenditure but the reasons for this were not clear <e> <s> the visiting committee examined the universitys figures and agreed that it was facing increases in costs for which it needed to make provision <e> <s> but at a time of constraint in public expenditure the university cannot expect not should it plan that increased costs will be met by increased funds <e> <s> it should plan to absorb increased costs in some areas through decreased costs in others as indeed as the noble baroness mentioned have other universities <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that this is the reason why the visiting committees recommendation about the development of the pickup programme was in fact received well by my right honourable friend who has said that he is looking at it <e> <s> he has asked the university to submit plans for the development of its pickup activities as follows <e> <s> first on the assumption that the present arrangements stand and secondly on the assumption that the loan is converted to grant <e>", "<cs> yes my lords and that is again why they look at the pick-up scheme

beneath the floor of the house <e> <s> it is very difficult to answer all of the noble lords questions <e> <s> i should make it absolutely plain that the university continues to occupy an important place in the governments strategy for higher education but it is the governments view that it should be able to operate more economically <e> <s> indeed the visiting committee said this and pointed to a number of ways in which they suggest that the open university can make savings <e> <s> we expect it to contribute to the savings in public expenditure which are required of the higher education system generally <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> of course we are aware of that and that is why we are suggesting in a sum of million for new computing facilities and million to provide for a more gradual approach to reduce grant levels the switch to science and technology and the new-blood information technology posts <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are directly supporting the year by grant aiding the national co-ordinating committees in the united kingdom <e> <s> many other activities in government programmes have relevance to the objectives of the year <e> <s> a considerable number of organisations are carrying out relevant activities <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall try to expand a little if i may on what is happening <e> <s> i think there are some local groups which are organising their own activities and programmes <e> <s> a number of initiatives relating to the year including for example the establishment of more local committees to foster greater participation by

very grateful to my noble friend for pointing that out which seems to be an admirable situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware of that but i think it is a delightful piece of advertising if i may say so and i hope the message gets out <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that that is perhaps a national problem more than an international one and of course we are doing everything we can <e> <s> that was one of the reasons why my right honourable friend the chancellor announced during his budget speech that the youth training scheme is to be extended to provide two years training <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i go quite as far along that track as the noble lord suggests but i think this gives me an opportunity to draw to the attention of your lordships the fact that a circular on the youth service was issued yesterday <e> <s> i think that perhaps it did not get the attention it merited because it was issued at the same time as the white paper on better schools <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the first part of the supplementary question of the noble countess which draws attention to the arts but i am afraid that the matter of the provision of music in schools is very very wide of this question <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that it had anything to do with international youth year and therefore it is wide of the original question <e>", "<cs> my lords british scientists are actively involved in preparing to observe halleys comet at close quarters using both space and ground-based facilities <e> <s> in the case of the former the united kingdoms involvement will be predominantly through the european space agencys giotto mission <e> <s> the main source of funds for these activities is the science and engineering research council whose grant-in-aid is

h of the sex discrimination act and for connected purposes <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords the farm animal welfare council is consulting interests about possible recommendations for new regulations based on the welfare codes <e> <s> the council has not however submitted recommendations to ministers <e> <s> when it does the government will of course consider them carefully and consult <e> <s> any new regulations then proposed would be laid before parliament for debate <e>", "<cs> my lords they are not bound by the same regulations as we have although obviously to a greater or lesser extent they have their own <e> <s> the governments view is that an important factor which must guide government thinking is the need to avoid placing

question of compensation to meet any new legal requirements <e> <s> however the government by allowing sufficient time to producers to adapt to new standards would ensure that any further welfare

of the century and many very great changes have been wrought in the quality and quantity of the nations educational provision as the result of their passage <e> <s> these bills were generally concerned with schools and colleges teachers and pupils and syllabuses and examinations <e> <s> this bill may appear at first glance to be about supplying goods and services money-lending local government revenue accounts limited companies and sex <e> <s> your lordships may well be wondering what all that has to do with education except perhaps for the last item but i shall seek to convince your lordships today that these are all issues of real importance to education and ones which the government hope will as a result of this bills passage grow in significance as educational establishments play their proper role in our industrial society <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness lady david and to the two noble lords who have spoken <e> <s> they have all spoken in favour of this bill and have supported its principles <e> <s> the noble baroness made a number of detailed points to which she will doubtless return on committee stage and i look forward to that <e> <s> i can also say that simultaneously consultations are being conducted with the local authority associations and others with regard to some of the subordinate arrangements as to accounts and so on <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i shall have to write to the noble baroness on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a real pleasure to welcome the presence of the noble lord lord ritchie of dundee to the alliance front bench especially after the very good common sense which he expressed as regards the use of the english language in publications <e> <s> i can only say in my own defence that i take enormous trouble when i write to your lordships to ensure that the letters are correct grammatically <e> <s> i am afraid that i do not have the time to go through publications put out by the des in a similar way <e> <s> however we are very pleased to see the noble lord sitting on the front bench and i hope that we shall be crossing swords if that is not too strong a term from time to time <e>", "<cs> my lords there has been a consistent increase in the relative and absolute number of women engineering and science undergraduates over the last five years for which figures are available <e> <s> the government are anxious to maintain this trend and have taken substantial steps to do so through measures encouraging girls to take up science in schools and to increase significantly the number of places available in engineering and scientific subjects in higher education institutions <e> <s> further progress depends also however on changing the existing preconceptions and attitudes of girls and their parents <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> among other things the equal opportunities commission and the engineering council showed much initiative in designating as women into science and engineering year <e> <s> this provided a welcome opportunity to increase awareness and to encourage girls to consider pursuing science and engineering subjects

yes my lords <e> <s> to answer my noble friends second point first there were a number of other factors which i tried to point out in that letter and other things which come into play <e> <s> i agree

very different question <e>", "<cs> my lords i imagine that very much they are <e> <s> that is why as i said in answer to the first supplementary question the engineering council was very much a party to women into science and engineering year and it is hoped to change these attitudes <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i do not have any figures available <e> <s> i will write to the noble baroness on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware of that but i am delighted to hear it <e>", "<cs> my lords i find it very difficult to pressurise members of the opposite sex into doing anything unless they are themselves absolutely determined to do it <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i do not think there is anything at all between myself and the noble baroness on this matter <e> <s> it really depends on the way you look at it <e> <s> the sole purpose of clause of this bill is to define the activities which the bill sets out to legalise and to distinguish them from the existing educational activities which are already within the leas powers by virtue of section of the education act <e> <s> subsections and respectively define the goods and services which may be supplied through further education establishments in both cases as those which result from its educational activities <e> <s> subsection defines these activities <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may help the noble baroness <e> <s> this is slightly complicated because there are already some commercial activities which are carried on for instance where hairdressing is practised where old ladies can have a very cheap perm and in bakeries where they sell off the buns <e> <s> the government believe that these activities should be allowed to continue without the full cost having to be recouped <e> <s> we want the items that are slightly new and probably more technical to be fully charged for whereas the existing activities should not be <e> <s> perhaps that explains the point <e>", "<cs> if i may say so i think that that would make it even more difficult to understand <e>", "<cs> dealing with amendment no <e> <s> the idea of this subsection is to enable leas to lend money to companies provided that two conditions are fulfilled <e> <s> first the loan must be for the purposes of an agreement of the type defined by clauses and <e>", "<cs> here again we seem to be in the same situation as we were on the first amendment <e> <s> there is a bit of misunderstanding over this bill <e> <s> it is not the governments intention that all these matters such as catering and hairdressing which the noble baroness mentioned should suddenly start to have to be charged for at their full cost <e> <s> this is not the idea <e> <s> the idea is that this bill will relate to the new technologies and that sort of thing and not to what might be described as the traditional ways in which colleges have been providing a service <e>", "<cs> i think that that can be dealt with <e> <s> this is one of the questions which will be raised with the meetings with the leas which are going on <e> <s> i must admit that i am not altogether happy about the wording of the bill on this <e> <s> i do not know whether we shall have to come back either at a later stage in this house or in another place with some amendment which will make this perfectly clear or whether it can be done by a list of guidelines although i think that even if we have a list of guidelines there is bound to be as the noble baroness has said a grey area <e>", "<cs> yes the idea is that it should be the full market value <e> <s> that is one of the principles behind this <e> <s> on the other point which both baronesses have made i can assure them that advice to polytechnics and other colleges will be similar to that which is now given to universities <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble baroness for that <e> <s> it is something which i must say worried me when i got down to the brass tacks this morning <e> <s> it is something in which i like to take a personal interest <e> <s> at the very minimum i shall write to the noble baroness <e> <s> however i cannot give an undertaking that we shall have anything ready for report stage <e>", "<cs> perhaps first i can try to put the mind of the noble baroness at rest about the question of the charities <e> <s> i acknowledge her point about the difficulties of providing supervision for contracts which are carried out through companies set up by assisted fe establishments such as the ilea polytechnics in order to preserve their charitable status <e> <s> but i do not think that there is any cause for alarm here because the subsection has been carefully drafted so as to refer only to agreements carried out under subsection <e>", "<cs> you have achieved a lot <e>", "<cs> i explained earlier on amendment no <e> <s> why the government consider the full-cost/open market value rule so important in order to avoid unfair subsidies to businesses in the public sector which will be in competition with private sector enterprises <e> <s> this amendment would have the effect of weakening that provision though in a manner rather different from the earlier one <e>", "<cs> i should like to begin by assuring the noble lord lord rochester and indeed the noble baroness lady lockwood as well as your lordships that the government do not intend to use the powers to which these amendments relate in order to create voluminous and burdensome regulations or accounting arrangements and that the local authority associations and other interest groups including notably the cipfa the local government accountants professional body and the audit commission will be fully consulted before the regulations envisaged are issued <e> <s> what we are concerned to secure <e> <s> however in the light of the consultations is the establishment of a responsible financial regime for the activities permitted by the bill within the framework of the existing accounting regime for local authorities <e>", "<cs> she is quite happy so i will do that <e> <s> i hope i have convinced noble lords that both the accounting regulation and the best endeavours provision are essential controls to prevent abuse of these powers and ensure consistent monitoring of the outcome <e> <s> i hope i have also convinced noble lords that these will not be burdensome on local authorities and that it will be done with consultation using their standard ways of accounting <e> <s> i hope that the noble baroness will withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> i know that both the noble baronesses have a very good line to the local authorities and they will probably hear their reactions a damned sight quicker than i shall <e>", "<cs> i hope that we shall finish it <e> <s> there are only two more amendments and at the speed we are going i think we can finish <e>", "<cs> as the noble baroness explained this amendment would enable local education authorities in effect to earmark the profits arising from their fe establishments commercial training and apply them for the furtherance of the establishments educational activities <e> <s> i am sorry if the noble baroness thinks that there is something sinister or suspect in what i said at second reading because i was trying to give the impression very strongly that this is what we hope will happen <e> <s> perhaps i may put it a little stronger and say that i unreservedly applaud the principle behind this proposal <e> <s> it is the corollary of clause concerning the treatment of deficits that profits should be treated in the same manner <e> <s> i agree entirely with what the noble baroness and the noble lord lord rochester said about this <e>", "<cs> i understand from the noble baroness that the aim of the amendment is to exempt from vat all supplies of goods and services made through local authorities further education establishments in pursuance of the powers under this bill <e> <s> the provision of education by schools colleges of education and other further education establishments maintained by local authorities is not regarded as being a business activity and accordingly falls outside the scope of vat <e> <s> this bill in no way threatens that state of affairs <e> <s> for the bill is not about the supply of education or training it is about supplying the valuable by-products which arise in education establishments alongside their normal teaching functions and furthermore about supplying these by-products on a commercial footing with a view to profit <e>", "<cs> it is a slightly complicated matter <e> <s> i understand that the universities and private schools for instance are neither part of central nor of local government <e> <s> group of schedule to the vat act provides specifically for their supplies of educational and research materials to be exempt from vat and extends to cover the supply of materials and services to their own students when the supply is incidental to the main provision of exempt education <e> <s> i acknowledge that there may be difficulty in defining exactly where provision of exempt education or research ends and where the commercial activities begin <e> <s> this is a question which can be resolved only by examining individual cases in detail <e> <s> i understand that local vat inspectors can give guidance in cases of doubt <e>", "<cs> my lords the terms on which non-ec almonds and hazelnuts enter the community will be unaffected by the accession of spain and portugal <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no evidence that producers in the twelve will suffer from competition from california and turkey <e> <s> in the case of almonds the united states product is the only one which provides a guaranteed supply of non-bitter almonds which are required for confectionery <e> <s> turkish hazelnuts likewise fulfil a market requirement which cannot be met by mediterranean products <e> <s> a commission study has stated that after accession the community will be far from self-sufficient in these products <e>", "<cs> my lords non-ec imports of almonds and hazelnuts enter the community at a <e>", "<cs>

almonds from per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> as part of the same package the americans are also offering to increase by tonnes their cheese quota to benefit italian-type cheeses of community origin <e> <s> this matter has been discussed on a number of occasions by the article committee and in fact we denmark germany and italy are in favour of accepting this offer <e> <s> i do not think

honourable friend has spelt out all the conditions he places on a reform package and he stands ready to seek extra resources to offer greater rewards to teachers performing especially well <e> <s> he would very much like to do something for the good teachers who in the days of growing pupil numbers would have received promotion <e> <s> this means a salary in which pay is more directly linked to performance <e>", "<cs> my lords i really must point out that it was the noble lord who mentioned bad teachers certainly i did not mention bad teachers <e> <s> i should like to pay tribute to the many hundreds of teachers who daily bring skill commitment and dedication to their difficult task <e>", "<cs> my lords i should also like to remind the noble lord if he will listen to my anwer to his

my lords i think their reasons are fairly well known <e> <s> the teachers have put in a pay claim for per cent <e> <s> which they are now trying to achieve <e> <s> also they are not willing to talk about conditions of service which is one of the bases of discussion on which my right honourable friend wants to talk to them <e>", "<cs> my lords i was replying to what the noble lord lord rochester said about the teachers going to a body of people who were not involved and surely that must be an arbitrator <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the commons amendments be now considered <e>",

be adjourned at approximately pm for a short period and that during this adjournment the agriculture improvement regulations and the agriculture improvement scheme will be taken <e>", "<cs> my lords the report confirms the strong statistical association between examination performance and social background and also points to better examination results by pupils at secondary modern and grammar schools than by pupils at comprehensive schools <e> <s> as the authors state the findings are capable of a variety of interpretations the issues are very complex and the inferences drawn tentative <e>

<e> <s> it could be possible <e>", "<cs> my lords the departments views on the first report were set out in a statement issued in november <e> <s> among other things this explained that the department had been reassured about earlier doubts as to whether the sampling of schools was representative but said that the question of appropriate adjustments in respect of social and economic factors in work of this kind was a matter for debate <e> <s> at the time my right honourable friend explained that contrary to some press reports the <e>", "<cs> yes my lords in a way i agree with the noble lord <e> <s> the government have no doctrinaire views about the various forms of secondary school organisation <e> <s> each has its strengths and its weaknesses <e> <s> we take the view which we set out in circular no <e> <s> / that no one pattern of secondary education has overriding advantages or disadvantages of principle and that the form of secondary education chosen for an area should be that which is best suited to local circumstances and the preferences of parents <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that the first statement of the noble lord lord glenamara that all comparisons are useless was such a useless question that i did not bother to answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords i think there must be an end-of-term feeling in the air but if the noble baroness reads my reply to an earlier supplementary question she will see that i was in no way attacking comprehensive schools <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may congratulate the right reverend prelate not only on the fact that he took so long to ask his last supplementary question thus ensuring himself a good last record in <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i am here either to defend the noble lord lord glenamara against my noble friend lord beloff or vice versa <e> <s> as the house will be up in about four hours i am willing to second either of them if they wish to have a go on the terrace <e> <s> i do not think that i need say any more <e>", "<cs> my lords i think this looks like being a three-cornered contest <e> <s> however perhaps we could complete the discussion on this rather long question on a happy note <e>

transport bill will be adjourned at approximately pm for a short period and that during the adjournment the prayer to annul the education mandatory awards regulations will be taken <e>", "<cs> my

to debate the subject of student support this evening <e> <s> i shall try to answer her questions about late timing but i am afraid she will not be very satisfied at the end <e> <s> the government recognise the difficulties that a late announcement can bring and are as anxious as are the leas that the new rates of grant and parental contribution scales are issued as early as possible <e> <s> for we released the new contribution scales and gave an indication of the change in the main rates dates in november <e> <s> the timing of the announcement of detailed rates will inevitably vary from year to year depending largely on the scale of any changes that we wish to make and the need to consult other interested departments <e> <s> we had hoped to achieve an early announcement this year but the interdepartmental consultations held us up <e> <s> in the event st may was the earliest date by which the main rates could be issued <e> <s> as the noble baroness herself said supplementary allowances cannot be calculated until dhss rates and supplementary benefit are published <e> <s> it was not until mid-june that supplementary benefit rates became available this year <e>", "<cs> my

very grateful to my noble and learned friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is customary for me to say that i am grateful to the noble baroness lady david and to the noble lord lord rochester for the way in which they have received the statement <e> <s> however i find it difficult to say that in the case of the noble baroness because although i have always found her extremely reasonable both inside and outside the house i must admit that today i find her totally unreasonable <e> <s> the noble baroness has launched an attack upon my right honourable friend and upon the education service <e> <s> i should point out that spending on each pupil is at its highest ever level and pupil-to-teacher ratios have never been better than they are today <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer is that no one will because the teachers have turned it down <e> <s> however that was the offer which would have resulted to the basic teacher on scale <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the answer is once bitten twice shy and twice bitten damn foolish <e> <s> i believe that the noble lord <e> <s> lord rochester referred to the houghton report <e> <s> this is a report which the teachers are always quoting

draw it to the attention of my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am absolutely certain that my right honourable friend read that debate with great interest and that he has taken note of what was said in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords the whole point of this bill which was defeated in this house was to give parents the right to choose whether or not they wanted their children caned so i do not think that the government can be considered dilatory in that regard <e> <s> we have no information about this particular matter apart from what was reported in the press <e> <s> suspension from school as such is not in breach of the european convention on human rights <e> <s> the discipline of a school is primarily a matter for head teachers and for governing bodies <e> <s> the local education authority concerned is no doubt aware of its general duty to provide education for this boy <e>", "<cs> question <e>", "<cs> my lords at a convenient moment after this afternoon my noble friend lord young of graffham with the leave of the house will repeat in the form of a statement the answer to a private notice question in another place on the consequences of the scottish court ruling that the assets of the trustee savings bank scotland belong to their depositors <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i will arrange for a statement that is to be made in another place on the monopolies and mergers commission report on the scottish and newcastle breweries to be printed in the <e>", "<cs> my lords in there

<e> <s> the government will continue to pursue policies to that end <e>", "<cs> my lords in there were nearly more graduates in science and engineering than in an increase of about a quarter <e> <s> however industry has indicated that it still needs more particularly in electronic engineering and computing <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may begin by welcoming the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey as the opposition spokesman on education and science in this house and wish him all the luck <e> <s> there has not been a cut in higher education as the noble lord suggests <e> <s> in fact since the number of home students has increased by more than <e> <s> the proportion of - to -year-olds entering higher education has increased by a tenth and the number of mature entrants has increased by a sixth <e> <s> our plans envisage further increases in opportunities to enter higher education over the next decade <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not often disagree with my noble friend lord nugent but on this point i think i must because at present per cent <e> <s> of university students and per cent <e> <s> of those in the public sector are not on science-related courses so i think that there is scope for change <e> <s> but my noble friend is quite right in saying that arts and humanities courses are also important <e> <s> as my right honourable friend the secretary of state has made clear rigorously taught such courses develop analytical and critical skills of broad vocational relevance and help transmit and enrich our cultural heritage <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that in answering the last supplementary question i said that i did not very often disagree with my noble friend <e> <s> i do not very often agree with the noble lord opposite but i do so on this occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that my noble friend will have to wait because detailed statistics on graduates subjects of study and on their employment destination are going to be published together with other related figures in a department of education and science statistical bulletin in late december or early january <e> <s> if my noble friend will wait patiently until then he will get all the figures <e>", "<cs> my lords our expenditure plans envisage small cash increases in grants to universities in the next few years <e> <s> the effect in real terms will depend upon the rate of inflation but a reasonable expectation might be that universities will need to make savings of just over per cent <e> <s> in each of the next two years and of rather less in <e> <s> we believe that these savings can be achieved through increases in efficiency so as to offer the taxpayer even better value for money <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we are getting rather wide of the question which is about the employment of graduates <e>", "<cs> my lords i gave my answer and i stand by it <e>", "<cs> my lords due to falling rolls the intake targets of some schools may need to be set below physical capacity to ensure the educational viability of others <e> <s> ilea is one of many local education authorities which see the need to do this but the government are not aware of any particular reports on its practice <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend that parental choice of school is very important <e> <s> i do not think i would go so far as to say it is paramount <e> <s> that is why the education act strikes a careful balance between the right of a parent to secure a place for his child at his preferred school and the need of the local education authority to be able to manage school provision efficiently in the interests of all the children in its area <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord lord alexander of potterhill has repeated in other terms what i said in my last supplementary answer <e> <s> i would therefore agree <e>", "<cs> my lords while i accept that some schools are more popular than others i do not think there is a black and white distinction

<e>", "<cs> my lords the intake of a school may not be reduced by more than per cent <e> <s> below its level unless my right honourable friend has approved public proposals to that effect in the light of any objections that they may attract <e> <s> my mental arithmetic is probably not as good as the noble baronesss but i think that on the figures she has quoted the ilea is probably within its rights because i do not think that the figures she has quoted would be more than a per cent <e> <s> reduction <e> <s> but of course it is open to local residents to make representations to the authority about these reductions if they are concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords this is what i have been saying all afternoon <e> <s> the answer is that under the act we tried to make it possible to respect parental choice but i think the noble lord is quite right when he says provided there is a place available <e> <s> i think what is worrying my noble friends behind me is that the ilea is saying that there are not places available when maybe there are <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to make a short statement about next weeks business <e> <s> it has been agreed through the usual channels that the main business next tuesday <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the secretary of state for education and science has announced several relevant measures including the publication of guidance on drugs misuse which has been made available to teachers and youth workers the preparation of curricula and teaching materials for use in the education service and the appointment by local education authorities of drug advisers funded by the education support grant <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that this will be greatly helped by the appointment of lea drug advisers <e> <s> these are expected to increase advice and support for schools and colleges and to provide more training for their staff as well as to improve liaison with the work of other local agencies <e> <s> it is extremely encouraging to know that each of the local education authorities has made a bid for the education support grant to fund the appointment of these drug advisers <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree very strongly with what the noble lord lord mellish has said <e> <s> obviously if the police can go in and talk about drugs <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that legislation on these lines will shortly be put in front of your lordships <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i am in favour of this and i hope that it will be done <e> <s> again i think that when these drug advisers are appointed this is just the sort of thing that they are likely to encourage <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that there are a number of measures being taken <e>", "<cs> again my lords it is hoped that when we have these lea drug advisers this is the sort of thing on which they will concentrate <e>", "<cs> my lords among a number of schemes for which the department of education and science has provided money some has been provided towards market research by andrew irving associates to ascertain how a publicity campaign should be directed <e>", "<cs> my lords the question on the order paper is <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble kinswoman for that supplementary question and of course i shall pass on what she has said to my honourable friend <e> <s> i should say that this booklet has been extremely well received <e> <s> i think that over copies have now been supplied round the country which is far more than the usual request for pamphlets produced by the des <e>", "<cs> my lords i am answering on behalf of the government and i am being briefed by the department of education and science <e> <s> i think we are moving slightly wide of the question <e>

cuts were received because i remember <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not going to enter into battle on the relative merits between wales and scotland <e> <s> the figures i gave were for past cuts and do not include future cuts <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the secretary of state for education and science accepted the advice of the advisory board for the research councils in that scientific priorities required a shift of funds towards work in areas such as information technology <e> <s> that shift could be accomplished only by reducing the funds going to the afrc from the science budget <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord lord mackie of benshie is right when he speaks about scotland <e> <s> i certainly would not argue with him on that matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i shall have to write to the noble earl lord halsbury with that information <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i was being at all cagey <e> <s> i have not only said that there were staff

course when any minister says during question time that he will write to a noble lord a copy of that reply is put into the library for all those interested to see <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that is

leave of the house repeat a statement that is to be made in another place on the exceptional weather aid scheme for farmers <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had minutes on this question <e> <s> the coincidence of it being on the order paper the day after the report has been produced has i am sure led to this <e> <s> i know that it is obviously a very important question but minutes on one question when the house is meant to spend minutes in total is perhaps long enough <e> <s> i suggest that we move on to the next question <e>", "<cs> my lords at a convenient moment after this afternoon my noble friend lady young will with the leave of the house repeat a statement that is to be made in another place on unesco <e> <s> it has been agreed through the usual channels that the

lords i really think that the noble baroness is being a little unkind <e> <s> i was prepared to answer her noble friend lord gladwyn but i had to sit down because my time was up and i wanted the noble baroness to have a chance to speak <e> <s> otherwise i answered just about every question that was put to me <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the secretary of state for education and science has considered all the available information about the difficulties at poundswick and has concluded that there is insufficient basis for his intervention under the very limited powers given to him by section of the education act <e> <s> nevertheless he is most concerned about the prolonged disruption to the education of many pupils and wrote to the manchester education authority on th december asking how they propose to bring the disruption to an end <e>", "<cs> my lords the original date for reply expired yesterday but i understand that talks have been going on all week between

understand that the talks are continuing and that there is some hope <e> <s> schools are governed in accordance with their articles of government <e> <s> the articles of poundswick school give the head teacher the power to suspend pupils where he or she considers that there is adequate cause <e> <s> but the <e>", "<cs> my lords just like the right reverend prelate i deplore vandalism in our schools and elsewhere <e> <s> it might be fair to say that the manchester authority set on record its own abhorrence of the kind of thing which happened here but on careful examination of the case they concluded that permanent exclusion of the five boys would have been an excessive punishment <e> <s> this is what gave rise to the dispute <e>", "<cs> yes my lords this is absolutely true but this is very much a matter for the local authority and perhaps unfortunately manchester did not take this view itself <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i understand the strength of feeling of the noble lord lord dean <e> <s> like him i can only hope that the negotiations prove favourable <e> <s> i do not think there is any possibility of my right honourable friend intervening any further because he simply does not have the powers <e> <s> the only power he has to intervene in local matters under section of the education act is if he is satisfied that the local education authority is in default of a statutory duty or under section of that act if he is satisfied that an authority has acted unreasonably <e> <s> the fact that an authority has acted unreasonably has been interpreted by the courts as meaning in a way which no reasonable authority could have acted having due regard to their statutory duties <e>", "<cs> my lords i am no lawyer <e> <s> that is what the act says <e> <s> i understand that my right honourable friend has taken very high legal advice about this matter and this is what he is advised <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to say this but we are going on at some length <e> <s> may i read from <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to congratulate the noble lord lord stewart of fulham on his success in the ballot and to thank him and all the other noble lords and baronesses who

carry out midday supervision <e> <s> they may well include teachers or of course there may be other people <e> <s> there are many other situations where children are supervised by adults who are not teachers <e> <s> it has been suggested that this reduces the midday supervision to mere child-minding as if that function were not in itself important <e> <s> i doubt whether many parents would agree <e> <s> their first concern must be to see that their children are safe and that their welfare is safeguarded <e> <s> many parents have found their lives disrupted because they have been asked often at short notice to take responsibility for their children at midday when they had already undertaken other commitments on the reasonable expectation that their children would be looked after by the school <e>", "<cs> the government do not accept that additional training should be a statutory requirement i underline those words for supervisory staff other than teachers <e> <s> as with other detailed aspects of new arrangements we believe that it is right to leave this in the hands of local education authorities <e> <s> i am sure that authorities will be guided by the principle that new supervisory staff must be capable of performing their tasks and of discharging the authoritys duty of care to the pupils in their charge <e> <s> no doubt some recruits will need short courses of training to fit them for their new role <e> <s> authorities have experience of providing training in such circumstances on which they will be able to build <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now adjourn during pleasure until half-past eight <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord irving has given us an opportunity this afternoon for a thoughtful debate about the nations schools

over the past years and that there is an enormous amount of dedicated imaginative and well-focused work going on in our schools today <e> <s> no criticism should be allowed to obscure that fact <e>

on human rights <e> <s> the united kingdom was one of the architects of the convention and was the first to ratify it <e> <s> we cannot just opt out because we do not always agree with the judgments that we find inconvenient <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> the decision of this house turned round the bill which the government considered was in keeping with the european court and that is why we are considering what action to take <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i have answered that question <e> <s> we are committed to the european court of human rights and we stand committed to it <e>", "<cs> my lords this afternoon my noble friend lady cox has provided us with the opportunity to debate an important issue and in a very powerful and excellent speech she has put some of those concerns before your lordships <e> <s> it is fundamental to the health of our society that our children and young people receive an unbiased education and any threat to this must clearly be regarded with the greatest concern <e> <s> the motion before us today refers to all phases of education but i shall concentrate my remarks on activities in our schools <e> <s> other issues raised by my noble friend and noble lords who will speak later which are more relevant to further and higher education will be answered by my noble friend lady hooper when she sums up at the end of the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure to which records my noble friend refers <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it depends on the school <e> <s> obviously the parents if they feel that this sort of thing has been going on in their school are quite entitled to approach my right honourable friends and they will weigh all the evidence that is given <e> <s> the more supporting evidence the parents can get obviously the stronger their case <e> <s> my right honourable friends have made clear that they take very seriously any such complaints they receive <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness lady nicol has no need to apologise <e> <s> her noble friend lord john-mackie is a most delightful person and i like seeing him across the dispatch box but it is equally as pleasing to see the noble baronesss pretty face <e> <s> there is no reason why she should apologise following the very kind remarks she made about the scheme <e> <s> i thank her for supporting it <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to introduce a bill to amend the law relating to education <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill he now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have allocated in response to proposals made by local education authorities education support grants totalling million to enable each authority to appoint a drug adviser from april onwards <e> <s> last month the government launched for young people a video package about drug misuse which has been made available free of charge to all secondary schools and local education authorities <e> <s> this package complements the booklet <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed i am aware that my noble friend was there because i believe i sat next to her during the showing of it <e> <s> i can assure her that the package comprises two video programmes the one which we saw which was based on the tv series minder and also another one <e> <s> there are forceful accompanying teachers notes and other material which will enable young people to explore their own attitudes values and feelings towards drugs and to practise relevant coping skills <e>", "<cs> my lords we had a debate the other day in which this subject was raised <e> <s> also we most warmly welcome the issue by the national association of head teachers of a most timely and responsible document called <e>", "<cs> my lords i think this is something any responsible teacher would wish to take on and it would be something that would come up normally <e> <s> i am not the noble baronesss noble friend though i like to think i am a friend of hers but i shall certainly draw the attention of my right honourable friend to her remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords there are no results yet through <e> <s> it would be very difficult to monitor because there are no central figures kept for drug misuse inside and outside school premises <e> <s> it would therefore be difficult to see what changes there have been as a result <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> schools may draw on the expertise of professionals in the health service as part of their health education programme which covers drug education <e> <s> such involvement by health service staff must be fully integrated into the schools teaching programme but of course the extent to which medical nursing and other professional staff are involved in these arrangements rests with individual health authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure my noble friend will know that the education service is not a national service but is provided by local authorities <e> <s> i think it is up to them in their own areas to decide whether or not they wish to monitor what is going on in their schools <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the right reverend prelate is not quite accustomed to this house and to the fact that statements are matters for short comments and questions to the minister and not matters on which to raise a debate <e> <s> perhaps he might very shortly put his question to the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord annan for giving us a further opportunity to debate higher education matters <e> <s> i am also grateful to the noble lord for recognising that our system of higher education has to learn to operate on less generous levels of provision than it would like and that this will require change <e> <s> but i am not sure that the noble lord has given enough credit for the change that has taken place or that is being pursued <e>", "<cs> i think this might be a convenient time to take the statement <e> <s> therefore i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> may i just say what a pleasure it is to have my noble friend lady young supporting me on this bill especially in what i know is the very busy life that she now leads <e> <s> when she moved the second reading of what became the education act she paid tribute to the knowledge and expertise in educational matters to be found in your lordships house <e> <s> this remains the case and i am sure that todays debate will provide a clear demonstration of that fact <e> <s> i think it altogether fitting that an education bill of the sort before us should start its passage through parliament in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords it is usual at this point to say a word about the arrangements for this afternoons two short debates <e> <s> the number of speakers for the two debates this afternoon in the names of the noble lords lord jenkins of putney and lord molloy is such that it is not necessary to propose any formal time limit but i am sure that noble lords will enter into the spirit of these short debates by keeping their speeches within the -minute limit which applies to the mover of the motion <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i start off by being a damp squib <e> <s> i must resist this amendment on two grounds <e> <s> first the provision is wrongly placed and i take the point made by the noble lord lord mcintosh that this is perfectly acceptable under the long title of the bill <e> <s> in spite of that i feel that this is not a matter which falls to be dealt with in the individual schools articles of government <e> <s> it would have to be a free standing duty on leas <e>", "<cs> the only thing i can add is that i do not think i have ever implied or delivered criticism of the work of the ombudsman and i am delighted to see the noble baroness lady serota sitting on the bench opposite <e> <s> that was not my idea <e> <s> my point was simply that parents will still have a right to go to the ombudsman when they have a complaint about education <e> <s> so far as concerns a young persons ombudsman certainly if such an appointment were practicable i imagine that it would bring in the social services children in care and goodness knows what else <e> <s> i should not have thought that it could possibly have been the responsibility of the local education authority <e>", "<cs> the government recognise the legitimate concern of the churches to ensure that functions which have traditionally been exercised by aided and special agreement school governing bodies under articles of government cannot under the new provisions in clause for the lea to make instruments and articles of government be removed from them <e> <s> the government share this objective <e> <s> however i have to say that we disagree with the right reverend prelate on the basis for this argument <e>", "<cs> may i say to the right reverend prelate that all i said was that i would be referring to them during the right reverend prelates next amendment <e>", "<cs> i note that this amendment follows a suggestion made by the right reverend prelate the bishop of rochester during the second reading debate <e> <s> we recognise the anxiety of the churches that any function currently bestowed on governing bodies by articles of government should not be usurped by leas when the articles are remade <e> <s> we also recognise that the suggestion that there should be model instruments and articles produced by the department of education and science is intended to be helpful as it is thought that the existence of model governmental documents will reduce the number of questions referred to the secretary of state because the lea and the voluntary school governing body cannot agree on the terms of the instrument or articles or both <e>", "<cs> the look on my face was not one of pain but one of acute hunger because i am on a very strict diet and allowed only one meal a day <e> <s> my stomach has been rumbling audibly for the past quarter of an hour <e> <s> but i apologise as i must not be frivolous on this important amendment <e>", "<cs> i think this might be a convenient time to adjourn not only for my convenience but also for that of other noble lords <e> <s> before resuming the house may i suggest that we do not return to this bill until twenty minutes to nine oclock <e> <s> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> the reason why aided and special agreement schools are treated differently under this bill is simply that they are different <e> <s> i should like to take this opportunity of repeating the high value <e>", "<cs> the moment has come when i am going to show that the government are far from rigid on this point <e> <s> i think that i shall go the whole way that the noble lord lord kilmarnock asked me to <e>", "<cs> having heard from my noble friend at the express invitation of the noble lord who moved the amendment i do not think that i need say very much <e> <s> i was not absolutely certain what was behind the amendment because as my noble friend lord renton said the bill provides for specialist representation on the governing bodies of maintained special schools not established in a hospital by the appropriate organisation or organisations <e>", "<cs> i draw attention to the provisions of subsection of this clause which gives some guidance on the conduct of parent governor elections <e> <s> the government recognise that there has been some confusion about the provisions of section of the act and parents rights to participate in parent governor elections <e> <s> subsection clarifies the position <e> <s> it prevents for example leas or governing bodies deciding that only one vote per household is allowed <e>", "<cs> we have probably made enough progress on the bill for one evening <e> <s> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand from the research councils that research involving animals has contributed to the prevention of disease through the development of vaccines notably against diphtheria polio smallpox measles tuberculosis and whooping cough <e> <s> in addition to disease prevention tests on animals have also led to improved treatments for diseases such as pneumonia diabetes leukaemia and some other cancers to more effective surgical techniques particularly in organ transplantation and heart surgery and to establishing the efficacy and the safety of medicines and other products <e> <s> animal health too benefits from such work <e>", "<cs> no my lords i do not think so <e> <s> as i am sure your lordships are aware a bill is currently going through parliament the animals scientific procedures bill <e> <s> this is supported not only by the research councils but also by a number of the more responsible animal rights organisations <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i am sure that that is absolutely right <e> <s> i should also add that unfortunately some experimentation on animals is necessary to protect the welfare of human beings too in this country <e>", "<cs> yes my lords and experimenting with animals is also quite an expensive operation in itself so there is much to commend not doing more than is absolutely necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords i should be surprised if that information is inadequately known because the bill took up a considerable amount of time in your lordships house <e> <s> i believe that at the present time it has just finished its committee stage in the commons so there is plenty of literature about it <e> <s> i think that it will be well known and when it becomes law the measures which it introduces will also be widely known <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure there is a certain amount of feeling about cosmetics <e> <s> the products must be safe and the safety testing of <e>", "<cs> my lords i know we have the television cameras on us but in spite of that i do not think that noble lords need to make up with lipstick too much <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to echo the unanimous thanks to the noble lord lord gregson for initiating what has been a most useful debate on a subject of great importance to the united <e>", "<cs> my lords at a convenient moment after this afternoon my noble friend lord lyell will with the leave of the house repeat in the form of a statement an answer to a private notice question in another place on the safety of members of the royal ulster constabulary and their families <e>", "<cs> my lords the need for the royal greenwich observatory to maintain an independent group of atomic clocks has been greatly reduced by the availability of co-ordinated universal time via satellite <e> <s> in consequence the serc does not intend to replace all the atomic clocks at the observatory as they become unserviceable <e>", "<cs> my lords it may come as a surprise and perhaps a shock to my noble friend to learn that we rely on other countries for our time at the present moment <e> <s> this will not change because the independent clocks throughout the world are co-ordinated in france and in fact the headquarters have always been in paris and a co-ordinated universal time is available via the navstar global positioning system satellite service <e> <s> however i can cheer up my noble friend by telling him that the observatory will in fact continue to provide the six pips by reference to the international atomic timescale available by satellite and its remaining clocks <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord said at the end of his supplementary question this is a very wide-ranging issue <e> <s> in fact there is no connection between the two neither has anything to do with the other <e> <s> the decision not to replace the atomic clocks has nothing to do with any proposed move by the royal observatory <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to tell my noble kinswoman and the house that this is indeed the case <e> <s> i think we have all seen on television recently the international experiments with halleys comet in which a number of countries including russia joined <e> <s> also of course in the field of astronomy the astronomers get together internationally very much in this field <e>", "<cs> perhaps my lords we ought to send them up in meteorological balloons <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i did say in my first supplementary answer that the international timing since its inception has been controlled from paris <e>", "<cs> sometimes my lords during question time in this house i wonder who on earth does control the time <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i announced on th february in reply to a question by my noble friend lord cranbrook that the secretary of state for education and science and agriculture ministers had decided to privatise the national seed development organisation and part of the plant breeding institute provided this can be achieved on satisfactory terms <e> <s> i also said that we intend to appoint financial advisers <e> <s> lazard brothers company limited have now been commissioned to carry out a preliminary study of the options for privatisation <e> <s> they have been asked to report in early may <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise that we have been talking about this matter for some time <e> <s> on the other hand if we had acted quickly the noble lord lord john-mackie would have been quick enough in getting up and questioning whether the government were acting with undue haste and without consultation <e> <s> so far as the staff are concerned i agree that they are the main asssets of the pbi and the nsdo <e> <s> in fact the morale of key staff is holding up admirably and we recognise the importance of retaining them especially at this time of uncertainty about the future of the two organisations <e> <s> for that reason we shall be seeking to take decisions as soon as possible consulting the staff through the respective governing bodies about the form of any privatisation <e>", "<cs> my lords individuals are of course free to leave at any time <e> <s> however i think that morale is higher now than before we announced that there was to be privatisation <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i would agree with the noble lord lord walston that the pbi has been successful in producing many valuable varieties and that the nsdo has also performed commendably its role of marketing finished varieties produced by the state institutes <e> <s> however there has been some reduction in the level of funding at the pbi and other institutes and it is sensible to look for ways to make this up <e> <s> it is government policy to encourage industry funding of r d to improve technology transfer from publicly funded research to industry for the benefit of the uk recovery and to consider privatisation where this might foster sound management commercial efficiency and good value for money for the taxpayers <e> <s> it is therefore entirely appropriate that the position of the pbi and the nsdo should be reviewed in this way <e>", "<cs> yes my lords the whole of the pbi will not be going <e> <s> i apologise but i have forgotten the second part of the question <e>", "<cs> no my lords because we hope that the site will remain <e> <s> we shall not sell off the whole of the pbi <e> <s> so far as the first part of the question is concerned namely whether we shall take into account other factors the answer is that yes we certainly shall do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i can give the noble lord lord cledwyn more than a crumb of comfort in that so far as the welsh plant breeding station is concerned no change is planned <e> <s> i must however express some reservation about the idea of a white paper though i shall of course draw it to the attention of my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> no my lords i would not accept that from the noble lord <e> <s> indeed i shall never forget the debate we had on that subject and i very much take the points that he made <e> <s> but i was trying to tell the noble lord that it is not going to be sold off <e> <s> of course i shall draw my right honourable friends attention to what has been said this afternoon and ask whether he will consider publication of a white paper <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the last part of the noble lords supplementary is concerned we shall be considering any suggestion that is put to us <e> <s> i understand that the nfu for instance are interested and we shall be examining positively any proposals that they put forward <e>", "<cs> my lords they are both questions that we shall be considering <e>", "<cs> my lords not to me at any rate <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we have decided that we shall answer one supplementary at a time <e> <s> i shall have to write to the noble lord on that one <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> when my noble friend lord beloff introduced this amendment he said that it was i think i have got the words right a modest little amendment <e> <s> that was echoed by the noble lord lord henderson of brompton <e> <s> i think that the debate has shown that it is nothing of the sort <e> <s> i am very much going to echo what the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey has said because i really should like to point out to the committee that it is neither necessary nor wise in this present bill to move along these lines <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that i have to start with a rather negative attitude to amendment no <e> <s> because it has been moved with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> is the one which would exclude the teaching or discussion of politics from the secular curriculum of any maintained primary school <e>", "<cs> no he is not <e> <s> what he is trying to do to save all your lordships time in what looks as though it will be a session going on probably until the early hours of tomorrow morning is to explain why we feel that the legislation elements which are common to all of them are not the appropriate way to proceed <e> <s> of course i shall be replying to all of them and listening very carefully to what is said <e>", "<cs> i entirely agree <e> <s> i think that the noble lord lord parry reinforces my point <e> <s> it is for that small minority that we have to try to get something that will work in law <e> <s> it is not for the great majority who are the sort of teachers which the noble viscount lord tonypandy and the noble lord lord parry remember having been taught by and probably teaching us themselves <e> <s> it is not those sort of people that we are after <e> <s> it is the people who will try to find a way through the legislation <e>", "<cs> i am very greatful to my noble friend lord trenchard <e> <s> this is just the sort of peg that we are trying to get through in this statement <e> <s> it is just the sort of thing that we are trying to encourage so that there will it is hoped be an agreed statement in which everyone will know where they stand <e> <s> this will help those people who are worried to come forward <e>", "<cs> i shall do my best <e> <s> i apologise <e> <s> i must take issue i think with some of my noble friends with my noble friend lord orr-ewing and also with the noble lord lord harris of greenwich about the fact that my colleagues are asking for evidence and when we produce it we do not act on it but ask for more <e> <s> perhaps i could just mention the examples that have been produced tonight <e> <s> i think of the william patten school to which my noble friend referred where the head teacher miss smidt was reported to have led pupils on demonstrations and to have advocated left-wing bias in the teaching <e>", "<cs> we are not complacent <e> <s> i thoroughly take all that my noble friend lord home has said <e> <s> we shall try working at it <e> <s> but i do not honestly think that the particular legislation as suggested tonight is the right way <e> <s> i am grateful to hear all round that my noble friend is not going to press this and perhaps we would not win it if she did <e> <s> but that is not the real reason <e> <s> i think we are trying as hard as we can <e> <s> we realise that it exists and that it is an extremely worrying subject <e>", "<cs> i should like to reply briefly to four questions which have been raised <e> <s> my noble <e>", "<cs> i start with the alleged <e>", "<cs> i did not raise the subject <e> <s> i am simply replying to it as it has been mentioned on many sides of the committee <e> <s> i think perhaps the noble lord lord parry is right and we should return to amendment no <e> <s> which puts a duty on local education authorities to forbid teaching which would undermine commitment to parliamentary democracy or the rule of law <e> <s> i am sure that no noble lord would oppose the intention behind this amendment <e>", "<cs> i think there is a problem <e> <s> in view of the fact that i have spent quite a lot of time telling the committee what the government are trying to do about it perhaps it is the noble earl who is wasting his time <e>", "<cs> again i have to say that amendment no <e> <s> does not solve the problems of definition evidence and enforceability to which i have referred <e> <s> partisan political views like partisan political activities is an imprecise term and one <e>", "<cs> it would be very churlish of me not to look at this amendment in view of the fact that i have said that i shall look at the others because it was no fault whatever of the noble lord lord ritchie that the usual channels somewhere along the line became clogged <e> <s> if we had been taking the amendments together i should have said that i would have a look at them all <e> <s> therefore i shall certainly take this amendment away and look at it with the others <e> <s> however i must point out that again the words impartial and objective do not look very easy to put into law <e> <s> having said that i shall certainly look at the amendment with the others <e>", "<cs> i had understood originally that we were trying to get to amendment no <e> <s> a but i realise that there is little hope of doing that <e> <s> i understand that we are to adjourn in approximately five minutes time <e>", "<cs> while speaking against this particular amendment i must say that the intention behind it the desire to ensure that parents and others are fully informed of the governors statement of curricular aims is one that i fully endorse <e> <s> i hope however by explaining relevant provisions elsewhere in the bill and in other legislation to convince your lordships committee that a further statutory requirement to that effect would be an unnecessary addition to current arrangements <e>", "<cs> the parents will have a lot of powers that they do not have now to insist and to have a resolution passed at their annual meeting <e> <s> if they have to wait one year say for the first annual meeting then they can thereafter insist on having the reports published as they come out <e> <s> i do not believe that there is any great problem <e> <s> to ask for three publications about each school really would be very expensive and unnecessary <e>", "<cs> we have perhaps gone far enough although not as far as i should like to have gone or i am sure some of your lordships <e> <s> i think we are beginning to feel the strain so i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i was rather surprised to see this amendment <e> <s> the committee will recognise it as being almost identical to amendment no <e> <s> which was tabled by the right reverend prelate the bishop of london in the light of a meeting which had been arranged between my right honourable friend and the right reverend prelate on th april <e> <s> this issue raised by the previous amendment and repeated in this one was fully discussed at that meeting when it was understood that the right reverend prelate the bishop of london accepted that his withdrawn amendment was not entirely appropriate <e>", "<cs> if i may answer the noble baroness i think there is absolutely nothing between us on this matter <e> <s> the point i was trying to make was in connection with amendment no <e> <s> which we discussed where the right reverend prelate the bishop of london was very happy that this should be the subject of a meeting and the government undertook to come back with appropriate amendments later on <e> <s> there are a number of amendments which will be proposed by the right reverend prelate later and i think that there is really nothing between the government and the church on any of the amendments <e> <s> we have given an undertaking to do it that way and i believe that a change at this stage would be counter-productive <e>", "<cs> the very special role of the governing body of an aided or special agreement school is one which the government fully recognise <e> <s> that is why they have taken the opportunity afforded by this bill to extend control of the curriculum already vested in the governing bodies of aided secondary schools by the act to the governing bodies of all aided and special agreement schools <e> <s> i know that this is something which has been widely welcomed by the churches and those involved in voluntary education <e>", "<cs> i have just seen the noble lord lord annan heading out of the chamber and i am sure no he is not going he would wish to retract what he said about civil servants <e> <s> in this committee the three of us sitting here are a fair target for all that is thrown at us but i am sure as the noble lord appreciates the civil service cannot answer back <e> <s> he used rather intemperate language about the officials which is not perhaps in the best traditions of this house <e>", "<cs> i think that this may be a convenient time to take the statement <e> <s> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> the effect of this amendment would be to require the governors of all maintained schools to make available a statement of their schools curriculum on demand <e> <s> my noble friends have explained however that what is sought is a very detailed statement in effect the syllabuses the pupils will study while they are at school so that for example parents wishing to avoid certain views being taught to their children can make an informed choice of school based on sufficient knowledge <e>", "<cs> we shall continue as quickly as we can with the consultations <e> <s> i cannot give an undertaking that it will be in this house because we seem to be getting later and later with this bill <e> <s> it may be here before we finish the bill in this house <e> <s> but as i said in my answer my right honourable friends current regulation-making powers under this act may be sufficient as they stand <e> <s> but we wish to consult and i hope it will be as soon as possible <e> <s> i cannot give an absolute promise that it will be before the bill has left your lordships house but i hope that it will be <e>", "<cs> i think the government are fairly used to being defeated in your lordships house and it is not the usual understanding of this house that the government necessarily get up and straightaway say what they feel about it and i do not intend to do so on this occasion <e>", "<cs> corporal punishment has just been abolished in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> if your lordships will forgive me i wonder why amendment no <e> <s> has been called before amendment no <e> <s> a <e> <s> we have had a discussion about whether we should teach mathematics in schools but it seems a strange way of proceeding <e>", "<cs> i can only say that i think this is one thing produced in the marshalled list for which the department of education and science is not responsible <e>", "<cs> this is covered by the act which defines a parent as including <e>", "<cs> the amendment is not intended to address the churchs concern as expressed in amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> we have a great deal of sympathy with the concerns expressed by the right reverend prelate in those amendments <e> <s> we are considering whether it is possible to go some way towards meeting them without undermining the ultimate responsibility of leas to secure the education of children in their areas <e>", "<cs> of course i sympathise with the intention behind this amendment of making governors more accessible <e> <s> it is however important to bear in mind while considering this amendment the structure of the clause and its interaction with clause concerning the parents annual meeting <e> <s> this clause sets out certain minimum requirements as to the contents of the governors annual report <e> <s> subsection <e>", "<cs> i did not say that it was dangerous <e>", "<cs> i was not suggesting that a parent should have to contact the governors through the clerk <e> <s> i was suggesting that the clerk would know the addresses of the governors so that if a parent really wanted to know their addresses it would not be all that difficult to obtain them <e>", "<cs> in responding to the noble lord perhaps i may follow his excellent example and also speak to the governments own two amendments nos <e> <s> a and a <e>", "<cs> i appreciate that this amendment is proposed in the light of the governing bodys position as employer of the head teacher in an aided school but the effect of it would be that the local education authority could not ensure that it is informed about the discharge of the head teachers responsibilities in relation to the school <e> <s> this could have a direct bearing on the authoritys overall responsibility for securing sufficient and efficient educational opportunities for the pupils of the area <e>", "<cs> your lordships may recall from our earlier proceedings that i acknowledged that the government agreed that some clarification of the position of non-teaching staff at aided schools was desirable <e> <s> indeed this was discussed further at the famous meeting which i have mentioned a lot this evening <e> <s> i do not think there is any disagreement at all between the government and the churches on the sort of provision required but the precise form has not yet been agreed after necessary consultations <e> <s> i have to suggest to the right reverend prelate that his amendment may not be entirely suitable <e> <s> in fact he did himself mention the act and after all this amendment leaves untouched section of that act as amended by paragraph of schedule to the bill and at the least those who have to interpret the legislation would find these two not entirely complementary provisions somewhat confusing <e> <s> the government have undertaken that once agreement is reached they will table their own amendment and on that basis i ask the right reverend prelate to withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> i am happy to say yet again that there is no difference between the government and the churches over the purpose of this amendment <e>", "<cs> i do not think there were before the amendment was drafted <e> <s> this amendment just brings the bill into line with what we thought we were doing in the first place <e> <s> certainly there were consultations with everyone concerned before the bill was drafted <e>", "<cs> these amendments would restrict the discretion of local authorities and the secretary of state to allocate the resources available for in-service training so as to reflect relative needs and priorities <e> <s> this would undermine the bills aim of promoting the more systematic and purposeful planning of in-service training <e>", "<cs> the effect of this amendment would be that the schools premises would at all times be under the control of the lea <e> <s> here i think i am going to tackle the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey and put forward an extremely good case as to why the government think that they have this right <e> <s> in fact we hope that this clause will have the effect of increasing community use of school premises and we intend to offer post-act guidance to that effect <e> <s> the noble lord lord mcintosh mentioned the debate that we had on community schools and the part that i took in it <e> <s> i should like to repeat that school premises are a public asset and the government believe that they should be as fully utilised as practicable within the resources available <e> <s> in our view and this is where i differ from lord mcintosh governing bodies are well placed to ensure that the community served by the school is offered reasonable opportunities to make use of the schools facilities <e>", "<cs> even at this late hour i think i must rise to that <e> <s> i did not say that <e> <s> what i said was that where this had been working in the past in a local authority that particularly liked this arrangement i did not necessarily say that it was a better arrangement it could be continued under the act <e> <s> i admitted that it may be more difficult but that was not the reason i put forward for dismissing the noble lords amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords at st march about days or one and a quarter months supply of beef was stored in intervention stocks throughout the european community <e> <s> of the total amount of tonnes just over tonnes were stored in the united kingdom <e> <s> the cost of intervention storage varies depending on the amount in store at any particular time <e> <s> in the cost to the community budget of storing intervention beef amounted to million european currency units or about million <e> <s> in the governments view a properly managed policy with less reliance on intervention to support the beef market should encourage consumption and discourage the accumulation of costly surpluses <e>", "<cs> yes my lords my noble friend is right that that is one reason for the current large surplus <e> <s> there are others such as over-production <e> <s> beef is bound to deteriorate <e> <s> it depends on how long it is stored but it certainly goes off in time <e>", "<cs> yes my lords the noble lord is entirely right and he has more experience on that than most people in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords we consider that intervention is a wasteful and relative inefficient way of supporting the beef sector and so in principle we support the commissions basic approach of shifting the emphasis of producer support away from intervention more directly to the producer <e> <s> we shall however need to look carefully at the commissions alternative proposals which would not as they stand provide adequate support for our beef producers <e> <s> i am afraid that i do not know whether the meeting has finished or when we shall be reporting but i shall let the leader of the opposition know that <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall have to write to my noble friend with that answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know the exact cost but it is certainly high <e>", "<cs> my lords the spastics society has submitted an application for central government funding towards a proposed study of conductive education and that is at present under close consideration <e> <s> there are no funds available to the secretary of state for education and science from which he could pay directly for an independent programme of conductive education <e>", "<cs> my lords i honestly do not know the size of that particular school in hungary <e> <s> i think that my noble friends figure of per cent <e> <s> is right <e> <s> however i ought to point out that i also understand that the children are very much selected as to those who are most likely to succeed in walking before they are taken to that school <e>", "<cs> my lords i was aware of the project but not of quite so much detail as is the noble baroness who knows more about it than i do <e> <s> i understand that the dhss was approached for funding in respect of the conductive education project in birmingham but decided after very careful consideration that it would be inappropriate to support that particular project <e> <s> it was made clear last year to the sponsors of the birmingham project that the des would be ready to consider a more limited scheme concerned with producing an effective evaluation of the system of conductive education as practised in hungary and its transferability to this country <e> <s> the university has not as yet submitted a formal application along those lines <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i assure the noble lord that we shall be following with interest what goes on <e> <s> however we feel that there is a lot more research needed into the subject <e> <s> that is why the approach now being made by the spastics society is being considered with great sympathy <e> <s> i understand that there is no consensus of opinion about that method of treatment <e> <s> some professionals have been very enthusiastic about it particularly in the field of cerebral palsy and in some aspects of mental handicap and other neurological handicaps <e> <s> others in the field including her majestys inspectorate have reservations <e> <s> they feel that although the method may be considered impressive in respect of movement it can be at the expense of other areas of educational and social development <e>", "<cs> my lords conductive education has been developed in hungary where it is used as the main basis for the early education of physically handicapped children and as a method of treating or re-educating adults with major handicaps <e> <s> the essence of the method is to treat children and others like normal individuals with the object of educating them on general subjects but incorporating into the general subjects lessons on how to eat walk sit and solve problems <e> <s> children are allocated to one particular superperson who is a cross between a teacher and therapist and is known as a conductor who takes them through the whole process of education as they grow older <e>", "<cs> my lords i bow to the superior knowledge of the noble baroness in respect of what goes on in and around birmingham <e> <s> i am sure that she is absolutely right <e>", "<cs> my lords at a convenient moment after this afternoon my noble friend lord glenarthur will with the leave of the house repeat a statement that is to be made in another place on the prison officers dispute <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lady young made clear on second reading that the government hope that the negotiations now taking place will make sufficient progress to allow an early start to the practical field work which the government have long wanted to launch <e> <s> we do not expect the talks themselves to lay down an exact working model but we hope progress will be made <e> <s> we have no national blueprint to impose <e>", "<cs> i should not reply as the noble baroness speaks from a sedentary position but the whole idea is that from now on this should be the situation <e> <s> she also asked what is the point when <e>", "<cs> the teacher will be able to meet the people who are appraising him and will be able to discuss the appraisal and make very clear what he thinks about it <e> <s> that is something which does not happen at this time <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble lord lord alexander whom i very much respect is getting somewhat carried away here <e> <s> this is not laying down what teachers must or must not do <e> <s> this is saying that if teachers do things which are bringing extra credit to them and to the schools in helping the children that should be recognised as such in their appraisal <e>", "<cs> the notes on clauses refer to the acas talks which are going on and where the government fervently hope that a voluntary agreement will come out <e> <s> if that is reached then the power will not be used <e>", "<cs> i think this might be a convenient moment to take the statement <e> <s> i beg to move that the house be now resumed <e>", "<cs> for the second time i find myself making a clause stand part speech on the amendment <e> <s> we seem to have had a number of points made in the last debate all over again <e> <s> noble lords will be aware that in <e>", "<cs> if we honestly had these things i for one should not be moving the bill from this side of the house

framework for it <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will accept what i say <e> <s> i would not have anything to do with such a thing as he describes if i had to put it forward for the government <e>", "<cs> the effect of this amendment would be to have an outsider unspecified but defined as being independent of the lea concerned involved in the appraisal of each and every teacher <e> <s> the motive as the noble lord lord kilmarnock has expressed is to ensure fairness for the individual <e> <s> such fairness is clearly essential and the government are most concerned that appraisal arrangements should embody adequate safeguards for the individual <e> <s> but the education service would be unique if it were to have an external element carried into its appraisal <e>", "<cs> this amendment as has been admirably explained would require that regulations made by the secretary of state on the subject of teacher appraisal should not come into force unless they have been laid before and approved by affirmative resolution of each house of parliament <e> <s> i would not go so far as the noble lord lord somers on this <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord somers spoke in support of this clause on two occasions <e> <s> however i can understand all that the noble and learned lord lord wilson of langside has said if with all respect he believes what the noble lord lord alexander of potterhill reads into this provision which is that all the teachers will be taken over by some coup by my right honourable friend and paid for centrally <e> <s> if members believe that then i can understand the reasons for their anxiety <e> <s> however as i have tried to explain that is not the point of the provision <e> <s> the negative procedure is perfectly adequate to cope with anything which may arise under this clause or indeed the rest of the bill <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful for that remark <e>", "<cs> there seems to be a general misunderstanding but i can give a categorical undertaking that what has been put forward is not in the mind of either my right honourable friend or anyone else in the government at present <e>", "<cs> yes i can indeed it has been going on for a long time <e> <s> the governments intentions on appraisal were first set out in march in <e>", "<cs> clause will enable the government to grant-aid local authority expenditure on the in-service training of teachers and certain others closely involved in the education service <e> <s> it is idely accepted that the current arrangements are imperfect and that a more systematic approach to the planning of in-service training is required at local level <e> <s> a new system of grants would create the framework for more purposeful and systematic planning <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord kilmarnock has explained that this is a probing amendment and that the intention behind it is to facilitate the establishment of new small aided schools in inner-city areas especially by parents who may not be able to afford the promoters financial responsibility for such schools <e> <s> the government very much sympathise with the thinking behind this amendment and i am sure it strikes a chord with many noble lords <e> <s> however i do not believe the amendment provides the right answer quite apart from the technical defects which the noble lord himself admitted <e>", "<cs> i find myself in difficulty because i thought that the noble lord was going to oppose this clause for a completely different reason <e>", "<cs> i cannot imagine how the noble lord could not have thought of that but he did not <e>", "<cs> this might be a convenient moment to break <e> <s> in moving that the house do now resume i suggest that we do not return to this bill until five minutes past eight oclock <e> <s> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> the government have great sympathy with the views underlying this clause <e> <s> we have repeatedly reaffirmed both in this house and in another place the vital need to uphold freedom of speech within the law and above all in our institutions of higher education <e> <s> i know that the noble and learned lord lord denning was not pleased at being pelted with flour <e>

always find it quite amusing when students seem to complain about their grants that they always seem to have enough money to buy eggs and flour to pelt at people that they do not like <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been a debate during which concern about the nations investment in education and science has been expressed from a variety of perspectives <e> <s> i am very grateful to the noble baroness for introducing it and for introducing it in the way that she did <e> <s> i shall attempt to answer some of the points which have been made and i hope that i may be permitted to begin by <e>", "<cs> my lords i never for a moment implied that the noble lord used the word skulduggery <e> <s> i just said that he hinted at it and as is typical of the noble lord of course he did it in the most gentle of ways <e> <s> i would just remind him in fact it was this government who authorised the publication of the hmi reports so we are quite prepared for the facts to be known and we are not trying to keep them hidden <e> <s> as i understand it the total expenditure on books has risen but some authorities have seen it as more appropriate to spend money on equipment rather than on books <e> <s> but the total provision for books and equipment has risen <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat in the form of a statement the answer to a private notice question that is being given in another place on the interim settlement of the teachers pay dispute <e> <s> the statement is as follows last friday the burnham primary and secondary committee agreed to increase teachers salaries in england and wales from st april by per cent <e> <s> or whichever is the greater <e> <s> this agreement was reached following undertakings to the management panel from all

prejudice to any subsequent consideration by burnham in the light of progress in the ongoing talks embracing all the aspects being discussed under the aegis of acas <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful for the manner in which both the noble lords lord irving of dartford and lord ritchie of dundee have received the statement <e> <s> the noble lord lord irving asked whether the government would make immediate extra finance available <e> <s> i am afraid that they will not <e> <s> fridays settlement did not purport to satisfy the governments conditions for extra resources <e> <s> it was made clear to local authority employers in advance of last fridays burnham <e>", "<cs> no my lords i am afraid that i cannot agree with my noble friend <e> <s> the whole point is that the teachers are

perhaps have quite such a busy day tomorrow we have a long education bill to go through later today <e>", "<cs> my lords not only do i apologise to the noble lord the leader of the opposition but as somebody who lived in what in my day at any race was a principality which i think is even more grand than a nation i apologise to any welsh members of your lordships house inside or outside of it

welcomed the statement <e> <s> i pointed out that there will be more money available but said i did not know how much that would be because it is a matter that has not been decided <e> <s> but there will be more money and i should have thought that everybody was grateful at this time for more money <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome very much what the noble lord lord annan has asked me <e> <s> it is a pity that when i was making my statement i looked to see whether he was in his usual place and did not see him there because i thought i might have a little support from that quarter <e> <s> the

annual parents meeting or direct to the secretary of state <e> <s> if the secretary of state feels that the lea has acted unreasonably in the sense of that word as interpreted by the courts in appointing a parent governor rather than holding an election it would be open to him to direct the authority to remedy the matter by holding an election <e> <s> whether or not practicable elections

i said some are post-degree and others are sub-degree <e> <s> subjects for debate are matters for the usual channels <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend lady hooper said in a written reply to the noble lord on rd june the authority accepts that parts of the teachers guide to the pack are inappropriate and has undertaken to revise them <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that ilea has said that it will not issue any more copies of the pack until the text has been revised <e> <s> the department has written to the authority suggesting that the pack be withdrawn meanwhile if the necessary amendments cannot be made quickly and the reply to that has yet to be received <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i agree entirely with my noble friend that this pack is monstrous and that is why the department has written to the authority suggesting that the pack be withdrawn <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord would have me answer a hypothetical question <e> <s> it would not be right to do so because matters are not helped by conjecture and the government in fact decide their actions on the basis of the circumstances of an actual case <e> <s> they would need to know for example if matters fell out as the noble lords question implies why it was that ilea has decided to act in that way <e> <s> what i can say though is <e>", "<cs> my lords the letter went on th may <e> <s> as i understand it even if elections take place it is still the same authority though the personalities may have changed <e> <s> we have given it a lot of time <e> <s> by the same expression we do not expect it to take very much longer to answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i should be delighted to be compared with sir humphrey <e> <s> the answer to my noble friends question is not very much longer <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure what the noble and learned lord is asking for a copy of <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall undertake to the noble and learned lord and other noble lords to have that placed in the library forthwith but i think it may horrify some of your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is not the first person to have had trouble with this noble house <e>", "<cs> my lords i undertake that when it is produced that will be done <e>", "<cs> my lords in march of this year the department of education and science issued a bulletin safety in education bulletin no <e> <s> to local education authorities and to schools containing general guidance to all involved with the organisation of outdoor pursuits and school expeditions <e> <s> the bulletin supplemented previous departmental guidance on the subject and in particular drew on lessons arising from the lands end tragedy <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to say that i think that schools continue to produce a number of educational and outdoor expeditions <e> <s> i understand that the numbers are not in fact falling off <e> <s> copies of the bulletin have been distributed widely through leas and other education bodies who are free to reprint the guidance to schools and colleges without copyright restriction <e> <s> i cannot answer my noble friend as to whether every school in england and wales has received a copy of it <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that that would be a good thing <e> <s> in fact her majestys inspectors and the department concentrate on getting the right advice out to schools to see that these awful accidents do not take place so that first aid is not necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords the government welcome the attention drawn to this important document which has indeed been received by the department of education and science and a number of other departments <e> <s> we recognise the urgent need to increase participation by key sectors of the labour force such as engineers and technicians in regular flexible and up-to-date continuing education in order to secure growing competitiveness of british goods and services <e> <s> we shall encourage colleges and universities to develop continuing education for engineers along the lines suggested by the reports good practice <e> <s> we are considering the reports evidence of need for further funding incentives for institutions and its call for further publicity and support for individuals employers and professional institutions <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i am very grateful to the noble lord for asking this question <e> <s> this is a report that we wish to publicise as much as possible <e> <s> what he says is very much the message that comes out of it <e> <s> the essential message i believe is the need to bring about a change in attitude so that all the individuals concerned see the necessity for keeping themselves up to date and well trained <e>", "<cs> my lords i have read the report but that is not one of the messages i draw from <e>", "<cs> my lords the report came out less than a month ago <e> <s> obviously it has budget implications <e> <s> i cannot therefore tell the noble lord when we intend to take a decision <e> <s> but i should make it clear that the government take the view that the cost of updating training should normally be paid by the beneficiaries who are usually the employers <e> <s> however we recognise that if this work is to expand in the way we think necessary development funds are required and we have made a start by increasing the pickup programme to million this year <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have made it clear both in the white paper <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend has any examples of schools which are not carrying out the law it would be a good thing if he were to raise them with my right honourable friend who would be very interested indeed to learn of such cases <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that schools are not flouting the statute because the government believe strongly that the statutory framework for religious education and collective worship has stood the test of time <e> <s> similarly the act provides that a pupil may be excused from attending collective worship at the request of his or her parents <e>", "<cs> no my lords he has not but i must say that the department receives very few complaints <e> <s> for example there were six complaints in alleging a breach of the statutory requirements for collective worship and another three in respect of the giving of religious education <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the parent has a right to go to the secretary of state who in turn can go to the courts <e> <s> i think perhaps the government are not yet so pushed that the secretary of state would have to apply for legal aid <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a certain amount of sympathy with the noble lord on the last point <e> <s> i think that if some of the right reverend prelates could make up their minds about whom we were to worship and why it might help certain humble believers like me <e> <s> at the same time it is the law of the land and as the law of the land it should be enforced <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only say that what the right reverend prelate has said makes me more and more convinced that what i said in answer to the noble lord lord paget was about right <e>", "<cs> my lords if her majestys inspectorate found a school which appeared to be attempting to evade the requirement of the act they would first raise the matter with the head teacher and if necessary with the local education authority concerned and if neither approach was successful they would indeed draw it to the attention of my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord has a very valid point in that section of the act makes it impossible to require teachers in county schools and most teachers in voluntary controlled schools to attend religious worship or to give religious instruction <e> <s> indeed there are a great many teachers who do not wish to do this <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that it is <e> <s> the act lays down the duty and it should be carried out <e> <s> incidentally we have just had an education bill go through this house and i do not think this matter was raised by any noble lord in his second reading speech or that any noble lord felt so strongly about it <e>", "<cs> my lords a number of people in this country have very odd views on very odd subjects <e>", "<cs> my lords i am here to answer questions not to make comments on what other noble lords say <e>", "<cs> my lords the act specifies that there must be an act of worship <e> <s> it does not specify that it need necessarily be an act of christian worship <e>", "<cs> my lords all five gcse examining groups in england and wales intend to offer gcse syllabuses in electronics from this september <e> <s> in addition some gce boards plan to introduce syllabuses in electronics at advanced supplementary level in september <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his supplementary answer <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the secretary of state was disturbed to see press reports of haringey councils plans <e> <s> he is making inquiries of the authority to establish the facts and to discover how it proposes to pursue its policy statement with its schools <e> <s> i cannot comment on the legal position before the facts are clear <e> <s> the government would certainly deplore any attempt to encourage homosexual behaviour among school pupils <e>", "<cs> my lords i concur with everything that the noble lord says <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give the figures as to how many letters have been received by my department on the amendment <e> <s> there are a number of amendments down for the report stage of the bill in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i said that my right honourable friend was making inquiries of the authority to establish the facts <e> <s> there have been a number of rather exaggerated press reports <e> <s> on the other hand i think that the council policy statement which was agreed on th july is pretty horrific as it stands <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord that mathematics and english are important <e> <s> i also tend to agree that sensible sex and health education is important <e> <s> i believe that this is very much a matter for local education authorities <e> <s> the government broadly take the view that a balanced curriculum is sensible <e>", "<cs> my lords i find myself utterly confused by what the noble lord lord paget has said <e> <s> i think that the noble viscount sitting behind him was trying to indicate just the opposite when he was talking about the amendment that he moved during the recent passage of the education bill and not that he was in favour of what haringey was doing <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord has asked me a hypothetical question <e> <s> the education acts lay down a sequence of legal procedures leading to criminal proceedings in the event of parents failing to comply with statutory requirements <e> <s> it would be for the lea and ultimately the courts to decide upon action in an individual case in the light of all the circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have the least idea <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i think that that is what i said in my original answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think so <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i should have to think about that <e>", "<cs> my lords the government welcomes the recent publication of the hmi discussion document <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have encouraged leas and schools through the white paper <e>", "<cs> my lords a range of relevant training opportunities exist for serving teachers at national and local level <e> <s> they may not always be labelled health education but they deal with health-related issues within the broader context of personal social educational and pastoral care <e> <s> the proposed new arrangements for the planning and funding of in-service training will encourage leas to plan training for teachers in general more systematically <e>", "<cs> my lords that is an important point <e> <s> i am very grateful to the noble baroness for raising it <e>", "<cs> my lords we have no plans at present to issue a policy statement on health education although i do not rule out the possibility of doing so at some future time should that seem appropriate <e> <s> we shall watch with interest the education service response to the hmi discussion paper <e> <s> we have indicated our intention shortly to issue a draft circular on the issues associated with sex education in schools <e> <s> if any noble lords feel strongly <e>", "<cs> my lords we have announed our intention to amend regulations to require schools to publish details of their health education provision <e> <s> this makes clear the governments expectation that all schools will offer health education and will ensure that parents are fully informed about the provision offered <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now adjourn during pleasure until pm <e>", "<cs> my lords in each case the figures i give are millions of pounds and relate to the five-year period to <e> <s> plant breeding institute <e> <s> those figures represent the total cash grants made to the institute by the agricultural and food research council from the public funds received from the science budget and from the ministry of agriculture fisheries and food for commissioned work <e>", "<cs> my lords both i and my noble friend lord belstead have been over this ground a number of times with the noble lord <e> <s> i think that this is a matter whatever answer i give to the noble lord on which he will have his opinion and the government will have theirs <e> <s> i see no way that i can convince him <e> <s> the governments policy in this area is to promote the fullest possible industrial and commercial exploitation of scientific discoveries <e> <s> despite past successes which the noble lord rightly mentioned the government believe that the private sector is best placed to commercialise the highly successful applied work at the pbi which is carried out in part of the institute only <e>", "<cs> my lords i should be delighted to write to the noble lord with that informa-tion <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i can indeed give the noble baroness that undertaking <e> <s> that is something we intend to do <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as concerns the afrc certainly the officials i have met seem to be very happy with this idea <e> <s> in regard to the future marketing of varieties produced in wales and in other <e>", "<cs> my lords the lazard figures are very confidential and in current negotiations and i could not quote anything from them <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a rather hypothetical question <e> <s> there are a number of institutes and people involved in this matter and these are the kinds of details we shall have to go into with them <e>", "<cs> my lords we have spent minutes on the first question of the day <e> <s> i think that the noble lord lord diamond has been anxiously attempting to rise to his feet <e>", "<cs> my lords with all respect my noble friend has had a go <e> <s> i am in your lordships hands <e> <s> we have spent minutes on this question <e> <s> i suggest that the noble lord <e> <s> lord diamond asks his question and then we move on to the next question <e>", "<cs> my lords at a convenient moment after my noble friend lady young will with the leave of the house make a statement on sir geoffrey howes mission to southern africa on behalf of the european community <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that over generations in this country both farmers and landowners produced some remarkable features in the countryside long before there were any planning controls at all <e> <s> i think particularly in my own part of the world of the lovely barns which are such a feature scattered as they are about the dales <e> <s> is it not rather unfair that the press this morning seemed to have cottoned on to the idea that every single farmer is going to sell off all his land and that rashes of houses are going to spring up everywhere <e> <s> i am sure my noble friend will agree that the farmers in this country are a sensible lot who appreciate the beauty of the countryside as much as anybody <e> <s> i also ask whether <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble baroness lady stedman for instigating this debate <e> <s> i am delighted that it is not one of the victims of one of the governments cuts and that we still have it <e> <s> i should like to follow up what was said by the noble lord lord gibson and welcome the governments initiative on the alternative uses of farm buildings and farmland <e> <s> i was delighted particularly about the alternative uses for farm buildings <e> <s> last week i went to see a snail farm in our local area which has taken over a derelict farm building and is actually exporting snails for consumption in france which i thought was rather good news <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord cranbrook for introducing the debate and to the nature conservancy council for publishing an attractive well produced and above all readable report <e> <s> as we have heard this afternoon it is far-reaching and provides a wide field for debate <e>", "<cs> i hope that i can convince the noble baroness lady darcy by what i am about to say i hope my noble friend lady blatch did because i saw a miserable look on the face of the noble baroness lady darcy and when i see her looking unhappy like that my heart bleeds <e> <s> i share the concern that children with special needs should not suffer under the bill but not from the same point of view as that put forward by the noble baroness that children with special needs would be unable to benefit from the national curriculum <e> <s> i start from the other end of the scale <e> <s> children with severe handicaps we must remember that under our present education system no child is regarded as ineducable should not be made to struggle through the national curriculum without being able to comprehend it <e>", "<cs> i shall leave my reply to that until we come to clause <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree especially in the light of the figures which he has given us that it will be very difficult for a mutual fund building society to get the necessary number of votes from its shareholders to convert to a plc <e> <s> does he also agree that regardless of whether such a society stays as a mutual fund building society or becomes a plc the greatest safeguard for investors in the institution will be sound financial management from the top <e>", "<cs> i from these back benches also support the amendment <e> <s> i am not altogether per cent <e> <s> in support of what the noble baroness said because i do not believe that it is necessary to have a disabled person participate <e> <s> on the whole it would be very good to have someone on this body who is aware of the special problems and needs of the disabled <e>", "<cs> i hate to stab my noble friend in the back from this side of the committee <e> <s> having sat so often where she now is and generally getting stabbed in the back from this side on education bills i sympathise with her <e> <s> on the other hand i strongly support the noble baroness lady darcy in her amendment <e> <s> obviously i feel very involved because of the position of my noble kinswoman <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble baroness why she has left out taxonomy <e>", "<cs> for a number of years i have argued with the noble baroness lady david across the dispatch box and debated with her over education and various other matters <e> <s> i have always found her arguments if not always convincing at least to be justified and very sensible <e> <s> however for the first time in my life she completely threw me with one of her arguments this afternoon on the effect that the governments proposals would have on rural areas <e>", "<cs> i support entirely what my noble friend lady faithfull said <e> <s> in my involvement with schools i have tried as a governor and in the local community to get places opened up <e> <s> it is always the caretaker who does not want his beautifully polished floor ruined by people coming in and playing badminton or something else in the evening <e> <s> i say <e>", "<cs> i go along with what has been suggested by my noble friend lord campbell of alloway and by the noble baroness lady david <e> <s> there is obviously a difficulty here <e> <s> as i understand it some local authorities may well be breaking the law at the moment by providing speech therapists <e> <s> there has been no mention today of physiotherapists who are also involved or of occupational therapists <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that perhaps the noble earl is being a little pessimistic over this <e> <s> there is an existing analogy at present <e> <s> which is that of aided schools <e> <s> about a fifth of the schools in the maintained system are aided and i am the governor of an aided school <e> <s> i know that technically we are empowered to appoint the teachers that we believe are best for the school but in fact at times of redeployment when the county has been in trouble it has come to us and asked us whether we minded taking on a teacher who required redeployment <e> <s> that happens <e> <s> it has not only happened in the school in which i am a governor but it has happened fairly widely throughout our area <e> <s> i believe this can exist perfectly well within the system <e>", "<cs> my lords may i remind noble lords that this is not a committee stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by thanking my noble friend lord ferrers for the detailed and fair way in which he presented the bill <e> <s> i think that he was honest in what he said <e> <s> he stressed i think quite rightly that this is a matter of balance <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the house will not agree to this amendment <e> <s> i remember that the whole idea of the act in which i was somewhat involved

that the amendment is one way in which we will politicise the situation <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> i did not speak to amendment no <e> <s> as my noble friend may have noticed but if the noble lord lord brain had pressed it to a division i should have been in somewhat of a quandary as to whether i should follow him through the lobbies <e> <s> if my noble friend decided to press this amendment i should have no hesitation in following him <e> <s> the excuse which i have heard and i hope my noble friend lord ferrers will not use it is that this group of disabled people is so small that they are not worth bothering about <e> <s> i do not think that that smacks of a conservative government or indeed of any government in this country <e> <s> i hope it is not an argument to be put forward <e> <s> i think that this amendment proposed so admirably by my noble friend lord wynford will bring much comfort for those who are disabled and enjoy the sport

moorland is that instead of sheep farms we see forestry <e> <s> once the land has been overgrazed by sheep it becomes sick and there is then no alternative but to plant trees <e>", "<cs> my lords i also should like to thank my noble friend lord stanley for introducing this important and topical debate <e>", "<cs> once in a blue noon i actually support something that my noble kinswoman moves <e> <s> in even more of a blue moon i actually go through the same voting lobby as she <e>", "<cs> my lords i begin by thanking the noble baroness lady david for introducing this debate <e> <s> it is rather like old times for me <e> <s> we have had many long and happy arguments across the chamber on this subject <e> <s> whatever we have said to each other during the debates we have always ended up as personal friends <e> <s> there cannot be anything very bad about a person who spends a lot of her time in the yorkshire dales <e> <s> the noble lord lord taylor of blackburn also knows much about this subject <e> <s> i have always forgiven him for the fact that he comes from lancashire <e> <s> nobody can be perfect in this life <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not boasting about the number of governing bodies <e> <s> i was trying to make the point that it was a damned stupid system <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems hours ago and indeed it is hours ago that my noble friend lord hesketh introduced this bill <e> <s> like some great matre d he produced a menu with many choice items on it and like many noble lords who have spoken this afternoon i shall start with litter and move on to part vii <e>", "<cs> i support what the noble lord lord addington said <e> <s> i hope that my noble kinswoman will not accept the amendment <e> <s> some of the naughtiest of ponies are the smallest of ponies <e> <s> they are extremely wilful little brutes and they can be extremely dangerous <e> <s> although they are not far off the ground they can give one a bloody great kick and a child can be thrown a considerable way before he falls head first on to the road <e>", "<cs> i would disagree with my noble friend lord mancroft on this <e> <s> on the second point he is probably on the wrong amendment about the ownership of ponies so i shall not say anything about that <e> <s> i could not follow his argument that children were less likely to do up their caps between the es of and <e> <s> i have a rather strange principle which is probably totally wrong that on the whole the more children grow up the more sensible they are <e> <s> this may be a complete and utter fallacy but it seems to me that they are more likely to do up their hats between the ages of and than they are under and i cannot see the reason for changing the age range <e>", "<cs> my admiration for the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon knows no bounds <e> <s> i asked myself how he would be able to bring in his aversion to europe on this discussion and he managed to do that on the last amendment <e> <s> donkeys and other animals can not only kick back but can buck and kick in the air with enough power to dislodge a small child and throw it on to its head <e>", "<cs> i too thank the noble lord lord mcintosh for explaining how the amendments fit together <e> <s> however i sometimes felt that he was a skilful spider spinning a web into which a rather fat tory fly would flop and find himself voting against the government on a number of issues about which he did not believe the government were wrong <e> <s> i give the warning that he is a fly old fly and can struggle his way out of many a web <e>", "<cs> i do not think the noble lord will trap me with that one <e>", "<cs> i am grateful that the chairman of the countryside commission was made a member of this body <e> <s> however does this literally mean that it must be the chairman alone who fulfils that function and that he cannot send a delegate if he is taken ill or suffers a long illness <e> <s> i do not expect my noble friend to reply to that straight away perhaps he can write to me before report <e>", "<cs> like the welsh dragon the sting is in the tail <e> <s> i am most grateful to those members of the committee who have supported me <e> <s> this is a new act of parliament establishing a new authority in wales and it seems to me to be most strange that we cannot write into the legislation exactly what it means <e> <s> instead we have to refer to the countryside act only to find that it is amended by paragraph b of schedule vii to the bill and so on <e> <s> surely it would be much better to have this written on the face of the bill <e> <s> as i said this is a new bill which establishes a new authority and all this should be clearly written into the legislation <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will continue to do battle so that there will be rejoicing in the <e>", "<cs> i disagree <e> <s> i am sure that my noble friend is enhancing the natural beauty of swalesdale and much of the tree planting <e> <s> that is what needs to be done here <e> <s> i have seen what he is doing <e> <s> i think that it is possible to enhance natural beauty <e> <s> i hope that the government will accept this amendment <e>", "<cs> i support what both my noble friends have said <e> <s> my noble friend lord cranbrook has put the case which also worries the countryside commission <e> <s> procedurally if my noble friend accepts the amendment i shall not be worried if it is amended at a later stage <e> <s> if it is in the bill it can be amended later <e> <s> i am not unhappy at the suggestion by my noble friend lord renton that my noble friend lord cranbrook withdraws the amendment and returns with a revised version later <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no fool like an old fool <e> <s> when i got up and said rather rashly that this was a simple question i should have seen the hornets nest that i would stir up in the house <e> <s> i should have known that it was coming <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friends lord morris and lord peel who are the only two noble lords who kept to the point that i was trying to make <e> <s> i am also grateful for what my noble friend the minister said <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be churlish of me not to thank my noble friend for bringing forward this amendment as it was done in response to an amendment that i tabled at committee stage <e> <s> having said that i much prefer the wording of the noble baroness lady white not least because it is much closer to the wording that i used at committee stage than what the minister has brought forward today <e> <s> i feel that the governments wording is slightly strange <e> <s> it seems to have been taken more or less word for word from parts of the and acts some of which are out of date <e>", "<cs> my lords i too thank my noble friend lord middleton and the right reverend primate for introducing these two interesting reports <e> <s> perhaps i may wear my countryside commission hat in order to thank my noble friend lady blatch for repeating the announcement made by her right <e>"]
