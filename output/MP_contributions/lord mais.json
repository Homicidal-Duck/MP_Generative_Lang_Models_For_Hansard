["<cs> in view of the lateness of the hour my lords i have no further remarks to make in connection with the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a third time <e> <s> we covered a considerable amount of ground during the second reading but i should like to refer to part ii of the bill in particular <e> <s> once again this part of the bill was designed to authorise the corporation in their capacity as conservators of epping forest to grant the minister of transport interest and rights in the forest or on forest land to the extent of some acres which the minister requires for the construction of the m a motorway connecting or running between the a at bull cross and the m <e> <s> as was fully explained by the promoters on second reading on the th november if this length of motorway is to be constructed on the land chosen the road at that point will be built in tunnel and that tunnel will run under bell common <e> <s> i think it is fair to say that ultimately no harm at all will be done to the forest but one must accept the fact that during the construction work the tunnel will be built by the formation of an open cut <e> <s> there is bound to be some disfiguration for a period of time but we are perfectly satisfied that when the back-fill takes place and the top soil is replaced the forest can be restored to its normal beauty <e>", "<cs> my lords before i say my few words may i add to what has already been said by other noble lords and congratulate the noble lord lord scanlon and the noble earl lord ilchester for the superb maiden speeches they have made this afternoon <e> <s> may i also thank the noble lord lord gregson for giving us the opportunity to discuss what is a vital matter at this particular time <e>", "<cs> my lords it is i believe generally accepted that the draft directive is welcomed in this country by both insurance companies and brokers for the obvious reason that they expect to benefit from greater freedom to operate throughout the community <e> <s> however in certain of the member states <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the government will give favourable consideration to this amendment <e> <s> as the position is now a finance institution or a clearing bank makes a loan quite innocently in a situation which may ultimately prove to be a prohibited transaction <e> <s> as it stands now if my interpretation is correct they would not be able to recover their loan under any circumstances <e> <s> this seems to me quite apart from the effect on the financial institutions not to be in the interests of industry as a whole <e> <s> i should have hoped that the government would have been able to accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i must begin by declaring an interest in that i have been a chancellor and am now pro-chancellor of a university and thus i have been on the receiving end of the measures which the government have imposed upon those universities <e> <s> and so it is to the financial implications that i propose to direct most of my remarks <e> <s> i would say at the outset that i accept entirely that having regard to the present economic situation in this country the government are faced with having to make cuts and in some cases drastic cuts <e> <s> it is not unreasonable that universities should to some extent be involved in those cuts <e> <s> having said that what i find thoroughly unreasonable is the manner in which they have been carried out the magnitude of the cuts the period over which those cuts were to be effected and the lack of adequate notice <e> <s> i shall deal with those points in greater detail in a moment and the effect that they have on one university in particular <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my thanks to the noble lord lord glenamara for giving us the opportunity to debate what is not only a very interesting subject but in the present day a very serious and an almost disastrous one <e> <s> i imagine that in your lordships house there are many who will remember as i do only too well the early thirties when unemployment was as bad as if not worse than it is today and the like of which we have not seen in the years between then and now <e> <s> in the early thirties it was difficult to find employment whether one had a trade or a technical qualification it made no difference there were no jobs there and that i am afraid is beginning to appear to be the situation that we are now in <e>", "<cs> my lords let me first add my congratulations to those that have already been given to the noble lord lord shaughnessy and the noble lord lord rodney <e> <s> i doubt whether we could have had two more expert members of your lordships house in attendance on this occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords may i from these benches say that her majestys government have our complete support in any action which they may have to take <e> <s> but in the light of industry generally can we be assured in so far as any assurance can be given that companies which at the moment are heavily committed in the argentine both in the supply of goods and in construction and other works will receive some instructions as to how they are to proceed <e> <s> in other words are they to carry on or are they to withdraw <e> <s> and will they have some assurance as to compensation or otherwise for what could in many cases amount to very heavy losses <e>", "<cs> my lords may i add my congratulations to the noble earl on his recent appointment <e> <s> may i also apologise for putting my name down so very late in the batting order but i particularly want to take this opportunity to draw attention to some of the problems which affect the new university at coleraine <e> <s> i do so because they have a very large number of young people there and they are the type of young people who will be needed in ulster in the years to come <e> <s> as i understand it the present position is that it has been decreed that they will be amalgamated with the belfast technical college <e> <s> this does not meet with much <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support what was said by the noble lord on the opposition front bench on the time factor in regard to this statement <e> <s> it was handed to me not more than half-an-hour ago <e> <s> we ought really to have been given more opportunity to study it and its implications and i hope that when the next report is made we shall be given adequate time to consider it in detail <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first say that i am not a stockbroker but i have like most members of your lordships house had dealings with the stock exchange on frequent occasions both personally and for the charitable organisations with which i am connected <e> <s> what concerns me most was referred to by the noble lord <e> <s> lord bruce of donington that is why <e>", "<cs> my lords this is as everyone in this house would agree one of the most important debates in which your lordships have been engaged for a very long time <e> <s> it is commonly accepted that today unemployment is the biggest challenge facing not only the government but also the country as a whole <e> <s> there are more than million people registered as unemployed at the moment <e> <s> there seems to be little hope that there will be any decrease in that number in the foreseeable future <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel hardly qualified to rise and speak on this occasion in company with such an abundance of legal talent but i can assure your lordships that i shall at least be brief <e> <s> there are many points in this bill which required attention but the one which has bothered me most and i think it has bothered most people connected with the construction industry whether on the professional side or on the industrial side is the period of years <e>"]
