["<cs> my lords may i start by saying that i now appreciate the reason for the reputation this house has for its debates <e> <s> i have found the comments made today to be very instructive and thoughtful <e> <s> i have learned a great deal and i certainly thank the noble lord lord mccarthy for his welcome to me on my first module of on the job training and i hope he will mark my performance afterwards <e>", "<cs> my lords nothing is ruled out but it would not be for me to anticipate the reply <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i shall be happy to tell the noble lord that the budget of expenditure is within the existing budget of the open tech programme which is part of that of the manpower services commission <e> <s> i have no doubt at all if i may speak from my former interest that the manpower services commission is delighted to take part in that programme <e>", "<cs> my lords to my personal knowlege the manpower services commission has always accepted the rules and regulations and the very spirit of equal opportunity within the working of not only the community programme but any programme <e> <s> there is perhaps only one restriction that might possibly be said to discriminate against married women and that is where a married woman elected to pay a reduced rate of national insurance contribution which did not entitle her to unemployment benefit <e> <s> however that would be a voluntary decision and one often taken because it was accepted that they would at that time be financially supported by their husbands while they themselves were out of work <e> <s> however i should like to assure the noble baroness that my honourable friend the minister of state for employment has a meeting within the next days with my noble friend the chairman of the equal opportunities commission lady pratt and i hope that such matters will then be resolved satisfactorily <e>", "<cs> my lords it is important to remember exactly what the community programme is designed to do <e> <s> it is to help the long-term unemployed that is those in our society who have been out of work for one year or more <e> <s> within that of course the government have to decide how to allocate resources which cover some filled places that will help some people during the course of a year within a group of some million long-term unemployed <e> <s> within that group at july were women which is per cent <e> <s> of the long-term unemployed <e> <s> the latest figure we have is that percent <e> <s> of entrants over the past months were women <e> <s> from that i think it is safe to assume that women are getting their proper proportion within the community programme <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i should repeat the rules which say that provided you are a recipient of benefit and can be categorised as long-term unemployed that is you have been out of work for months you are eligible to enter the scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords in august before the new rule was introduced fewer than per cent <e> <s> of the entrants in the previous months were not in receipt of benefit themselves but a significant proportion of these might still be eligible for the scheme under the new rule which says that a person is eligible if his or her spouse is receiving benefit <e> <s> it is merely an earnest of the governments intention to confine the programme to those most in need that is to those in receipt of benefit <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the or so recipients of benefit who will now be entitled to enter the programme which was previously denied them will find this a small change <e>", "<cs> my lords my suspicions are that it is not but i shall be quite happy to check on this and i shall write to the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> in thanking your lordships i should like to say to the noble lord lord dean of beswick that the timing of the statement was dictated perhaps by events occurring in another place and also by the receipt of the proposals from the skill-centre training agency which have been laid in the library of the house <e> <s> i am sure that no slight was intended against yesterdays debate <e> <s> i for one apologise for not being here for that debate <e> <s> it is important to look at exactly what are the proposals of the skillcentre training agency <e> <s> they are all there within the framework of the adult training strategy a strategy that was drawn up by the manpower services commission last year after full consultation with employers with trade unions and with the world of education approved by the commission in november and submitted to ministers and approved by the government early this year <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so to the noble lord i think it would be premature to start debating the detail of the plan that has been placed in the library <e> <s> there is a reduction in the number of skillcentres nationally <e> <s> there is a reduction in the number of skillcentres both in wales and in scotland <e> <s> however the point that i should like to put to your lordships this afternoon is that the amount of money spent by the manpower services commission within the adult training strategy remains unchanged <e> <s> what we are talking about today is a plan by the skillcentre training agency itself submitted to the manpower services commission on a way to improve its efficiency <e> <s> that means changing its reliance upon buildings and existing locations perhaps and it may be upon training for yesterdays trades and looking at a different method of delivering training for tomorrows skills <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that it is for me to comment upon the views of the cbi or the tuc on regional aid <e> <s> i would be surprised i have yet to see its statement in detail if the cbi had inferred from the plan of the skillcentre training agency that this will increase unemployment <e> <s> quite the contrary <e> <s> a large part i believe or a part certainly of unemployment today is due to the absence of the proper skills <e> <s> i hope that this is part of a process that the manpower services commission is devising to produce the right skills in the right place at the right time <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend will as i said take into account all shades of opinion on this matter <e> <s> however i must confess that concern has been expressed in the past and shared by me that on occasion wages councils fix rates which preclude the possibility of young people -year-olds from taking advantage of the young workers scheme <e> <s> i am sure that the report of the inquiry which looked into the shops act and the recommendations contained in part of that report will be considered by my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords the wages inspectorate check about establishments each year and during and just over per cent <e> <s> of employees were found to be underpaid <e> <s> lost as i am in admiration for the bbc i do not think it is its job to substitute for the wages inspectors although any evidence it has will of course be considered <e>", "<cs> my lords the responsibility for employment of course is with my right honourable friend the secretary of state for employment but no one on this side of the house can fail to be concerned with the problems of unemployment and the difficulties and obstacles that are facing employment particularly for young people <e>", "<cs> my lords i am fully aware of the historical reasons which brought about the creation of the wages councils and the ills which at that time they sought to remedy <e> <s> nevertheless i should remind the house that it is extremely difficult for or -year olds in this country to obtain employment at the present time in the hotel and catering industry because of the levels of wages that have been fixed for them <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think this government will knowingly undertake any policy other than one designed to enhance employment and employment opportunities <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord that the secretary of state for employment will consult with all parties concerned should such an eventuality arise <e> <s> of course at present no decision has been made he is merely contemplating the consequences <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully understand that <e> <s> i was merely making the point that if allegations are made in any particular area they should be supported by full evidence <e> <s> if there is evidence i have no doubt that the wages inspectorate which is the true and proper body for investigating such complaints will take it up <e> <s> it is very difficult to do so unless there is specific evidence against particular individuals <e>", "<cs> my lords one of my concerns is to look at any matters which act as barriers to employment and i have no doubt that all these matters will be investigated by the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i congratulate the noble lord and all noble lords who were concerned with the establishment of wages councils and rejoice with them that the difficulties of that particular era have been overcome <e> <s> however the matters which must concern the government are those which restrict employment in this country in particular whatever restricts the employment of young people <e> <s> i have spent much time over the past two or three years with young people and i am concerned for their employment <e> <s> however i repeat my original answer the government have made no decision on the future of the wages councils <e> <s> they are carefully considering all the evidence <e> <s> i know that my right honourable friend will carefully consider all that has been said in this house this afternoon <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i did hear <e> <s> i will pass on to my right honourable friend the secretary of state all comments expressed this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lords lord stoddart of swindon and lord diamond for their statements <e> <s> i do not think that it will come as a complete surprise to the house if i say <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his question <e> <s> i say merely that to my knowledge there was no particular government statement <e> <s> when i read the sunday papers i found two totally conflicting headlines <e> <s> i suppose had i put the two together they would have cancelled each other out <e> <s> what i think the government have done today has been to demonstrate beyond any shadow of doubt that they intend to maintain their course of anti-inflationary policy <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is privy to information which i do not have and neither i suspect do no <e> <s> or the treasury <e> <s> my information is that there was no particular statement emanating from either area <e> <s> the interpretation of the press is a matter for the press <e> <s> may i remind your lordships house that at the present time the press is not under the control of the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for her statement <e> <s> i say merely that the governments policy remains that the bank should intervene if necessary to seek to smooth sharp movements and maintain orderly markets <e> <s> the precise level of the exchange rate is a matter which the government will neither set nor be totally indifferent to <e> <s> the government and my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer have always said that there is no such thing as an exchange rate target <e> <s> but the present and precise level of exchange is a matter which must always be taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords the advantage and the disadvantage of a free and floating market is always its uncertainty <e> <s> i should hope that the prompt action taken by the government today would ensure that we shall shortly return to the same level of interest rates as before <e>", "<cs> my lords to my knowledge sir john hoskyns the director general of the institute of directors is not at the present time an adviser to the government and was no doubt expressing his own view <e> <s> possibly the problem is that the markets have heard siren voices continually urging the government to relax and believe that the government might do so <e> <s> but the government have demonstrated today that there is no u-turn and the government are not going to let up on their present and future anti-inflationary policy <e> <s> the control of inflation is the route back to prosperity <e>", "<cs> my lords i am depressed that the noble lord is depressed at my answers because i thought i had made the position of the government extremely plain <e> <s> the government will continue with their policy of keeping inflation down <e> <s> in the governments view that is the only way back towards the road towards fuller employment and the road towards profitability <e> <s> what has been demonstrated in each year since is increasing investment until this year it is at a record level <e> <s> i must remind your lordships house that if we look at employment in this country within this country we have per cent <e> <s> of all adults of working age employed compared with per cent <e> <s> in germany and per cent <e> <s> in france <e> <s> what we must do is to bring back by the control of inflation investment growth and productivity <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord seebohm <e> <s> the amount of money washing around in todays market is such that intervention in the way that was formerly the practice would i suspect have very little effect <e>", "<cs> my lords the position changed over the weekend partly as a result i have no doubt of speculation in the press and elsewhere <e> <s> but the position is a fluid one and it changes and at the time when my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer thought it proper to act he acted <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not too sure that the present state of the coal industry has much to do with the state of worker or management involvement in that industry <e>", "<cs> in the form of co-operatives <e> <s> section of the employment act which brought in the possibility of reporting on this position does not apply to nationalised industries <e> <s> at the moment the government are looking at the position to see how the initial reports which have been coming out for a year reports by companies on involvement are actually working through <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are always interested in improving employee involvement in the management of industries be they in the nationalised industry sector or in the private sector <e> <s> at the present time section of the act excludes nationalised industries as it excludes companies with fewer than employees and other types of organisations such as building <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that your lordships house has taken note of the improvement in service and profits of such companies once forming nationalised industries but which have now moved back into the private sector <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his slightly gloomy interpretation of the figures but i think i should remind your lordships house that of all people of employable age in the united kingdom no less than per cent <e> <s> are in employment whereas the comparable figure for germany is per cent <e> <s> and that for france is per cent <e> <s> if we look at employment which is the positive way of looking at the whole picture we can see that we have at long last created an environment in which new business is flourishing and employment is again on the increase <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that question <e> <s> it is true that from to the number of self-employed declined by but happily since it has increased by about so it stands today at nearly and is rapidly on the increase <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that question but i am afraid i must have some notice of it <e> <s> all i can say is that in the last months about more jobs have been created and the figure is on the increase <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be a brave man indeed who would criticise or seek to give the credit for the present unemployment situation to the great growth of equal opportunities in this country <e> <s> it is an undeniable fact that over the past years we have seen both a great increase in the number of women in employment and also an increase in part-time jobs <e> <s> indeed there is an argument that according to the number of hours which were worked years ago we are all working part-time <e> <s> there is no question that as the years go by we shall see first once again a growth in the number of women in employment and secondly a move towards part-time employment <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no doubt that many decades of action by governments of all colours have contributed towards the employment situation within the last few years <e> <s> there is also little doubt that as the change in the postindustrial society comes about there are areas of the country in which it would be impossible no matter what action were taken by government to resuscitate the old industries <e> <s> what her majestys government are trying to do is to bring about conditions such as exist today in scotland where more people are employed in electronics than in ships steel and coal <e>", "<cs> my lords i would do anything to satisfy the noble lords curiosity but in the circumstances i feel that i must wait until we know the actual results of the work that i am doing at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that your lordships house would accept that no one particular party has a monopoly of concern as regards the figures <e> <s> of course they are heartbreaking and the very least that any of us in this house would want to do is to ameliorate the position <e> <s> where we differ is as to the best route to take to ameliorate the position <e> <s> i for one am convinced that the government are on the right course <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that question but i am afraid that the answer is not capable of dissertation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness lady seear <e> <s> i would remind the noble baroness that when i became an articled clerk the sight of a woman training to become a solicitor was indeed remote and rare <e> <s> now almost the majority of solicitors are women and the growth of women in all types of employment is quite marked and not confined merely to low paid jobs <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware that any artificial means of creating jobs actually lasts <e> <s> we are seeing a trend towards part-time employment and a trend towards shorter working hours <e> <s> i suspect that that will happen naturally <e> <s> one thing about which the government are resolved is that it should not happen artificially <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord dean of beswick for the way in which he responded <e> <s> it would be slightly discourteous of me to remind the noble lord that in the then labour government reduced the fund <e> <s> the fund was actually in surplus and it was done at that time in order to save the public sector borrowing requirement <e> <s> we are of course taking steps in a similar way today and it really is a question of transferring the burden from all taxpayers to the particular taxpayers <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord for his remarks and with the consent of the house <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord dean of beswick for his comments <e> <s> i should say at the outset that some staff of the skillcentre training agency will be affected but my right honourable friend the secretary of state for employment has asked the commission to consult fully with staff and trades unions particularly in regard to avoiding compulsory redundancies wherever possible <e> <s> redeployment voluntary early retirement and compulsory retirement at age or over will be explored first <e> <s> compulsory redundancy is expected to be necessary for only a minority of staff <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones because while i have every sympathy with what he has said his remarks in fact demonstrate the very real difficulty which has been besetting the manpower <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for omitting to explain in full perhaps what i believe to be the meaning of that part of the statement <e> <s> it simply means that the proposals originated from the manpower services commission and were made to the secretary of state as part of the adult training strategy and as part of the training strategy the manpower services commission has undertaken to deliver training in all parts of the country according to the new plan <e> <s> it would wish to identify the sources of the new training before it would seek to close any skillcentre <e> <s> it is concerned to see that the adult training strategy is delivered and delivered economically <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that it is going more on the practice of the department of trade and industry which is postponing the time for paying it back <e> <s> i agree very much with the noble baroness lady david about the shortage of university teachers in engineering and technology <e> <s> this is a problem which the government have to solve and they are asking industry in the short-term to loan qualified staff in order to help with this very real problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that supplementary question <e> <s> in fact since some million has been spent in regional aid in corby and some companies have received offers of aid <e> <s> that is how jobs have been created since <e> <s> corby also has the benefit of having the most successful enterprise zone is also a steel closure area and thus eligible for aid from the european coal and steel community <e> <s> what corby demonstrates in microcosm is that employment is moving from manufacturing to the service sector <e> <s> many of the jobs created in corby in the past three years have been in the service sector and against the national trend unemployment in corby has been dropping <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that question <e> <s> what corby demonstrates more than anything else is that if one is prepared to look forward rather than backwards and prepared to look for the creation of new types of jobs which are becoming available then growth in employment will result <e> <s> what we must not do is to continue to look backwards for the old days which will not return <e> <s> i am afraid that there are insufficient statistics available to my knowledge at the moment on current progress made within the coal industry but i shall certainly make inquiries on the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i have to confess that i do not have the details but i shall write to let the noble baroness know the difference <e> <s> my information is that the jobs are spread throughout <e> <s> however i shall make inquiries <e>", "<cs> my lords that is an interpretation that could be construed <e> <s> but i suspect the real reason is that corby is much more willing to look forward than to look back <e> <s> corby represents the most successful of the first of the eleven enterprise zones that were established <e> <s> it has demonstrated time and time again that it is willing to look towards new activities <e> <s> if that example could be followed then i think that all policies would be successful <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness lady seear for the question <e> <s> of course it is true that not all parts of the country are as amenable to the new world <e> <s> but i can recall visiting bradford not so many weeks ago and seeing the remarkable progress which it has made in attracting tourism <e> <s> i can remember very clearly or years ago visiting bradford <e> <s> without wishing to cast any aspersion on the citizens of that city it was not a place to which i would have gone for my holidays at that time <e>", "<cs> my lords to my knowledge the amount of money which has been allocated towards the enterprise board for the national coal board is rather more than million <e> <s> but the point that i am trying to make this afternoon to your lordships house is that attitude is often equally as important as funds if not more important <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that demonstrated that at the time the original million was allocated and the time when it was increased to million the industry was in some disarray <e> <s> now that miners are back at work i hope that the national coal board together with the people who work with them can start to plan positively for the future <e>", "<cs> my lords the proposal that i should lead a high level british business mission to china was put forward by my right honourable friend the prime minister when she met the chinese premier in peking in december <e> <s> in choosing the members of the mission i had the benefit of advice from the department of trade and industry and from the british embassy in peking <e> <s> my intention was to put together a high level team reflecting a broad range of british advanced technology in the fields to which the chinese attach economic priority including energy transport communications and the modernisation of industry <e> <s> i also wanted to include a representative of the service industries reflecting the importance of invisible exports in britains overseas trade and the potential for increasing our trade with china in invisibles <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful indeed to the noble lord for his comments <e> <s> i believe it was considered by members of my mission that it was successful but each and every member knew that he was acting not only as a representative of his own firm but also as a representative of british industry and commerce <e> <s> we will give and indeed we are at the present time giving a great deal of thought to the best way of disseminating the lessons we have learnt but i can assure your lordships that two things will happen <e> <s> first we shall disseminate the information and secondly this will not be the only effort because we shall follow through and see whether we can at the very least bring up our level of trade with china to a level which is commensurate with the rest of the free world <e>", "<cs> my lords speaking from memory last year china bought some billion dollars worth of goods from overseas and at the same time exported billion dollars worth <e> <s> their foreign debt i believe rose from five billion dollars to six billion <e> <s> i should remind your lordships that our trade with china last year was something like million so we have some way to go <e> <s> there were suggestions when i was in china that we should consider some form of soft loans or the equivalent <e> <s> indeed i read in todays paper that some soft loans have been granted by others of our eec partners <e> <s> my impression is as was the impression of many members of my mission that there is much business to be done on normal commercial terms <e> <s> i will certainly pass on the recommendation about the royal show <e>", "<cs> my lords i suspect that the best way in which we can encourage understanding between nations is to trade together <e> <s> the purpose of my mission was to encourage trade in the interests of both our economies <e> <s> i hope we shall succeed and if we do there will be plenty of room as there already is for cultural missions <e>", "<cs> my lords i was entertained yesterday by the export group of the british construction industry and they expressed great satisfaction with the mission and actually said they were happy in these particular circumstances not to be included <e> <s> in deciding on those who were to come within the mission the difficulty i had was in distinguishing between large numbers of firms when all were of interest <e> <s> within my mission i took many people who were interested directly in construction of power plant and transmission lines <e> <s> i believe we have a considerable future in terms of management contracts and construction expertise and i hope that we shall proceed as a result of my mission <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord lord hatch for asking this question because i must confess to your lordships that when i returned from my mission and read some of the cuttings from the british press i did not recognise the descriptions <e> <s> i travelled out with my delegation which i should remind your lordships was possibly the most high-powered trade delegation we have yet sent in an official capacity to a foreign power with a letter to premier zhao ziyang <e> <s> the same day that i met the premier there happened to be in peking a delegation of members of local chambers of commerce bringing with them a letter to the chairman <e> <s> that was to my mind more of a political visit but even if it was not i should remind your lordships that japan does possibly times as much trade with china as we do because today we do perhaps per cent <e> <s> of chinas trade whereas japans trade with china i believe is something approaching <e>", "<cs> my lords one member of my mission was sir eric sharp the chairman and chief executive of cable and wireless <e> <s> while we were there three memoranda were signed one to establish as a joint venture a telecommunications technology development centre in peking itself with conference office and hotel facilities and secondly and more importantly a memorandum of intent to establish a joint venture to develop a telecommunications system for the whole of the yangtze delta region <e> <s> that region has million people living there twice the size of the united kingdom <e> <s> this will involve capital expenditure of some million dollars over the next five years <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i think the details of all the memoranda that we signed were in fact published when we came back <e> <s> but i am happy to be able to reassure your lordships that conversations have carried on at a very encouraging rate since our return <e> <s> delegations are now arriving in the united kingdom as a result and indeed some of the members of our delegation already have teams back in china following through <e> <s> i take it very much upon myself to ensure that a proper follow-up is maintained and i hope that as the months pass since by their nature the projects will reach their conclusion in a matter of many months if not a year or so we shall see the full fruits of our endeavours <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord mccarthy for his implicit backing for this white paper <e> <s> i should like to assure him that the government have not been entirely prescriptive about the shape of the youth training scheme <e> <s> indeed it is now with the manpower services commission for them to negotiate with the partners in the commission the precise shape so that employers unions and the world of education will have the very last word and it is hoped will come back with a scheme which will be acceptable to all parties and acceptable to the government one that will be able to take within it some to young people for training <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord lord molloy and indeed all of your lordships will not wish me to anticipate what i shall have to say later in winding-up the debate this afternoon save to say this <e> <s> what we are talking about is foundation training for all our young people and the very first paragraph of the white paper points out that many people leaving school today will not retire until the second third of the next century <e> <s> the world that they will then live in is unimaginable to us <e> <s> we are talking about providing flexible and broad foundation training and the beginning of a national programme of vocational occupation schemes <e> <s> however i am grateful to your lordships for welcoming the statement <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend <e> <s> the precise shape of the new scheme remains to be determined <e> <s> it will be determined by consultation and agreement between all the parties <e> <s> i note very much my noble friends comments about the catering industry <e> <s> that is already provided for within the existing youth training scheme and i hope that the new scheme will indeed look at all the requirements for catering which is one of the very real growth areas in our economy today in terms of employment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his comments <e> <s> one of the points which concerns me is why there should be so many people looking for jobs in europe but very few looking for jobs in the united states <e> <s> it is a conundrum on which i hope i can amplify a little later on <e> <s> but let me assure your lordships that although the smoke stack industries have disappeared manufacturing will not disappear in this country <e> <s> it may not be a great employer of people but there are many other ways to employ people <e> <s> i hope very much that we shall live through an era in which we see manufacturing rightly restored as a wealth producer for our people <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his comments <e> <s> this is a matter of some considerable concern to my right honourable friend the secretary of state for education and science and indeed it has been pointed out to me on occasion by employers and potential employers up and down the land <e> <s> it is not a matter with which resources as such are concerned <e> <s> it is one of those areas where quality is more important than quantity <e> <s> while i am on my feet perhaps i may say that i hope that your lordships will accept my apologies if i have to leave the debate for a few minutes to deal with matters arising out of the white paper but i shall return as speedily as i can <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord mccarthy for the way in which he commenced his speech this evening since i wish to follow his example <e> <s> i should start therefore by saying how grateful i am to the noble lord lord barnett for introducing this debate this evening and giving us an opportunity at least to ventilate our different opinions on the way the real world is <e> <s> of course i am less than totally grateful to him for his contribution but i shall come back to that in a moment <e> <s> perhaps i may say how happy i was to be here today when the noble lord lord murray of epping forest made his maiden speech <e> <s> i have vivid memories of my first appointment as chairman of the manpower services commission when i called on him and of the warm way in which he encouraged me and the enthusiasm he showed for our task <e> <s> although i suspect that we may differ somewhat politically i know that we are united in our determination to see that young people get the right start in life <e> <s> i welcome him and his future contributions to our debates <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord <e> <s> i shall come to that in a moment if i may <e> <s> may i just deal lastly with the foundations of the economy by reminding us all here this evening that we live now in an economy which has been growing every year for the last four years we have inflation now at its lowest level since the s we have both investment and exports at record levels and we also had half a million new jobs created in the months to last september <e>", "<cs> the short answer to that is yes my lords <e> <s> i have also heard many reports from the contractors and other associations who make a case for more infrastructure but infrastructure must have its own reward <e> <s> it must be there for its own sake not in the cause of employment <e> <s> there may be good causes for infrastructure but it must be put in the context of employment <e>", "<cs> my lords japan may be a particular case and one to which i have no doubt attention is being given at this moment <e> <s> but the sheer fact and the simple truth is that if we were to endeavour to protect our economy we would be on a long and gradual slide to the centrally-controlled economies behind the iron curtain that i have heard so much about this evening <e> <s> that is not the way which i suspect your lordships house would want us to go <e> <s> we can be competitive we are competitive <e> <s> one only has to look

of the words of the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby do i dissent from this evening <e> <s> all he said had the ring of truth and common sense about it <e> <s> i wish he would speak to some of his noble friends and perhaps persuade them if i am not able to do so this evening <e>", "<cs> the noble lord may say rubbish but i am afraid that many of the lessons we have learned and lost during the s were because in the s and s we were concerned with matters other than quality and production and other than the customer himself <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord would do well to exercise a little patience because i was just about to say that while i am personally totally convinced that that applies to under s there is a period of consultation and i wish to see what comes out of that period of consultation <e> <s> the noble lord with a few more seconds of patience would have had his fears put to rest <e> <s> we have to be patient and we have <e>", "<cs> the position is similar in sports and recreation and other services for tourists as my noble friend lord gowrie well knows <e> <s> but more than one independent forecast has pointed to substantial increase anything up to new jobs in the

demonstrates better that the governments policies are working than a continued and steady increase in the number of people in employment <e>", "<cs> my lords in the past few months one of the benefits

look beyond the waters <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall write to the noble lord giving those particular figures <e>", "<cs> my lords i would completely agree with the noble earls statement <e> <s> the statements which we announce each month are indeed the count of those receiving unemployment benefit and that is an unequivocal and unshakeable figure and one upon which i believe your lordships house would do well to continue to rely <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend for his question but alas i am a minister without a portfolio and even if i had one i think i could do little to prevent those who so desire exaggerating the bad news and minimising the good <e> <s> the registered number of unemployed stands at the figure that we give <e> <s> within that figure it is sensible to assume that all are seeking work but your lordships will have to make up your minds for yourselves <e>", "<cs> my lords for once i am in total agreement with the noble lord <e> <s> the figures that we present on the unemployment count do not represent the truth of the situation <e> <s> the truth of the situation is represented by the figures that i endeavoured to give in my supplementary answer which show that the number of people in employment is steadily and surely rising <e> <s> that is the figure on which we should concentrate <e> <s> i assume and expect that figure to continue to rise until the number of unemployed starts to diminish <e>", "<cs> my lords the point i was endeavouring to make in answering these questions was simply that the total workforce of the united kingdom is increasing and so is the number of people in employment <e> <s> at the present time the rate of increase in the workforce is such that the number of unemployed is not diminishing but i expect that it soon will <e> <s> perhaps i may make this point <e> <s> we have one of the highest proportions of populations of working age in employment in europe <e> <s> our figure is per cent <e>

this matter <e> <s> i am sure that they are going to respond during the period of consultation and representation but i will certainly inquire of my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i slightly regret the emotive language of the supplementary question because the position is simply that unless we get men <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his observation but i would also remind the house that although we are an island we live in the whole world and that if we do not attract the best talents to enable us to grow other countries will do so as they did in the

of may in which to consider the future of wages councils <e> <s> i believe that it behoves me on this side of the house in any event to wait until that period of consultation is over <e>", "<cs> no my

arose under section of the employment act <e> <s> i hope in the fullness of time and it will not be many weeks at that we shall make a report on that <e> <s> the conclusions to be drawn from it are another matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am trying very hard to confine the answers to the scope of the question and i think once again the noble lords question has gone right to another matter <e>",

continue to play the part that it has so valuably played up to now <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for that comment <e> <s> perhaps i may remind your lordships house that itecs information technology centres are part of the youth training scheme and as such are not a formal part of the education system but their very basis is employment-oriented and the driving force

since august and demonstrates that government policies are working <e> <s> secondly i hope that your lordships will take cognisance of the fact that if we are to have a viable manufacturing industry

is not always the case that that happens <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no wish to avoid answering questions of this nature but the question on the order paper is specifically about the manufacturing sector <e> <s> the increase in the number of unemployed since is common knowledge and the figure has gone up substantially <e> <s> incidentally on the chart that we have been following the line of increase is no greater than the line of increase since the s <e> <s> but what is different today is that the employment that we have has a firm foundation <e> <s> i sincerely believe that the steps

together <e>", "<cs> my lords without wishing in any way to sound immodest i suspect that there are few members of your lordships house who have spent more time than i have dealing with the subject of unemployment and i am as concerned as anyone else about it <e> <s> but what the government have done for the employment of young people stands comparison with what has been done by any nation of the

deliberations of the auld committee <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not for me to speculate about the thought processes of my noble friend lord boyd-capenter <e> <s> however perhaps i may say that i for one have always found him extremely moderate <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that my right honourable friend the secretary of state for employment when he announces the result of his deliberations will be shown to have acted not only with moderation but also with wisdom <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e>", "<cs> my lords the results of the representations which were received by my right honourable friend

inhibitions in order to make this what i believe it really is a charter for jobs for young people <e>", "<cs> my lords the statement from my right honourable friend the secretary of state for employment says that he will <e>", "<cs> my lords there will be nothing to stop wages dropping below the level of benefit save for one factor they will not attract people to take them <e> <s> already we have difficulty with many <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding is that each wages council will continue for its particular industry and set rates for that industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware

<e> <s> as a result we have the social security system today which has greatly transformed the situation <e> <s> i am aware also that while this government have abolished wages councils their predecessor government abolished <e> <s> there is nothing sacrosanct or sacred about wages councils as such <e> <s> the real priority of this government and i submit of the opposition is that we all take steps to ensure that employment increases so that young people and older people all have jobs <e>", "<cs> my lords i was delighted this afternoon when i saw the noble lord lord shinwell in his accustomed place because i knew that when we discussed wages councils he would remind the house how they came into being <e> <s> however i wonder whether the noble lords memory goes back far enough to remember the time when people walked with red flags in front of cars because the world changes and restrictions and regulations which seemed appropriate at one time are subsequently found to be not so necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is very difficult to settle on a rate but i hear every word that is said in this house and i have no doubt at all that my right honourable friend the secretary of state for employment will read todays discussion and will take that into account <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble baroness that i shall speak to my right honourable friend the secretary of state for employment <e> <s> i have no doubt that when the new regulations come out they will be simpler <e> <s> i hope that they will be more comprehensible to those who wish to consult them <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> what is recommended this afternoon fits with the spirit of the auld recommendations <e> <s> the retention of councils is consistent with the basic concern of the auld committee <e> <s> i should perhaps remind the house that my right honourable friend the home secretary has said that he will look sympathetically at the best way of ensuring that established shopworkers cannot be compelled to work on sundays <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful indeed to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i am afraid that there are times when i completely fail to fathom the workings of some of the wages councils <e> <s> this happened particularly before i came to this house when i was in the manpower services commission and saw wages councils set minimum levels for young people which ensured their continued unemployment <e>", "<cs> my lords the levels of apprentice wages in those areas of engineering and other industries in which apprenticeship exists are by and large covered by union agreements <e> <s> but the government have introduced if you like a form of national apprenticeship in the sense that the youth training scheme which will last for two years from next year onwards will certainly cover all those in the distributive industries and all those in areas which are at present covered by wages councils <e>", "<cs> my

increased by and employment in the rest of the nine decreased <e> <s> the other countries which showed an increase in employment within the nine were italy where the figure was denmark belgium and the netherlands <e> <s> germany showed a decrease of greece a decrease of and ireland a decrease of <e> <s> france which had the unfortunate occurrence of following policies advocated by noble lords opposite showed a decrease of <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> we are one of the few countries in the world showing such a massive and steady increase in employment <e> <s> we are also one of the few countries in the western world which is showing an increase in the employed labour force and in the labour force available for employment <e> <s> that is a matter which time will rectify <e> <s> if we carry on with present policies and are not diverted we shall see employment rising at a rate which will soon overtake the increase in the employment force <e>", "<cs> my lords we have <e> <s> we are one of the few countries in the world showing a massive increase in employment <e> <s> may i remind your lordships of the enormous differences that have taken place in the world between say the whole of europe including the ten and the united states of america <e> <s> back in europe as a whole including the united kingdom had about million people in work and the united states had million people in work <e> <s> within the next months the number of employed people in the united states of america will overtake the number of employed people in europe and we are million souls less <e> <s> the answer is simple <e> <s> it is only the policies carried on by this government <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is nearly right <e> <s> since the early s we have lost over million jobs in this country <e> <s> that is absolutely true <e> <s> however we should ask ourselves why that is so <e> <s> for the years from to this country was bottom of the growth league in the whole of europe <e> <s> i repeat it was bottom <e> <s> however since not only have we been at the top of the growth league but this year we shall overtake the united states of america <e> <s> the government have shown that buying jobs by compromise which leads to overmanning is the slow but sure path to decline and decay <e> <s> the governments policies and the policies which they are following through are leading to jobs which will have a secure foundation <e> <s> the jobs which we have today are jobs which will last <e>", "<cs> my lords my spirit sags <e> <s> if the noble lord had heard me on television a day or two ago then perhaps he would not be asking this particular question <e> <s> all employment is productive <e> <s> there is a myth that employment is only productive if it produces things <e> <s> employment is equally productive if it is in a factory in a hotel in service sectors or in manufacturing <e> <s> it is all employment and that is the way towards wealth generation <e> <s> the mythology that somehow we must get our hands dirty and make things because that is the only way in which to be in productive employment is something which time has shown not to be correct <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> we all know the figure it is some plus <e> <s> however we also know that the number of people in employment after the uncertain period in the s is slowly steadily surely but inevitably increasing <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> the noble lord opposite was talking about the number of those people claiming benefit <e> <s> we live in a society in which i freely admit there are people who are looking for work and who are not registered as unemployed <e> <s> i suspect that there are a large number of people who claim benefit who are also not looking for work <e>", "<cs> no my lords because it depends upon the steady progress of the economy and the course upon which we are now set <e> <s> patience is a virtue <e> <s> the one thing about which i can assure your lordships house is that the policies which the government have been following and will continue to follow and from which they will not be deflected will be those policies which will bring the right result <e>", "<cs> my lords the unemployment count is based on administrative records and is inevitably subject to occasional changes in coverage as a result of changes in the way benefit is paid or in signing on arrangements <e> <s> since there have been eight changes which could conceivably affect the unemployment count five of which have had a discernible effect <e> <s> while it has been possible to estimate the effects of these changes at the time they occurred such effects do not remain constant and it is not feasible to assess what the unemployment count would be today if the changes had not been made <e> <s> however a consistent series of unemployment estimates according to the present coverage back to has been introduced and published in the july <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> the present count is a claimant count <e> <s> it records each month those taking benefit where the test is availability for work <e> <s> for some years past my department has carried out a labour force survey which is a survey of some households where the test is seeking work <e> <s> that survey shows that there are some people not registered for benefits who are looking for work <e> <s> at the same time the survey

hide different conditions in different parts of the country <e> <s> it would be foolish not to admit that there are many people genuinely seeking work and for whom unemployment is a real agony <e> <s> there is only one thing to do about that situation and that is create the correct economic conditions in which there can be real growth in employment <e> <s> that is something which this government are doing so that we may bring those terrible conditions of unemployment to an end <e>", "<cs> my lords no government have had as good a record of training as this government <e> <s> we have in four years introduced <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is entitled to his own opinions and he must forgive me if i do not share them <e> <s> i was told yesterday morning that the leader of hackney said that riots were caused by unemployment among the to year-olds <e> <s> i must tell your lordships that for two of those years there is compulsory education in schools in this country and for the next two years as from next easter there will be available to each and every young person leaving school at a place on the two-year vocational training programme <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall endeavour to answer those four or five supplementaries <e> <s> of the eight changes which have taken place in the count some have introduced initial reductions and one at least introduced an increase in the figures <e> <s> it is difficult to give an estimate today of the changes that they will make but i commend to your lordships the article in the <e>", "<cs> no my lords what we must be concerned about is a reduction in unit costs in manufacturing an increase in profitability in manufacturing and a recognition that just as the blacksmith once had his day so it may be that large numbers of people engaged in manufacturing industry may not occur in the future <e> <s> what we must have is a profitable wealth-creating manufacturing sector in this country and that i hope will come about <e>", "<cs>

youth training scheme or courses of study <e> <s> but that is not so <e> <s> a moment or so ago we referred to hackney <e> <s> in hackney in the one-year youth training scheme over per cent <e> <s> go into employment immediately and throughout the country the figure is per cent <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> the test for benefit is available for work <e> <s> the labour force survey has a different definition which is actively seeking work <e> <s> there are a large number of different people within the claimant count according to the survey <e> <s> for example there were single-person families two-thirds of whom were not seeking work and who regard themselves as fully occupied looking after their families <e> <s> there were housewives who were not seeking work who regard themselves as fully occupied in looking after the home <e> <s> this was a different analysis within the labour force survey <e> <s> technically they are acceptable for the test of available for work <e> <s> there is a difference between the benefit count and the survey under the labour force survey <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships house will have an opportunity of debating that report before much longer and i hope then that we can have a full exchange of views <e> <s> i make it quite clear that my concern is with the growth improvement and wealth creation side of manufacturing and not with one single test

of all our competitors unemployment rates both the oecd rates and the national rates from which the noble lord will see that some countries in europe have higher rates of unemployment than ours and that others have a rate going up faster than ours <e> <s> of course some others have lower rates <e> <s> unemployment is the european disease spain ireland and portugal are higher <e> <s> if there

easy answer some of us would have found it <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the first part of that question is that people should examine their own consciences as to those who actually spread despair <e> <s> secondly i resent any imputation from any side of this house that the governments statistical service cooks any figures <e>", "<cs> my lords when i say hard work i mean hard work by government and hard work by people <e> <s> it is a long and difficult process to create new employment and new wealth and to do it in a way which lasts and contributes to the economy of the country

hope very much that negotiations over the forthcoming years will deal with it <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> the cbi government ministers and i suspect from time to time those within the council of neddy try to make clear that the essential element in our position in the world today is our unit costs <e> <s> it is a combination of wage levels and productivity <e> <s> on that depends the future growth of industry in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords my concern is with unit costs <e> <s> and last year i am afraid to have to say unit costs in this country went up by per cent <e> <s> while unit costs in germany went down by per cent <e> <s> and in japan by nearly per cent <e> <s> it is not the level of pay that counts it is the level of unit costs <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to commend to your lordships house the report of your select committee on overseas trade which says <e>", "<cs> my lords i would prefer a clear commitment from all parties concerned in manufacturing industry to that aim <e>", "<cs> my lords yes although the question goes a little wide of dispersal of tourists <e> <s> it is under the youth training scheme that i think the training for tourism has received its biggest boost and industrial training boards and management boards are involving many young people in a professional approach towards tourism <e> <s> i hope very much that as we move

that our first objective should be to increase the number of overseas visitors who come to this country <e> <s> our second objective is to encourage them to see all our countryside and our great heritage outside london <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is only fair to point out that the major part of the spending on tourism in this country is by britons going around britain <e> <s> that is a very desirable state of affairs <e> <s> at the same time i think we should make it very plain unequivocally plain that we welcome overseas visitors just as we in turn hope they will welcome us to

holiday arrangements <e>", "<cs> my lords on th october the number of unemployed claimants in the united kingdom was and in october the number of people claiming benefit was <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall accept completely that this matter is not about presentation <e> <s> however what it demonstrates and what the figures which i read out demonstrate is that you cannot have an effect without a cause <e> <s> i suspect that the differences which we saw in unemployment in and were more a result of the overmanning of british industry and of many years of other governments policies than anything else <e> <s> what we can see today is that jobs are now growing at a rate unequalled in europe that there is steady real and sustained growth in the economy and that the growth this time is going to stay <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i should inform the noble lord lord hatch that spain <e>", "<cs> my lords mid- there were in the civilian labour force <e> <s> today there are in the labour force <e>

particularly show the government in a good light and nor have i ever claimed to hide beneath the figures as such <e> <s> there is only one way in which unemployment can be cured in this country and in

themselves until a statement is made a little later on about the governments future plans <e> <s> however it is safe to say that no government can at the moment be pleased with the results of policies

very difficult problems of inner urban deprivation are cured <e>", "<cs> my lords i offered to send the noble lord lord hatch a note <e> <s> i shall leave a note in the library <e> <s> however it is

develop the right liaison between the universities and the industries <e> <s> i should like the noble lord to go to salford and to aston and to see the change in attitude there <e> <s> that is something which gives me great hope <e> <s> your lordships should see the new businesses there <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord forgive me <e> <s> i was actually praising salford and aston i

indeed it is because it is october that the abolition of redundancy rebates as such will not affect local government reorganisation since by then such redundancies as will have arisen in local authorities should have taken place <e>", "<cs> no my lords i am saying that the government are never interested in persuading employers particularly employers in manufacturing to keep unnecessary labour <e> <s> indeed the whole thrust of the governments activity is to promote efficiency and productivity <e> <s> i was pointing out that the purpose of the redundancy payments when introduced in was to persuade employers to dispense with unnecessary labour <e> <s> it would be curious at a time when unemployment is at the top of all our priorities if the government continued in a small measure with helping to facilitate additional redundancies <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for her supplementary question <e> <s> i think it is important to recognise exactly what is implied by section of the social security act <e> <s> under that provision young people can be disqualified from receiving unemployment benefit for up to six weeks if they refuse a reasonable opportunity for training under yts but in practice the supplementary benefit is reduced by per cent <e> <s> in those six weeks <e> <s> since as long ago as people have been refused benefit or have had benefits reduced if <e>", "<cs> my lords the figures of course vary from region to region of the country but nationally over per cent <e> <s> of young people who leave the youth training scheme go into employment added to which another percentage goes back into full-time education <e> <s> i have little doubt that those figures will be considerably better when the two-year scheme comes into operation <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> that is deliberately vague because it is left to the appropriate benefit officer to decide <e> <s> in practice it means two or three offers of a suitable scheme <e> <s> to my knowledge it was never done on just one refusal <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> that is exactly the same sanction to which adults can be subject <e> <s> i think i should reiterate that the scheme is entirely voluntary for young people to choose to go into and for employers to take young people in <e> <s> but if after a number of refusals a young person or an adult wilfully refuses to take a job he can be subjected to a penalty of per cent <e> <s> of his benefit for a period up to six weeks <e> <s> surely that is not the end of the world <e>", "<cs> my lords of course it is the appropriate benefit officer who so decides <e> <s> but i think that we should look at the numbers involved <e> <s> in the period between july and september this year young people refused between april and june of this year people refused <e> <s> we should look at the matter in proportion <e> <s> i suspect too that the benefit officers <e>", "<cs> my lords i well appreciate that within this year perhaps as many as young people have suffered per cent <e> <s> of lost benefit for a period of up to six weeks <e> <s> however on friday of this week i shall go to meet the one-millionth young person to go into the youth training scheme <e> <s> if we put the matter in proportion i think we will begin to realise what exactly we are discussing <e> <s> we must treat young people as adults <e> <s> surely all of us in your lordships house will agree that it is our duty to offer people jobs and it is our duty to offer people places under the youth training scheme <e> <s> if under the rules they wilfully refuse to accept places for training or jobs the most that we can do is to apply a per cent <e> <s> sanction on benefit for a period of up to six weeks <e> <s> that at least is the proper place in our society <e>", "<cs> my lords precise details of the scheme have yet to be announced but i have little doubt that if adults refuse jobs or if adults who have been out of work for more than a year wilfully refuse the opportunity to go for counselling to help them back into employment we shall have to consider the matter and see what the position is <e> <s> but the position under the sanctions is simply this people obtain benefit through being available for work <e> <s> if we say to somebody who has been out of work for more than a year please come to have an interview in order to discuss your opportunities for going back into work i hope that no one who has been out of work for more than a year will refuse that offer and therefore i do not see the position ever arising <e>", "<cs> my lords i fail to understand that use of the english language <e> <s> it seems to me that we are saying to young people here is the opportunity of a place for training to help you on your way through life or you have the opportunity of a job <e> <s> but if you consistently and wilfully refuse a place on the scheme the state in all its majesty will reduce your benefit by up to per cent <e> <s> for up to six weeks <e> <s> for that to be considered compulsion is a distortion of the use of the english language <e>", "<cs> my lords i owe the noble lord an apology which i gladly make <e> <s> it is the governments policy that as from next april all young people of should be entitled as of right to a place on a two-year training programme or to continue at schools or colleges of further education until <e> <s> look forward to that day when all young people will be able to get a distinct and worthwhile qualification at the age of <e> <s> that day will not be too far distant <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only agree with the noble lord but it is of course quality of aid that is just as important as quantity <e> <s> the government are looking at the quality of the aid and the way in which it is provided as well as at the absolute amount of it <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have in mind the plight of all young people in this country whether they be in the city areas or in rural areas and whether they be coloured and from the ethnic minorities or not <e> <s> it is important that we encourage all members of our community to enter into the enterprise culture <e> <s> i suspect that in the inner cities it will be difficult to find employers who can give more jobs <e> <s> what we shall have to do is encourage a sense of enterprise and self-employment and encourage more small firms to bring back into the very centre of our cities that which created those cities in the first place that is a spirit of enterprise <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i refuse to accept that a large number of our young people are not acceptable on training schemes by reason of their inabilities <e> <s> many of our young i suspect may not have benefited from the years of compulsory education which the state afforded them but the fault lies not with them but with the education they received <e>", "<cs> no my lords because we have two circumstances to contend with <e> <s> one is the supply of venture capital and the other is the conditions of the inner cities to let enterprise flourish <e> <s> i suspect that in many instances the level of rates and other activities in the inner cities are inimical to enterprise <e> <s> we have to promote conditions which will let enterprise flourish and then ensure that we have an adequate supply of venture capital <e> <s> the government are addressing themselves to both those problems <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware of that activity and i will do all i can to assist it though i suspect that my noble friend overestimates my power and influence <e>", "<cs> my lords i gladly give the noble baroness that assurance <e> <s> of course they will be adequate <e> <s> what we must ensure is that the successor scheme to the youth training scheme is a scheme that is employment based that it is a scheme directed towards giving opportunity for employment to all young people <e> <s> those who suffer from some handicaps must of course have longer on the scheme than on the existing scheme and i have no doubt they will have in the scheme to come <e> <s> i assure the house and the noble baroness that that will be so <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i give no such assurance <e> <s> what i did was defend the young of our country <e> <s> i said that when we look at the quality of those who come out of school we should attack not the ability of our young but the quality of the teaching they receive <e> <s> that i believe is something that most noble lords will accept that we should always blame the teacher and not the pupil <e> <s> however i stand open to correction as i do on many other matters <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> of course there are ethnic minorities as there are members of the general public in the inner cities and outside who need special treatment <e> <s> there are many in our society who do <e> <s> i was attempting to say that i suspect that if we look at the right kind of circumstances for young people which will motivate and guide them then we can as the youth training scheme has adequately demonstrated do much to restore all our young to a proper place in our society <e>", "<cs> no my lords because that is not so <e> <s> in terms of government support per pupil the amount has gone up year after year since <e> <s> in terms of teacher-pupil ratio it has gone down year after year <e> <s> what we must never do and what i hope your lordships house will never do is confuse quantity with quality <e> <s> we must ensure that the quality of teaching and the quality of the motivation of our young people get better <e> <s> i am not sure that all noble lords would agree that despite the additional spend over the years we are actually getting better value for it <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly write to the noble lord and give him that figure but i remind all in your lordships house that whether the contribution is made from central government or from local government it comes from the taxpayer and the ratepayer and that it is our money <e> <s> the source of it matters little <e> <s> it is the quality and the use to which it is put that are important <e>", "<cs> my lords we have strayed a long way from the original question <e> <s> however what i will say to your lordships is simply that in england and wales there are employers in the world of education the local education <e>", "<cs> my lords this is indeed a complex problem which i suspect cannot be explored in full during a question <e> <s> the facts are that the spend under the urban programme has increased between and this year from million to million which i sense from my mathematics having benefited from a school education is a substantial increase not a reduction <e> <s> in certain partnership areas with which i am concerned as chairman of the city action teams we are now spending about million on housing the environment and employment <e> <s> but neither the government nor anyone in your lordships house would say that in spending all this money we are actually eliminating the problems <e> <s> we are all concerned with the way in which we can improve the quality of our spend in order to begin to address ourselves to some very serious problems which exist in the inner urban areas and of which we have all become painfully aware over the past few months <e>", "<cs> my lords i can speak in your lordships house on many matters but not on that particular one save to say that the only way in which employment will be maintained and even increased in this country is to concentrate on productivity and unit costs <e> <s> i hope that the series of amalgamations which have been going on continually at least for as long as i can remember will have that as an objective <e>", "<cs> my lords it is my task to co-ordinate government activity in the inner cities <e> <s> yesterday i had a very hopeful meeting with the association of metropolitan authorities <e> <s> i found a great spirit of co-operation <e> <s> i hope that we can move to seriously address ourselves to these problems <e>", "<cs> my lords in this country there is a presumption of innocence <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord aldington as i know is the house for proposing a motion today which raises issues of great importance <e> <s> i look forward with all noble lords to hearing the maiden speech of my noble friend lord clitheroe <e>", "<cs> my lords the debate today has considered vital issues for the future of our country <e> <s> perhaps i may say that the house owes a debt of gratitude for the labours of the members of the committee all of whom spoke in todays debate and particularly to the chairman of the committee my noble friend lord aldington <e> <s> looking back over some seven hours of debate a number of themes ran through it <e> <s> many of your lordships have been concerned about attitudes about our culture and about the attitude of the nation not if i may make so bold as to say so in the way which the noble lord lord stoddart stated but about the attitude to wealth creation the attitude to industry and seeing a proper respect in our society for the way in which we create wealth as well as for the way in which we divide it up <e>", "<cs> my lords i am always pleased to be corrected by the noble lord but the theme was there that we should somehow go back and spend money on infrastructure <e> <s> but that is not the point that i wish to argue tonight nor the fact that as a government we are spending more and more where it is necessary to be spent on infrastructure <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise the strength of the noble lords argument on that matter but generally speaking and taken across the piece it is the difference in quality and design <e> <s> the noble lord gave us a lecture on economics which i must confess that i did not follow but i shall read <e>", "<cs> it is half or thereabouts my lords <e> <s> again it is a decision made by individuals in the market place <e> <s> it is only by making such decisions that we shall restore the state of our industry <e> <s> i shall not refer again to jaguar but that was a simple decision <e> <s> it was exactly the same <e> <s> it had nothing to do with government money and if i may say so nothing to do with share ownership <e> <s> it was simply to do with quality <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord stoddart for his general support of this order <e> <s> the noble lord is a far-sighted man and looks forward to some day when there may be a return of another government <e> <s> i fear that i cannot look that far in the distance <e> <s> but i recollect that at the time when we looked at the industrial training boards many were found somewhat wanting and the government acted accordingly <e> <s> the important point is that in those areas where training is required we provide the training <e> <s> i am happy to give the noble lord opposite the assurance that the payroll limit does not include the employer himself and therefore the very small builder is excluded from this <e>", "<cs> no my lords it most certainly is not <e> <s> it is the government who are pointing out time and time again that unless we reduce unit costs we shall not maintain employment in this country and generate the wealth of this nation <e> <s> we can reduce unit costs in a number of ways <e> <s> one is by increasing efficiency by competitiveness and by ensuring that we do not give ourselves unnecessary wage increases <e>", "<cs> my lords i would welcome applications on the wages front from conscientious leaders of trade unions who would take into account all conditions <e> <s> the figures issued by phillips and drew and i have a copy of them are in local currency <e> <s> they are adjusted to a common currency and i see that we finish third in the list <e> <s> i should also like to point out that in the period from to a period for which the present government do not hold responsibility the figure was per cent <e> <s> and in many cases this figure is a function of inflation rather than of real return <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble friend for pointing out the elementary facts of life <e> <s> i totally agree with him <e> <s> the most important factor is that our unit labour costs should be lower than those of our competitors <e> <s> last year our unit labour costs rose above the rate of inflation those of the united states increased but were below the rate of inflation those of japan and germany actually fell <e> <s> those are the indicators for employment and nothing else <e>", "<cs> my lords an integral part of the governments policy is to bring about conditions in which employment can increase and by any standards that has been a success <e> <s> last week i announced that since the first quarter of employment has increased by jobs <e> <s> ultimately unemployment can only be reduced by the rate of increase of new jobs overtaking the increase in the labour supply <e> <s> that and that alone is the measure by which matters of this sort can best be judged <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to take issue with the noble lord lord jacques on the question of leadership but if we look at the leadership which has been exhibited in say the nationalised industry sector or that part of it which has gone into the private sector over the past year or two we will find many cases of inspired leadership irrespective of the salary level of those at the top <e> <s> leadership and example are not merely the result of measuring money they are the result of measuring all those other factors which come into account quality of goods delivery on time and many other matters <e> <s> i suspect that on this issue we are missing the main point <e> <s> the main thrust of government policy is to restore that sense of enterprise into our economy which once made our nation great and which will do so again <e>", "<cs> my lords the main thrust of industry year as it develops will be to restore into our educational system a respect for industry and wealth-creation so that the flower of our youth will be interested in going into those activities <e> <s> in that lies our hope for the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i must confess that at times i find it difficult to understand what i am talking about and i cannot answer for your entire lordships house <e> <s> however i must direct the noble earl to phillips and drew who prepared these figures <e> <s> from looking at the figures i suspect that they are in terms of historic costs and are not therefore updated <e> <s> inflation is a very real factor <e> <s> there have been periods when inflation has been greatest in this country and we have had the greatest apparent return on assets <e> <s> those are the periods when we were sowing the seeds of our doom <e>", "<cs> my lords when noble lords opposite talk in terms of a wages policy they talk in terms of a prices and incomes policy and they talk in terms of wage restraint <e> <s> we consistently draw to the attention of industry the supreme importance of getting unit labour costs down and every time that i have answered a question in your lordships house it has been on the basis of unit labour costs <e> <s> it is that factor and that factor alone which is important <e> <s> indeed wages can go up if unit labour costs come down <e>", "<cs> my lords it is significant that only in the past four or five years when we have had the highest growth rate in the whole of europe and in one or two years it has been even higher than that of the united states we have been able to afford to see conditions in which real wages rise <e>", "<cs> my lords there are many factors to be taken into account <e> <s> we have oil we have non-oil <e> <s> it is a long way from the question <e> <s> i shall write to the noble lord opposite with the detailed figures <e> <s> what is important is that during this period of oil income we have seen our overseas investments which stood at billion in stand a few months ago at billion and that is the restoration of our fortunes for the future <e>", "<cs> my lords comments flattering to the activities of ministers of this government are sufficiently rare to always come to notice <e> <s> i was well aware of that notice in <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> the establishment of the consul general in shanghai was paralleled by the establishment of a consul general of the chinese government in manchester <e> <s> shanghai is an important area for trade and is doing great work <e> <s> i hope that in the fullness of time we shall see other activities and other consul generals established in china <e> <s> it is important to realise at the moment that we have perhaps per cent <e> <s> of chinas foreign trade <e> <s> i hope very much that one day we shall have per cent <e> <s> which is the figure we had in the early seventies <e> <s> i think that then the foreign office will no doubt consider expanding our representation in china <e>", "<cs> my lords there can be little doubt that in hong kong there exists a substantial body of people who know both the united kingdom and china <e> <s> indeed i have continually advised all those companies wishing to go to china that they should contemplate using hong kong as the gateway into china <e> <s> in doing so the activity of our trade commissioner in china is to be commended <e> <s> it is alas <e> <s> not for me to say whether the commission is adequately staffed but for those who work there and those in this country who endeavour to trade there i can say that up to now i have heard few complaints about the standard of service provided in hong kong and only causes for congratulation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i have no personal knowledge of the activities of the american consul general in canton <e> <s> in relative terms canton is not that far away from hong kong and many people from hong kong travel there and back continually <e> <s> i hope that we shall indeed see a continuing expansion of our trade throughout all the seaports of china which are now open to foreign trade and through the many provinces of china <e>", "<cs> my lords in fact i suspect that we have vested more time in china than we have in japan <e> <s> indeed it is not for the government to pick those areas of the world in which we should spend our time it is for british industry and british commerce <e> <s> the governments job is to facilitate their inquiries <e> <s> that i am told by those in the know the government <e>", "<cs> my lords what we have all noticed since the historic accord on the future of hong kong which was signed not that long ago is the increasingly strong links between the most populous nation in the world and the united kingdom <e> <s> they are links which i hope will bode well for the economies of both our countries <e> <s> certainly on behalf of the government we are doing all we can to propagate them <e>", "<cs> my lords of course not <e> <s> i just hope that british businessmen who go to china will make the effort and i am sure they all do to learn at least enough about the customs and the habits of our friends in china to ensure that they undertake successful business <e>", "<cs> my lords i am indeed grateful for the expressions made by those opposite <e> <s> so far as the second point is concerned i am sure that the government will do all that is necessary to ensure that we remain competitive <e> <s> indeed as we see developments unfold over the months to come i am sure that even my friends opposite will be satisfied <e>", "<cs> my lords the facility for soft loans has been agreed with the government of china <e> <s> very shortly detailed discussions are to take place under which those who will benefit from this facility will be agreed by both governments <e> <s> until that happens of course no actual companies have benefited under soft loans agreements <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to assure your lordships house that i am becoming increasingly aware of age <e> <s> nevertheless the government have decided that in the interests of seeing as many jobs grow as possible it would not be in that interest to introduce legislation that would discriminate against age <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i think we all feel that this is so much a matter of individual performance and individual ability that it should be left to individual employers and employees to decide <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> no my lords it would not be true to say that <e> <s> public expenditure has been decreasing annually since <e>", "<cs> my lords i can certainly produce those figures but alas not at this moment since it is another question <e> <s> but i must tell your lordships that it is not public investment that is important but the total of investment <e> <s> last year fixed capital investment stood i believe at billion and next year it will be up at billion <e> <s> both figures are records <e>", "<cs> no my lords not in the slightest <e> <s> for one thing a question on public spending is a long way indeed from public investment and secondly i could contest the noble lords contention <e>", "<cs> because my lords the question asked by the noble lord lord molloy was about the percentage of the gross national product

question actually asked was about each year from until the end of the financial year and as i have offered i shall provide all the figures in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i occasionally have difficulty in discerning it myself <e>", "<cs> my lords in the first year the present government were not in office that was but as regards succeeding years it is true that for the next two years the percentage did increase <e> <s> there were slightly exceptional circumstances and in each year since then the percentage has either remained the same or has decreased <e>", "<cs> my lords those supplementary questions go very far of the question on the order paper <e> <s> what i can say is that in fact the recent price changes had little effect on receipts since the revenues were largely determined by prices for oil deliveries up to the end of <e> <s> lower oil prices for will of course reduce government revenues from united kingdom oil and gas production in <e> <s> however consumers and industry will benefit from lower oil prices <e> <s> lower prices will permit higher world trade and output with lower inflation and that must be good for europe the united kingdom and for jobs <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to make a statement on government help to people living in inner city areas <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful indeed to the noble lord lord stoddart

mind <e> <s> this is a response to conditions that have been perceived for many years in the inner cities <e> <s> the noble lord opposite makes the mistake as many who sit on the opposition benches do of confusing quantity with quality <e> <s> it is not a matter of the amount of money that <e>", "<cs> my lords i normally fear simple questions because they often prove hard to answer but not on this occasion <e> <s> if government programmes had created jobs in the inner cities i suspect that we would not have the need for this experiment <e> <s> the difficulty that we have it is one faced by all governments is that many programmes seem by their very nature to avoid the very worst areas of deprivation in our cities <e> <s> what these programmes are doing is to seek out and confine themselves to these areas <e> <s> that is what i hope we shall learn from a series of experiments and a series of models <e> <s> the jobs that government can directly create are jobs in the inland revenue and the vat offices not the sort of jobs that people normally think of as being job creation <e> <s> what the government can do is to create a climate in which jobs can grow <e> <s> as we have seen we are creating more jobs than the rest of europe put together <e> <s> what we now want to do is to create jobs in these particular inner city areas and to see conditions in which these jobs can grow <e> <s> these are areas in which many young people have not benefited from years of compulsory education <e> <s> far from it <e> <s> they are areas in which many have not even come into the youth training scheme but have stayed outside the simple rules of society <e> <s> these are the people we want to reach <e> <s> i am sure that all in your lordships house will wish the experiment success if only for the sake of the inhabitants of these areas <e>", "<cs> yes my lords in these particular areas it was thought appropriate that we start with co-ordinating government departments <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord plummer <e> <s> may i say that if a central organisation was the answer londoners having had a central organisation for these many decades surely there would not now be so many areas of central london to which he draws attention in need of urgent rebuilding <e> <s> that is neither the answer nor the way <e> <s> i thought i had made clear that within these areas the government already contribute through the programmes the manpower services commission the home office and the department of environment over million to which we are adding another million merely

small amounts of money <e> <s> we are talking about some million or more to which we have added a further million in areas in which we have some people living <e> <s> the programmes can be

those who live in these areas <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to make new provision instead of section of the sex discrimination act to amend section of that act to provide for the removal of certain restrictions applying to the working hours and other working conditions of women and to repeal the baking industry hours of work act <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that all in your

of places <e> <s> i am quite sure we shall find enough places on employers premises and that those firms which have now realised the great advantage to them as well as to young people in taking part

north-west or in the south <e> <s> but we have to notice that the world has moved on that no longer are we the worlds largest supplier of bulk steel no longer are we the worlds largest provider of

right price then i suspect that we shall find more british goods sold at home <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer receives many representations from all sides of industry including of course the cbi and i have no doubt at all that he is giving serious thought to all of them <e>", "<cs> my lords the leader of hackney council said that the riots were caused by unemployed to year-olds <e> <s> i replied that they should be at school until and from next year would have a place in the yts until they were <e> <s> i stand by that remark and continue to stand by it <e> <s> there is all the difference between the opportunities for young people in the north-east and the north-west and the opportunities for young people in the southern half of england

regular monitoring of yts programmes by the manpower services commission the standards of training on two-year yts will be ensured by a number of specific measures including courses leading to qualifications a new training standards advisory service and training by approved training organisations <e>", "<cs> my lords the important part of the two-year yts is to ensure that all young people who enter not only benefit from their time on the scheme but leave with a valid qualification or a credit towards a qualification which will help them build up their future lives <e> <s> it matters little i suspect whether they take this training provided that it is good with an employer in the private sector some employers in the public sector or even in the armed forces <e> <s> there is an

representatives and the world of education <e> <s> each and every scheme is monitored and can be closed down if any case of the kind referred to is proved and indeed would be if such a thing happened <e> <s> what i do know is that there are many young people in the inner cities who do not take advantage of the yts having gone through school systems which unfortunately bring them out into the world of work not prepared for it <e>", "<cs> my lords i have visited many schemes of industrial catering and variants on that <e> <s> i suspect there may not be any in catering for hospitals because until

debate and we should not trivialise it by discussing mere statistical changes in the figures <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful for the observations of my noble friend with whom i entirely agree <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for that question but in all sincerity i do not think it is my place to announce incorrect figures <e> <s> the purpose of this change at the request of the statisticians was to reduce an over-recording of unemployment <e> <s> the changes that i said will be announced in parallel are to show the percentage of those unemployed in the current series and also to include a separate figure this will not happen until june or july this year onwards including the self-employed and the armed forces so that members of the public can have a better idea of the actual percentage of those unemployed compared to those in work <e>", "<cs> my lords i appeared on that programme this morning <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not the slightest doubt that we

believe my statement to be absolutely clear and if there is any feeling in the land that the government are fiddling the figures it is due far more to the smoke that was thrown up in the questions put by the noble lord lord stoddart and by many of the opposition who have tried to read into this all sorts of disgraceful if i may use that word charges <e> <s> there is no fiddle <e> <s> if noble lords

people in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his observation but as i have continually endeavoured to point out to your lordships unemployment is a european problem <e> <s> in europe there are many different political systems <e> <s> we even have heaven help us <e> <s> a socialist government <e> <s> in france there is a socialist government which tried to conduct the policies advocated by the labour party but which failed dismally and today france has rising unemployment on a shrinking workforce <e> <s> i would point out that last year the workforce in this country increased by and despite that unemployment went up by about <e> <s> we shall have to see what the future brings <e> <s> what i do know is that if we do not follow the policies advocated by this government the position will be far worse <e>", "<cs> my lords let me say at the outset that i slightly resent the implication that i am not here to answer questions the whole time as the noble lord said <e> <s> if your lordships look at the record you will find that i am quite assiduous in my attendance in your lordships house <e> <s> in another place attendance for questions by a minister is once every three weeks <e> <s> if your lordships look at my record i think you will find that i am here more than often enough <e> <s> i also have responsibilities outside your lordships chamber and i take both responsibilities seriously <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will understand that <e> <s> secondly although i am not in charge of the coal board my reading of the situation is that despite the report there was no way in which that mine could ever be held to be profitable and the review body thought that it should continue in certain circumstances for other reasons <e> <s> it is not my responsibility but if the noble lord wishes to have a question put down he will find it answered in another place <e> <s> the question has little to do with unemployment it has a great deal to do <e>", "<cs> oh yes my lords it has a great deal to do with employment elsewhere in the industry <e> <s> without an efficient and productive coal industry and efficient energy prices we shall not retain our place in the world <e>", "<cs> no my lords i am quite capable of speaking for myself <e> <s> what i am saying is that i shall show respect to a select commitee in another place by answering it directly and not in the form of a reply to a question in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that everyone in your lordships house would be concerned on both counts to ensure first that all long-term unemployed people get as much help and assistance as they can and secondly that they are genuinely unemployed <e> <s> this measure in itself is there to determine what help we can give to long-term unemployed people <e>", "<cs> my lords we announced a pilot scheme which started on th january and we are studying the results as we go along <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret to say that perhaps exceptionally the report in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i can certainly let your lordships house have details of numbers from memory <e> <s> i believe that the total number of long-term unemployed within the pilot areas is in the order of <e> <s> i shall certainly write to the noble lord with the figure if that is incorrect <e> <s> of that some per cent <e> <s> of those interviewed that is have agreed to follow up a positive opportunity as a result <e> <s> many of those have gone on the re-start programme some are going to join job clubs others are interviewing for jobs and still others are interviewing for places on the community programme <e> <s> many different opportunities are available <e> <s> it is a pilot scheme and we are following it through <e> <s> i do not think i should make a formal report to your lordships house in answer to a question but find some other suitable occasion for it <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall find a suitable method of ensuring that that information becomes known in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords the purpose of a pilot is to study the results <e> <s> once we have studied the results we shall see what to do then <e>", "<cs> my lords what we are finding through these pilots is the best way to help long-term unemployed <e> <s> we have seen some interesting results from them and we are now studying the results urgently to find how we can spread them as soon as we can <e> <s> we shall not waste one day in doing so <e> <s> we will find ways of helping long-term unemployed people whether they live in rural areas or in inner cities <e>", "<cs> yes my lords the foreign and commonwealth office is in close contact with the united states authorities on all aspects of the iranian-iraqi conflict including the supply of defence equipment <e> <s> these contacts have included discussion on iranian military procurement activities based in london <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a matter where we have no evidence at the moment and therefore we shall be looking to see where we can acquire some <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but i would wish to assure the noble lord lord williams and your lordships house that we have no evidence of any involvement of the iranian national oil company in this activity <e>", "<cs> my lords i think in all the circumstances that it would be better to say that the government have no evidence in the matter and therefore cannot comment further <e> <s> whether or not inquiries have been made and the outlook on those inquiries are not matters that i think we should raise in this way <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for pointing out that hackney is an area of high unemployment <e> <s> although hackney is in the south of england it often seems to me that unemployment is not so much a north-south divide as an inner urban-suburban rural divide and there are many areas in the south which have high unemployment <e>", "<cs> my lords i resent the accusation about lip service because it is not lip service <e> <s> we are concerned to ensure that all our young have opportunities to get on in life <e> <s> we have to look at the quality of education which many young people receive in the inner city areas we have to take into account that many politically motivated people are concerned to prevent us even from taking stock of those of the ethnic minority who exist among the unemployed <e> <s> i have had considerable difficulties in that regard <e> <s> without the information it is extremely difficult to answer the supplementary question <e>", "<cs> my lords i was pointing out that there is an enormous difference between areas like middlesbrough and cleveland where unemployment is very high and where the job opportunities are alas few and hackney where unemployment is very high <e> <s> i was making the point that it is situated in the middle of london where considerable job opportunities exist <e> <s> i think that it is necessary and serious that we should go to investigate why these pockets of high unemployment should exist in areas where there are many job opportunities <e> <s> it is a matter which concerns me and one which i shall happily look into provided that no opportunity is taken merely to make political capital out of such a visit <e>", "<cs> my lords i often have opportunities to point out to the cbi and to your lordships house that it is not the government who directly create jobs it is the people <e> <s> it is for the government to do all they can in order to encourage those circumstances to come about <e> <s> there is an enormous difference between a report of a select committee in the other place or a report of the cbi and those who seek to achieve political confrontation <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am no stranger to hackney <e> <s> i pointed out to your lordships house that for example for adult training in hackney we shall see an increase in the figures between this year and next year of no less than per cent <e> <s> that is from to in those who will be engaged in adult training <e> <s> we are concerned to ensure that conditions improve in hackney but what i must repeat again and again to your lordships is that hackney is not an island it exists in the whole of london <e> <s> what we must do is ensure that the job opportunities that exist in the whole of london are available to those who reside in hackney <e>", "<cs> my lords among the many responsibilities i have for answering questions in your lordships house the census is not one of them <e> <s> i can only give the figures i am given <e> <s> i am told that no figure exists for the london borough of hackney <e> <s> i will inquire again <e> <s> if it does exist i will write to the noble lord and have a copy of the letter placed in the library <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the difficulty <e> <s> that is why in many areas of the country there is an adequate supply of premium places which help schemes whether or not there are sufficient employers <e> <s> what i am also aware of is that there are those who for political motivation or other causes go around telling young people that they are working for slave wages and that they should avoid yts <e> <s> they tell young people for sheer political reasons that they should not go on to a scheme a scheme which i believe to be real and not only to be helping young people but to be thoroughly endorsed by the tuc and the cbi <e>", "<cs> my lords let me say two things <e> <s> first of all as far as i am aware hackney is in london and not birmingham and i was referring to hackney <e> <s> secondly i am referring not to any member of your lordships house but to those who out of sheer political opportunism are saying to young people directly do not join yts <e> <s> i see that there are those on the other side of the house who agree with me <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord is correct <e> <s> i find it slightly curious that in large areas of the country many young people willingly go on to yts <e> <s> it is only when we get to certain areas within the inner cities that we find these difficulties <e> <s> in some areas that i look at many young people i meet say to me and to those who work in the scheme that they are entitled to more money <e> <s> they do not take into account the real value of yts to them and to the community as a whole <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no doubt that the invitation which i received on monday was totally unconnected with the noble lords question <e> <s> i shall consider it and see what can be done <e>", "<cs> my lords i was trying to set a precedent for the shortness of an answer <e> <s> self-employed people who claim supplementary benefit are included in the count <e> <s> the only people who are not would be self-employed people who were not eligible for unemployment benefit but in the event that people do not have sufficient means they would be included in the count <e> <s> indeed the survey shows that some previously self-employed people who were seeking work but were not claiming benefit were therefore excluded from the count but at the same time that was offset by others who said they were claimants but were not seeking work or who had some paid work during the week in reference <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness <e> <s> the monthly claimant count is a count of all those who are claiming unemployment benefit or who if unemployed and available for work are claiming supplementary benefit <e> <s> the employment statistics are the ones which we wish to ensure are correct <e> <s> at the moment we only get those results either by the census which is once in every three years or by the labour force survey <e> <s> i am looking to find ways of advancing the publication of the labour force survey so that we get a more up-to-date account of the number of employed people within the economy <e>", "<cs> my lords i will inquire <e>", "<cs> my lords the economy has taken the unprecedented collapse in the oil price in its stride a tribute to its underlying strength and to seven years of sound and prudent financial and economic management <e>", "<cs> my lords when the chancellor has to prepare a budget he has to do that on the basis of certain assumptions about the levels of prices and other matters in the year to come <e> <s> the past three months have been particularly difficult for the chancellor and i think all your lordships would wish to congratulate him on the skill and expertise he has shown in managing the economy in such a difficult time <e> <s> the advice that the chancellor has taken about the price of dollars per barrel is his best assumption in the present circumstances <e> <s> what will happen in the future is not known to anyone in your lordships house nor even i suspect to sheikh yamani himself <e>", "<cs> my lords it demonstrates not only that government policies can be pursued and are being pursued but that they will be pursued in the face of future circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that in the course of time circumstances will show us that that will be greatly to the advantage of europe and the united kingdom is firmly part of europe <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the second part of the noble lords question <e> <s> as the months and years roll by we shall see that the <e>", "<cs> my lords that is another question but to satisfy the noble lords curiosity about the shape of the budget may i merely say that the shape of the unemployment measures was all that i could have wished for <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall deal with the last part of that question because it will be up to my right honourable friend to prepare his budget in the normal way <e> <s> i have no doubt at all that he will return to the other place in a years time to deliver the next budget when everything will be going according to plan <e> <s> i should like to break the linkage which is shared by those opposite that somehow unemployment and the expenditure of central government funds are inextricably linked <e> <s> they are not <e> <s> we have to look very closely at the quality of output and not the quantity of any input <e> <s> i believe that the package we have and the improvements that we can make in our present expenditure on unemployment which runs into many billions of pounds each year will show that we can deal with unemployment <e> <s> i know that it is a great temptation for your lordships house to deal with unemployment <e> <s> it is the central issue of our day <e> <s> this is the fifth question in the past eight days but the original question was about oil <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i hope very much that those efforts will continue undiminished because even with those price levels we will find that efforts to reduce energy consumption will pay for themselves in a very short time <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that market forces and being spendthrift can actually go together <e> <s> it has seemed that the way governments have intervened in the past has resulted in policies more spendthrift than anything else <e>", "<cs> my lords assuming that the price of oil does not change i would invite the noble lord to put down a question in a few weeks time to congratulate the government on the then price of oil at the pumps <e>", "<cs> my lords yes gladly <e> <s> in the net overseas investment of the united kingdom was billion <e> <s> from the chancellors statement your lordships will realise that today it is billion the greatest amount of any industrial country in the world other than japan <e> <s> we are second <e> <s> the dividends from those overseas investments will continue to flow long after the oil has run out <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> i think that it will also show that we are entering a sixth successive year of growth and it looks very much as if the seventh will also be in front of us <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i am glad to enlighten the noble lord <e> <s> if we look at what counts with people which is the amount of money that they take home and not the amount of money that they pay in taxes we find that the income of those on average earnings between and went down by per cent <e> <s> whereas since their income has gone up by per cent <e> <s> in real terms <e> <s> it is your income that you spend and not your taxes <e>", "<cs> my lords i am assured that the figures take account of both direct and indirect taxes and national insurance <e>", "<cs> no my lords because the only matter that counts surely is the amount which a family has to spend on rent rates food living and everything else including vat <e> <s> if we take the net expenditure after deducting for taxes we find whether a person be single married with no children or married with two children on half average earnings or on double average earnings he will have far more in net take-home pay now than in <e> <s> perhaps for the benefit of all your lordships i will cause the figures to be placed in the library <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> but the government were also brought into power in order to see the economy become wealth-creating again <e> <s> what these figures represent is the fact that year after year those of us in work and even those of us out of work can see an improvement in our net income in real terms <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i think all your lordships can take comfort from the fact that those on half average earnings have seen since this government came to power an increase of about per cent <e> <s> in real terms <e> <s> it is also true that there are many now on perhaps times average earnings and maybe even more <e> <s> but is it merely a coincidence that that has come about at the same time as we have seen <e>", "<cs> yes my lords and i hope they will continue to be as long as this government follow the same policies over the next decade <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not in the slightest bit complacent about unemployment no one could be in view of the current figures <e> <s> however we are unique in providing for the first time in europe indeed i believe in the industrialised world three years as a guarantee for all year-old school leavers two years on yts and one year available to those on the new workers scheme <e> <s> that will ensure that for all young people leaving school this year at the age of unemployment is becoming an option and i hope that it is an option that they will not take <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord asked a very simple question <e> <s> he asked <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know to which responsible organisations the noble lord refers <e> <s> i am merely saying that those on half average earnings are if they are single per cent <e> <s> better off in real terms if they are married with no children per cent <e> <s> better off and if they are married with two children per cent <e> <s> better off <e> <s> to me that means an increase in real terms in living standards <e>", "<cs> my lords there are countries with higher unemployment <e> <s> as concerned as we are all with unemployment it seems slightly strange does it not <e> <s> that every question that i am asked no matter on what subject always ends up with unemployment <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord wishes to put down a question dealing specifically with that point i shall be glad to answer it <e> <s> our unemployment is by no means the worst in europe <e> <s> indeed i would suggest that in regard to young people we are making the best efforts to deal with the problem and that our record stands comparison with any other country in europe <e>", "<cs> my lords we are a long way from the question <e> <s> if we may keep to it i think that would be of advantage <e>", "<cs> my lords business in the community is taking the lead in encouraging an increase in secondments to local enterprise agencies from large firms <e> <s> such secondments can qualify for tax relief <e> <s> the government fully support business in the communitys efforts in that area <e>", "<cs> my lords at present the total number of local enterprise agencies is some in england and some in the united kingdom as a whole <e> <s> there are in england as far as we can see people on secondment from the private sector <e> <s> that figure is increasing all the time <e> <s> i cannot help the noble lord as to the companies and organisations that have provided those people but i shall be happy to let him have that information if he wishes <e>", "<cs> my lords i pay glad and grateful tribute to the many organisations and companies in this country that have allowed some of their brightest executives to go into local enterprise agencies and to help with the promotion and growth not only of new jobs and businesses through those agencies but also with the many other programmes run by the manpower services commission <e> <s> indeed it is a sign of the responsibility felt by the private sector for the state of the economy and for those not in full employment <e> <s> i am very glad to pay tribute to those organisations <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad on this occasion and alas it is only on rare occasions to be fully in agreement with the noble lord <e> <s> i am happy to remind all in your lordships house that on st april the local enterprise agency grants scheme will commence for a period of five years <e> <s> that scheme will give money to local enterprise agencies up and down the land but only to those in need of central government assistance those whose income is no more than in the first year <e> <s> such support is designed to taper off as local enterprise agencies come to rely upon the support of local industry <e> <s> we felt that the best way to ensure that agencies remain relevant to needs is for them to demonstrate to us that they can obtain help from the private sector <e>", "<cs> my lords i hardly think that local enterprise agencies have been handicapped by the policies of this government <e> <s> indeed they are almost a creation of the policies of this government <e> <s> where i suspect we depart from the noble lord is that we believe that continuing support from government without a demonstration of the support of the private sector would succeed only in institutionalising the agencies and would cease to make them relevant to the creation of small firms in a short time <e> <s> we are here ensuring that local enterprise agencies will always be relevant to the needs of their localities because they will have to demonstrate continually that they have support from the companies there <e>", "<cs> my lords we live at a time when tourism continues to enjoy a worldwide growth and it is important for the prospects for employment and growth in the united kingdom economy that we take our fair share of tourists and encourage them to return <e> <s> the government play their part by giving support in the form of grant-in-aid to the tourist boards but in this regard we look primarily to the industry itself which i know is making great efforts to improve the standards of service welcome accommodation and tourist attractions <e> <s> at the end of the day we must do all that we can to ensure that our visitors want to come back <e>", "<cs> my lords i am rarely satisfied on matters of training <e> <s> all i can say is that yts is making a significant contribution to the professionalism of the tourist industry and that for the very first time there is a national two-year training programme which can lead to improved standards <e> <s> however i suspect that we still live in a world where we equate service with servility and it is difficult to persuade young people of the worthwhile occupations that exist within the tourism industry <e>", "<cs> my lords we are looking forward to receiving a report which will consider the adequacy of hotel rooms <e> <s> i suspect that there are not a sufficient number but i also know that this is a matter for local democracy in terms of town planning <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i have always found that those who take short-term advantage of situations pay the price <e> <s> i hope very much that the tourism industry and hotels in central london and throughout the united kingdom are aware of conduct which is in the industrys best long-term interest <e> <s> however i must say that the spending of overseas visitors to the united kingdom and they contributed million in which as i said was an increase of per cent <e> <s> is still a minor part of the total spend on tourism in this country which was million <e> <s> the majority of the money spent on tourism in the united kingdom is still spent by britons travelling in britain <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall read that debate with great interest and i hope that the conditions that prevail inside your lordships house may one day prevail throughout the country <e>", "<cs> no my lords it would be better i believe for oil prices to adjust and to fall to their correct level <e> <s> i notice that during the last few days they have come back very closely to dollars a barrel <e> <s> we shall have to see how the position develops <e>", "<cs> my lords this country does not sit back it does join in <e> <s> it supported the baker initiative <e> <s> it appreciates that the best way to go about this is through a country by country case by case approach and that it ill serves anyone debtor or creditor nation to speculate about the future level of oil prices <e> <s> we have to adjust to circumstances as they arise and dampen down unnecessary speculation <e>", "<cs> my lords by following the policy that the government are following at the present time <e>", "<cs> no my lords but this government recognise that the price of oil like the price of other commodities is a market matter <e> <s> the government recognise the limit of the ability of themselves or any other collection of governments to <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no doubt that within the scenario of any change in the oil price there are as many winners as losers <e> <s> what we are seeing is that this country was not dependent on a particular level of price of oil <e> <s> we see that there is a remarkable opportunity now for our manufacturing industries for exports and for the growth of the economy as a whole <e> <s> however my right honourable friend the chancellor took an assumption of dollars a barrel as the price of oil for the forthcoming year <e> <s> we shall just have to see what level the price of oil actually achieves <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish that i shared the noble lords belief that governments could get together and look ahead with great precision at such a volatile subject as the price of oil <e> <s> for every loser when there is a change in the price of oil there is a winner <e> <s> for every venezuela there is a poland <e> <s> a case by case study is the only way that we can react <e>", "<cs> yes my lords because this situation can best be dealt with by a case by case study <e> <s> what we have seen in helping the baker plan proceed and looking at what has been done through the paris club and in other ways is that the problem is gradually slowly and painfully being reduced <e>", "<cs> my lords may i take this opportunity of dealing with the matters raised by my noble friend lady seear and other noble lords <e>", "<cs> forgive me my lords the noble baroness lady seear who i hope is a friend outside this chamber as well as in other places <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful for the admission this afternoon by the noble lord lord wedderburn that we are marching forward <e> <s> i trust that he means not only with regard to the elimination of discrimination for reasons of sex but also with regard to all other policies of her majestys government <e> <s> perhaps i may say to the noble and learned lord lord denning that it is many decades since i was a law student but i was always told that the reason cases are published by courts the court of appeal and by your lordships house is for a doctrine of precedent to apply <e> <s> i am not sure that the doctrine of precedent should apply in cases of tribunals <e> <s> this i think is a very real distinction <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness lady turner and i agree with her when she says that it is the duty of unions to save jobs <e> <s> of course it is and i hoped very much that the unions would in their wisdom have seen fit to support the governments position in this matter since it is the continuation of jobs within the industry with which we are concerned <e> <s> nor should we allow ourselves to be side-tracked by individual cases of employing year-olds within the baking industry <e> <s> that is clearly wrong under other legislation and is not covered by the matter which we are discussing this afternoon which is fully in the spirit of the sex discrimination bill and is concerned with the removal and elimination of employment practices based upon sex <e> <s> surely we should seek the elimination of both protections in this instance <e>", "<cs> my lords i must confess to the noble baroness lady seear that i have heard so much about cowboys this afternoon that i am beginning to feel a little like the lone ranger <e> <s> but cowboys are a state of mind <e> <s> whatever the law may or may not be we have to ensure that we do not have cowboys in our midst by means other than simply legislating them out <e> <s> i would assure the noble and learned lord lord denning and my noble friend lady elliot that section of the health and safety at <e>", "<cs> my lords may i assure the noble baroness that what starts off as considering shortly becomes an inflexible duty <e> <s> that is the way in which these matters get interpreted and develop <e>", "<cs> my lords i assure the noble lord that that does not refer to the duty to take a bath <e> <s> how would employers take account of conflicting interests between individual or groups of employees <e> <s> not all employees will have the same interests <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to assure my noble friend that my understanding of the european court judgment was simply that that which it was permissible to sell in the country of origin could not be made part of a ban on importation <e> <s> but it is a matter which we are considering <e> <s> i hope before very much longer we shall have a view <e>", "<cs> my lords i may alas disappoint someone in your lordships house by saying that i cannot accede to the last request <e> <s> at the moment it is permissible to manufacture and sell these objects within the united kingdom <e> <s> i do not think that the relaxation of the ban on importation will make any difference to the present position <e> <s> however it is a matter which is a cause for concern <e> <s> we are looking at the situation and i hope before much longer we shall make a decision <e>", "<cs> my lords i was at one time but a humble solicitor and it does not fall to me to disagree with the noble and learned lord or with the european court <e> <s> but i believe that the essence of the decision was simply that there could not be a ban by our courts on importation of that which it was permissible to sell in this country <e> <s> however we are considering the matter and i hope that we shall come back with a decision shortly <e> <s> it is difficult for me to say any more than this and i hope that all in your lordships house will understand <e>", "<cs> my lords yes but goods which are obscene will be covered by the obscene publications act and will continue to be seized at import <e> <s> we are talking about a different matter entirely that is a customs test of goods called indecent <e> <s> the decision was merely on the ban on indecent goods which are permitted to be sold within the united kingdom and which could not be barred by customs or so the european court held <e>", "<cs> my lords i hear everything that the noble viscount says <e> <s> all i can say is that it is becoming increasingly difficult to sell such objects on a sunday <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but i would rely on your lordships to accept that this is a responsibility of customs and excise for whom i gladly answer in your lordships house <e> <s> it is not my primary responsibility but i shall speak to my right honourable friend and i shall notify him <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact that i did so in snow was neither here nor there <e> <s> what was interesting even in that weather which was cold for any time of the year was that when i left just after lunch visitors had already arrived <e> <s> even at outdoor centres of that sort providing the value that they do visitors at this time of year is extremely good <e>", "<cs> my lords the very first thing i would say is that neither i nor the government have in any way altered the basis of calculating the figures <e> <s> what has happened and happened this time for the first month is that there was a delay of two weeks in order that there could be a more correct check of the monthly claimant count <e> <s> that is what happened recently <e> <s> i resent the charges made in another place that anyone has fiddled the figures <e> <s> accuracy surely is something everyone in your lordships house would wish to see <e>", "<cs> my lords no one would endeavour to diminish the very real problems of the north-east of england in looking for new jobs to replace all the jobs lost in the declining industries <e> <s> but on the other hand we do not often enough give credit to the efforts that are being made in the north-east to find new employment to the enterprise being shown and to the success that these endeavours are producing <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> the last thing that i would wish to do is to mislead your lordships house <e> <s> what the noble lord is asking me to do and i shall gladly do it is to say that seasonally adjusted the claimant count shows an increase and has shown an increase each month <e> <s> but i was pointing out the difference between the claimant count which is a total of all those receiving benefit and the labour force survey which is an estimate of all the people without jobs and seeking work <e> <s> the labour force survey definition is the definition which is adopted by the united states of america in looking at unemployment <e> <s> there are those around who say that that provides a better measure of unemployment <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be glad to answer the noble lords question if he will put it down on another occasion <e> <s> it is a very different question but one that i shall be quite happy to answer <e> <s> secondly i am not sure that there is an underlying increase in unemployment <e> <s> i gladly admit that there is an underlying increase in the claimant count <e> <s> i look at the other evidence before me and it shows a different picture <e> <s> just as unemployment cannot be solved by any one simple solution nor can we explain away unemployment by one set of figures <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful that the noble lord does not wish to be unkind to me but let me tell him to have faith <e> <s> he will see that the policies that this government have been following and in particular the policies of the past few months will do more than anything else towards dealing with the terrible problem of unemployment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to say that million new jobs have come into being since march <e> <s> i am happy to say also that we are experiencing faster employment growth in this country than in any other country in the european community <e> <s> indeed i remind the house that france with a diminishing working population is still showing a fall in employment <e> <s> we have a fast-growing working population <e> <s> also we give per cent <e> <s> of all adults of working age a job <e> <s> the figures for france and germany are per cent <e> <s> and per cent <e> <s> respectively <e> <s> however i must fail to give your lordships any information about the black economy <e>", "<cs> my lords the one thing that will not help anyone who is unemployed in this country is the preaching of despair at him day after day after day <e> <s> if there is one thing that i resent it is those people who go round saying that there is no hope no opportunity and no chance <e> <s> there is <e> <s> we will work our way out of the problem <e> <s> there is no simple solution but hard work <e> <s> i doubt very much whether anyone in authority in the united states would advocate franklin d roosevelts line of state works to get unemployment down in any other country <e>", "<cs> my lords part of the answer is that the account figures show that about per cent <e> <s> of those claiming benefit were not looking for work during the week of the survey <e> <s> i do not know the explanation for that but the definition of unemployment in the labour force survey is simply those out of a job and looking for work <e> <s> the claimant count is simply a measure of those claiming benefit <e> <s> neither of them are perfect and neither are absolutely accurate <e>", "<cs> my lords if it will give comfort to the noble lord for me to admit that the claimant count seasonally adjusted is increasing then i gladly do so because that is true <e> <s> i was asked in the question what the latest figures on unemployment show <e> <s> not wishing to mislead your lordships house i have therefore referred to the labour force survey <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i wish to assure the noble lord lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill do now pass <e> <s> i said at second reading that with this bill the government were carrying forward their commitment to promote equal opportunities in employment between men and women <e> <s> during the discussions in your lordships house we have heard differing views as to how some provisions should operate and indeed whether some should be omitted altogether <e> <s> there has however been no disagreement over what i would describe as the essence of the bill that men and women should be treated equally in employment and that barriers should be removed which hinder either from making their full contribution to the economy <e>", "<cs> my lords i am pleased to discover at least that i am at the same time both horrid and naive in insisting perhaps on a priority of this government which as far as i am concerned will always remain a priority of this government <e> <s> it is simply employment <e> <s> when this government express concern about the burdens on business they do not do so for any reason other than the effect it has on <e>", "<cs> my lords i was marvelling at the wisdom of the house when it rejected some of the amendments proposed by noble lords opposite <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his unsolicited testimonial to my candour and honesty <e> <s> however i must tell him that this is not a new problem it is a problem that has been concerning her majestys government for many decades <e> <s> in we introduced itbs and they had an effect but alas the effect appeared to be to increase bureaucracy and not to increase the supply of training <e>", "<cs> my lords i regard the responsibility for all training as primarily in the hands of management <e> <s> the fact is that management should appreciate that having a more professionally trained workforce and in my book that includes management can only be to the benefit of their own organisation and to the united kingdom as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure how we define adult training <e> <s> of course this government are the ones who introduced the two-year yts and the government who are giving more training to more people than at any time before in the history of our nation <e> <s> moreover it is training which is essential foundation training and training for young people which has led to two-thirds of them entering full employment or going back into full-time education or further training <e> <s> at the moment we are concerned about the general acceptance throughout the whole of industry and commerce of the fact that a better trained workforce is a more efficient workforce and works to the common good <e> <s> this understanding can only come from employers themselves and not from the government telling them that it is so <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but i wish to assure the noble baroness that in fact of the training boards were disbanded some three or four years ago because they were thought to be overly bureaucratic <e> <s> i am told that the views of the industries were widely canvassed before that decision was taken <e> <s> the engineering industry training board of course continues to function to this day as do the construction industry training board and five other training boards <e> <s> nevertheless even within the field of engineering training there has been a movement in the <e>", "<cs> my lords the world passes on <e> <s> craftsmen are just as necessary as they were in the past but possibly in lesser numbers <e> <s> however one great matter calls for congratulation today <e> <s> i read that the amalgamated union of engineering workers decided yesterday that it would at long last drop time-based apprenticeship and go towards standards <e> <s> this has been long overdue and i hope that we can now begin to see a revolution in the whole field of apprenticeship <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i have no wish to disappoint the noble viscount but i have no intention of leaving these benches for some considerable time <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but i think that there is cause for hope and quiet satisfaction about the future <e> <s> i attended yesterday the spring open an exhibition at the novotel hotel in hammersmith <e> <s> i saw there how we had become a world leader in the principle of distant learning covering all sorts of occupations <e> <s> this affords considerable cause for concern because english is the worlds first commercial language and it could be the worlds greatest training language as well <e> <s> this is an area in which we have considerable expertise <e> <s> i only wish that our own employers used it more <e>", "<cs> my lords we are examining the proposals <e> <s> one of the great difficulties in the <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are studying the american experience of workfare programmes which was featured in the panorama programme on th april <e> <s> we have already applied some of the lessons of these programmes in the restart programme to help the long-term unemployed <e> <s> for example jobclubs have been very successful in a number of states and have proved equally successful here <e> <s> we are planning to establish jobclubs by the end of this year and to increase the number to as soon as possible thereafter <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a matter which must be handled with care <e> <s> nevertheless i am aware of the views of lord beveridge <e> <s> he said in the beveridge report <e>", "<cs> my lords all sides of your lordships house will agree with that <e> <s> the best thing for everybody is to be back at work <e> <s> but we are part of europe and it is a europe-wide problem and a problem with which we must deal <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord that schemes such as those practised in russia are not what we should contemplate even in our wildest dreams <e> <s> nevertheless we must ensure that people do not become so discouraged that they give up or so determined to live off the work of others that they do not try <e> <s> we have to find ways in which we can help people to help themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords we are investigating the workfare programmes in the united states <e> <s> we commissioned a report some months ago <e> <s> i hope that report will be released shortly <e> <s> there is an essential difference between the united states and this country <e> <s> the difference is the wholesale co-operation which that programme showed between unions and all parts of society in promoting such a programme <e> <s> i am not sure that co-operation would necessarily be received here <e>", "<cs> my lords of course and the insurance element is unemployment benefit which lasts for the months <e> <s> that is the period of the insurance benefit <e> <s> we are talking on this matter about supplementary benefit for those people who have been out of work for more than one year <e> <s> that is the essential difference between the two <e>", "<cs> my lords i said that we shall investigate this matter with great care <e> <s> i cannot see much future for the kind of programme that was seen in oklahoma i believe in which mothers of eight-weeks-old children were forced to put them into day care so that they could go to search for work <e> <s> on the other hand i believe that there is something that we possibly could do <e> <s> the one element which ran through that programme was the apparent approval by those receiving benefit and those giving the work that it was a good scheme <e> <s> that is worthy of investigation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the suggestion <e> <s> only one matter holds me back from this <e> <s> it seems to me that those parts of the world where unemployment is high and the economy is sluggish consider that these are problems of the future that there will not be sufficient work to go round <e> <s> in other parts of the world where the economy is growing fast the problem is exactly the opposite <e> <s> they are looking for people to fill the jobs <e> <s> i do not know how many in your lordships house will have noticed that in the united states the debate taking place is on extending the age of retirement <e> <s> the retirement age is moving up to <e> <s> there is legislation going through in the united states to give people the right to work until <e> <s> the problem seems to be the exact reverse of the problem that appears in europe <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord wells-pestell for introducing the subject of this debate <e> <s> before i say anything further i must apologise to all your lordships for my inability to remain until the end of the debate <e> <s> unfortunately i have a long-standing engagement but i assure all in your lordships house that i shall read with care all the contributions to the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords a great gap divides us and i have an enormous task to bring home the economic realities of life <e> <s> it does not matter two hoots what happens to the level of tax and what happens to the level of national insurance <e> <s> what does matter is what people spend at the end of the day and how much money they take home <e> <s> until we get that understanding of their economics then i think that i had better pass swiftly on to education because this is a profitless area with noble lords opposite <e> <s> all that i can say is that i will gladly swap the tax bill of the noble lord opposite for his net take-home pay because i think he will find that his net take-home pay and that of any noble lord is always larger than their tax bill <e>", "<cs> my lords my reference to the society of envy was in reply to a remark that i did not think was justified about the man who built up jaguar taking it from units a year to and who knows many more beyond and who is giving employment to many people <e> <s> to say that people who are the leaders of companies that succeed are unworthy of the salaries they draw is only showing envy and is not looking at the achievements <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have thought that expenditure of billion an all-time high would show that this government are very concerned indeed to ensure an adequate supply of skilled labour <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but these are two distinct matters <e> <s> i can express some satisfaction with the governments efforts towards meeting the demand for skills in short supply but at the same time dissatisfaction about the view taken by employers towards their responsibilities for carrying out training <e>", "<cs> my lords the usual question i am asked in relation to lancashire concerns the high level of unemployment <e> <s> i was not aware until this moment that draughtsmen were in short supply there <e> <s> i shall look into the matter <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but that has been a symptom of postwar experience in this country alongside the decline of the enterprise culture <e> <s> we have somehow not bothered about training or about the provision of engineers <e> <s> we have looked more towards other skills <e> <s> that is changing today <e> <s> i only hope that we have time to make up the shortage <e>", "<cs> my lords it is i believe safe to say that ever since when i went to the manpower services commission and indeed for years before i was aware of the woefully inadequate measures of training for young people <e> <s> however it is unfair to compare apprenticeships which are a formal part of the german education and training system and apprenticeships in this country which have been limited in the main to the construction and engineering sectors <e> <s> today we have the national two-year yts <e> <s> we have training for young people on a scale unparalleled in our history <e> <s> we shall see as the years go by that we catch up with our principal competitors <e> <s> as to universities that is another question <e>", "<cs> my lords in the electricians union agreed a national deal under which it halved the level of apprentice wages <e> <s> as a result the number of apprentices in the electricity industry more than doubled <e> <s> the engineers refused to do the same and the decline continued <e> <s> there is a great correlation between the level of young peoples wages and the opportunities for work <e>", "<cs> of course my lords up to about young people a year will be entering yts <e> <s> they will be coming out of a two-year yts well on the road towards vocational qualifications <e> <s> that is unparalleled in our history <e> <s> in a year or twos time there will be up to young people engaged on vocational skill training <e> <s> in addition we shall be helping up to a quarter of a million people each year on adult training schemes <e> <s> there has never been such a concerted effort towards training by government at any time in our history <e> <s> ten years ago when the problem of youth training first came up the then government looked at the principle of yts and discarded it because of cost <e> <s> that speaks for itself <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> during my time as chairman of the manpower services commission we gave total backing to wise and towards programmes helping young women and young girls to go into engineering <e> <s> indeed the principle of all manpower services commission schemes has been no discrimination on grounds of sex or for that matter on any ground <e>", "<cs> my lords years ago was the time when we should have laid the foundation for training young people and perhaps then the outcome would have been better <e> <s> that is however a different question <e> <s> as for universities and polytechnics the government have to ensure that the amount of research and training done helps to play a part in the economic life of the nation and is not research done simply for its own sake <e>", "<cs> yes my lords and a further cause of concern is this <e> <s> the government have entered upon a programme to give additional resources to the universities for the provision of more electronic engineers <e> <s> i hope very much that the schools system will respond by providing enough people with suitable qualifications for those courses <e>", "<cs> my lords all i will say is that the responsibility for education in this country is vested in local education authorities and not in central government <e> <s> that is something that everyone in your lordships house would do well to remember <e>", "<cs> my lords it is another matter because that is another question <e> <s> but if the noble lord was asserting that the places lost have a direct relation to manufacturing industry i venture to disagree with him <e> <s> if he would care to put down a question on the subject i am quite sure that we shall provide the answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe greatly in the market principle <e> <s> i am sure that wages rise to increase supply and eventually supply will rise to fill demand <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall gladly do that <e> <s> there are some who feel that an unsatisfactory outcome of robbins was the conversion of many very <e>", "<cs> my lords the reason is that i believe in lubricating supply and demand and that is a very good lubricant <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a matter which is kept under continual review <e> <s> we do not intend to enter unless there is a clear balance of advantage in favour of us doing so <e> <s> the views of the government were stated quite fully by my honourable friend in another place the economic secretary when he said in a debate <e>", "<cs> no my lords because i think it would be quite wrong for us to set in advance conditions or circumstances which we consider right <e> <s> we have to consider the position at the time <e> <s> i would say to all your lordships that i have no doubt that had <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate that it is the view of very distinguished people in our society that the government should or should not do different things and that has always been the case <e> <s> there is happily but one government <e> <s> it is for the government to make that decision and the government will do so when the government judge that the time is right <e>", "<cs> my lords if we look back over the last years of human progress we shall find that the world is an infinitely better place than it was years ago in terms of living standards of the average citizen <e> <s> of that there can be no doubt <e> <s> of course we have unemployment <e> <s> i hope very much that unemployment will one day be a thing of the past <e> <s> these are two entirely separate matters <e> <s> what we must do is first to have a sound monetary policy for the united kingdom secondly we must play our part as a full and committed member of europe <e> <s> when the two go together and when we decide it is time to join the exchange rate mechanism i am sure that the government will do so at the first possible opportunity <e>", "<cs> my lords it is for the government to listen to advice but it is for the government to make up their own mind and the government will do that <e> <s> exports and the battle to restore the british economy are about much more than just exchange rates <e> <s> so far as the cbi is concerned the cbi knows that it has as much to do with goods being delivered on time and with quality and design as it has with simple exchange rates <e>", "<cs> my lords i will clearly give the reason why the government do not believe that we should join at this time <e> <s> it is because we do not consider that there is any clear balance of advantage in our doing so today <e> <s> the moment we do we shall join <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no doubt that the same argument was used one year ago and two years ago but i shall draw all that is said in your lordships house to the attention of my right honourable friend the chancellor <e>", "<cs> my lords i hardly think this is the time or place for a lecture on economics <e> <s> in the view of the government there is no clear balance of advantage at this time for us to join <e> <s> until there is we shall not join <e>", "<cs> but my lords we are a full member of the european monetary system <e> <s> we deposit per cent <e> <s> of our gold and dollar reserves with the european monetary co-operation fund <e> <s> we participate fully in all discussions but what we have not done at the present time is to deem that the time is right to join the exchange rate mechanism <e> <s> i have no doubt at all that that time will come <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i look forward to the day when we can say that unit labour costs in british industry are fully competitive with those of our european competitors <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i have seen the leaflet and i should like to congratulate the cbi on producing it <e> <s> but alas i often feel that the media both television and newspapers are more interested in news stories and news stories by their very nature are more concerned with failure than they are with success <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may confess it to your lordships i always try to give a clue to the correct answer in my answers to questions put by noble lords <e> <s> in the answer i gave just now i said it was a prime objective of government policy to change attitudes and it is attitudes which must be changed before we come on to the availability of risk capital <e> <s> concerning the availability of risk capital there is no country in the industrialised world which has an equity capital scheme so advantageous as the business expansion scheme <e> <s> that is a scheme which is being taken up to an increasing extent and one which will have a great deal to do with the future success of our nation <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord were to inspect the youth unemployment figures of countries in europe he would find that what we are doing certainly bears comparison with the efforts of any other country without resorting to such devices as conscription <e> <s> the success of this governments policies must be looked at in the unemployment figures and those do not need repetition by me once more <e>", "<cs> my lords that is certainly another question but changes have been made to the business expansion scheme in order to ensure that we were talking about equity risk capital investments rather than any other form <e> <s> that i believe has been successfully achieved by the last two budgets <e>", "<cs> my lords whether or not we reduce taxation and i certainly hope we do what governs peoples desire to risk their capital is the thought that we shall continue to have a strong and growing economy and under the policies of this government we shall assuredly do so <e>", "<cs> my lords if we wish to come back to the original question i am sure all your lordships will know that the london docklands corporation <e>", "<cs> is certainly an example of success and is one which receives sufficient publicity <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> as i see it there are three stages <e> <s> first we must see what are the initial reactions before a decision is taken to issue a consultation document <e> <s> then the consultation document will be issued and we shall see what happens as a result of the consequent discussions <e> <s> after that my right honourable friend the chancellor will make up his mind as to the steps he wishes to take but i hope very much that what my noble friend mentions will be included <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very appreciative of the noble lords memory which goes back a long way and covers many budget speeches <e> <s> i think what the chancellor is really doing is seeing whether there is a way in which we can encourage <e>", "<cs> my lords i am suggesting that we have preliminary consultations then we go for a consultative document and then we see what reception we get <e> <s> as in all things it is as well to get to the end of the road before we judge what the whole matter is worth <e>", "<cs> my lords that will depend on the results of the preliminary consultations which are now taking place <e> <s> if we want adequate consultation to take place we must do two things <e> <s> first we must see what are the preliminary reactions and secondly my right honourable friend the chancellor must make up his mind as to which bodies he will consult <e> <s> the proposal yesterday met with a receptive response and i had hoped that your lordships would be as receptive as the cbi and the tuc <e> <s> if there is anything in this world that we must do it is to accept change we must not always be reactionary <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope very much that the remarkable success of the governments economic policies will augur well for the success of this proposal as it will for all the matters on which the government are engaged <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not the slightest doubt that my right honourable friend the chancellor will go to the co-operative movement <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we are looking at two entirely separate matters <e> <s> we are looking at proposals for profit sharing which are first being put out for preliminary discussion so as to find a way in which workers management and all industry can share future profits perhaps in an effort to break the spiral of paying ourselves too much money <e> <s> i must point out that of all the industrialised nations we have the worst record for paying ourselves above the going rate of inflation <e> <s> i hope very much that the results of this proposal will bring to an end the -year period in which in industry the spirit has often been one of confrontation and not co-operation <e> <s> that is an outcome we should all like to see <e>", "<cs> my lords at the moment we are at the very early stage <e> <s> i suspect that everything will be involved in the consultation process <e>", "<cs> my lords i bow to the noble lords knowledge of the liberal yellow book <e>", "<cs> my lords yes all parties will be <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i fail to follow the noble lords question <e> <s> i would merely say that i am not in any way misleading your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords the essence of profit sharing is that it will be just that sharing in the profits and also sharing in any resultant losses <e>", "<cs> my lords i suspect that the result of the consultative process will be that in talking about profit-sharing we shall be talking about profit-sharing within particular profit centres and that means going down to particular profit centres <e> <s> but i hope that no one on my side of the house or anyone in your lordships chamber for that matter need worry about the future ability of managers to manage <e>", "<cs> my lords we are at a very preliminary stage indeed and i think it would be as well to see whether it goes further and when it goes further to look at the results of these consultations before we start looking at detail <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord hatch of lusby has described a classic profit sharing arrangement in which workers share in addition to their wage a formula based upon the amount of the profits <e> <s> it is not in that sense an actual share in the profits <e> <s> it is an accretion to them <e> <s> i fail to see the distinction <e> <s> i think the noble lord is wrong in saying that i have misled the house <e> <s> i also think he is wrong in persisting with this point <e>", "<cs> my lords our net contribution to the community in was million which was for a number of special factors unusually and regrettably high <e> <s> it compares with a figure for of million in prices <e> <s> the equivalent figure for was million <e> <s> our net contribution over the years was of course reduced by the effects of the transitional financial arrangements applying for the first few years after accession <e> <s> i have arranged for a table showing our annual net contributions to the community budget since to be published in the <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> last year the contribution we made to the community was unfortunately and regrettably high <e> <s> that was because of the non-receipt or the delayed receipt of our abatement and other matters as well <e> <s> but for those adjustments the normal contribution would have been substantially lower <e>", "<cs> my lords there i must agree wholeheartedly with the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords it will be based on current prices and on prices <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no doubt that adjustments should be made to the agriculture budget <e> <s> but i would be failing in my position in the house if i did not point out to your lordships that if we had made the adjustments which we should have received and which were received a few days later the contribution last year would have been lower in real terms that the contribution for <e>", "<cs> my lords i have given the increase in the labour force which was <e> <s> i have given the increase in unemployment which is <e> <s> but the increase in new employment is not a statistic that is normally kept because new employment is a figure that can vary day by day <e>", "<cs> my lords i am proud to boast that i have never on behalf of this government claimed credit for creating any new jobs by the government <e> <s> what we have always done is claim credit for creating the climate that will enable people to create jobs for themselves <e> <s> that is the function of government <e>", "<cs> my lords if i stripped the rhetoric from the noble lords question i should find little to answer <e>

unemployment increasing in this country at a rate either less than or comparable to that in europe <e> <s> we see in this country a determined effort to deal with the evils of unemployment by the only route possible which is the creation of new jobs <e> <s> that was the purpose of the question of the noble lord lord hatch of lusby and that is the answer i gave him <e>", "<cs> my lords i can gladly state that since we have seen million new jobs come into being <e> <s> i can say also that i accept that since one can find a drop in the employed labour force of million <e> <s> and of course one has

noble lords look down on those who take part-time jobs <e>", "<cs> my lords such noble lords should ask those people who fill them because those jobs are very much wanted <e>", "<cs> my lords i am quite happy to answer for the government but i am most unhappy to answer for the opposition <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be delighted to do so <e> <s> i should of course prefer to have a question on that particular point but i shall arrange to have an answer placed in the library <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> certainly spain has a higher percentage unemployment figure <e> <s> ireland has as have others <e> <s> it depends how you define unemployment <e> <s> it depends very much on the social systems which support unemployment and it depends very much on the size of the labour market itself <e> <s> this is a complex matter which is not best served by having quick answers to questions <e> <s> if the noble lord wishes to ask that as a particular question he should do so <e>", "<cs>

matter that is providing a future for those who unfortunately will face redundancy in the years to come as a result of the lack of orders in the shipbuilding industry not only in this country but also i am afraid world-wide <e> <s> that is the immediate problem <e> <s> my concern is that those who are to become redundant are given at the earliest possible opportunity a chance to do something different to use their redundancy to look towards the future <e> <s> that is where i think your lordships house should be looking this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has a far greater

fisheries protection vessel and a new ferry for services to the scottish west coast islands <e> <s> both british shipbuilders and united kingdom private sector yards have been invited to bid <e> <s> i have no doubt that a decision will be made before very much longer <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord hatch of lusby <e> <s> first i must tell him that i do not claim that i have ever preached to the house <e> <s> however i have asked your lordships and the noble lord in particular to face reality on occasion and i would ask him to face reality today <e> <s> we must look at a world in which the government have invested million to little avail since the outside world has not changed <e> <s> we must look at british shipbuilders which has succeeded in winning only tonnes out of tonnes which in the reduced circumstances is the requirement in order to break even <e> <s> we must look at a world in which not the germans but the japanese are contemplating a reduction which would involve job losses they have already taken and a further are a possibility <e> <s> we must look at a world in which ship orders are simply not available and all the wishing in the world will not bring them back <e> <s> we must face reality <e> <s> we must look forward <e> <s> we must look for other occupations for many people who were previously engaged in shipbuilding <e>", "<cs> gladly my lords <e> <s> surely the one thing that makes no difference in the real world is whether you have a profitable warship-building company put together with other shipbuilding companies that cannot get orders or whether you keep them separately and allow a privatised and revitalised company to go ahead from strength to strength <e> <s> if we really want to see shipbuilding continue then we should allow the warship-builders or the others to have full access to the private sector and to the market but that does not deal with the real problem and it is only trying to avoid reality to say so <e>", "<cs> my lords if one matter has become absolutely apparent it is the governments attitude and the governments determination and desire to see that shipbuilding continues in this country <e> <s> however we have to face reality <e> <s> we have to ensure that the volume and capacity of shipbuilding accords with the likely body of demand <e> <s> in taking the steps that we are taking today we are facing reality we are defending the shipbuilding that we have and we are not giving up as has sweden which was a great shipbuilding nation and as have many others in europe <e> <s> we are looking at what we have in a different and changing world <e> <s> it may well be that those opposite would very much have wished a few years ago to have kept blacksmiths forges in operation <e> <s> the world changes <e> <s> they had to be turned into garages <e> <s> today we must look at shipbuilding and see whether many of the skills of our people can be turned to something useful <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> although i suspect that the unions must bear some part of the blame for the conduct in the s and s there is no question that even if we had a very efficient shipbuilding industry such was the competition from the third world such were the prevailing wage rates and other matters i suspect that we would have found the industry in decline in any event <e> <s> nevertheless we are very much aware of the problem of unfair competition and my right honourable friend the secretary of state for trade and industry only a few days ago set up an internal unit which is closely monitoring this matter and will ensure that steps are taken where they are deemed necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords i hear what the noble lord says <e> <s> the time to regret a hangover is not when you experience it you should slow down the night before <e> <s> i wish that perhaps we had moderated our behaviour in the s because we may have suffered less in the s <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i am more than happy to give the noble lord an assurance that nothing will happen before that meeting takes place which i believe will be later this month <e> <s> i should also say that i am not aware of any previous approaches by the federation of master builders <e> <s> i know of the federations concern and i am sure that we shall see to it that they are happy <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure

wish to extend a general invitation to all but i understand that those who have concerns will express them to me <e>", "<cs> my lords these are of course different types of schemes and have nothing to do with apprenticeships which these days are funded to a large extent through the yts <e> <s> they are to do with helping those who have been out of work for a long time <e> <s> concern has been expressed by employers and unions that the growth of the community programme has been to an extent that it begins to jeopardise the volume of work available to small and medium-size builders <e> <s> i am sure that all in your lordships house will appreciate the great desire and need that we have to find work for those who have been out of work for a long time <e> <s> on the other hand we must couple that with a desire not to create more unemployed by promoting such government schemes <e>", "<cs> my lords i suspect that there are some people in our society who think that the principles advocated by keynes and galbraith are responsible in part for the number of unemployed we now have in our society <e> <s> i do not see that we necessarily need a larger number of schools when we see school rolls shrinking by per cent <e> <s> i do know that we need houses and the private sector is building houses vigorously <e> <s> land is needed on which to build houses and that is a principal constraint but that is a long way from the question <e>", "<cs> my lords in the comparatively short time in which i have been in your lordships house i have become used to the style and manner of the noble lord lord bruce of donington and i am able to strip away from his style accept the content and realise from what he says today that he welcomes this white paper as long as it does not impinge on others <e> <s> i assure him it does not <e> <s> i take the main thrust of his remarks as a general welcome to taking away unnecessary regulations <e> <s> where alas <e> <s> i cannot agree with the noble lord is in his statement that he thinks this is just something new that we have dreamt up <e> <s> if the noble lord and all in your lordships house would care to turn to the first annex of the white paper you will see there a long list of the steps which our last white paper brought out and what we have done in the meantime <e> <s> the second chapter covers the next steps on where we are going in the future <e> <s> i also ask the noble lord and all in your lordships house to read just the first paragraph or two of the white paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> the white paper refers to the fact that the department of the environment will be going out within a very short period for formal consultation on the changes which are planned to be made on the use classes orders <e> <s> these are technical in nature <e> <s> the noble lord will also see in the white paper the governments determination over a period of a year or two to halve the time taken on planning appeals and that we are vitally concerned that with safety we reduce the time taken in order to get essential planning permission through in the interests of the growth of employment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful for the support of the white paper shown by the noble lord lord graham of edmonton <e> <s> of course it is important in the interests of many people that we lighten the burden on individuals <e> <s> but we must lighten it with safety <e> <s> as far as the planning changes are concerned i think that the noble lord will see that the proposals do not contemplate any of the changes about which he was anxious <e> <s> residential property will be kept for residential use and we have said that there is to be no change in the law regarding the right to work at home <e> <s> people have a right to work at home so long as they do not change the residential character of their abode and so long as they do not annoy their neighbours <e>", "<cs> my lords this is part of a continuing process <e> <s> within the white paper on the inside cover my noble friend will find that for the very first time the objectives of the department of employment are there printed <e> <s> i have the honour to lead a department which for many years past i suspect saw as its primary function either sponsoring trade unions or sponsoring the rights of members of trade unions <e> <s> what is printed there clearly says that the work of the department of employment is to encourage the development of an enterprise economy and to reduce unemployment through more businesses more self-employment and greater wealth creation all leading to more jobs <e> <s> this is part of that process <e> <s> i should not like anyone in your lordships house to think that government are so all-knowing that they can determine to a fine degree of exactitude the number of jobs created or lost by any decision of government <e> <s> enterprise is not like that employment is not like that <e> <s> what government have to do is get out of the way of the people so that the people can create the jobs <e>", "<cs> my lords the only irrelevance demonstrated this morning is the irrelevance of those sitting opposite me who insist on looking backwards and who cannot look forwards <e> <s> the loss of employment in shipbuilding is regrettable <e> <s> the world is passing on <e> <s> the demand for ships has disappeared not only in this country but all over the world but that is another matter <e> <s> on railways of course it is regrettable that we have had to have a loss of railway jobs this week <e> <s> perhaps those opposite would advise the national union of railwaymen and aslef that if they stopped doing such things as blacking the transfer of some newspapers and prohibiting the transfer of some newspapers by rail they would find that the railways themselves would not lose jobs as a result of more and more freight traffic being transferred from railway to the roads <e> <s> in looking forward to the creation of the jobs for tomorrow we have to create the conditions in which those jobs will flourish <e> <s> it is of no use looking back we have to look forward <e> <s> it is of no use wishing the world were as it used to be what we have to do is prepare it for what it will be tomorrow <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that all in your lordships house would agree that this has become a little too deregulated <e>", "<cs> my lords the simple fact is that in accordance with the judgment of the european court of justice we have to apply the same tests to these goods imported from one member state to another as we do to goods on sale within the boundaries of the united kingdom <e> <s> however i very <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact is that the european court of justice has said that we should apply the same test to importing over our national boundary as we apply to the sale of these articles within the united kingdom <e> <s> the articles are classified as indecent and not obscene and they are allowed to be sold within the united kingdom <e> <s> i shall draw the matter to the attention of my right honourable friend the home secretary and no doubt he will be made well aware of all that your lordships have had to say on the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall of course draw all that has been said in your lordships house to the attention of my right honourable friend the home secretary <e> <s> it is for him or indeed for anyone to introduce an amendment at any time <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> as i have said it is still legal in this country and therefore to look towards europe as a method of defence against something which is legal in this country is not quite correct <e> <s> what we should consider is what is allowed in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i can see the connection but it is not for me to say <e>", "<cs> my lords the manpower services commission gives assistance towards training and retraining for jobs in the travel and tourism industry under the youth training scheme and a number of adult training schemes <e> <s> grants for tourism-related yts currently amount to around million and more than million is being spent by the manpower services commission on tourism-related training under its adult training schemes <e> <s> in addition the provision within the maintained further education sector for vocational education and training for tourism-related jobs at craft supervisory and management level has expanded rapidly over the past years as tourism has grown in importance although it is not possible under the block grant system of funding to estimate government assistance to relevant college courses <e>", "<cs> my lords what i can say is that some students were involved in non-advanced hotel and catering and travel and tourism courses in <e> <s> the commencement of courses in those subjects has carried on in and <e> <s> alas i cannot satisfy my noble friend with specific numbers regarding scotland that is slightly another question <e> <s> however i shall have the answer put in the library <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness lady

training under the training for enterprise scheme <e> <s> they were predominantly employed people <e> <s> we still have the balance going towards unemployed people <e>", "<cs> my lords the drive for more professionalism in tourism is gathering pace <e> <s> it is paying great benefits for those who are going into employment after completing their courses <e>", "<cs> my lords i take responsibility for a great many things but i think responsibility for language training would lie with my right honourable friend the secretary of state for education and science <e>", "<cs> my lords i have read a great deal about the new litter teams <e> <s> i think we should await the formal announcement on them <e>", "<cs> my lords i said much in a minute interview last week <e> <s> however before i deal with that let me say that no country in the world has greater policies designed to help those who have been out of work for a long time than has this country and no other country in the world has introduced programmes to help youth move from school into work <e> <s> let me clear up once and for all one <e>", "<cs> my lords the reason for the success of the governments economic policies is the simple fact that we realise that the world is changing <e> <s> there is no way in which we can go back to a world in which we can rely on building ships for a world that does not require ships or unfortunately on digging for tin for a world which does not require tin at prices at which we can economically dig for it <e> <s> it is a world in which we have to prepare ourselves for the jobs that will arise tomorrow <e>", "<cs> my lords to my knowledge the total amount of those involved in both agriculture and domestic service is per cent <e> <s> in this country <e> <s> of that perhaps even half a per cent <e> <s> is private domestic service <e> <s> i am not sure of the figures <e> <s> it is certainly not a significant number <e>", "<cs> my lords that is an entirely different question <e> <s> if the noble lord would put it down on the order paper i am sure that it would be answered <e>", "<cs> my lords what we have seen other countries in europe have seen and other industrialised economies have seen is that investment in infrastructure for the purpose of creating employment does not work <e> <s> investment in infrastructure for the purpose of improving the infrastructure does

has popularly been called litter has not been announced but i have read a considerable amount about it in the local papers <e> <s> it is so i read a programme which is going to involve some places on the community programme and it is a programme that i look forward to seeing announced in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that no one in your lordships house will think that there is anything wrong in the government seeking to ensure that those people who are not entitled to benefit do not draw it <e> <s> the restart scheme is predominantly about helping those who have been out of work for more than a year back into work and in that it is going to have considerable success <e> <s> the efforts of my department are concerned with those who have been out of work for a long time <e> <s> however i am equally concerned that there should not be people who prey off the unemployed by taking benefit when they are not entitled to it <e>", "<cs> my lords since i entered your lordships house i have had a long and intensive learning process on the value of inland waterways from the noble viscount <e> <s> i shall certainly bear it in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords the great insensitiveness about the interview was the selectivity with which one particular phrase out of the minute interview was taken <e> <s> i hate to bore your lordships house but i should say that immediately before that my actual words were <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is innovation which is the important part of our economy <e> <s> however in looking at it if i may refer to the earlier question from the noble lord opposite the <e>", "<cs> my lords if we were to judge between the question i have just been asked and the answer i shall give on who is out of touch with the world i think the record will show the position <e> <s> i have spent all my time for four years and two months now looking at the problems of unemployment and of helping to get people back into work <e> <s> we in common with all other large industrialised nations have seen long-term unemployment rising <e> <s> it has finally been checked in this country <e> <s> i would venture to make a forecast that in six months time we may well see it lower than it is today <e> <s> we may well see long-term unemployment begin to decline <e> <s> i very much hope so because that is what we are working towards <e> <s> it is no good wishing away the world <e> <s> what we have to do is to find ways of combating the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords manufacturing employment i am the secretary of state for employment has been declining steadily since <e> <s> it has been declining at a steady rate which accelerated for two years in and and it has carried on declining as it has in all industrialised nations other than japan where it has remained roughly stable because of technology <e> <s> we still export <e>", "<cs> my lords i said as a member of the government that i suspect that in six months time we shall begin to see long-term unemployment go down <e>", "<cs> my lords we estimate that the employed labour force increased by men and women between march and december a total of <e>", "<cs> my lords we should be concerned with all aspects of the labour market <e> <s> it is only right to point out that although the number of males in employment has gone down over the past two years the number who are self-employed has risen strongly therefore the total number of men working is going up not going down <e> <s> many in your lordships house tend if i may say so to look down a little on part-time jobs for women but if we look at the survey we find that per cent <e> <s> of women working part time were happy with the hours worked and what is more per cent <e> <s> of women working full time would prefer to work fewer hours <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say on behalf of the governments statistical service how much we resent the imputation that government figures that are issued are taken out of the air <e> <s> these are official government figures from the statistical service <e> <s> they are not manufactured by me or by any of my colleagues and on behalf of my statisticians i must register that point <e>", "<cs> my lords a survey is the way by which most of these figures are arrived at <e> <s> the figure is from a publication called <e>", "<cs> no my lords but i shall certainly study it <e>", "<cs> my lords many of these surveys take some time to prepare before they come out <e> <s> if the noble lord looks at the whole field of population census and surveys he will see that that is the case with many of them <e> <s> i shall certainly have a look but attitudes change remarkably slowly in these fields <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i am quite unable to answer that supplementary question for the simple reason that conditions of employment are freely negotiated between people <e> <s> my concern is to see that as many people as possible get jobs <e> <s> the one way i suggest by which we shall reduce the number of jobs is by laying down external conditions of employment <e>", "<cs> my lords the figures on self-employment came out as a result of the labour force survey <e> <s> it is a survey of homes <e> <s> it is issued by the government statisticians <e> <s> it is a survey <e> <s> the figures do not come out of thin air <e> <s> secondly of course in any average wage there must be as much below as above because that is the definition of an average <e> <s> what i can tell you is that the average wage in this country has been rising strongly and rising above the rate of inflation <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord soames for raising this matter this afternoon though i must confess that at times during the debate on the snake listening to his persuasive guile i wondered whether i was not listening to the snakecharmer himself <e> <s> i listened very carefully to what he had to say <e> <s> he said to start with that my noble friend lord cockfield had said one thing some years ago and i another last month <e> <s> that may be but the world moves on times and conditions change and we have to look at the world as we find it

friend says <e> <s> that is of course another matter and one to which i would be happy to return at another time <e> <s> but perhaps i may turn to the noble lord lord lever who gave us as he always does a global view of the ebbs and flows of the international monetary system and looked as we should all be looking for international monetary stabilisation <e> <s> of course joining the erm and

of course we have said we should go in but what i am trying to show to all in your lordships house is that it is not a simple step of just moving in <e> <s> it is a factor that we have to take into account <e>", "<cs> my lords the rpi advisory committee was convened in september to advise on the possibility of rebasing the index <e> <s> they will be no doubt aware of the report of the institute for fiscal studies and i think we should see their recommendations <e> <s> if i might say so it makes a pleasant change for the government to be criticised for exaggerating figures <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly arrange for that to be done or for details to be placed in the library <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware of the significance and the importance of the retail price index and also of the various different ways in which it is used including government securities <e> <s> that is the reason there is an advisory committee which is an independent committee <e> <s> they will be making suggestions to me which will be published <e> <s> i have no doubt at all that they will be giving the best possible advice and that they will be looking at it from an independent point of view

<e> <s> but it is important that we should have a single comprehensible simple-to-understand index and one which fairly represents the cost of living in the country <e> <s> that is the important point <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i can go along with none of the contentions of the noble lords question but i will say this <e> <s> my predecessor appointed an advisory committee and i look forward with interest to receiving the recommendations that it makes <e>", "<cs> yes my lords the treasury publishes a separate prices and tax index which shows different figures <e> <s> but we must be very careful because we are a nation of some -odd million people and we could construct -odd million different retail price indices <e> <s> what we must do is to have a single figure which is fair and understandable <e>", "<cs> my lords that may well be but i am not sure whether it is necessarily so <e> <s> it may well be what the institute of fiscal studies report said <e> <s> how correct that is is a second matter although i have no reason not to suspect that it is correct <e> <s> but i am advised by an advisory committee of independent people and i must listen to what they have to say

i must listen to it <e>", "<cs> my lords if that is an incentive i have not noticed that it has worked <e>", "<cs> my lords i have an advisory committee and i will really listen to what it has to say

may well be differences in the bottom decile or the top decile but we have to look at an index which is comprehensible for the whole country <e>", "<cs> my lords all i can say is that the bottom decile of earners that is the lowest per cent <e> <s> of earners have over the last seven years seen their pay go up above the rate of inflation as shown by the rpi <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords we value the contribution that the manpower services commission makes to employment and training and note its plans with interest and approval <e> <s> since the preparation of the mscs corporate plan we have made extra resources available for the nationwide restart <e>", "<cs> my lords the corporate plan of the manpower services commission is of course its corporate plan <e> <s> perhaps i may read one extract from it <e>", "<cs> my lords the first thing the government have to do about unemployment generally but also about the specific problem in the north-east is to recognise that we live in a world of change and that we have to prepare ourselves for tomorrows conditions <e> <s> nothing any government could ever decide will restore the same outline of industrial occupations that used to exist in middlesbrough in cleveland and in the north-east as a whole <e> <s> it is of fundamental importance that we recognise that <e> <s> we have announced an enterprise

help with the real problem which in common with our other neighbours in western europe we have in adapting to change in the evolution of the industrial revolution <e>", "<cs> my lords that is quite a separate question <e> <s> i have not checked on the number of people employed before the first world war <e> <s> i would find it difficult to assume that that is correct <e> <s> but the facts which i can tell the house and which i think are important to all of us since the noble lord talked about europe are that in the period from to our unemployment rate and that of france has each grown by about per cent <e> <s> while that of italy has grown by per cent <e> <s> and that of germany by per cent <e> <s> those are the realities of the world in which we live and they are the realities of the world

may correct one point <e> <s> what i said was that i hope very much that when the figures for christmas are published we shall see that long-term unemployment is beginning to reduce <e> <s> i am not making any forecast about the general level of unemployment <e>", "<cs> my lords the manpower services commission includes wales and there is a separate committee for the principality <e> <s> i am sure that that which we are talking about includes wales but i shall examine it specifically in relation to wales <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that question <e> <s> we are

noble lord for reminding me of the question but i am less grateful to him for going on to matters quite outside the question although i am happy to deal with them <e> <s> the channel tunnel is

available <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i must leave the sense of irony to the noble lord i do not share it <e> <s> i should have thought that making the world safe from terrorists was the best possible way to lay the foundation for a good international tourist business <e> <s> but i must tell your lordships that it appears that the temporary drop in the number of american tourists came primarily from those who were coming on group tours <e> <s> the vast majority of american tourists coming under their own resources continue to come <e> <s> indeed if i may quote from the director-general of the british tourist authority who is just about to retire after years in the tourism business he said <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may make a confession to your lordships house i have often felt some puzzlement in looking at the origin of some of the questions from the noble lord <e> <s> but i must say that we should not forget that also before whatever action was taken against libya an american family including an month-old baby was blown out of an american plane by terrorist action <e> <s> what we have to do is work together in a concerted effort to reduce the level of terrorism and to make this a world safe to travel in <e>", "<cs> my lords i should make it very clear that we welcome visitors from all countries to our shores <e> <s> we welcome those who speak our language as well as those who do not <e> <s> our overriding desire is to ensure that those who come to our shores wish to come here again <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very glad to hear what the noble lord has said <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> that surely demonstrates once more that an essential part of the policy of all civilised nations must be to eliminate terrorism whence-ever it comes <e> <s> just to assure all your lordships may i say that for the first three months of this year which are the only months for which we have yet published figures the number of visits increased by per cent <e> <s> to million and that visits from north america increased by per cent <e> <s> while spending was constant and increasing <e> <s> i suspect that we shall show a drop particularly from north america in april and may but i have no doubt that with many events to come we shall see a resumption of the sustained growth of this economy <e>", "<cs> yes my lords as well as the pound-dollar relationship there was the dollar-deutschemark relationship and the dollar-french franc relationship <e> <s> the american dollar dropped in purchasing power which initially must have affected some decisions <e> <s> but we have seen in the past six months a drop in the price of oil <e> <s> we are now beginning to experience a considerable reduction in the cost of transatlantic fares and i have no doubt that all these things will level out <e>", "<cs> no my lords it is not for me to say what is in the mind of americans <e> <s> but i suspect that it had a great deal to do with the singling out of americans wherever they were overseas <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a long way from the question which is specifically about libya <e> <s> but i will agree that we must deal with terrorism in the best way possible <e> <s> the best way is often a firm way but we must deal with it <e>", "<cs> my lords this morning i had the great distinction and pleasure of taking the secretary general of the peoples republic of china hu yaobang down the river thames <e> <s> i regret to inform all in your lordships house that it did not stop raining <e> <s> that did not help the tourist industry <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the prime minister gave an interview which was shown on american television and which i believe did a great deal towards reassuring american tourists <e> <s> the wife of the president mrs nancy reagan announced that she was coming to london for the royal wedding <e> <s> what we have seen and what the bto is reporting

behind the original <e>", "<cs> my lords we are now straying a very long way indeed from the question <e> <s> i think that we should let it go at that <e>", "<cs> my lords it is for a whole variety of reasons though i often suspect that the noble lord thinks that he knows the answer even before he asks his question on these particular occasions <e> <s> we are now looking at a number of very complex matters and relating unemployment directly to the current rate of inflation is something that i have been doing month after month after month in drawing everyones attention to the importance of moderating wage claims <e>", "<cs> my lords it is true that if we look at the tax and price index it would be necessary to receive a wage increase of per cent <e> <s> to maintain ones standard of living <e> <s> nevertheless within manufacturing industry the increase was per cent <e> <s> and that is probably the largest real increase for decades <e> <s> that is not good news for employment in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say to the noble baroness that i completely agree with her <e> <s> i hope very much that the whole idea of profit sharing will commend itself to both sides of industry so that we can see a more fruitful way forward to bringing back manufacturing profits to this country <e>", "<cs> my lords it is an interesting position <e> <s> in unit labour costs in manufacturing were running at per cent <e> <s> increase <e> <s> material and fuels purchased by manufacturing industry were running at per cent <e> <s> increase and output prices went up by per cent

finance minister of that government <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has brought into one supplementary question inflation unemployment and competition <e> <s> perhaps i may at least answer part of that question by saying that compared with oecd countries as a whole today we have a narrow gap of per cent <e> <s> which is <e>", "<cs> my lords i did no more than repeat the words of the finance minister who said that the current economic policy has to stop if australia is not to turn itself into a banana republic <e> <s> i do not know how much more i have to say about that except that australia went in for infrastructure spending and today it has rising unemployment balance of payments problems soaring inflation and a finance minister who at least is dissatisfied with the present state of australias economy <e> <s> that is the lesson i wanted to draw from infrastructure investment <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i think it is important to bring home to everyone that the take-home pay of a married man with two children has risen in real terms since by per cent <e> <s> and for those on half-average earnings it has risen by per cent <e> <s> that is indeed a measure of the way in which the quality of life can improve <e> <s> personal judgment about the quality of life is for the individual <e>", "<cs> my lords the question was directed to the quality of life and in

time when year after year our standard of living is going up <e> <s> in order to maintain our standard of life we wanted to have pay increases of per cent <e> <s> but those in manufacturing industry

that the government have only partial responsibility for some of them <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware that it is a great temptation to which i am afraid not only some noble lords but many others succumb to paint the life of this country in the blackest possible terms <e> <s> i am proud of life in this country <e> <s> i want to see it better <e> <s> i work towards that aim as do all her majestys government <e> <s> i think there are occasions when we should look at the improvements that we have made and should not merely look at the distance we still have to travel <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to say that i am able to agree with the noble lord lord barnett because i have on many occasions in the past complained about the growth of earnings <e> <s> but this question was asked i suspect with the motive of showing that in this country things are so bad and we are proceeding so poorly <e> <s> it is esssential that we put things in perspective <e> <s> what we should look at and realise is that our standard of living is going up faster possibly than at any time before <e> <s> that has a rebirth side and that is the prospect for jobs <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> but what i would caution all those sitting opposite about is not to take five words out of a -minute interview and <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure what the noble lord refers to <e> <s> there is in my

my department went in showed that at the very least opinions were divided <e> <s> there were many institutions against a change many for a change but in the end no clear opinion emerged <e> <s> in those circumstances it was thought fit that we should not make a change <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble baroness will be kind enough to give me a list of the days on which it will be warm and sunny

"<cs> my lords i have learnt to have a very selective memory <e> <s> for the past week it has been perfect <e>", "<cs> my lords that is another question <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that there are

down that report <e> <s> it is looking for something far less ambitious which i still believe even now would be impossible to put into effect <e> <s> what the jobstart allowance does and what the new worker scheme allowance does is to target those allowances on two specific groups <e> <s> i refer to long-term unemployed people looking for a job at a wage of under a week <e> <s> there are such jobs

yes my lords <e> <s> i should however point out that so far as unemployment is concerned i do not believe that we have a north-south divide <e> <s> what we have is an inner urban rural and suburban divide <e> <s> there are many pockets of very high unemployment in london and the south-east and there are many places of low unemployment up in the north <e>", "<cs> my lords the number of long-term unemployed at the moment is stable <e> <s> i have ventured to forecast that when the figures come out for christmas we shall find that thanks to the concentration of government effort on that category

good news for employment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord lord barnett for pointing out that when i was discussing those in work who have never had it so good i was drawing attention as he has drawn attention in this house to the fact that <e>", "<cs> my lords we never cease to draw attention to the benefits of this governments economic and monetary policies which have reduced inflation to per cent <e> <s> and which i hope will see low inflation in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords what is of the utmost importance is that we have a productive industry and a commercial base where wealth creation is rewarded to the common good <e> <s> what we have seen elsewhere in the world is that any society which endeavours to impose a limit does not grow in wealth <e> <s> we must become as productive as our competitors we must become as well off as our neighbours in europe we must look after the less fortunate in our society that is the policy of this government <e>", "<cs> my lords i would remind the noble baroness that inflation had fallen and was kept down before the oil prices fell in the way they did in the last few months of course we have had a boost from oil prices falling but there are those who wanted to follow an alternative economic policy and had that been done we may well have found that the reduction in inflation would not have occurred <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble friend but i have to point out that <e>", "<cs> my lords i must confess that i think there is something innately wrong in a view which looks to those who create the wealth of this country and says that they should not be rewarded <e>", "<cs> my lords i should point out that year after year wage increases for the last four years or so have on average gone up considerably above the rate of inflation in every single year <e> <s> there have been real pay increases which are to be welcomed there have been considerable adjustments in the pay of the nurses <e> <s> however if we were to look only at those who lead our industries and only at those who lead our commerce and if we were to make it so unattractive for them to do their jobs we would find that unemployment and wealth creation would suffer <e> <s> nothing which the noble lords opposite can say will alter that basic fact of human nature <e>", "<cs> my lords that is nothing to the horror i feel when i hear the noble lord lord mccarthy put in my mouth words about the poor which i have never said <e> <s> i am endeavouring to bring home the basic facts of human nature that if you

that principle <e>", "<cs> my lords i have always referred to unit labour costs being concerned only with the labour content of the cost of goods <e> <s> i have at all times pointed out that our unit labour costs must be competitive with those of our neighbours and that our unit costs themselves must be competitive with those of our neighbours and they have not been recently <e>", "<cs> my lords

amendment adopted in committee carries no implication of criticism of the independent members of a wages council <e> <s> it is inevitable that there will be difficulties in finding a date and time convenient for the very large number of people involved in the operation of a major wages council <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment is designed to enable wages councils to fix premium rates

amendments nos <e> <s> and which at least concern the subject which we are discussing <e> <s> it seems to me that we are getting into the field of unintended and quite unnecessary complications <e> <s> let me stress that we are not in the business of giving the wages councils complicated and detailed instructions on how they are to do their job <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said in speaking to the previous amendments councils have been the subject of much criticism for setting minimum rates which reflect what is often called the going rate instead of providing a safety-net or floor below which no workers basic pay should fall <e> <s> the introduction of a specific obligation on councils to consider the link between the rate they fix and the level of employment in their trade in all areas is designed to meet these criticisms <e>", "<cs> my lords amendment no <e> <s> seeks to narrow the application of subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords during discussion in committee on amendment no

checked by inspectors are being paid at least the legal minimum fixed by wages councils and the changes which this bill seeks to introduce will undoubtedly result in a higher general level of compliance <e> <s> the exclusion of under s will reduce the number of workers covered by about half a million <e> <s> employers and workers will find it much easier to understand wages orders which will set only a single basic hourly rate and a single overtime rate <e> <s> there will be none of the present complexities which have been such a common cause of underpayment <e> <s> the simplicity of wages orders will also enable increased use to be made of postal questionnaires for initial inquiries <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i think that i ought to put at least some part of the record straight <e> <s> the noble lord lord mccarthy runs riot with figures and although i have restrained myself with commendable fortitude this evening i must come back on some of his points <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord wedderburn has correctly stated my noble friend lord trefgarne expressed some sympathy with the amendment when it was moved in committee <e> <s> i well

explain the position to the noble baroness lady seear <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i much regret that the noble baroness believes that <e> <s> i think that i have answered the point and i do not think that i can move from that <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i might just correct one point made by the noble lord <e> <s> i think that he misheard me <e> <s> i did not say that we should compare the right to itemised pay statements or time off for public duties with the same right to join a trade union <e> <s> the argument i was developing is that there comes a point at which if we say that this right should have that then what other one should not <e> <s> i believe there will come a time when all employment protection law will be covered at this point and that is why the government decided that we must stop here <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand perfectly well the purpose of this rather complicated amendment and i congratulate noble lords opposite on their ingenuity and the intention they are displaying to use a continuation of the redundancy rebate as a subsidy for employers who follow approved policies on employment training

sufficient duration and was perceived to be such people would go off the register and in those circumstances after the six-months course at the skillcentre would go back on the register if he or she

in january the unemployment rate in the york travel-to-work area went up to per cent <e> <s> however assuming that york citizens are just as enterprising as the average of those in yorkshire and

lords the house will have the opportunity to debate this matter later on this week <e> <s> however i should like to confirm that unemployment is a quite serious matter <e> <s> it is a problem which exists not only in this country but throughout europe <e> <s> it is serious enough that we should not seek to exaggerate it <e> <s> it does not help the unemployed to be told continually as indeed

lords i must confess that i have lived a somewhat sheltered life and it is only within the past two or three years that i have entered your lordships house <e> <s> nevertheless it comes as some surprise to me and why it should be a surprise i am not too sure that it is only since last summer that this obsession of those who sit opposite with fiddling the figures if i can quote their favourite phrase has come about <e> <s> can it be anything to do with the current direction of the unemployment figures <e>", "<cs> my lords first of all perhaps i may say that i am grateful to receive my noble friends thanks <e> <s> i will accept thanks from all quarters and particularly from my noble friends <e> <s> secondly the noble lord must form his own view of the consequences of the difference in treatment between judgments of our own courts and those of the european courts <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not for me to speculate on what may be in my noble friends mind <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord will surely accept that there are many of us in this world who have lived at a time when we thought that we understood quite clearly the interpretation of a piece of statute only to find that the courts in their own wisdom would give a contrary interpretation <e> <s> all of us are now learning to live with that <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe i can do no more than to refer the noble lord and indeed all your lordships to my answer that the new arrangements do not have any effect on the public expenditure totals or on the total own resources available to the community <e> <s> we are talking about only when it is paid not how much <e>", "<cs> my lords i suspect that actually that is the case <e>", "<cs> my lords surely that is a matter for the whole arrangements with the european community and that i think is one to which we have all gladly acceded <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord must form his own conclusion as to that <e>", "<cs> my lords i should be happy to think that i was in a position to satisfy all your lordships as to the distinction between the two courts but i am afraid it is rather wide of the question and we shall have to defer that to another time <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will forgive me in fact i have looked at that today <e> <s> there are today fewer questions than there used to be in and in the s

mind at rest and to set the record straight <e> <s> i should hate to think that the noble lord spent the night hours tossing and turning with worry and concern over the accuracy of the office of

unemployment itself has fallen <e> <s> is there a connection i ask myself <e> <s> for i must confess that i could detect little concern before <e> <s> perhaps this new concern is a suitable subject

statistics <e> <s> but i shall come onto that <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall come very shortly to the true level of unemployment in this country <e> <s> however many of those on yts are employed and

country <e>", "<cs> no my lords it is totally wrong <e> <s> if you wish to calculate unemployment in relation to those who are employees in employment as against those out of work you have a figure of or per cent <e> <s> if you wish to calculate unemployment by the proportion of those out of work compared to all those people in our country who are working including the million people who are working for themselves unemployment is per cent <e> <s> i think i mentioned a moment ago that the oecd definition is per cent <e> <s> that seems to me to be the accurate definition <e> <s> if one wishes to keep adding back through a series of statistical adjustments i have no doubt that you can make unemployment up to any amount <e> <s> if the noble lord were to calculate the total number of those who have retired in the last years and to add that to the count that would have as much bearing on the number of unemployed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way

on the community programme he will go off the long-term register in the normal way <e> <s> but by and large the vast majority of people are left untouched unless they go into a jobclub and find a job

made some or months ago it was fully disclosed it was subject to a statement and every month thereafter we merely remind people of the change <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord bruce of donington and i shall in the few short minutes left to me try to look at where we have been in what has been a very good debate <e> <s> the debate ranged widely though perhaps not always very

most parts of our country <e>", "<cs> my lords i am totally unable to say that since i personally do not know most people who are unemployed <e> <s> i know that in areas of high unemployment there are vacancies which seem difficult to fill even with unskilled labour <e> <s> i can say no more than that the most active job market in the country is london and yet london has as many long-term unemployed as the whole of the north-east <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend in another place the paymaster general is quite properly concerned about the level of unemployment in the north-east and north-west <e> <s> quite properly he believes that if wages in those areas could reflect living costs it may well be that unemployment would fall <e> <s> but it is no more than that <e> <s> there is no desire on the part of this government to see lower wages <e> <s> there is a great desire by this government to see lower unemployment higher employment and a rise in wages throughout the land <e>", "<cs> the method of appointment and other provisions in respect of the independent members of the board of banking supervision have been the subject of extensive debate in another place <e> <s> the provisions of the bill that is now before the committee reflect that debate following changes introduced by the government <e>", "<cs> forgive me for interrupting but i think that the point being made is not that my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer does not understand the market which is far from being the case but that because the bank is in day-to-day contact with the people in the market it will have better knowledge of individual people who are at that time practising in the market <e>", "<cs> i appreciate the purpose of these amendments and the need to avoid conflicts of interest arising on the board <e> <s> but the board is intended to be an expert arm of supervision and in order to play that role it is vital that the board includes among others experienced commercial bankers who can bring first-hand knowledge of prevailing banking practices into the supervisors decision-making process <e>", "<cs> i think it is very difficult if not dangerous to be drawn in at this stage in settling policy for decades ahead or for as long as these boards will continue to exist <e> <s> what is important is that this is a board that has a very real and vital role to perform <e> <s> in order to perform a supervisory role it must have at its disposal sufficient knowledge of current banking practice <e> <s> if we accepted the amendment in any way we should first of all get into definitional difficulties about what is the executive or non-executive role which can cause a whole raft of problems for the future <e> <s> secondly we would be excluding from the board the very people who are most aware of the latest practices and the direction in which the market is going <e> <s> they are also most aware of situations which require changes perhaps in supervision or changes in order to ensure that this board has teeth that it actually performs properly <e> <s> it is a way in which the world is changing it is a fast-changing world as we have all come to realise <e>", "<cs> i think i should at the outset remind the committee that my remarks about the board of banking supervision having teeth referred to the whole board and not to just certain members <e> <s> in fact i hope they will all have teeth and i hope they will all use them <e> <s> we have before us today two amendments and they are rather different <e> <s> amendment no i suspect goes without saying <e> <s> the board is empowered by paragraph of schedule to determine its own proceedings <e> <s> i feel about this that the words already include giving advice in such manner as they think fit and i do not think that we should go much further but i shall listen to what everybody has to say <e>", "<cs> it is a surprising world in which we live <e> <s> i occasionally hear complaints about how people take offence at programmes on television or the radio or in connection with other matters but i little thought the day would come when the wording of the banking bill would turn out to be quite so offensive <e> <s> it just goes to show <e>", "<cs> i am sorry but what i said a moment or two ago is simply this <e> <s> the bill requires the bank of england to provide the board with regular reports on matters relevant to its function <e> <s> there may well be times of particular difficulty when the regularity of that report might have to be increased to weekly or even daily <e> <s> who can tell <e> <s> merely to provide for not less than quarterly does not take us any further <e> <s> the important point is that there should not be an occasional report <e> <s> it is seen clearly in the bill that they should be at regular intervals but those intervals can vary if the need should arise to make them more frequent <e> <s> i cannot imagine the need would arise to make them less frequent but i cannot tell what circumstances may dictate <e> <s> also when one considers that the independent members of the board are empowered to require any further information they may need over and above the regular reports from the bank of england there is that additional safeguard <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will allow me irregular as to timing but not as to content i trust <e>", "<cs> i take great comfort from the words of the noble lord lord obrien of lothbury that the bank will not be irrevocably damaged by our comments in the committee this afternoon <e> <s> what we are dealing with now in amendments nos <e> <s> and is voluntary and involuntary removal from the board <e> <s> it seems to me just a matter of common courtesy that if a member is appointed on a joint basis he should at least be allowed to retire on a joint basis and to write to both the chancellor of the exchequer and to the governor of <e>", "<cs> i thought that my noble friend lord thorneycroft gave the perfect definition of a member of a board supervising my activities one who would fall asleep whenever we came to discuss them <e> <s> but this is a serious point and i do not think i need to draw attention in this committee to the circumstances in which members can be removed from boards including physical or mental incapacity and bankruptcy <e> <s> it would be invidious for the chancellor to be required to provide as a matter of course details of the reasons for a members removal on such grounds <e> <s> if there were anything controversial if something happened which caused great debate of course ministers are answerable to parliament for all matters under this bill that could then be raised <e>", "<cs> these provisions are already fairly detailed and i believe that there is a danger of creating impractical requirements if we accept this amendment <e> <s> it is clear from the existing provisions that the governments intention is that there should be a substantial majority of independent members on the board <e> <s> it may in future prove desirable to increase the numbers and that is why this schedule provides for such increases <e> <s> if the need for an increase were to deal with a temporary situation then subsequent reductions might be required and this too is provided for but it would not be sensible to insist on a strict retention of the proportion of one sort of member to the other <e> <s> if it proves desirable to increase the number of independent members for example it does not automatically follow that it would be efficient or necessary for the <e>", "<cs> yes <e> <s> i think that there is a provision that there is a majority of independent members and i think that the government would wish to keep the same majority <e> <s> however it is not always possible to keep the same proportion <e>", "<cs> i feel a little lost on this particular amendment because i can well see that there are some reasons why the board could report on its proceedings although that is not the intention of this amendment but to report on its procedure seems to me no more than the board saying that it met <e>", "<cs> if only the government always got its drafting right <e> <s> but that is another matter entirely <e> <s> i am in some difficulty over this <e> <s> i fail to see how you actually describe the procedure of individual meetings

stage <e>", "<cs> dealing first with amendment no the cost of the board and the facilities necessary for its proper functioning will be provided in any event by the bank of england in accordance with paragraph of the schedule <e> <s> these costs will be met from the banks own resources and voted funds are not in themselves involved <e> <s> it seems therefore unnecessary for the treasury to be consulted in this matter as indeed the treasury is not consulted about details of the banks other expenditures on banking supervision <e>", "<cs> i shall certainly inquire but at the moment i could not say because it is not one of those facts which i have ever with me <e>", "<cs> without going on principles should always be had but not taken too far <e> <s> what we have here are not three corners <e> <s> the third leg if you like is a very substantial edifice indeed <e> <s> it is the bank of england it is there it has resources of its own it has always carried on meeting from its own

report as a matter of record that in there were stoppages in there were stoppages in there were stoppages and in there were stoppages <e> <s> i would rather like us to look at the period after the and

finding difficulty in deducing exactly what alliance policies are <e> <s> in this instance i do <e>", "<cs> my lords in many instances they are unofficial strikes and i do not believe they will come under working days lost <e> <s> i shall have to look at that point to determine exactly what the action is but in many cases the employers do not recognise such action as a strike <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think anybody in your lordships house needs reminding about the activities of the national union of mineworkers and the effect of those activities on the total number of days lost through strikes <e> <s> in there were stoppages in progress and the enormous total of million days lost by strike action a strike which contributed to no more than the shrinkage of the mining industry <e>",

their depositors <e> <s> regulation of controlling shareholders in banks is an important part of that protection and this is why the government included in the bill from the start a series of very

shall turn to that point in a moment <e> <s> i believe it is of central concern to his amendment <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will exercise a certain degree of patience i hope to be able to mention what we shall be doing <e> <s> in fact i shall deal with it now <e> <s> in regard to the existing statutory procedures for consideration of public interest factors which could emerge from the proposed acquisition of british companies including banks there is a review taking place <e> <s> i have also referred to the undertaking given in another place by my honourable friend the economic secretary on

"<cs> forgive me a <e> <s> i apologise for that <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i say finally to my noble friend lord elton that where the legislation says public interest it means that and the matter is considered by the monopolies and mergers commission <e> <s> it is not really accurate to say that the phrase only means the latest government statement on the scope of that matter <e> <s> i have said already that i shall ask my right honourable friend the secretary of state for trade and industry to look at the matter of public interest and i hope that he will take that into account <e>", "<cs> i am not in a position to say that any bid from japan would be blocked using the reciprocity powers because i do not know what will happen in japan or how open japan actually is <e> <s> we have to wait to see the circumstances and the facts of the case although my honourable friend in another place has cast doubts on whether such reciprocity exists today in japan <e> <s> as i have already said <e> <s> i look forward with considerable interest to see what the future will bring particularly in the case of cable and wireless which is an analogous case but in another area <e>", "<cs> one thing i can assure the committee is that the secretary of state for trade and industry will take these points on board <e> <s> i cannot say what the outcome of the review will be but i can say that the position of the banks and the banking system as a whole will be taken into account during the course of the current review of these matters <e>", "<cs> i listened with great care to my noble friend lord elton to the noble lord lord obrien and to the noble lord lord roll who i am delighted to see in the chamber today <e> <s> my faith in the judgment of my noble friend lord bruce-gardyne was undermined a little when i found the noble lord lord williams and the noble viscount lord chandos in agreement with him <e> <s> i then recalled that he was supporting the governments line and so my faith has been fully restored <e>", "<cs> i accept my noble friends assurances but sanctions nevertheless <e> <s> i am not sure <e>", "<cs> yes i am because i believe very much that the new provisions to regulate shareholder controllers have an effect beyond the strict range of their application <e> <s> any would-be controller now knows that he cannot expect to build up a controlling shareholding without the approval of the supervisors <e> <s> these new powers therefore cast their shadow back <e> <s> they will influence say a per cent <e> <s> shareholder in the way he conducts himself <e> <s> if he acts in such a way that he is revealed to be unsuitable to exercise a controlling role any subsequent attempt to obtain control can now be blocked <e> <s> there need be no concern about small shareholders in the sense that they are embryonic controllers or have their foot in the door <e> <s> the bill already covers that situation <e> <s> for these reasons and for some of the reasons which my noble friend lord bruce-gardyne outlined the government do not believe that provisions of the kind proposed by my noble friend in his new clause are needed <e>", "<cs> i do not think it helps our discussion to use names such as boesky and others because the bank itself has found ways to supervise without running into many of the dangers which my noble friend outlined <e> <s> it is a very strong test indeed and a rigorous requirement to be a controller <e> <s> as soon as you become a significant shareholder as soon as you go over per cent <e> <s> the bank is aware of you <e> <s> it has the powers to investigate you to watch you and very quickly the bank will let it be known whether you are a suitable person to be a controller <e> <s> i am not sure whether the market as a whole has to know <e> <s> certainly the significant shareholders will be aware how far they can take their own interests <e> <s> we have after all to defend the market operating as a market and the more we interpose restrictions the more i suspect in the fullness of time we will actually militate against london operating as a proper market <e>", "<cs> we have certainly strayed a considerable way from the consideration of a clause in the banking bill <e> <s> we have ended up with a small but nevertheless interesting debate on the morality of international lending <e> <s> i for one shall very much miss the right reverend prelate the bishop of birmingham from your lordships house and for that reason i shall read extremely carefully his contribution to todays debate <e> <s> but i must confess that at the moment i can hardly find a single word to agree with <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend lord elton <e> <s> i believe that i can at long last give him some comfort on the points about which he is <e>", "<cs> i am extremely grateful to my noble friend and i should also like to express my gratitude to the noble lord lord williams of elvel <e>", "<cs> yes the noble lord will no doubt wish to declare an interest as representing the entire body of auditors and accountants <e>", "<cs> of course in those circumstances it would be the bank which would pay when it asked the various accountants to prepare reports <e>", "<cs> if my noble friend looks at clause i believe that he will find it there <e>", "<cs> i am more than happy to take the noble lords assurances on that <e> <s> i was gently teasing him <e> <s> the cost of attending on the inspectors falls on the auditors <e> <s> the bank pays the inspectors costs but there is some lack of clarity about this whole matter perhaps <e> <s> i shall write to the noble lord to clear this matter up once and for all <e>", "<cs> i happily disclose an interest <e> <s> well over years ago i practised for a few months as a solicitor and that must make all i say subject to that disclosure <e> <s> there is a clear difference about a privileged communication <e> <s> a privileged communication is a communication made by a barrister advocate or solicitor with his client <e> <s> that puts it in one category with some other confidential information which may be referred to in subsection <e>", "<cs> privilege is i believe a term of art of the legal profession and therefore covers a certain category of disclosure <e> <s> i am not sure that it is necessarily the same between a banker and a customer or a banker and a client <e>", "<cs> i am sympathetic to the amendment of the noble lord lord bruce of donington but i consider that the way it is drafted may not be exactly appropriate <e> <s> this is partly because clause applies not just to united kingdom-incorporated companies but also to all other authorised institutions including overseas institutions and united kingdom partnerships not all of whose accounts necessarily have by law to include auditors reports of the type required under the companies act <e> <s> as the noble lord is aware section of the companies act provides for the purposes of that act that a united kingdom companys accounts must include an auditors report <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord bruce of donington does his profession great credit in the way he is concerned for its wellbeing and interests <e> <s> i understand the noble lords concern that auditors should not feel inhibited from disclosing relevant information to the bank but i am advised that this amendment is unnecessary <e> <s> the clause absolves auditors from contravention of any duty to which they are subject whether that duty be express or implied provided of course that they act in good faith when communicating with the bank <e> <s> it is in the same form as section of the financial services act and is similar to section of the building societies act which refers to obligation but without the qualifying words express or implied <e> <s> i hope the noble lord having heard my explanation will feel that he can withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> the statutory arrangements for the regulation of financial institutions in the united kingdom operate according to function <e> <s> accordingly there are separate statutory requirements for example for deposit-taking businesses under the banking act and for investment businesses under the financial services act <e> <s> similarly there are separate supervisory authorities for the different sectors <e> <s> this is a good system of regulation which promotes the kind of expertise that is required for adequate supervision <e>", "<cs> i congratulate my noble friend on bringing forward this amendment <e> <s> it is not a point central to the supervision of banks but it is nevertheless a worthwhile clarification of the existing law as it affects banking transactions carried out with the latest of technologies <e> <s> it can be difficult for the law to keep pace with such changes <e> <s> an amendment such as this designed as it is to remove a possible contraint on the development of an important project in electronic banking is welcome to the government <e> <s> i am pleased to be able to accept it <e>", "<cs> i hear everything that the noble lord lord bruce of donington has said although i can neither agree with the conclusions he is drawing from the comparison of different categories of civil action nor give him the undertaking for which he asks <e> <s> as he no doubt knows i could not do that at such short notice <e> <s> however there is little purpose in having a bill of this nature without seeking to enforce it <e> <s> i will draw his remarks to the attention of the director of public prosecutions and of my right honourable friend the attorney-general <e> <s> i have no doubt that he will pay full regard to some of the noble lords remarks if not to the inferences that he draws from them <e>", "<cs> my lords i am rather surprised that the noble lord should bring to the attention of your lordships house a report of this nature which among other things alleges that a few weeks ago when i introduced a six-month restart programme i introduced a work-for-benefit scheme <e> <s> the report contains figures which are misleading the total impression is misleading <e> <s> if the noble lord wishes to ask me how many people go into employment as a result of restart he may put down a question <e> <s> restart as a programme has now been accepted even by noble lords opposite or at least by <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may remind all in your lordships house that no one in this country has his benefit stopped unless his circumstances are such that he is not entitled to claim benefit in the first place <e> <s> there are many cases where people are claiming the wrong benefits and are entitled to sickness or disability benefits <e> <s> those people are steered on to the right sort of benefits <e> <s>

perhaps i may say that people have been disallowed for failure to attend within merseyside out of the people who were interviewed up to th february <e> <s> those who go into jobs are not included in the statistics for this programme <e> <s> i am quite happy to look at the figures for employment as a whole <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware that it has caused a certain amount of dismay to noble lords

the greatest work the unemployment unit counts it as <e> <s> some of the changes as i reminded all in your lordships house during the debate on it included items such as the strike in the newcastle

count and not one has taken place since the figures changed direction last july <e> <s> unemployment is going down in this country <e> <s> it will continue to go down despite the great dismay and disappointment of those opposite <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know how many times i have to repeat to the noble lord lord hatch of lusby that this is not an employment programme <e> <s> you may as well divide the cost of restart by the number of people who eat chocolate sundaes because that has no relevance to it at all <e> <s> i shall just remind noble lords of two simple facts <e> <s> only since we started the restart programme has long-term unemployment started to go down <e> <s> only since we started the restart programme have we discovered that one in four of the long-term unemployed is illiterate <e> <s> only since we started the restart programme have we been in the position to say that we have now met and helped all of the long-term unemployed in this country <e> <s> i stand very proud of the governments programme of work which is now the envy of other countries with high unemployment <e> <s> we have seen the results so far <e> <s> we shall continue to see the results as this government will continue with restart <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to be criticised on that score considering how i was criticised on the day i stood in your lordships house to introduce the programme <e> <s> at least the house <e>", "<cs> my lords it is absolutely true to say that that is the figure mentioned in this pamphlet <e> <s> it is totally untrue to say that that is the cost per job as a result of restart <e> <s> restart is not an employment programme and perhaps i may explain why <e> <s> we interview people <e> <s> we put people into job clubs <e> <s> we never count the two-thirds of people who go into employment from job clubs <e> <s> we put people on training programmes <e> <s> we never count the people who go into employment on training programmes <e> <s> we put people a year on to the community programme <e> <s> we never count those who go into jobs out of that programme <e>", "<cs> my lords we have recently extended the restart programme so that from easter it will give counselling interviews to those who have been unemployed for six months and then at six monthly intervals <e> <s> restart is not an employment programme as such <e> <s> in reality it is a gateway to the or more programmes which my department runs as a means of getting people who have lost their motivation to look for work back looking for work and undertaking training <e>", "<cs> my lords it has not been the practice of my department to keep detailed statistics of those who go through training programmes or jobclubs and then into employment <e> <s> at the end of the day everyone in your lordships house can look at the programmes as a whole and at the progress that the figures show <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not a question of the area manpower boards which have all the information that is available to the manpower services commission <e> <s> it is the very nature of restart itself <e> <s> people who have been out of work for six months or more now but formerly for over a year are interviewed and an attempt is made to persuade them that it would be sensible to go to a jobclub to take a training programme or go on one of the variety of programmes which we have

the protection <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> the number of approved share schemes has grown from around in to over today and million people have now benefited under those schemes <e>", "<cs> my lords on this particular occasion the noble lords question passes me by <e> <s> from time to time we have always warned those who buy shares that they are speculating <e> <s> we believe that shares are a good investment but anything that goes up can come down and i am sure that those who buy shares are fully aware of that fact <e>", "<cs> my lords if those who are concerned with this business

substantially <e> <s> as an aggregate the nationalised industries lost billions of pounds each year <e> <s> all the companies that have been denationalised are making profits <e> <s> the funds have

what i rejoice in is the way in which british industry has risen to the challenge how we have an export-led boom and how british goods are re-establishing the reputation they once proudly held for

difficult for management to see that far ahead yet we are indeed aware of the sensitivities in scotland and the management of the british steel corporation has been able to offer assurances going as far as seven years <e> <s> i thought that those assurances would be received with great rejoicing north of the border and i am sure that they really should be <e>", "<cs> my lords on my noble friends final suggestion sufficient unto the day i think <e>", "<cs> my lords i have given long and careful consideration to the way in which a country could have all the health social and other services it has without creating the profits in the first place out of which to do so <e> <s> of course we can only privatise those companies which are profitable <e> <s> if the noble lord can suggest to me a way in which we can privatise unprofitable companies i promise we will consider it seriously because companies do not flourish and do not grow in the public sector <e> <s> what we are seeing is simply a further extension of the governments privatisation programme which will not end until all the companies that should be in the private sector are returned there <e>", "<cs> my lords the normal reason for introducing a regulatory body is to ensure that if there should be a monopoly supplier that monopoly supplier will not charge excessive prices to the consumer <e> <s> i recall the difficult days in during the strike in the steel industry when after a few weeks there appeared to be an adequate supply of steel coming in from other parts of the world and i think that would ensure that there would be no shortage of competition whatever the british steel corporation did in its private form <e> <s> to have a regulatory body to ensure that only british steel was used would be quite against the spirit of the treaty of rome and indeed not in the interests of either the consumer or british industry as a whole <e>", "<cs> yes <e> <s> where there is an infringement of copyright it must continue to be an infringement of a civil right <e>", "<cs> a moment of reflection has enabled me to assure the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge that it is perfectly legal to tape at home where no copyright material is involved <e> <s> thus all gilbert and sullivan is safe hut alas where copyright material is involved it is illegal to tape it at home <e>", "<cs> let me at least assure the noble lord lord donaldson that it is not a criminal offence at present nor will it be <e> <s> to my knowledge he will not have to go to prison <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend lord ferrers but i fear that i must disagree <e>", "<cs> i have a very long tape <e> <s> i must have very many messages but the machine takes a tape that lasts for more than minutes so indeed do all the telephone answering machine tapes that actually record messages <e> <s> the estimated revenue before administrative expenses would be million a year <e> <s> i do not know what it would be afterwards perhaps three-quarters or half that amount <e> <s> the sales of the united kingdom record industry were million at trade prices and very much more at retail prices <e> <s> as we are talking about retail prices the figure must be close to double that so it would be or million <e> <s> so the levy is a very small amount of money <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord williams of elvel for his comments <e> <s> of course i am very much aware of the importance of morale in the civil service <e> <s> the noble lord may possibly recall that i spent five and a half years as a sort of civil servant immediately before entering cabinet <e> <s> i am convinced above all else about the need not only to have high morale in the civil service but to show the appreciation for the very real work that the civil service does in order to discharge the obligations of government <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful indeed for the welcome given by my noble friend to the statement <e>", "<cs> my lords i suspect that the noble lord would be calmed if he read the white paper or indeed a copy of my statement <e> <s> it consists of a great many matters other than regional policy <e> <s> it is concerned with the growth of the economy of this country for without the prosperity that a growing economy brings we cannot have the caring society which we should all like to have <e>

today will allow applications for regional development grant to be made up to and including st march this year so that plans may proceed <e> <s> however the payment out for that may be some years ahead but applications may go in until st march this year which should give adequate notice to all those contemplating investment under the old system <e>", "<cs> my lords the white paper is based upon our assessment of what is required in the interests of the economy of the united kingdom <e> <s> nevertheless we have taken steps to ensure that it does not conflict with the treaty of rome <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord cannot possibly have it both ways <e> <s> he cannot ask me how my policies will reduce male unemployment in the north and at the same time complain bitterly that regional selective assistance is allowing firms such as nissan to come into the north-east to compete with other british manufacturers but at the same time giving jobs to male employees in the north <e>", "<cs> my lords i always thought that the sda was itself a centralised body in scotland <e> <s> i think that i have a certain degree of bravery but i am not brave enough to take on the combined lobby of the sda and the hi db <e> <s> i confirm to the noble lords opposite that those agencies will of course continue <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord lord taylor for his unqualified undertaking not to interrupt prayers tomorrow <e> <s> i also happily agree with him that i follow lancashire in everything except cricket <e> <s> we shall work out these programmes to

taste for the world of work <e> <s> we shall be looking at those young people who are not caught by tvei who do not have present work experience and who are not covered <e> <s> it may well be that this programme will be offered outside lancashire but i am sure no-one in lancashire will object <e>", "<cs> my lords not only does industry and commerce in the regions benefit from grants from the european community but we have assured your lordships house today that regional spend will not be reduced <e> <s> i hope that all noble lords take fully into account that at the end of this decade regional businesses will benefit by some million per annum as a result of the unified business rate <e>", "<cs> my lords i am fully aware of what the noble lord says <e> <s> i was of course responsible for the manpower services commission when it moved all its head office functions out of london towards sheffield <e> <s> indeed my white paper today announces the moving of people from victoria street more towards the regions <e> <s> the rules under which regional selective assistance is being administered have not changed since <e> <s> they take into account not only movement of jobs but also saving of jobs <e> <s> that will not change <e> <s> i believe we are seeing a welcome return of confidence in the regions as the south-east becomes so congested and so expensive that we are beginning to see many companies going further and further north in an effort to achieve better conditions <e> <s> this is not the time for a full debate on this subject which will go on very much longer <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not averse in the slightest to government departments or indeed your lordships house being transferred to the north of england but i am also concerned that productive industry and commerce should be in the north of england as well <e>", "<cs> my lords the fair trading act distinguishes three levels of influence on a company which constitute a qualifying merger <e> <s> it is that point which the director general is at the moment in the process of investigating <e> <s> these three qualities are the ability materially to influence policy the ability to control such policy or the acquisition of a controlling interest <e> <s> it would be as well to await the report of the director general who will then advise me <e> <s> i can then see what steps should be taken <e> <s> i am aware of the interest in the matter and of its implications <e> <s> i assure all in your lordships house that we shall be following this through very closely indeed <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but the golden share is in respect of a company in the north <e>", "<cs> my lords if the monopolies and mergers commission which is the end result of the director generals report finds that a merger might be expected to operate against the public interest for this purpose a substantial shareholding can qualify as a merger my power is to remedy or prevent any adverse effects specified in the report <e> <s> if a merger is in contemplation i can prevent it <e> <s> if it has already taken place i can require disposal of all or part of the existing shareholding in the target company <e>", "<cs> my lords i am absolutely satisfied that the director general of the office of fair trading will be considering whether this is a merger situation <e> <s> if he finds that it is and that it qualifies for investigation and at that time i so agree i am certain that the monopolies and mergers commission will be looking at all aspects of the problem <e>", "<cs> it surely does my lords but as i told your lordships a moment ago under the fair trading act there are three levels of influence in a company which constitute a qualifying merger <e> <s> those levels of influence are the ability materially to affect policy to control policy or to acquire a controlling interest <e> <s> that is the law <e>", "<cs> my lords i believed that the latest holding was just over per cent <e> <s> i have not been following it closely <e> <s> i also noticed that the chairman of the company seemed to consider that to be acceptable <e> <s> i believe that we should wait to see exactly what the director general advises me before taking any further steps <e>", "<cs> my lords the government welcome the fact that the court of auditors has devoted a chapter of its annual report to the question of fraud <e> <s> the courts report will be discussed by the economic and finance council later this year on the basis of a procedure which the united kingdom was instrumental in setting up <e> <s> the government will aim to ensure that the council recognises the importance of the fight against fraud <e>", "<cs> my lords the detected fraud that is fraud which has been found out runs at a far lower level than the noble lord suggests <e> <s> over the past five years the average has been approximately million although it was about million in which is important and should be dealt with <e> <s> suspected levels of fraud which have not been detected have yet to be proved <e>", "<cs> my lords i have little doubt that the report in <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> on average over new businesses have opened and closed every week of this decade <e> <s> that process appears to be continuing <e> <s> there is no doubt that small and medium-sized business are responsible for a great deal of the growth in employment and the economy of the united kingdom <e> <s> i am sure that your lordships house appreciates that my right honourable friend the secretary of state for employment is responsible in the government for looking after small firms <e> <s> my department looks after the interests of all companies <e>", "<cs> my lords over the past few weeks i have spent some considerable time <e>", "<cs> my lords luxury goods are part of the gdp calculation <e> <s> i suppose that tobacco would be also but drugs are surely an illegal activity and form part of the black economy which is not normally calculated in any assessment of gdp <e>", "<cs> my lords i suspect that increased public expenditure would be just as welcome as increased taxation <e>", "<cs> my lords the funding of the nhs is another question <e> <s> i think all in your lordships house will be aware that the increase which the health service will receive next year is approximately equal to my entire budget <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to assure the noble lord that i said more businesses opened than closed each week <e> <s> there is an average net increase of over a week <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> it is significant that the two reports issued by the cbi after th october referring to opinion within manufacturing industry collected after th october should be the two most optimistic reports for the past years <e>", "<cs> my lords the balance of payments deficit which the chancellor of the exchequer has estimated for the year i say this from memory will be about billion and has long been forecast <e> <s> it should be taken into account at a time when this country has net overseas investments well in excess of billion <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot possibly say what was in the minds of those who built up the detailed forecasts not only the one which the government made but the one made by the oecd <e> <s> however i notice with alarm that the noble lord used the word crisis <e> <s> i think that all in your lordships house should recognise that today share prices on the london stock exchange are per cent <e> <s> above those of this time last year <e> <s> that hardly represents a crisis <e>", "<cs> my lords it depends very much on the way in which the money is spent <e>", "<cs> my lords since the scheme has permitted over loans aggregating over million to be made to small businesses <e> <s> these loans have helped the businesses concerned to start up or expand thus creating wealth and employment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful <e> <s> there is a new simplified administration covering loans up to for smaller companies <e> <s> i believe that those who apply for loans up to will find that the procedure now is much more suited to their purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall of course look into the matter and if i may write to the noble baroness with the information <e> <s> many of these loans come to the government through the banks because often it is the banks which apply for the guarantees <e> <s> this is a matter which should perhaps be <e>", "<cs> my lords there is little doubt that the rating policies of some authorities in the land have made it extremely difficult for small firms to carry on <e> <s> we have endeavoured to use persuasion <e> <s> today we are engaged in other matters <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> surveys by the department of employment show that the loan guarantee scheme is one of the most effective of all schemes operated by the department <e> <s> it operates at a net cost per person on the register of jobs created of about per job <e> <s> that is an extremely favourable figure <e> <s> a review of the schemes effectiveness is being carried out by national economic research associates who report during the course of this year <e> <s> the present scheme runs until st march <e> <s> i have no doubt that we shall wish to look at the report before deciding on its future <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that my noble friend will understand when i say that i am more concerned that the value of a note should not be reduced rather than its actual size <e> <s> not long ago i returned from the united states of america where i noticed that all hank notes were of the same size <e> <s> that does not seem to have harmed that country over the past decades <e> <s> however i shall pass on my noble friends comments to the governor of the bank of england <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the coin has now received wide acceptance within the country and that it would perhaps not be too sensible to go back to producing notes <e> <s> the existing note has a life of some nine months <e> <s> it seems to me that if we were to return to the note the cost would begin to outweigh any benefit <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot tell your lordships whether we have been studying the kind of notes produced in australia but we have been paying considerable attention to what other countries have been doing <e> <s> holland has been experimenting with plastic coated notes <e> <s> there may well be something in the notion that changing the quality of the paper might prolong the life of the notes a little <e> <s> however the present feeling is that such a cost would be disproportionate to the benefits obtained <e>", "<cs> my lords the last time i saw a note it was a different size <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not for me to comment on the noble lords spending habits <e>", "<cs> my lords i have long been aware that scotland is indeed a different land <e>", "<cs> my lords i can certainly tell the noble earl that that is a quagmire into which i shall not descend <e>", "<cs> my lords i venture to suggest that no one in your lordships house is more aware than i of the plight of those who have been out <e>", "<cs> my lords for once i agree with the noble lord lord hatch of lusby that economic policies were responsible for the considerable increase in unemployment in the early s <e> <s> they were the economic policies we followed in the mid-s which are shown to have had a direct result in our economy not being able to adjust to the sharp change which happened when the oil price rise came and when this country found it had to be competitive in a world in which we had to earn our way or suffer the consequences <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware that manufacturing employment has been falling at the rate of jobs a month on average month in and month out since the middle of <e> <s> i suspect it will continue to fall in that way as manufacturing <e>", "<cs> my lords i think all in your lordships house should be concerned about increases in wages that are not earned <e> <s> where wage increases are accompanied by productivity increases and unit labour costs are under control we should all welcome that because the ambition of this government is to have a high wage society not a low one <e> <s> however where industrial action takes place for wage increases for their own sake without accompanying productivity increases i fear for the future of jobs <e>", "<cs> my lords i resisted all temptation to forecast the future of unemployment when it was rising and i shall equally resist that temptation when it is falling <e> <s> i hope that my answer made clear that i was concerned with strikes about wage increases which were not accompanied by productivity increases <e> <s> that will affect the future of jobs <e>", "<cs> my lords whether or not part-time work is low paid often depends on the willingness of people to take those particular jobs <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not saying that employment will continue at this rate because i am not making any forecast <e> <s> however if i were to take arithmetical proportions it will fall beneath the level in about three or four years time <e> <s> however that is hardly the point <e> <s> we have a vastly increased working population <e> <s> we have an economy that is the envy of the industrialised world whereas in as i hardly need remind any one of your lordships we were the sick man of europe and an object of ridicule by other industrialised nations <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> assessments need to be sent direct to taxpayers even where an agent is acting because the tax due is the personal liability of the individual and taxpayers are informed of their right of appeal against the assessment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that my noble friend is more than interested to know what current demands are being made upon him by the tax man <e> <s> where authorised the inland revenue will send copies of assessments to the professional adviser of the taxpayer <e> <s> it seems to me that it would be dangerous if we had a system whereby at all times the taxpayer could be unaware of the demands upon him <e> <s> after all tax due is the liability of the taxpayer the professional adviser is there to advise <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot claim to be of an advanced age but i must claim to be rather upset when i receive an assessment from the tax man <e> <s> i would rather that it be sent direct to my adviser <e> <s> however i believe that in the end i should know about it <e> <s> of course there are difficult circumstances but perhaps i may suggest that those concerned should first authorise the tax man to send the assessment to their professional advisers and secondly send the envelope on to them unopened <e>", "<cs> my lords sperhaps i may tell the noble lord lord diamond that to my knowledge no complaints have been received but i shall certainly inquire <e>", "<cs> my lords normally that is done but it is a requirement that the taxpayer should authorise the inspector to send those demands <e>", "<cs> my lords my information is that the inspector is not so inhibited <e> <s> i am concerned to think that he might be but i am told that in fact he can send a copy to the adviser provided he sends it to the taxpayer as well <e>", "<cs> my lords some negotiations as to where the moneys will go have yet to be concluded <e> <s> however it has been agreed that less developed regions within the community will receive a larger share of the structural funds <e> <s> within the united kingdom only northern ireland is a less developed region <e> <s> i am happy to confirm to my noble friend that it appears that united kingdom receipts from the regional fund will grow significantly over the next few years <e>", "<cs> my lords it is in a way a cause for congratulation that less and less of the united kingdom is becoming a less developed region within the european community <e> <s> i assure all in your lordships house that central government are not changing their policy with regard to support for regions <e> <s> the detailed negotiations within the community as to the precise allocation of those funds have yet to take place <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a complex matter <e> <s> approximately two-thirds of the receipts from the fund go towards local authority and public utility infrastructure <e> <s> they save about half the cost of the capital expenditure in the eligible areas <e> <s> if the noble lord cares to put down a question about the precise allocation of those moneys i shall be happy to enlighten him <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to assure my noble friend that there is a feeling in other parts of the community that the united kingdom is rather too adept at receiving those grants <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not speak in your lordships house with responsibility for scotland or wales <e> <s> i have said that at present while the broad shape of the structural funds that they should be doubled by has been agreed no decisions have been taken about the size of the three individual funds or of the united kingdoms share <e> <s> no doubt within the united kingdom the respective secretaries of state are fully involved in the allocation of those moneys <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give that assurance because i was not consulted in these negotiations <e> <s> as i have already said the overall shape of the structural funds has been settled but the discussions about the size of the three structural funds or the united kingdoms share have yet to take place <e> <s> i should remind the noble lord that the question on the order paper is on another subject <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness <e> <s> this was a matter that i referred to the monopolies and mergers commission which concluded that in the light of proposals developed by british airways it would

officials are i believe continuing <e> <s> but it is a matter solely for the commission and the company involved and i cannot comment upon it <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a matter for the commission <e> <s> my understanding of the present position is that the matter is with the commission and with commissioner sutherland in particular <e> <s> it is very much a matter for what he proposes and where he proposes to take it afterwards <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to dispute one fact with my noble friend <e> <s> i lay no claim whatsoever to any legal ability <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord williams of elvel is in this instance being carried away with the thought <e> <s> at the moment the matter is still with the commissioner <e> <s> let us see what he does with it and then we shall see whether we should worry from that time onwards <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i am very glad to assure my noble friend that the government do have such powers <e> <s> what the government want to see is a profitable and economic north sea oil sector and we are engaged in so doing <e>", "<cs> my lords since the act of union we have taken the national interest to include that of scotland as well as wales and northern ireland in the united kingdom <e> <s> i am not aware that any independent british exploration companies to which the noble lord lord williams of elvel referred are in possession of a golden share <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very glad to say that i can agree completely with my noble friend <e>", "<cs> yes my lords it has brought many jobs to scotland and we hope that those jobs will continue for many decades to come <e>", "<cs> my lords the department of employment estimates that million foreign visitors came to the united kingdom in the first months of compared with million and million in the same periods in and respectively <e> <s> figures covering the whole of will be published on nd march <e>", "<cs> my lords the government will do all in their power to encourage the growth of the tourist industry <e> <s> many of the activities to which my noble friend refers are in the hands of the local planning bodies that is local government rather than central government <e> <s> what we must do in a world in which tourism is perhaps the fastest growing internationally competitive industry is ensure that we can get more than our fair share of it and at the same time do it so that it does not disturb too much the lives of those of us who live here <e> <s> it is an important growth area and will long continue to be one <e>", "<cs> my lords i should certainly like to have evidence of how tourists are being ripped off in that way <e> <s> as far as i know there is no international treaty which compels overseas tourists to come to this country <e> <s> the mere fact that the figures are increasing so rapidly and have done so in a year in which the pound has not changed too much in value certainly against european currencies shows that the tourists themselves are voting with their feet and that they consider that they do get value for money both in british hotels and in the united kingdom generally <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> those costs tend to vary of course from time to time with exchange rates <e> <s> the important test is a very simple one will people come here and stay in the hotels <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i rise to reply to the debate this afternoon in a slightly unusual position <e> <s> on the one hand i am a member of that endangered species at least your lordships will send me away a member of that endangered species a comparatively happy secretary of state after all the kind things that some members of your lordships house have said about my white paper <e> <s> at the same time i am also a thoughtful secretary of state since a number of very valid and important points have been raised all of which i shall give consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that the noble lord would not expect me

six months of last year manufacturing industry showed an average decline of some employees a month <e> <s> however between and the figure was a month between and the figure was a month between and in

more than almost anything else is surely our degree of competitiveness <e>", "<cs> my lords whether or not major industries go to different parts of the country depends upon those industries rather more than upon my department <e> <s> it is the actions of my department in past years which have contributed so much to parts of the region becoming a branch economy <e> <s> of course there are substantial manufacturing industries north of watford gap because that is where the original industrial revolution started and where the great enterprise of our citizens made this country great <e> <s> there has been and is continuing to be change <e> <s> i am vastly encouraged by the resilience of those who live in the regions and by the way in which they are adapting to new technologies and new occupations <e> <s> i can do no more than quote the japanese ambassador who yesterday paid tribute to what our citizens can do in the north <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we have to accustom ourselves to the fact that in the future the balance between industry and the service sector will not be the same as it has been in the past <e> <s> what really counts is that the nation as a whole creates wealth <e> <s> that we are certainly doing <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble baroness cares to put down a question i should be happy to supply the details <e> <s> our productivity is improving vastly <e> <s> we had fallen a long way behind and i suspect that we still have some way to catch up with germany although on the whole we are beginning to catch up with france and indeed show signs of overtaking them <e>", "<cs> my lords unemployment is now standing at per cent <e> <s> which is somewhat below that for most of the other major industrial nations in europe <e> <s> there are considerable areas of skill shortage in our country <e> <s> over the past few years we have been taking steps to deal with those shortages <e> <s> it is very much for the private sector to accept that it should be providing more training and there is some evidence that that is now beginning to happen <e>", "<cs> my lords that set of figures ignores totally the self-employed and in doing so unfortunately distorts the picture considerably <e> <s> the number of self-employed in our land approaches million it could be even higher <e> <s> it is not for the government to create opportunities it is for the government to create the climate so that industry and the manufacturing and service sectors can expand and thus provide employment opportunities <e> <s> there can be no greater evidence than the experience of the past two years to show that this has been happening <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware that our balance of payments is running at a deficit from memory i think of some billion <e> <s> in many cases these deficits tend to be adjusted for the better in due course <e> <s> however the most important factor is that we are showing growth as great as if not greater than any other industrialised nation in the world <e> <s> the british economy is doing very well it is very strong <e> <s> one sign of that strength is that we tend to import more <e> <s> i hope that in the years to come we shall see the economy as a whole including the service sector and the industrial sector continue to grow and that we shall find the position rights itself <e>", "<cs> my lords the industrial sector is not diminishing <e> <s> it may well be that employment is declining as a result of new technology and increased productivity and efficiency <e> <s> however when i last saw the figures industrial output was some per cent <e> <s> above that for and rising strongly <e> <s> i believe that that will continue to be the position <e> <s> it is something of a red herring to talk about the situation when the oil revenues run out <e> <s> over the past years we have achieved substantial reserves of billion or billion of uk net overseas investments <e> <s> the dividends from that source last year alone amounted to some billion which was almost as much as the entire drop in oil proceeds when the price of oil halved <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have no intention of accepting any proposals for vat harmonisation which would extend vat to food gas electricity or young childrens clothing and footware <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a rare almost unique occasion on which i find myself in total agreement with the noble lord lord bruce of donington <e>", "<cs> my lords because of pressing government business i will not alas be able to listen to the whole debate but i hope to hear as much as possible and for that part i miss i will read the <e>", "<cs> my lords i gladly accept that there should be a lower limit but i refuse to accept for one moment that there should be an upper limit on which incomes actually stand <e>", "<cs> my lords i am referring to incomes in society and not artificial structures for minimum wages which only have the effect of stopping growth

answer one of his questions <e> <s> however i can say to both noble lords that the honda company which has a valued commerical arrangement with rover has been informed of the situation <e> <s> the company has sent me a message to say that they welcome such negotiations and look forward to continuing to co-operate and work with the rover group in the new circumstances should they transpire <e>", "<cs> my lords i say to the noble lord lord barnett that part of my reply to my noble friend lord jenkin of roding was that there would have to be some restructuring of the balance sheet <e> <s> that might be considered a euphemism for looking at the existing burden of debt which has accumulated after so many years in public-sector ownership <e> <s> it is a matter of state aid and a matter which has to be negotiated with brussels <e> <s> it is also a matter which will be considered in the weeks to come <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the new vista opening for all those who work within the rover group will be enlarged by negotiations with british aerospace <e> <s> it is much too early to be more specific <e> <s> i have come to your lordships house to tell your lordships that

noble friend who succeeds in ensuring that i never forget the isle of wight <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i am very glad to be able to explain to the noble lord lord barnett that there is something called the private sector <e> <s> in the past months we have seen such a resurgence of demand in the north-east and the north-west and the northern region itself that quite frankly it is impossible for the government to build all the new factories nor indeed is it desirable that they should do so <e> <s> we have seen an expansion of per cent <e> <s> in the programme itself but an expansion greater than that in actual demand for factories <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> english estates is being asked not to consider building factories in the future where the private sector will do so <e>

the demand <e> <s> it seems to be unsatisfactory that we should continue to do this only at the expense of the taxpayer when there is a very good and viable private sector in the rest of the country

providing will increase from million in to million in <e>", "<cs> my lords to my knowledge it is <e> <s> i will happily write to the noble lord with the details and put a copy in the library <e>", "<cs> there will be <e>", "<cs> nonsense <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord lord williams of elvel for those comments for his contribution to our debate and for his not inconsiderable history of the economic development of the principality <e> <s> however his memory alas is failing him because i recall that there was a very effective regional policy in the valleys

way that she has mentioned <e> <s> i was coming back to her question <e> <s> i believe that at the moment there are sufficient consultants to provide the services at the level we are now looking for <e> <s> i believe that we shall see a movement of individual consultancies from the south to the regions because that is where the demand will begin to occur a possible expansion in the number of consultancies and in the number of consultants as demand for say marketing consultants causes people with those skills and abilities to leave other companies and to set up or join consultancies where they can offer their services more <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept the point although it is some way from the topic of the bill and the function about which we are talking <e> <s> nevertheless the work of bodies such as the training commission is an important and integral part of regional policy <e> <s> we are not talking about whether the government have a regional policy they have a regional policy <e> <s> we are not talking about whether they spend money in the regions we are proposing to spend more money <e> <s> we are talking about an effective regional policy and the best way of

am afraid that he is incorrect <e> <s> i shall return to that matter but i should like to point out that he was also incorrect in his figures in relation to civil servants <e> <s> as i told him on the last occasion on which we discussed this matter my department has many civil servants outside london over <e> <s> the total number in my department is over half of which are outside the greater london

departments to the regions <e> <s> on the last occasion i reminded the noble lord that i was responsible for moving the head offices of the manpower services commission from london to sheffield which i believe can still be considered to be a region <e> <s> in bootle in the north-west a considerable number of people are in employment <e> <s> i believe that the department of employment has more than per cent <e> <s> of its civil servants employed around the country and that is true of most civil servants <e> <s> however i shall be happy to write to the noble lord giving a full breakdown of the figures <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that it is a matter of congratulation that per cent <e> <s> of civil servants are not in the south-east <e> <s> however london happens to be the centre of government i remember that on the last occasion i said that i should be quite happy if this house were to move to the north-west but some things are impossible to move <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now make a statement on the rover group plc <e>", "<cs> my lords it is both <e> <s> it is in the form of a simple grant by way of a security which is repayable only if businesses are disposed of during the period and/or tax losses over and above million are claimed <e> <s> if so it is repayable to the extent of the benefit achieved by the company <e>", "<cs> my lords the estimates i have indicate that there are something between and jobs involved in the component supply industry for the rover group <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble viscount for his support of the arrangement <e> <s> i assure noble lords that the policy of the government has been to achieve the return of the rover group to the private sector <e> <s> we have considered many ways in which that could be accomplished <e> <s> it seems to us that this is the best way and that the reward of the government will be the continuation of component suppliers and distributors as well

proposed sale in the round i hope that all noble lords particularly noble lords opposite will listen at least to the views expressed by the workforce the distributors and all who work in rover and be cautious about the ways they judge the outcome of this deal <e>", "<cs> my lords half or so of the billion assurances will be paid off when the million which the government pay discharges the bank debts <e> <s> the remainder will be paid off in the course of time as trade creditors and other obligations are paid <e> <s> what will happen probably after the end of the year is that the varley-marshall-joseph assurances will have been eliminated and will be part of the normal trading obligations of the rover group as a subsidiary of british aerospace should this matter proceed <e>", "<cs> my lords the procedure started today <e> <s> the matter will take some months and i very much hope that we shall reach agreement <e> <s> it would be foolhardy to say what you anticipate doing on

the last two elections gave us the basis of our mandate for this action <e>", "<cs> my lords at present the varley-marshall assurances total some billion for a net cost of million which as i said is the million that we shall be putting into the company less the million that we shall accept as the proceeds of sale of the shares <e> <s> we shall be extinguishing that billion liability <e> <s> that demonstrates the benefit to government <e>", "<cs> my lords i hardly think that the process of privatisation was a closely guarded secret in our manifesto of or at the time of the two subsequent elections <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that credit should be given where credit is due <e> <s> the terms of mercurys licence were that it should provide services to edinburgh and glasgow by november

happy to say that i believe that a report published by oftel has been properly received by british telecom and those difficulties are now being put right <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a matter which i shall refer to the noble lord lord mackie <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> there have indeed been discussions with the commission about the designs provisions in the copyright designs and patents bill

answer them all i hope that i may be given the opportunity to reply to them later <e>", "<cs> my lords from the moment that my right honourable friend kenneth baker made the statement in until i restated it only a few days ago it has always been government policy that the duopoly would be reconsidered in november <e> <s> we have considered the matter <e> <s> there are many other implications <e> <s> i do not believe that i should take up your lordships time this evening to deal with that point <e> <s> i am happy to deal with it on any other occasion <e> <s> it is a plank of our

looking at all these matters we are very conscious that we have priorities before us <e> <s> indeed in this period of questioning we have seen the cost of the columbus platform come down very considerably <e>", "<cs> excuse me my lords but i regretted nothing <e> <s> i have denied that i misled your lordships house and i stand by each and every word i said <e> <s> to put the record

pass through your lordships house until the last few days of july as indeed happens every year <e>", "<cs> my lords nevertheless the position is this <e> <s> noble lords will accept that this bill has passed all stages in another place <e> <s> it has had a second reading in your lordships house <e> <s> there have been many other cases of bills in a similar position <e> <s> there has to be a

the date of closure by st march will be processed and dealt with in the usual way <e> <s> those that arrive on or after st april will not <e>", "<cs> my lords i am following well-honoured precedents <e> <s> for example if noble lords consider the way the investment grants scheme was terminated in they will find that exactly such a precedent was followed that it is customary to give adequate notice and that the notice applied from a date and the legislation followed <e> <s> if the legislation were to fall that would be another matter <e> <s> but if the legislation is passed that is the precedent that has been honoured in the past and will be honoured on this occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall carry out research into that and write to the noble and learned lord <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the opportunity to debate this amendment <e> <s> the noble lord lord taylor has made a number of points about scotland and the scottish economy and has argued forthrightly that regional development grants should be retained in scotland <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will understand if i am equally forthright in explaining why the government do not feel able to accept this amendment <e>", "<cs> i hope the noble lord will forgive me if before he presses the amendment i emphasise two particular points <e> <s> firstly this does not mean in any way a move away from a regional policy <e> <s> when i came to your lordships house on second reading i pointed out that we were spending more money and not less <e> <s> it is a qualitative change <e> <s> i am sure that in his private life the noble lord would question giving out money irrespective of proof of need <e> <s> i would rather give taxpayers funds only in those cases where they would make a difference <e> <s> that is one reason for the move away from automatic grants and towards selective assistance <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord although i fail to share his acceptance that a reduction of long-term unemployment by nearly a quarter of a million in the last months should be thought in any way disgraceful <e> <s> nor do i live in such an insulated world as the noble lord lord dormand of easington who has not noticed what has happened throughout europe during the course of this decade <e> <s> he also fails today to notice the fact that unemployment is rising in every country in europe while it is falling sharply here <e> <s> we are no island <e> <s> we live in the real world <e> <s> we have to deal with conditions as they are and this government certainly are dealing with those conditions <e>", "<cs> my lords the really satisfying statistics over the last months show that the north-east and the north-west are leading the return to normality and that unemployment is falling fastest in those regions <e>", "<cs> my lords once again i fear that i have to disagree with the noble lord <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> my lords all of us in your lordships house regret unemployment <e> <s> but i think that no one would disagree with me when i say that we regret it most among the young <e> <s> it is satisfactory at least that the number of unemployed aged under fell by per cent <e> <s> in the last year <e> <s> indeed it is now less than half of what it used to be at the time when we first launched the youth training scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has spent more time with his colleagues than with young people <e> <s> the young people with whom i speak up and down the land do not accuse this government of fiddling the figures <e> <s> the young people to whom i speak appreciate and accept the fact that we have introduced the best training scheme for young people <e> <s> that is something which noble lords opposite when they had the opportunity hesitated to do and turned away from <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> it is perhaps another question but my information is that the jobclubs continue to show the productivity that they have shown in the past in getting those who are out of work back into employment <e> <s> i have not seen the latest figures from restart <e> <s> i shall write to the noble lord and put a copy in the library <e>", "<cs> my lords forecasting the rate of unemployment was a temptation that i was able to resist in the days when it was going up and also when it started to fall <e> <s> i do not think it would be profitable to give further forecasts save one and that is that the government will not relax their efforts to ensure that they provide as much help as they can

than that i fear at this moment i cannot say <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope we shall never get back to in terms of productivity labour relations output and all the other matters which at that time gave us a worldwide reputation for the british disease <e> <s> when i go to the north-east and see the new factories that have been set up when i see the metrocentre in newcastle and all the new vigour and vitality of the north-east i would not exchange that for for anything <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to assure all in your lordships house that i have never been smug about unemployment <e> <s> far from it <e> <s> but i refute the allegations about the economy and in particular about the way unemployment is going in our country <e>", "<cs> my lords the criteria proposed by the commission on rd march are neither entirely clear nor apparently fully satisfactory <e> <s> negotiations continue <e> <s> the criteria have to be adopted by the council unanimously <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to assure my noble friend that i agree it is important beyond all doubt that the highlands and islands should continue to qualify for the regional fund <e> <s> indeed the government have emphasised this in brussels and i know the case has also recently been very ably put there by the representatives of the region <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord would care to put down a question on that matter i should be very happy to deal with it <e> <s> we are at this time dealing with the criteria which are a different matter <e>", "<cs> my lords every time my friend stands i immediately think southwards but in this case i suspect the answer must regretfully be no <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to reassure the noble lord in the terms that i have just assured the house that we believe that it is important that the highlands and islands should continue to qualify for the regional fund <e> <s> i believe that the highlands and islands have by european standards exceptional claims for community assistance and we shall continue to make that point <e>", "<cs> my lords we accept that it is also important both for rural wales and the assisted areas in devon and cornwall that they should continue to qualify for the regional fund <e> <s> we are pressing their cases in brussels as well <e> <s> but with the greatest respect i believe that the structural fund is another matter and i shall be very happy to deal with it or to write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords we are at the beginning of a process of negotiation and i am sure that this is a matter which will become clearer in the fullness of time at least i sincerely hope so <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the interesting suggestions that have been made <e> <s> i have great confidence in the work done by english estates in the north-east and the north-west and i see no further reason for us to expand on that <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> before we make a territorial tour of the entire nation may i also lay the claims of west sussex very firmly before your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret that on this occasion i cannot agree with the noble lord <e> <s> the government exhort people to have regard to the level of wage claims on the basis that those claims should in fact be earned <e> <s> over the past year or so the underlying level of average earnings has gone up by some per cent <e> <s> whereas inflation stands at some per cent <e> <s> so all have had a real increase of over per cent <e> <s> in their standard of living <e> <s> happily productivity has improved during that period to such an extent that unit wage costs have only increased by per cent <e> <s> and last year we actually earned the increases that we paid to ourselves <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that if one lesson has been learned over the course of this decade it is the general realisation that wage <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord <e> <s> the whole purpose of the review of social services payments now being undertaken is to get rid of or to eliminate as many of those marginal rates of tax as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord must begin to recognise that the philosophies that lie behind his question were the cause of our decline in the s and s <e> <s> it is only since we started to realise that we must first create the wealth before we can look at the distribution of it that we have seen the resurgence of the united kingdoms economy <e> <s> the actual average earnings percentage increase among all persons in the manufacturing sector was per cent <e> <s> and in the services sector per cent <e> <s> both contribute to the creation of wealth <e>", "<cs> my lords once again i fear that i cannot agree with the noble lord <e> <s> i suspect that if he were to go out and ask people today he would find that they recognise very clearly that the right kind of successful effort deserves a proper reward <e> <s> the general satisfaction with the way that the economy as a whole has been performing has rarely been higher than it is today <e>", "<cs> my lords i assume that the noble lord lord dean of beswick was not referring to the union negotiations with ford at dundee but to those in the south at dagenham <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord recollects as i do that the negotiations were about whether they would have a three-year or two-year agreement <e> <s> rates of pay did not figure prominently in the rejection <e>", "<cs> my lords the films act offers a framework within which the commercial film industry is developing successfully <e> <s> british screen finance limited which receives government funds under the terms of the films act in just over two years has supported over british feature and short films <e> <s> in addition projects have received government finance under the development scheme managed by the national film development fund <e>", "<cs> my lords i suspect that the greatest fiscal incentive towards the film industry has been the recent tax changes which the chancellor has been able to announce in the budget <e> <s> that is concerning the taxes on individuals <e> <s> i am sure that all in your lordships house will join with me in congratulating all those concerned with the making of the film the last emperor which won no fewer than nine oscars and which was british-funded without any help from the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not certain how much government policy comes into that but it is nevertheless true that despite the fact that attendances at cinemas have increased substantially over the past three years there is a continuing and ever-expanding demand for low-budget or medium-budget films for use on television and in other ways <e> <s> that is known as the market and i have little doubt that the demand will eventually be supplied by what the film producers make <e>", "<cs> my lords my information is that hill samuel was the body that put it together <e> <s> it arranged the funding <e> <s> i care little who puts the money in <e> <s> it was british-funded to that extent <e> <s> it is a matter for great congratulations <e> <s> if it shows one thing it is this <e> <s> the industry is very resourceful <e> <s> i am sure that it will find a way better than we can <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a matter very much for those concerned in running pinewood studios <e> <s> in my original answer i referred to the fact that british screen finance limited had supported with government assistance over british feature and short films over the past two years <e> <s> that seems to me a great contribution <e> <s> however where they are made depends on the circumstances at the time <e> <s> it may well be that costs in this country were too high for some of these films to be made here <e>", "<cs> my lords the tastes of the people of northampton are not precisely my tastes but i congratulate them nevertheless <e>", "<cs> my lords as this matter is a little wide of the original question i am not sure that my information is correct but i understand that we are still waiting for the report from the monopolies and mergers commission and therefore we must obviously wait to see what the detailed terms of that report are <e>", "<cs> my lords unfortunately my noble friend gave me a slight shock at the start of his question <e> <s> i believe that the passing of the films act which essentially deregulated the cinema in this country has been responsible in part for seeing attendances at the cinema increasing from million in to millions last year <e> <s> that figure is still going up <e> <s> i believe that the help we are giving now through british screen is probably the best targeted help that we could give to production <e> <s> we should let the market show us the best way in which we can support the industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly do not take away from that statement at all but the issue surely is whether or not government help will make it <e>", "<cs> my lords the response has been excellent since the january launch <e> <s> fifty-seven thousand requests have been received by phone or coupon for the enterprise initiative booklet of which some have now been distributed <e> <s> we are on course to achieve the target i set in the white paper of consultancy projects per month <e>", "<cs> my lords these are still early days <e> <s> of the applications we are processing just over half have been in marketing some per cent <e> <s> in design and some per cent <e> <s> in quality <e> <s> among the smaller amounts were for business planning and financial information systems which we have launched only recently <e> <s> all are significant areas in which smaller and medium-sized british companies can profit to some advantage in improving the quality design and marketing of their products <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not certain that it is not attractive to the large consultancy firms <e> <s> it is certainly attractive to the specialist consultancy firms <e> <s> as the original announcement made clear we have appointed principal contractors in each of the areas <e> <s> for example the institute of marketing is the principal contractor for all the marketing consultancies the design council is the principal contractor for the design council and is enterprise support is the principal contractor for those on business systems <e> <s> those firms are responsible for the lists of contractors and they contract with us <e> <s> they are also responsible for supervising the results <e>", "<cs> my lords although these are early days i can give the example that as a proportion the application in the north-west considerably outnumbers the number of companies in existence there <e> <s> i know that close to the noble lords heart is the cause of scotland <e> <s> some per cent <e> <s> of the applications so far received come from scotland <e> <s> i am not sure of the number of companies in scotland <e> <s> i shall inquire <e> <s> however i do not believe that we are much out of line <e>", "<cs> my lords not only by the department <e> <s> they will have to be vetted first by the design council the institute of marketing by pera and by the other main contractors <e> <s> that is part of their responsibility as specialists <e> <s> they must then be selected by the individual company which wants the consultancy <e> <s> in most cases they are paying either half or one-third of the actual costs and they will be severe critics of the output <e> <s> i have undertaken that we shall look at each complaint if we receive complaints about the output and the work of contractors <e> <s> if such cases exist then we shall in that way quickly compile a blacklist <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> this is one of the matters which the negotiations towards a single market will undertake that is to agree common standards for the whole of europe <e> <s> i hope that this will be one of the beneficiaries of such an agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords no it is my impression that such legislation would not be required <e> <s> some years ago my department gave limited support to interactive systems but without great success <e> <s> however i shall look into the matter and if i am wrong i shall write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the private sector and the market will develop cheaper ways of providing such services <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> approximately wide-band cable franchises wide-band cable is required for the purpose have been awarded <e> <s> so far are in operation <e> <s> there are approximately total subscribers in both wide and narrow-band cable facilities covering approximately million homes which are now capable of receiving the service <e> <s> the growth of cable has been slower than earlier expectations but one hopes that it will be faster in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords the estimates which have been made so far as to the economic effect of the single market in europe is that employment in europe will increase by some million <e> <s> there will he some million new jobs <e> <s> it is the determination of the government that as many of those jobs as possible should be within the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord would care to put down a specific question on that point i shall be more than happy to answer him <e> <s> of all the citizens of working age in the united kingdom no less that per cent <e> <s> are in paid employment <e> <s> throughout the rest of the community the figure is per cent <e> <s> in other words we have per cent <e> <s> more of our citizens in jobs <e> <s> surely that is the point on which we should be congratulating ourselves and that is what we would wish to maintain <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not only wage constraints we must also ensure that we make this country attractive for those who wish to invest in it particularly in areas in the north and in scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to assure the noble lord lord mason that it bodes very well for the nation <e> <s> the jobs we have are jobs which pay a salary or wage <e> <s> they are the important jobs to have <e> <s> the sort of jobs they are is very much a secondary matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble viscount that we help those firms through the enterprise initiative to look at important concepts such as quality design marketing manufacturing systems and now information systems and financial management <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> i am happy to go hack even further because the number of jobs has been rising since <e> <s> before the noble lord follows up with a supplementary question i understand that we lost a considerable number of jobs between and <e> <s> the point is that in many industries we lost jobs but the actual amount manufactured did not change <e> <s> i can do no more than remind the house of the example of bsc which still produces roughly the same amount of steel today while employing less than one-third of the people it used to <e>", "<cs> my lords if i had that information i should of course provide it <e> <s> however i am more than happy to write to the noble lord <e> <s> i think that perhaps the noble lord overlooks the fact that when employment increases to the level that it has in the united kingdom and especially when we find jobs for women on which only denmark can challenge our record then more of those jobs by their very nature have to be part time <e> <s> they are the types of job that many of our citizens are in fact looking for <e>", "<cs> my lords the proposed fur marking order has been notified under the normal gatt procedures to contracting parties which include canada <e> <s> in addition my honourable friend the minister for trade has met the canadian high commissioner and my departments officials have met a number of canadian government representatives to discuss their concerns <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to be able to confirm to my noble friend that we did not consult the canadian government before making the order for the simple reason that we have not as yet made the order <e> <s> what we have done is to go out to consultation <e> <s> we are considering the position and listening to what the consultations actually say <e> <s> the precise form of the order will be decided in the light of the response to the consultation letters <e> <s> the consultations have reinforced our view that there is widespread public concern about the use of the leghold trap <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that it is right that they should be looking towards the government of the united kingdom <e> <s> as regards leghold traps their use was prohibited in the united kingdom by the pests act <e> <s> there have been some developments towards the use of padded traps in canada <e> <s> all that the proposed order may well do is put a notice on furs that they have been caught using the leghold trap <e> <s> it is not proposed in any way to prohibit the sale of these furs <e>", "<cs> my lords this is in the process of consultation which is now going on <e> <s> we are looking at all the evidence that has been put to us <e> <s> we are informed that these traps are used in catching the majority of fur-bearing animals <e> <s> i shall be happy to listen to any representations which my noble friend would care to make to me or to my department <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> i cannot speak for other member states but we are not simply waiting for the commission to come forward with ideas in this important safety field <e> <s> we have planned a number of initiatives for this year including two new child safety booklets produced with the child accident prevention trust the annual fireworks campaign and a toy safety campaign in the run-up to christmas <e> <s> other safety campaigns will include material on child safety <e> <s> the voluntary safety organisations are also active in this area and i should like to pay tribute to their work <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly look to see what the position is at present <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> the discussions which have taken place between my officials and officials of other member states with the commission have led to a significant change in the commissions thinking on the position <e> <s> we are now awaiting its conclusions and until we hear what they are we cannot take the matter further <e> <s> in the meantime we are carrying on with our own efforts <e>", "<cs> my lords i hate ever to disagree with the noble baroness but it is the department of trade and industry <e> <s> we are for enterprise as i am sure are all in your lordships house <e> <s> the german presidency is planning to hold a consumer council on th or nd june and although that is some way distant i hope that these matters can be resolved in time for that <e> <s> if not we shall have to look again to see what is the position <e>", "<cs> my lords the joint treasury and stock exchange survey carried out in january and february this year estimated that million people owned shares per cent <e> <s> of the adult population <e> <s> this represents a threefold increase since <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to say that as far as we can tell the events of th october the day when all the stock markets around the world seemed to fall substantially have had no discernible impact <e> <s> it seems that smaller shareholders have proved to be good long-term investors <e>", "<cs> my lords frankly no <e> <s> i am sure the noble lord lord bruce of donington <e>", "<cs> my lords when i have the great pleasure of bringing to your lordships house the bill dealing with steel privatisation i shall look to the noble lord lord bruce for support even if that support is limited to those who are willing to invest funds <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord lord barnett that of course prudence in investment is as good as prudence in anything else in life <e> <s> however it is indeed good that those who work in companies should feel that they have some stake in the future of the company with which they can identify <e>", "<cs> my lords that could perhaps be evidence about scotland <e> <s> i do not see that it shows any evidence of the north-south divide <e> <s> looking at the figures of those people who own shares in this country it seems to me that they are spread throughout all income groups <e> <s> i hope that those in scotland have as much faith as those in the south in the future of the private sector <e>", "<cs> my lords at a time when the united kingdom is the second largest net overseas investor it does not behove us to look at those companies in this country which have foreign control <e> <s> if we were to do that we as a nation would suffer far more <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord may care to put down a question as that is another matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i perhaps have greater faith in the workings of the market <e> <s> if there is a demand for smaller shareholdings i suspect that we shall find people who will be ready willing and able to deal for such shareholders <e> <s> we shall have to see how the situation develops <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding is that i have answered two at the most <e> <s> since i have been unable to make up my mind which two of the three i have decided to pass <e>", "<cs> my lords i seem to recall a time when i had a certain reputation for statistics and i have no wish to re-invent that <e>", "<cs> my lords i look at the progress that these public utilities have made since denationalisation and i take great pride in that <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been an interesting discussion because we have ranged far wider perhaps than the terms of the amendment appeared to justify <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord lord taylor and the noble and learned lord lord wilson for accepting that constitutionally the amendment is correct <e> <s> the only point on which i would disagree with the noble and learned lord lord wilson is that it is in any way new <e> <s> the precedents go back some decades and it is one of the ways in which the government can make changes of this nature <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not propose at this stage to go into detail again on the principle of the bill <e> <s> we firmly believe that ending regional development grants and the system itself is the right decision <e> <s> it is a decision which must be set against the framework of promoting individual enterprise which we have established through the enterprise initiative <e> <s> it must also be looked at against the background of an improved and improving economy <e>", "<cs> my lords i hear what the noble lord says and i shall discuss the matter with my colleagues <e>", "<cs> my lords the amount for advertising and publicity during is still being discussed by my department <e> <s> if we go back years to the last year of the old era and up-rate the amount the government then spent on advertising by median inflation the figure comes to million <e> <s> excluding privatisations the budget for last year was million <e> <s> that answers the noble lords question <e>", "<cs> my lords the department is relying upon market forces <e> <s> if the noble lord cares to look at the white paper which i brought to your lordships house last january he will see that i said that close communications between my department and business will be improved by greater emphasis on marketing dti services and running clearly focused campaigns on issues relevant to business and to the dti <e> <s> i have today received details of a survey which shows that over per cent <e> <s> of businessmen think it right for my department to seek to spread best management practice in the ways that it is doing per cent <e> <s> is an extraordinarily high sample but i think that it is one with which we can rest content <e>", "<cs> my lords yes clearly <e> <s> the noble lord who rarely misses anything i say may have overlooked the fact that i was pointing out <e>", "<cs> my lords i suspect that the transport and general workers union received many warnings since ford had carefully considered other sites for this plant namely in spain portugal and austria before deciding to go to dundee <e> <s> part of the package which i am told attracted ford was the single union agreement with the aeu <e> <s> such was the way in which this matter developed that i suspect no warnings in the world would have changed the mind of the tgwu leadership <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much wish that that could be the case <e> <s> however we can only refer existing practices under the terms of the fair trading act and not threats for the future no matter what their nature <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a hypothetical situation <e> <s> however had such a threat been carried out i suspect it would have been open to anyone to refer the matter to the mmc or to ask for it to be considered <e> <s> should that unlikely situation ever arise i hope that it is referred to the mmc <e>", "<cs> my lords this is not an inter-union dispute <e> <s> it was quite clear that in this instance ford had agreed with a union to provide a factory <e> <s> what happened afterwards was that another union threatened that it would take action against the other plants of that company <e> <s> on that point i do not know what the government can do except to study the position <e> <s> if we can find a way through i have no doubt that my right honourable friend the secretary of state for employment will be taking steps <e>", "<cs> my lords though i am intrigued by the way in which the noble viscount puts this question we are talking of restrictive practices and they are not offences <e> <s> the question is whether this is a restrictive practice <e> <s> a restrictive practice does not become one until it actually comes into being <e>", "<cs> my lords what i suspect is needed is the peaceful introduction of single union agreements <e> <s> i suspect that all members of your lordships house will agree with the noble lord in that <e> <s> when it comes to ascribing blame for the unfortunate occurrences which cost about jobs in dundee it seems fairly clear to those who live in dundee where the blame lies <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his compliment as i interpret it <e> <s> it is not even so much for the courts but for the company itself <e> <s> it was ford that became aware of what the working conditions would be like it was therefore ford that decided in the circumstances it had no option but to withdraw <e>", "<cs> my lords those tears are not crocodile tears they are real times or more <e> <s> in this instance it is not a matter for the government but very much one for the tuc <e> <s> there has been enough time some five months for the tuc to deliver <e> <s> i hope very much that it will do so before another five months pass <e>", "<cs> my lords there are many examples of inward investors who have invested in this country successfully and with single company agreements <e> <s> in the particular case of ford the company was bringing a new plant to an existing infrastructure of many plants in this country <e> <s> that becomes very difficult when it is alleged that the transport and general workers union threatens certain action <e> <s> but this should not deter new investors in this country <e> <s> they have found that even without government assistance it is by far the best country in europe in which to invest <e>", "<cs> my lords that may be some comfort to the lawyers <e> <s> but the great test here is ford <e> <s> ford decided that the threat was real enough so it withdrew <e>", "<cs> my lords i suspect that it is a matter of interpretation if not by the lawyers then certainly by the courts whether a threat of a restrictive practice is in fact a restrictive practice <e> <s> it is my advice that it has to come into being before it exists <e> <s> until then the fair trading act does not apply <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will allow me i believe that these corrections at the end of the year have been taking place since time immemorial <e> <s> the process has to do with the way the figures are collated and does not arise because of reductions in government staff <e>", "<cs> my lords i said that we are still as much as per cent <e> <s> behind some of our major competitors <e> <s> i did not seek to hide that <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i believe that i speak on behalf of all in your lordships house when i say that the debate has lived up to the promise foreshadowed by my noble friend lord joseph in his original contribution <e> <s> we have had a long but interesting and discursive debate in which i would agree with the noble lord lord peston politics has not appeared unnecessarily <e> <s> of course politics is always there because we are talking about essentially political matters <e>", "<cs> my lords this is not the occasion to enter into a debate on training <e> <s> however i would argue with the noble lord because i feel very strongly that today training is much more relevant to the world of the future than the training that existed in the late s <e> <s> at that time in the main the spend went down

honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer to provide an abbreviated version of those accounts but i suspect that there will be those who will object <e>", "<cs> my lords companies will have to prepare the normal set of annual accounts which will be filed at the companys registration office and will be open for inspection in the normal way <e> <s> we shall shortly be publishing a consultative document detailing the proposed regulations that will be issued <e> <s> that will show that companies may be able to consult their shareholders to decide which form of accounts they should then issue <e> <s> of course it will always be possible for shareholders to receive the full form of accounts either by application to the company or to the companys registration office <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a matter that all listed companies indeed all companies should take into account in order to have better relationships between all who work in the company <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> companies will still be issuing full sets of accounts but such has been the growth in numbers of shareholders over the last few years that the burden on many large ex-nationalised industries the privatised companies is such that they will be happy if their shareholders so wish to issue a short form of accounts <e> <s> should there be anything wrong in the accounts and should the auditors have to qualify <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very happy on this occasion to agree with my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords the appreciation of the yen and efforts by the japanese authorities to boost imports have greatly improved the prospects for exports to japan <e> <s> british exports rose per cent <e> <s> in sterling value in and given the right approach on the part of

difficult market but do not appreciate the potential that it now has <e> <s> japan now has the highest <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as scotch whisky is concerned i have reason to believe that the barriers or tariffs which have existed for some years will be disappearing during the course of this summer <e> <s> i believe we shall find that the japanese authorities will be responding to the gatt panel and that the discriminatory taxes against scotch whisky will be disappearing even though there may be some difference in taxes between locally produced drinks and scotch whisky <e>", "<cs> in japan <e> <s> i have great hopes of prompting the sales effort <e> <s> unfortunately i was not able to visit scotland <e>", "<cs> of course my lords <e> <s> only a few months ago the japanese authorities admitted four more british companies to the japanese stock exchange <e> <s> i believe we are now seeing the opportunities available in japan and that we shall see the barriers disappear as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i gladly pay great tribute to my noble friends activities as chairman of the group which has been promoting trade with japan so strongly over the last year or two <e> <s> i pay further tribute to his perseverance in asking me yet again about a matter that we discussed not very long ago <e> <s> i told my noble friend then that i should be happy to consider that matter in some detail very shortly <e> <s> i was not happy nor should any member of your lordships house be happy with the knowledge that the universities only produce some graduates in japanese a year <e> <s> that does not seem to be a very satisfactory number <e> <s> i have since been made aware of a number of polytechnics and further education institutions around the country which are training people in the japanese language but what we need as a matter of urgency is to have more of our businessmen fluent in japanese <e>", "<cs> my lords i am unable to speak for the american government but representatives of the british government have been to japan <e> <s> my right honourable and learned friend the foreign secretary was there in january <e> <s> i was there in march <e> <s> we are

compliments that he paid to my noble friend lord whitelaw <e> <s> i agree with every word that he said about my noble friend <e> <s> the second concerns the way in which he said that this was an agreeable statement <e> <s> surely no statement that has been made to your lordships house could be more agreeable than the simple fact that billion will now be paid off the national debt <e> <s>

confirmed that it remains his intention to reduce personal and direct taxation as and when it is prudent to do so <e> <s> inflation must remain the first priority but happily today we have expenditure totals that enable progress to be made in the reduction of taxation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord diamond <e> <s> it occurs to me that his definition of an economy that is out of control may well he accurate when seen from his benches <e> <s> that may well be so because i am not an authority on what the view is like from the noble lords benches <e> <s> if one goes

see some of these improvements coming through <e>", "<cs> my lords it was not a red herring <e> <s> what we are discussing here is the quality of service of the post office and not some treasury

consumer credit represents only some per cent <e> <s> and credit cards less than per cent <e> <s> i shall repeat the answer that i gave to the noble lord lord ezra <e> <s> expenditure on imported durables is about one-tenth of consumer spending <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for offering me help in answering the question but i fear that i cannot agree with him <e> <s> the imbalance in the balance of payment figures shows that there is enormous expenditure on capital equipment semi-manufactured goods and raw materials <e> <s> expenditure on capital equipment by industry has increased by some per cent <e> <s> if we analyse the spending we find that although consumer spending has increased it forms only a small part of the increased indebtedness funded and fuelled by mortgages <e>", "<cs> my lords that point is some way from the question <e> <s> i shall write to the noble lord to show how those figures are analysed and place a copy of the answer in the library <e>", "<cs> my lords i hate to date myself so precisely but the time to which the noble lord referred when i was at school was during the war <e> <s> the circumstances were perhaps slightly different <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to inform your lordships that it was the second world war <e> <s> i shall certainly draw the attention of my right honourable friend the secretary of state for

ordinary course of events we cannot expect to be armed with knowledge of every single occurrence in every possible area <e> <s> if my noble friend will merely do as i ask and put down a question on the order paper i am absolutely certain that he will receive an answer that will satisfy him and your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the assistance that the noble lord lord bruce of donington has given me and for the incidental information that he has given to your lordships house about the occurrences at the agriculture ministers meeting yesterday <e> <s> however i said that my right honourable friend the prime minister intended to put this matter to the next council of ministers meeting in march <e> <s> i believe that to be the proper place for this matter to be raised and there it will be raised <e>", "<cs> i am sympathetic to the principles behind these amendments <e> <s> i believe that we should and do have regard to the reputation of individuals and for that matter companies and firms who may be affected by an investigation or inquiry <e> <s> it is our policy to conduct investigations in a way which so far as possible does not unduly damage the business or other affairs of the persons or companies concerned <e> <s> we recognise that damage can be caused simply by the announcement of my departments investigations which is why as a matter of policy section of the companies act and sections and financial service investigations which do not lead to a publishable report are not normally announced <e> <s> the current policy is set out in my departments booklet <e>", "<cs> the difficulty arises in that there is a wide spectrum of cases <e> <s> however there is no need to write into any statute that we must act fairly because i am labouring under a general duty to do so <e> <s> that requirement exists and it is fundamental <e>", "<cs> i fear that my explanation was not as clear as it should have been <e> <s> we propose that we do not announce for that very good reason namely that we do not put people under a burden and then later on my department has to say that they are clear <e> <s> there may well be cases in which we cannot say that for reasons of taking further proceedings or there may be further cases where we cannot say that there is no evidence because there may be evidence but it is insufficient for further action to be taken <e> <s> when all things are considered i hope that members of the committee will feel that this is fairer in a very difficult and imperfect world <e>", "<cs> i confess that i suffer occasional disappointment at the hands of the noble lord lord williams of elvel and the knowledge that his sympathies do not lie with this side of the committee comes as a slight blow but i shall learn to live with it <e>", "<cs> perhaps i should first describe how decisions to appoint inspectors are taken <e> <s> the practice of my department is to approach the persons considered to be the most suitable for a particular investigation since investigations vary considerably <e> <s> in the normal event a lawyer and accountant are appointed although in many cases suitably qualified persons from other walks of life could be considered should the need arise <e> <s> lists are kept by the investigations division of the names of suitable legal and accounts candidates and those lists are regularly updated <e>", "<cs> the costs incurred by persons required to assist inspectors under section of the companies act have nearly always been met by the person so required on the principle that inspectors should not have to pay to receive evidence <e> <s> this amendment seeks to clarify that situation <e> <s> however i must resist the amendment partly because i believe it is unnecessary and partly because it may cast doubt on the position in other cases where no <e>", "<cs> i am under a great deal of difficulty because the noble lord speaks about justice and decency in terms that i find difficult to recognise <e> <s> the costs incurred by persons required to produce books and documents to inspectors and to attend before inspectors under the terms of section have always been met by the person so required <e>", "<cs> on looking at the report of inspectors it is the responsibility of the holder of my office to decide whether or not to take any further action in the sense of forwarding the matter to the prosecuting authority <e> <s> that is something which the holder of my office would normally do <e>", "<cs> if new information came to light after the investigation had been closed the matter would go to the prosecuting authority only at the end of the investigation and if it were in the public interest to reinvestigate the affairs of the company then i or the holder of my office would consider appointing inspectors to carry out a new investigation <e> <s> in those circumstances i suspect that that would be the more appropriate action <e>", "<cs> in those circumstances which would be slightly extreme it would be open to the holder of my office to reappoint the same persons as inspectors so that they could carry on <e> <s> perhaps i may explain how i see the existing power in the bill operating <e> <s> i would expect that an investigation would be stopped or curtailed only if there were no reason to go on with it once the matters suggesting a criminal offence had been uncovered and passed to the relevant prosecuting authority in other words it had come to the end of the road for the investigation <e> <s> because of that the subsequent decision not to prosecute would not alter the fact that there had been no good reason to continue with the investigation <e> <s> indeed if it were reopened it would only be for the purpose of going through the motions and would be a waste of both time and resources <e> <s> the decision whether to have a report or to publish it is a separate matter <e>", "<cs> clause makes a minor amendment to section of the companies act <e> <s> section confers on the secretary of state the power to bring civil proceedings on behalf of any body corporate if on the basis of the results of an investigation he thinks that there are grounds for doing so in the public interest <e>", "<cs> i do not <e>", "<cs> it is rather more than a third of a century since i last studied law <e> <s> in those days it was always my impression that commas in legislation did not exist <e> <s> the matter was one for interpretation by the courts <e>", "<cs> mental commas as well as physical commas <e> <s> i hope that noble lords opposite who still practise law will give me some support for that simple assertion <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord mishcon who no doubt recalls far better than i that the act was a consolidating measure and of course the provision was in place before that <e> <s> before addressing the effect of this amendment i should like briefly to explain our intention in bringing forward clause <e> <s> it is intended to give the secretary of state more discretion on whether to appoint inspectors <e> <s> the amendment would not change the current position where the secretary of state is required to appoint inspectors and where the application is made under section unless he is satisfied that the application is vexatious <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble lord lord mishcon and i particularly appreciate his desire to rescue me although in this particular case i must look with some care at he who is throwing the line towards me <e> <s> certainly i have listened to the noble lord with interest <e> <s> whether the bill at this point refers to documents or to books and documents we do not consider to be of great consequence <e> <s> it might help the noble lord if i were to remind him that the word documents is defined in subsection of the new section to include information recorded in any form so it covers both <e> <s> the other references are similarly defined <e> <s> of course definitions are already used for this purpose in sections and of the financial services act <e>", "<cs> as i am sure the noble lord knows it is not necessary for us to keep possession of books or papers of which possession is taken under the search and entry provisions of section of companies act for a period longer than three months unless criminal proceedings are commenced <e> <s> i fear that if we were to do this it might be a burden for inspectors to have to store what will end up to be although not a small mountain of paper perhaps a considerable one <e> <s> i can see little or no advantage in replacing the three-month period over which documents may be kept with an indefinite period linked to the life of an investigation <e> <s> we have to balance the rights of those subject to investigations and the need to ensure the effectiveness of the investigations <e> <s> it would be hard to justify holding on to the papers for the life of the investigation as it would only marginally improve the effectiveness of the investigation if at all <e> <s> it is of course possible for copies to be taken <e> <s> if copies are taken and the originals returned that does not in any way release the person from the duty to produce the documents again if required <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for his admission of guilt in general if not in the particular <e> <s> on this matter we are agreed on both sides of the committee that it is important that standards of integrity in public life are maintained <e> <s> it is important that public bodies should be able to take disciplinary action against any member of staff who for example is found to have taken insufficient care to protect market-sensitive information <e> <s> this is very much in the interests of maintaining the high standards of conduct and probity that the public expect of officials when they hold sensitive information in the course of their duties <e>", "<cs> i should like to amplify my earlier remarks <e> <s> if there is any question of criminal matters that is outside this provision <e> <s> we are talking only about disciplinary proceedings <e> <s> i gave an example where an investigation under the financial services act revealed that there was no evidence of an offence by the officials or that the evidence was not strong enough to take to court but that there was a <e>", "<cs> i suppose that civil servants have been known to leave documents in trains indeed ministers have been known to leave documents in restaurants and similar mistakes have been made <e> <s> these things do happen <e>", "<cs> i listened very carefully to the noble lord <e> <s> i recognise that a proposal which seeks to limit or make exceptions to a protection in law or a privilege is one which needs to be justified <e> <s> perhaps i may now provide that justification <e> <s> i am conscious that the relationship between a banker and his customer is important and that confidentiality is important in that relationship <e> <s> i suspect that both the noble lord and i had banker written on our <e>", "<cs> i should say to the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran that we consider the present provisions of the companies act and the financial services act are insufficient for enabling inspectors to get at all the relevant facts in some cases <e> <s> in a few cases the inadequacies of the present provisions have enabled those required to provide information or documents to delay and frustrate the progress of investigations <e> <s> i shall give the committee an example <e> <s> at present there is a specific power in the companies act enabling inspectors appointed under that act to require a director to provide information from his bank accounts <e> <s> if those are out of the country or otherwise unobtainable it appears there is little the inspectors can do to gain access to what might be crucial information in an investigation <e>", "<cs> i can understand the concern that members of the committee may well have about possible fishing expeditions <e> <s> however i do not consider that the so-called necessary qualification is appropriate <e> <s> such a test may prevent investigators from gaining access to information which could be pivotal to their investigation but which at the time of their application for the secretary of state to authorise a requirement on a bank cannot be shown to be really needed <e>", "<cs> i understand what the noble lord lord williams has said <e> <s> however i should like to put on record that the wording of the current provision is based on that used in the criminal justice act <e> <s> to that extent we are not pushing back the frontiers of banking confidentiality beyond where they already exist in other legislative areas <e> <s> i should like the noble lord to bear that point in mind when he considers the matter <e>", "<cs> section of the financial services act enables me to appoint inspectors to investigate possible insider dealing offences <e> <s> in contrast with other investigatory powers the express purpose of insider dealing investigations is to find out whether an offence of a specific category has been committed <e> <s> i attach great importance to ensuring that such investigations are carried out as quickly as possible consistent with their being carried out effectively and fairly <e> <s> in such circumstances it can be advantageous to limit the duration of the investigation and to restrict the scope of the investigation for example dealing in certain shares between certain dates in order to ensure that the investigation is targeted and that the possible insider dealing offence can be dealt with quickly <e>", "<cs> i suspect that the noble lord is more confident in dealing with that legislation from memory than i am in dealing with it in front of me <e> <s> if he is prepared to withdrawn the amendment i shall consider the matter <e> <s> there are a number of minor technical amendments which will have to be dealt with at a later stage as i said to the noble lord lord mishcon and i shall consider the matter in conjunction with those amendments <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble lord lord mishcon and all members of the committee will understand if i deal with this point which i consider to be very important at a little greater length than i would otherwise do but i believe that for the consideration of the bill at all its stages it would be as well to have these matters on the record <e>", "<cs> if i may i shall deal first with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> this amendment would remove the gateway for disclosure to the treasury of restricted information obtained by virtue of the new powers of investigation <e>", "<cs> the amendment would remove the proposed power in subsection for the secretary of state to amend by order the table in subsection of authorities and functions to which the disclosure gateway in subsection b applies <e>", "<cs> i say to my noble friend that i understand the reluctance with which parliament quite rightly would give to ministers the power to vary the orders and legislation <e> <s> i say to the noble lord lord lloyd that similar order-making powers exist in the financial services act the companies act and the banking act <e> <s> however they refer to specific matters covered in those acts <e> <s> here we are looking at the changes required for these gateways <e>", "<cs> i should remind my noble friend that at the end of the day the only decision as to whether or not the share of the market has increased is not made by the boards of companies but by their customers and the demand for the goods and the quality of the goods that they manufacture and hopefully sell <e> <s> i have the greatest admiration for the mmc but i should hate to think that it had to decide the likely future sales of any product <e> <s> however my noble friend is entitled to his view <e> <s> i suspect that he has as much chance of converting me as i have in the long run of converting him <e>", "<cs> that is another question but i agree with the noble lord <e> <s> i have some difficulty in deciding exactly what a junk bond is <e> <s> i suspect that it is something that is always recognised in hindsight rather than beforehand <e> <s> however i am happy to say that the tide has turned in the united states and the prevailing fashion for that type of operation seems to have passed <e> <s> certainly it does not seem to have come to the united kingdom in anything like the same shape or size as it has taken place in the united states <e>", "<cs> i shall say without any fear of disagreement from either side of the committee that i know absolutely nothing about economics even today <e> <s> i shall not therefore contest that matter <e> <s> i say it as a matter of some pride <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord lord peston will admit that there is a certain incentive to boards of directors which fear that they might be in receipt of an unwelcome bid at least to sharpen their performance <e> <s> insulation from that is not what our economic life should be about <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the noble lord lord williams <e> <s> however my noble friend lord wolfson mentioned shareholders <e> <s> in my position i have to balance a great number of different interests <e> <s> i wished to ensure that all members of the committee were aware that the interests of shareholders were very truly one of those <e>", "<cs> does the noble lord agree that agreed mergers can be just as anticompetitive as contested mergers <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord can elucidate and tell the committee how it helps to build up the manufacturing base by asking the monopolies and mergers commission to look at or bids a year or by asking the office of fair trading to look in considerably more detail at of the bids a year <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord does not follow me <e> <s> i understand the point about the criterion but how does it help to build up the manufacturing base <e> <s> what test can the monopolies and mergers commission carry out to ensure that somehow firms will be made more competitive and their products will sell more widely <e>", "<cs> i reassure the noble lord lord peston that i have an open mind <e> <s> surely he should have learnt that from my claim not to be an economist but that is something else <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble lord will accept that i cannot have regard to the test without actually examining it <e> <s> in effect that would mean the director general would have to apply the same rigorous examination as the mmc <e> <s> we must also remember that the mmc consisting of a panel of people which varies from time to time has been decided in the past by your lordships house to be the most suitable body to apply the test <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may help the noble lord lord peston <e> <s> i am aware indeed we are all aware of the public interest test that the monopolies and mergers commission will apply in due course <e> <s> i have said in the past that the job of the director general of fair trading and indeed my job as well is to act almost as a magistrates court to see whether there is a case to answer and purely that <e> <s> if there appears <e>", "<cs> no i said at the beginning that we have regard to section all the way through <e> <s> the job of the director general is to see whether there is a <e>", "<cs> if it were to do what happens now then it is clearly unnecessary <e> <s> my view is that it asks us to do more than we are doing now <e>", "<cs> the prenotification system is designed to facilitate the process of examining mergers especially for the vast majority of mergers where it is clear at an early stage that a reference would not be justified <e> <s> it will enable parties to know what they have to do and what information to provide and if they meet the necessary conditions once the period for considering the merger has expired i will no longer have the power to refer it <e> <s> it will give the office of fair trading the information that it needs to decide quickly which mergers raise no competition or other problems and advise me accordingly or which need further examination with a view to a possible reference <e>", "<cs> this point will come into being later on <e> <s> companies can start to acquire more shares and then find themselves in a merger situation or it could be determined later that they were in a merger situation without necessarily realising it <e>", "<cs> to be successful the prenotification system must offer prenotifiers the certainty of a decision from the authorities within a time-scale which is as short and as firm as possible <e> <s> the director general needs sufficient time to consider whether in the light of the available facts a merger should be referred for full consideration by the monopolies and mergers commission <e> <s> but the longer the time allowed to the director general the less attractive voluntary prenotification becomes to the companies concerned which will not use the system if it does not offer any advantage in terms of time <e> <s> a careful balance needs to be struck between these two requirements if voluntary prenotification is to be workable <e>", "<cs> yes it can be extended for an indefinite period <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will withdraw the amendment i shall look not only at the working day point but also at extensions more than once <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble lord will take this as an example of how open my mind is today <e>", "<cs> this amendment would change the definition of a working day for the purposes of the prenotification system so that it excluded bank holidays in any part of great britain rather than bank holidays in england and wales <e> <s> at first sight this appears to be a sensible amendment but i hope to explain why it is unnecessary and in this case even undesirable <e>", "<cs> i hope that my noble friend will understand if i say to him that i suspect that the amendment which he has moved is neither modest nor i fear does it in our view improve the bill <e> <s> it is obviously essential for the proper operation of the prenotification system for the authorities to be able to rely on information which they are given by applicants <e> <s> that is why we have provided that a clearance will be invalidated if any information given whether in the original notice or otherwise is false or misleading and why we have given the director general of fair trading power to reject a notice where he suspects false or misleading information to have been given <e> <s> however it is also essential if business is to have confidence in the system that once a merger has been cleared it should not be possible to reopen it without good reason <e>", "<cs> yes you must not just smell a rat nor must you catch it you must at least see it <e>", "<cs> the fundamentals of the pre-notification system are set out in new sections a to c in clause <e> <s> we consider it appropriate for the details of the system-how prior notice will be given how it will be rejected how it will be withdrawn and when prior notice will be treated as received or rejected to be dealt with by secondary legislation <e> <s> it is after all a new procedure which has to stand the test of time <e>", "<cs> the first of these new clauses would mean that the monopolies and mergers commission would have to concern itself with competition not just in the united kingdom but also in the european community <e> <s> there is nothing wrong with being concerned about competition at the community level <e> <s> we are after all committed to a programme to reduce barriers to trade to which the noble lord lord ezra kindly referred a moment ago and trade within the community will further open up opportunities for competition <e>", "<cs> i shall confine my remarks to this amendment although i suspect that what i say may have utility in other amendments <e> <s> i fear that the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran misunderstood what i said <e> <s> he is of course perfectly entitled to question any amendment <e> <s> we want to improve the workings of the bill <e> <s> i accept that totally <e> <s> i should be the first to accept any amendment which improved the workings of the bill <e>", "<cs> that is precisely the point <e> <s> we are concerned with competition in the relevant market <e> <s> the test of that competition is the particular consumer concerned be he a man a woman or an industrial company <e> <s> so if we added the words european economic community to the amendment they would confuse the issue <e>", "<cs> yes i accept that <e> <s> our writ of course only runs within the united kingdom <e> <s> the test of competition only applies within the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> i fear that i cannot even listen to the seductive words of the noble lord lord ezra about that merger <e> <s> my mind must remain completely blank until such time as i hear from the monopolies and mergers commission <e>", "<cs> i suspect that this is a debate that we may well have again on a later amendment <e> <s> perhaps it is as well to ventilate the matter now <e> <s> the united kingdom is subject to the requirements of the treaty of rome <e> <s> the treaty is paramount it includes provisions designed to preserve competition throughout the european community <e>", "<cs> i boasted to the noble lord lord peston about having an open mind <e> <s> even though i do not agree with him on this occasion my mind is still open <e>", "<cs> i should say to the noble lord lord peston at the outset that i have nothing against the idea of obtaining representations from consumer

situations a year <e> <s> sometimes these are mergers arising from bids and are contested situations <e> <s> many are friendly mergers <e> <s> some are what are described probably incorrectly as creeping mergers where the shareholding goes up until at some stage the director general decides that there is sufficient influence on it that a merger situation arises <e> <s> to be forced to go to

others shares by parties to a merger which had been referred to the mmc eight to cases per year as long as there was a continuing investigation under the provisions of the companies act or the financial services act <e> <s> indeed it appears my noble friend wants to curtail all takeovers of or by companies which are the subject of such investigations <e> <s> the prohibition would apply to the bidder company and to the target company <e>", "<cs> before the lord sits down i should like to point out that as the law now stands if an investigation produces new evidence i have the power to send it back to the monopolies and mergers commission within six months of receiving the evidence <e>", "<cs> perhaps my noble friend will give way <e> <s> in that event if the investigation shows that something wrong has been entered into and i shall not define wrong exactly but my noble friend knows what i mean and benefit has been gained from that then i have the power to refer that back to the monopolies and mergers commission <e> <s> what my noble friend or any amendment similar to his might ask me to do would apply if the target company or the bidding company or parties entirely unconnected with the transaction were being investigated <e> <s> that would clearly be wrong <e> <s> therefore i have the power to refer back in the event that the aggressor company is doing something wrong <e> <s> in any other circumstances it would not be right to take that sort of step <e>", "<cs> the new subsections introduced into section of the fair trading act by this clause would prohibit parties to a merger which i refer to the monopolies and mergers commission from acquiring each others shares except with my consent <e> <s> the prohibition is designed to prevent the build up of holdings which might prejudice the outcome of the mmc inquiry it would come into operation when a prospective merger was referred and would last for the duration of the inquiry <e>", "<cs> my lords it is true that imports accounted for per cent <e> <s> of the market last year compared with only per cent <e> <s> for <e> <s> the reason for that was the unparalleled prosperity and growth in demand <e>

investment <e> <s> we are concerned about the amount of investment in british industry and the jobs and wealth creation which that actually creates <e> <s> whether that investment is provided by

its investigations into different sites within the united kingdom <e> <s> i hope that the company will find a site which will be suitable for its purposes because it would be most welcome within these shores <e>", "<cs> my lords it is true that the ford motor company has decided to move the assembly of one model from the united kingdom to belgium <e> <s> however at the same time the company decided to expand substantially the manufacture of engines within the principality something to which the noble lord the leader of the opposition cannot object too strongly <e> <s> it is a great pity that the number of british manufactured cars has fallen over the past two decades <e> <s> that is largely because the cars which were produced were not attractive to the customers <e> <s> that is a lesson which i believe we have learnt today <e> <s> in and we were manufacturing cars per year last year the figure exceeded million and i believe that the number will continue to climb very substantially <e> <s> therefore we are on a rising trend and it is important that we should keep it that way <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly pass the remarks made by the noble lord lord ezra to my right honourable friend the secretary of state for transport and i may share them <e>", "<cs> my lords that is one of the ways in which the motor industry has changed over the past years and in which it is becoming internationalised <e> <s> many car companies including ford and others manufacture different components in different parts of europe and assemble them here <e> <s> it is becoming increasingly

greater clarity <e> <s> no formal notification of proceedings has been received from the commission when we do receive notification we shall of course consider it carefully <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we should put this into perspective because it applies to so much of our record within the european community <e> <s> when the commission issued the directive we were the first nation in the community to implement it <e> <s> when before christmas no doubt as part of its housekeeping the commission issued a press release confirming that proceedings were to be taken against of the

way to be contemptuous of anyone in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord lord williams of elvel who is most helpful as ever <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the first step should be for the commission to tell us in what respects it is not happy with the act <e> <s> i look forward to receiving a communication from the commission rather than just a press release <e>", "<cs> my lords before i move that the house do resolve itself into a committee perhaps i may offer an apology to the noble lord lord williams of elvel <e> <s> i understand that a <e>",

though in my own experience i have not put it into effect in the chamber <e> <s> i shall certainly look at all these points <e> <s> but as i have said the first matter is to look at the consultative document and the reponses that we get to it <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord williams will i am sure forgive me for remarking that this set of amendments bears a striking similarity to amendments that he put forward during the passage of the financial services act two and a half years ago <e> <s> i am sorry to have to tell the committee that in consequence my remarks will have a familar ring <e> <s> the reason for this is quite simple the noble lord lord williams was misguided on that <e>", "<cs> the noble lord should listen to my reply before he draws conclusions <e>", "<cs> in listening to the very interesting debate on the amendment put forward by the noble lord lord williams of elvel i very much regretted the absence of the noble lord lord stevens of ludgate whose wise counsels on this day would have been very welcome to your lordships committee <e> <s> i regret even more the sad reason for his absence today <e>", "<cs> the amendment tabled by the noble lords lord williams lord peston and lord lloyd would by its operation destroy the modification to section of the financial services act which i announced last november <e> <s> it may be convenient therefore if i say a little about our reasons for proposing this modification <e> <s> section is <e>", "<cs> i hope not to have that experience but we shall see <e> <s> we incorporated the definition in secondary legislation first because it is more amendable to change and secondly our proposed definition would be for limited purposes only <e> <s> i believe that it will deal with the legitimate anxieties expressed by my noble friend lord lucas of chilworth <e>", "<cs> it is self-evident professional investors are professional investors and private investors are private investors <e> <s> however i hope that the rules which we bring forward at the time of secondary legislation will define the terms <e> <s> they tend to vary from individual market to individual market <e>", "<cs> i assume that a private investor is covered by section in his investment in that unit trust <e> <s> the unit trust itself in its operations in the market will surely be a professional investor <e>", "<cs> i can give a categorical assurance to the committee that should the occasion arise i would certainly buy a used car from my noble friend <e> <s> i am grateful to him for his description because it encapsulates what we are talking about <e>", "<cs> my lords these are matters being considered by my department <e> <s> there are matters which might possibly affect prosecution they are being investigated at the present time <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> a copy was sent to that body during the consideration of the bid as was a copy of an interim report which i asked the current inspectors to produce for the monopolies and mergers commissions consideration <e> <s> i should confirm to your lordships house that the report does not criticise minorco in any way <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord williams of elvel will readily concede that the wording is that of the mmc it is not mine <e> <s> i understand that the report was seen by monopolies and mergers commission officials who concluded that it had no relevance to their current enquiries <e> <s> they reported that fact orally to members of the commission <e> <s> that was a decision for them <e> <s> that is what happened <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> that is a matter for those who consider whether prosecution would be appropriate in this case <e>", "<cs> my lords the simple reason is that we have imported more goods from the community <e>", "<cs> my lords it is true in the three months to january exports of manufacturers were some per cent <e> <s> higher than a year ago <e> <s> if we look back over the past five years it is also true that imports from the european community have nearly doubled <e> <s> they have gone up from billion to billion but exports to the community have just doubled from billion to billion <e> <s> we are seeing a continuing rise in the value of our exports to the community but also a continuing increase although at a slightly lower rate <e>", "<cs> my lords almost half of our trade now is with the european community <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear i cannot agree with the noble lord <e> <s> indeed on the last visit which representatives of the cbi paid to me a few months ago they said that they totally supported the governments policy even if it meant maintaining the current interest rates and the value of the pound as they saw that the first priority must be to control inflation <e> <s> indeed there is now considerable evidence that many countries are moving manufacturing capability to this country for example japan germany and many other countries <e> <s> therefore i believe that there is nothing to fear for the future other than that we should redouble our efforts to continue to manufacture the sort of goods which will export <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> perhaps i may make a fundamental point about our present balance of payments deficit <e> <s> only a quarter of the growth consists of imports of consumer goods which include cars <e> <s> the balance consists of raw materials semi-finished intermediate manufactured goods and capital goods <e> <s> there we have evidence that british industry is gearing itself up once again at a higher level <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly obtain that figure write to the noble lord and place the information in the library <e>", "<cs> my lords last time i looked at the figures the value of the pound was slightly lower against the deutschemark <e> <s> however at the end of the day the government do not manufacture goods our companies manufacture goods <e> <s> at the end of the day it is up to british industry to manufacture goods which sell not only at home but overseas <e> <s> if we look back at the s the s and early s when we lost our share of manufactured goods it was not so much down to the government as to the quality and design of the goods <e>", "<cs> my lords under the treaty of rome there are restrictions on what the government should do and indeed whether they should do anything in that regard other than the programmes which they carry out today to encourage the spread of quality manufacturing systems by emphasis on design and on the many matters on which british industry should concentrate if it is to regain its markets both at home and overseas <e>", "<cs> my lords the question did not concern forecasts <e> <s> i shall look at the figures <e> <s> we have a substantial balance of payments deficit in manufactured goods with the community <e> <s> of course we have a considerable surplus in invisibles with the community and as our exports are continuing to grow that element of the growth will come out of manufactured goods <e>", "<cs> my lords sitting where i sit it seems that the best way to reverse the deficit we have with the european community is for our <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord will study <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord will forgive me for intervening <e> <s> on those three pieces of legislation we were of course concerned to protect members of the general public <e> <s> in this instance we are looking at how the auditors report to the shareholders of a company in respect of their own interests <e> <s> i suspect that the test is different <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not entirely agree with the noble lord lord diamond when he said that any amendment introduced by my noble friend lord caldecote and the noble lord lord ezra need scarcely even be read although i did agree with the point which he put to me subsequently <e> <s> i could disagree even less when the noble lord lord williams joined in the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i might ask my noble friend whether he knows from his own experience of any board of a large public company or of any form of plc for that matter that would voluntarily risk having qualified accounts <e> <s> if not then surely the statutory requirement would give no added protection at all <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord lord williams of elvel offered a very good red herring and i must congratulate him on this <e> <s> however while there was an ssap about current cost accounting there were still statutory requirements on companies at that period to produce their accounts in the normal way <e> <s> there was an additional set of accounts <e> <s> i suspect that it would not be seen as non-regard to ssap it would be seen as a method of qualifying accounts and i am sure would have been seen by everyone as a more serious breach <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment is similar to a number of amendments that were discussed in committee and relates to an issue which is the subject of one of the recommendations of the dearing committee <e> <s> the amendment would lay a duty on the directors of a company to have regard to all relevant accounting standards in preparing the companys individual accounts <e> <s> as noble lords will be aware the dearing recommendation goes further in one important respect <e> <s> it proposes that in the case of all large companies the directors should be required to state in the notes to the annual accounts whether these are drawn up in accordance with applicable accounting standards and to draw attention to any material departures <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has developed his argument somewhat further than he did at the committee stage <e> <s> i hope we agree that the bill does not need to repeat the seventh directive word for word in order to give proper effect to it <e> <s> if we were to do so we must take into account the differing legal and administrative frameworks and cultures of each member state <e> <s> were each member to follow precisely and slavishly the wording of the directive it is highly unlikely that the objective of a common framework could be reached given the differing legal environments <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord mottistone for recognising the governments attempt to get this right <e> <s> the noble lord lord williams said that it was the third attempt <e> <s> in fact the second and the third attempts were almost identical <e> <s> i hope the noble lord will accept that we have taken this back have thought about it again and have returned with it almost as it was <e> <s> if i understood the noble lord lord williams to be referring to belgium perhaps i may point out that merger accounting is a member state option <e> <s> to my knowledge belgium is not implementing this provision <e> <s> therefore in that case it does not apply <e> <s> when it comes to be put into effect here companies and auditors will have to look upon what are generally accepted accounting principles <e>", "<cs> my lords no par value shares means that they have no value <e> <s> in that instance one would interpret it as the stronger of the tests and would have to say equity for equity <e> <s> the noble lord is going to extremes in this case <e> <s> he is looking for obscure circumstances <e> <s> in any event we would have to accept the tests of the seventh directive and follow its wording <e> <s> we would have to see the generally accepted accounting principles <e> <s> the noble lord referred to the case of <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord will allow me to intervene <e> <s> as i understand the position we are saying that one can have proportional consolidation for unincorporated bodies but not for incorporated bodies <e> <s> unincorporated bodies are essentially partnerships between companies in whatever proportion that partnership is owned by the company which is seeking to consolidate the assets <e> <s> to that extent is the test of minority share or the test of control the same as if it were an incorporated body <e> <s> in other words there may be a direct liability under the partnership <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall deal with the second point made by the noble lord lord williams of elvel <e> <s> i suspect that it is right to exclude altogether proportional consolidation of unincorporated bodies because they are separate legal entities <e> <s> the corporate veil still applies and there is no legal liability unless it has been specifically entered into for the debts of the subsidiary of a parent company <e> <s> if it were to be entered into and guarantees were to be given that is surely a matter which if it were of significance would be noted on the accounts in some way <e>", "<cs> my lords whether it is full or partial consolidation it would be joint responsibility for the liabilities but not necessarily the assets <e> <s> although i am not an accounting expert and it is a long time since i dealt with such matters i suspect that what would happen is that there would be proportional consolidation and i suspect a note on the balance sheet or some note of the liabilities which would be covered by the joint liability <e> <s> those are matters upon which the accountants would determine a full and fair view of the accounts and would reflect that <e> <s> we can see a good case to allow proportional consolidation for unincorporated bodies but not for incorporated bodies <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will go along with that <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord williams has reminded us this amendment was discussed in committee on a paving amendment and despite the governments advice the chamber showed that it supported the principle underlying it <e> <s> although the noble lord omitted to move the amendment itself when it was reached i do not feel that it would be in accordance with the tradition of the house to seek to take advantage from that <e> <s> we also have a convention that we do not seek to reverse on report amendments on which the chamber has voted in committee <e> <s> this is a valuable convention which greatly facilitates our business <e> <s> i shall not therefore be inviting the house to oppose this amendment today <e>", "<cs> my lords i too shall speak to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> i fear i am less attracted by the first of these amendments than the second <e> <s> we have had only a relatively short time to study the implications but i am willing to accept that they merit more careful consideration <e> <s> i can give the noble lord an assurance that we shall consider them more carefully between now and third reading but without commitment <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the besetting sins of any of us who have the privilege of exercising power is a reluctance to delegate <e> <s> it is so tempting to want to keep ones hands on every aspect of a project but as we all know unless one delegates the less important matters it soon becomes impossible to find time to deal with those matters that are more important <e> <s> i want to suggest to noble lords who moved this amendment that it is perhaps disproportionate to require parliament to set aside time on the floor of the house to consider and approve in advance the detailed arrangements for summary financial statements <e>", "<cs> my lords i find myself under a peculiar difficulty <e> <s> i would be quite content to contest a matter of legal interpretation with the noble lord lord benson but i would find myself somewhat inhibited in taking the same position with the noble and learned lord lord roskill <e> <s> however i am a member of the legal profession albeit i have not practised for over a third of a century and i shall endeavour to try <e>", "<cs> my lords of course they cannot secure that a person is fit and proper but surely the noble lord would agree that the body <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with great care to what the noble lord has said and to what the noble and learned lord lord roskill said <e> <s> if the noble and learned lord advances that opinion i will think again <e> <s> if the noble lord will withdraw the amendment i will undertake to look at it <e>", "<cs> my lords the fears of the noble lord lord benson about the effect of laying down minimum requirements in this paragraph are unfounded <e> <s> if a recognised supervisory body were to impose more strict requirements on the ownership of firms and that was acceptable to me then a member firm would not be able to ignore those stricter requirements and claim that it must nevertheless be eligible for appointment as a company auditor as it fulfilled the statutory conditions <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i should like to ask whether he moved amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> if so i have a contribution to make <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say a few words on amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords with permission i shall say a word or two about amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it may be helpful if i repeat the governments policy on the question of the control and ownership of auditing firms by qualified persons <e> <s> our policy is that the legislation should reproduce the minimum requirements in the directive and this is accomplished by paragraph of this schedule but that professional bodies should in principle be able to go beyond those minimum requirements provided they satisfy the competition test in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give a timing <e> <s> i hope that it may be possible to bring forward the amendment before the bill goes to another place but if not i shall ensure that we will have an opportunity to discuss the matter at a later stage <e>", "<cs> my lords our policy has been as i have explained in regard to one or two similar matters that we provide the minimum <e> <s> it is open to the appropriate body to provide more safeguards than would be satisfactory provided that the secretary of state for the time being is satisfied that those are not anti-competitive <e> <s> it is that test which is the appropriate test <e> <s> we see the directive applying the minimum standard but it is open to others to go beyond that minimum standard <e>", "<cs> my lords no of course not <e> <s> the noble lord lord williams of elvel is well aware of that <e> <s> when looking at the control and ownership of auditing firms by qualified persons and similar matters we must ensure that the provisions included are for the protection and safeguard of the client the investor and the creditors of firms <e> <s> we must ensure that those safeguards do not by their operation become anti-competitive <e> <s> minimum standards are set within the community <e> <s> those standards must pass the anti-competitive test <e>", "<cs> my lords in common with the noble lord lord williams of elvel i shall speak to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> as has been mentioned this matter was debated in committee <e> <s> since then my officials nave as was promised at that time discussed monitoring further with the profession <e> <s> before describing the professions proposals i think it might be helpful for me to say a few words about the intentions behind the monitoring and enforcement provisions in paragraph of schedule <e>", "<cs> my lords if it is a bureaucracy it is a bureaucracy of the profession and not of government <e> <s> it will be something that the profession itself will look at <e> <s> if we are to place such regard i believe it is high

and that the auditor is acting independently and with integrity <e> <s> we are not saying that every auditor should be checked on every single matter but that the institute if that is the recognised body sets up a procedure whereby it can point out to some of its members that a system of checking is there <e>", "<cs> my lords in there will be further economic activity within the entire community <e> <s> over the past year or two we have seen problems of success because the growth of this countrys economy has increased demand so much <e> <s> public purchasing pressure has grown faster than our

greater community in europe and we must maximise that opportunity in order to ensure that the people of the united kingdom benefit most from it <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mason may well

lords perhaps the noble lord knows who those people are but i cannot recognise them <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i am not sure i quite go along with the simile he has just given in your lordships house <e> <s> but the difficulty is that i do not know how to stop the japanese companies <e> <s> if japanese companies look around europe and compare us say with germany

therefore for reasons that seem to me to be quite obvious they opt to come here <e> <s> in many cases now japanese companies come to this country and receive no assistance whatsoever <e> <s> in other cases they come and receive only selective assistance which is available to other british firms <e> <s> i cannot see any way in which i should keep them out nor is there the slightest possible reason why i should even try <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord lord williams of elvel for his support on this question <e> <s> it is a habit i should like to encourage in him <e>", "<cs> my lords i hear what the noble lord says <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that at the end of the day overseas companies coming to the united kingdom will invest where it best serves their purposes <e> <s> that is why i believe they come here <e> <s> i should like to make the point that in the governments view there are no foreign companies in the united kingdom there are japanese-owned british companies and there are american-owned british companies and there are german and swiss-owned british companies <e> <s> that is surely the best view because it is britons who are employed by them and the wealth created accrues to the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords i must report that when i was last in tokyo i heard a great many remarks about the quality and output of the nissan factory in the north-east of england which at the time compared favourably with any other plant owned by nissan anywhere in the world including japan <e>", "<cs> my lords they are precisely the same <e> <s> we do not have special rules for overseas companies <e> <s> selective assistance in the appropriate areas of the country are available to companies whether or not they come from overseas or not <e> <s> i should remind your lordships house that toyota may very well decide to come to the united kingdom without receiving one penny of assistance <e> <s> even if the company decides to go to a development area where it would receive regional assistance the new regime in europe may be such that it will not be able to collect it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord lord taylor <e>

world in which it seems to be scotland which receives the bulk of the regional aid money <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that there are two distinct parts to my noble friends question <e> <s> in relation to the first part concerning state aid i read with great interest a speech made by sir leon brittan recently and an announcement that it appears that the commission is to lead an assault on the principle of aid across the community <e> <s> it would be a very bad competition in which countries in the community would vie with each other to entice companies to invest <e> <s> it would be better to have no aid at all and to let companies out of sheer economic self interest invest in the country which provides the best economic climate <e> <s> that country i suspect would be the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord williams of elvel for what he said <e> <s> i am sure the noble lord will understand me fully when i say that i cannot claim responsibility for anything which is broadcast on the radio news at one oclock neither can i do so in respect of a report from an agency in tokyo <e> <s> i said on th january in your lordships house that i would come back to the house when i had a statement to make on the matter <e> <s> this is the first statement i have made on the position and i am sure that your lordships will not expect me to do otherwise <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe for what he said <e> <s> i am sure that his congratulations to the people of derby are shared by members from all sides of your lordships house <e> <s> further i am glad to be able to confirm that commissioner bangemann of the european community has now formally confirmed to me that the french government will now count the sunderland-built nissan cars as being cars of european and british origin and that they will be allowed to circulate freely <e> <s> i regard that matter as no more than one of the growing pains of the european community <e> <s> it is a matter which is now behind us <e> <s> i look forward to the future <e> <s> i also look forward to welcoming all those companies which may come to settle within our shores and which undertake to obey the rules which we have set so that their products may be circulated throughout europe as british products <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend for what he said <e> <s> i do not think that i should add anything to his last remark <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully understand what the noble lord has said <e> <s> the car plant will be coming into gradual production over the early years of the next decade <e> <s> further it is a matter at which my right honourable friend the secretary of state for education and science will no doubt be looking <e> <s> it is also a matter at which i very much hope the local education authority will be looking because that is where the primary responsibility lies <e> <s> it is a matter which a combination of effort from the private and public sector will undoubtedly solve <e>", "<cs> my lords there are many reasons but one of the additional reasons we welcome toyota is that at a time when the demand for cars in this country far outstrips our capacity to produce them last year per cent <e> <s> were imported it is safe to say that we can see a substantial increase in the car industry in this country without affecting any jobs here <e> <s> although last year we sold about per cent <e> <s> of the total theoretical car capacity of europe there is room for further expansion <e> <s> secondly i am sure that industry has learnt its lesson <e> <s> it took some decades to learn that without investment there can be no future <e>", "<cs> my lords i am the first to pay tribute to the sterling work that the noble lord lord northfield has done in telford in securing the settlement of a large number of japanese companies there <e> <s> i believe that the british people do not need such reassurance <e> <s> many japanese companies and other companies from overseas which have settled within these shores have given positive proof of their desire to be good citizens <e> <s> we have seen that time and time again <e> <s> i hardly think that toyota will be an exception <e> <s> i look forward to a time when we shall wonder whether a toyota is a japanese company or whether it has always been a good british company <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to confirm that commissioner bangemann told me he has been informed by the french government that there were no further impediments <e> <s> he of course had always held that view <e> <s> i do not believe that we shall see any further difficulties in that regard <e> <s> i regard the matter as now closed <e> <s> it has been firmly established that those cars and other cars established here within the criteria will have access throughout europe <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i had always understood that industrial land was used for industry <e> <s> if there is a change of use other considerations will apply but i believe that it is industrial land <e>", "<cs> my lords what is the function of derbyshire county council but to put in a certain amount of infrastructure to welcome jobs and all the wealth-creation processes in its area <e> <s> there were other authorities which were happy to do so <e> <s> it seems to me to be a proper function for derbyshire <e> <s> i am sure it is something that the people of derbyshire will welcome <e> <s> i

speciality cars <e> <s> one can look at the cars produced by the ford motor company <e> <s> it has an engine plant in bridgend which produces cars for a large part of europe and the bodies of some cars that it sells in this country are made in germany <e> <s> we are rapidly reaching the stage where we are internationalising the car manufacturing industry <e> <s> it is extraordinarily difficult to say who does what <e>", "<cs> my lords our appetite for vodka must be such that we have an adverse trade balance with the soviet union <e> <s> our imports from there considerably exceed our exports to them <e> <s> the real difficulty in trading with the soviet union is simply their lack of hard currency <e> <s> that will tend to rule out consumer products <e> <s> in the main our endeavours in the soviet union are confined to capital projects particularly concerning power generation food and the like <e> <s> that is where we shall have the furthest and best advances <e>", "<cs> my lords

obviously pay considerable attention to it <e> <s> i shall speak to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> among a number of agreements that i signed when mr kamentsev the trade minister was here with mr gorbachev was one which involved a british company going into the soviet union and working with a producer of washing machines <e> <s> the company will be redesigning them and then enabling those products not only to be sold in the soviet union but exported <e> <s> another company is involved there in the redesigning of jeans and their manufacture and in other clothing apparel <e> <s> a number of these projects are going ahead but the difficulty is that they require hard currency and therefore there must be an element of export involved as well <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a piece of information that i do not have with me <e> <s> i shall write to the noble lord and put a copy of the letter in the library <e>", "<cs> my lords my responsibilities lie within the united

clear <e> <s> the sex discrimination act refers to employment <e> <s> employment is a conscious decision of the employer whether the employer is an individual or a company <e> <s> the election of a director is a collective decision by a large number of people and the same rules cannot apply <e> <s> it may well be that one day there will be another solution but we do not believe that this

comments on the conduct of this matter <e> <s> i should like to say to the noble lord lord ezra that the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran had let me know that he was unfortunately unable to be with

virtues of the isle of wight that during the course of this bill he has been an equally powerful advocate for the cbi <e>", "<cs> my lords at this point in our debates it is the convention to say that this has been a very interesting and wide-ranging discussion <e> <s> at this time i can say that without any fear of contradiction because the range of interests that have been expressed and the

were first kept to find a repayment in the order of last years figure <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i followed the question put by the noble lord lord bruce of donington <e> <s> i shall only say that in all these matters the relevant figure is the percentage of gdp <e> <s> it is the proportion of the total resources of the nation that goes to pay off our debt <e> <s> that is coming down

british telecoms market research on the customer reaction to their changed format reveals that per cent <e> <s> of the public are satisfied with the new format of the directory and only per cent <e> <s> were dissatisfied while some per cent <e> <s> had no preference <e> <s> i do not know what we should do further on that <e> <s> what has become obvious is that such has been the growth of the usage of telephones in the london area that it was necessary for bt to look at different ways of dividing up the directory <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the effects of dividing the book up between residential and business subscribers means that the directories are lighter and smaller <e> <s> if they were put back again into one book by necessity they would be larger and heavier <e>", "<cs> my lords the last survey on public telephone call boxes showed that no less than per cent <e> <s> were in working order <e> <s> over the past months we have seen a continuing increase in the number of call boxes which are in working order and i suspect that the noble lord was rather unlucky <e>", "<cs> my lords books are no longer kept in telephone boxes for a very good reason that is that they were consistently vandalised and set alight <e> <s> part of the policy of british telecom in order to ensure that telephone boxes are in working order is to take out the telephone books and to make available a directory inquiry service <e> <s> i suspect that it is better in the long run for that to happen <e>", "<cs> my lords i assure my noble friend that minitel of whatever is the name of the particular receiver system may be free to the subscriber but it is expensive to the taxpayer <e> <s> that system is very expensive <e> <s> the fullness of time will show whether that is a good bargain for the french taxpayer <e> <s> the present system is far more competitive and efficient <e>", "<cs> my lords as long as we confine that wide area to british telecom i am content <e>", "<cs> my lords i doubt whether any system could be perfect but i shall ensure and i know that this will happen in any event that the chairman of british telecom will read what your lordships have said this afternoon and he will no doubt take that into account <e>", "<cs> my lords if it were economic to do so then i suspect that british telecom would take that quite seriously <e> <s> however from the figures i have seen the cost to the french government and french telecom in providing that system is out of all proportion to the utility <e>", "<cs> my lords per cent <e> <s> had no preference and the balance of per cent <e> <s> had no opinion <e>", "<cs> my lords i have said earlier this afternoon that i can see an argument why members clubs should be free to enter into tied loans if that is the collective wish of the members on a free vote <e> <s> that is a point which is accepted <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble baroness will forgive me i think i can do no more than to comment on the paper submitted by the wolverhampton and dudley breweries which is a brewery prominent in the area that the noble baroness was discussing <e> <s> they say on the second page that competition indeed is responsible for low prices that it is only in the midlands where committed regional brewers have been able to use that weapon competitively and that it is no accident that prices in those areas are below the national average <e> <s> i assure the noble baroness that that was something which the report actually showed <e> <s> i commend that paper to the noble baroness <e> <s> indeed it contained many of the proposals that the noble lord lord williams advanced in his speech <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to intervene once again but we have a difficult and complex position as it is <e> <s> we should take care not to make it more difficult <e> <s> even the dissenting view accepted the fact that a complex monopoly situation exists <e> <s> paragraph of the report shows that the <e>", "<cs> my lords again i say how grateful i am to my noble friend lord kimball for initiating the debate and for giving all in your lordships house the opportunity to debate this matter thoroughly <e> <s> i have been sitting in your lordships house for close on five years now <e> <s> it is said i believe it fully that one judges a man by his friends <e> <s> i have had a certain amount of culture shock this afternoon as i begin to wonder where i am sitting <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope my noble friend will forgive me and i am sure my noble friend consulted extensively with the whole industry but the industry must reflect on what i have said and look at it carefully <e> <s> let us not come to any premature judgments <e>", "<cs> my lords the figures i have to date show that some million of british coal enterprise money has been committed out of total funding of some million <e> <s> the additional money has been attracted from other sources like banks and local authorities <e> <s> some indeed has come from government grants for example regional development grants <e> <s> that funding has helped to create jobs to date <e> <s> however i hear what the noble lord has to say <e> <s> i shall make inquiries although the matter is not my specific responsibility <e> <s> i shall then write to the noble lord and place a copy of the correspondence in the library <e>", "<cs> my lords it is strange that the noble lord should say that regional policy needs changing at a time when we have seen unemployment coming down fastest in the regions <e> <s> the noble lord is also under a misapprehension <e> <s> when we abolished regional development grants we did not at that time introduce selective assistance <e> <s> that was introduced to my knowledge in the early s <e> <s> we have ensured that the money that is given for development in the regions is only given where it makes a difference <e> <s> that seems a sensible step that any prudent government would take <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope very much that it is the private sector <e> <s> individuals and organisations within the private sector have to get planning permission <e> <s> there the local authority has a role to play <e> <s> if we were to depend only upon english estates in creating factories in the north-east or the north-west quite frankly it would not be able to cope <e> <s> we wish to see a vigorous private sector building the factories and warehouses that are needed <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have been working through british coal enterprise <e> <s> i pay considerable tribute to the work of that organisation <e> <s> it provides assistance by five main routes <e> <s> if offers advice and guidance to facilitate business start-ups and expansions in coalfield areas it offers loans to new businesses or firms wishing to relocate to those areas and it offers support for any new or existing enterprise agencies <e> <s> it also provides land and premises and identifies special training needs <e> <s> however one cannot provide training needs in the abstract <e> <s> training can only be provided when one knows the specific end purpose for which it is required <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> however i can certainly make inquiries and find out <e> <s> i am not sure whether statistics for coalfield areas as such exist but i know that british coal enterprise has stated that it has helped to create some jobs <e>", "<cs> my lords if a mine is to close the government could not provide alternative work for miners in the same business as they were in before <e> <s> we have seen in south wales in particular an enormous regeneration of the economy <e> <s> we have seen all kinds of new businesses go there <e> <s> it is important to accept that the future is different from the past and that people have to adapt themselves to the world that will exist and not try to recreate the past <e>", "<cs> my lords i suspect that those who have gone into other jobs and those who are undergoing training are very grateful not to have to continue in the mines <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the leader of the opposition has raised a matter which is not only far from the question but is also not within my knowledge at the moment <e> <s> i shall certainly have a look at the report <e> <s> however almost every week i read authoritative reports which in the event are not borne out by the facts <e> <s> i suspect that that will always be the case <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of that fact <e> <s> i am concerned that we do not delude those people in industries whose time is past that the only employment available to them in the future is in similar industries <e> <s> we have to encourage people to look for the opportunities that will exist in tomorrows world <e> <s> that has been the policy of this government throughout this decade <e>", "<cs> my lords i said that british coal enterprise had helped to create jobs <e> <s> the noble lord must appreciate that never before in the entire history of the british isles have so many men and women been in paid employment as there are today <e> <s> no other country within the european community has created million new jobs as this government have done <e> <s> this is a time to congratulate the government on their efforts and not the time for carping criticism of one particular aspect <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i follow the point made by the noble lord <e> <s> if he is very concerned about it i am happy to assure him that the government accept the principle of additionality <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to pay tribute to my noble and learned friend for the work that he did decades ago in the north-east <e> <s> probably as a result of that work we are seeing an amazing resurgence of the enterprise for which the north-east was once rightly famous <e> <s> if my noble friend were to go to a town like consett which used to exist as a one-industry steel town and see the enormous variety of employment there today and the hope that exists in that community he would indeed feel very pleased <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble baroness that i will have a good look for my heart and i shall then put my hand on it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord williams of elvel for the manner in which he welcomed part of the statement if not all of it <e> <s> i should say to him that i was of course taking the consumers interests very much into account <e> <s> i listened carefully to bodies such as the consumers association which brought home to me the great need to see that soft drinks and other non-beer drinks are covered and are made a more competitive market <e> <s> i should say to the noble lord lest he be concerned about our position within europe that soft drinks and other non-beer drinks are covered by the block exemption but they are not central to it <e> <s> we are free to adopt whatever policy we wish in respect of them without conflicting with the block exemption <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords friends would not have me do anything but the noble lord lord williams of elvel would have me do everything <e> <s> that was the difficulty in which i found myself <e> <s> having to dispose of large numbers of public houses within a short period would not help to remedy the position <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> of course he is quite right <e> <s> the figures of themselves do not tend to denote any great monopoly but it is ease of market entry which distinguishes this industry from almost every other <e> <s> one can open another shop in the high street there is barely any limit on the amount of competition that one can introduce <e> <s> however in this area the system of licensing justices has been such as almost to eliminate any increase <e> <s> in a period of years when we have seen population changes within the united kingdom the number of public houses has <e>", "<cs> my lords i hear what the noble lord says <e> <s> i suspect that i am not the best person to advise the brewers today because i doubt whether i am the most popular man with them at the moment <e> <s> i should point out however that in freeing up of the existing public houses which are tied to the six national brewers over the period of the next two years we shall be increasing the number of free houses in this country very substantially indeed <e> <s> by insisting that wholesale prices must be published and that the brewers have to supply on that basis we are enabling almost for the first time those free houses competitively to obtain supplies of beer <e> <s> by taking low-alcohol beers as well as non-alcoholic drinks out of the tie we shall considerably improve the supply of those commodities <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret to hear what my noble friend has said <e> <s> i hope very much that the national brewers will reflect on my package as a whole and will realise that it represents a proper balance in the recommendations of the mmc report <e> <s> we live in a world in which defects have to be remedied <e> <s> i hope that in the fullness of time the brewers will accept and live with the present position <e>", "<cs> my lords we have taken them out of the tie and further provided that in three years from now the director general will reconsider the position <e> <s> that fact will not have escaped those in the industry <e> <s> i am sure they will realise that if the situation has not been remedied further steps may have to be taken <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may just say to the noble lord how grateful i am to him for having paid tribute to the prime minister for the tremendous changes that she has wrought in the economy of the united kingdom <e> <s> that has ensured that during this decade we have been top of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i hope that he will have a word with the brewers and help them to appreciate how good i have been to them <e> <s> at the moment i suspect that they may not see it exactly that way <e> <s> in reply to my noble friend and it is a matter that i should have mentioned to the noble lord lord williams of elvel i cannot see the faintest similarity between the dock labour scheme which was after all a statutory protection to give jobs for life and the steps that we are now taking in this industry whereby we are endeavouring to create a more competitive environment <e>", "<cs> my lords this very balanced package provides at the same time more diversity of choice by introducing guest beers greater competition by ensuring that low-alcohol and non-alcoholic drinks should be freed and protection for the tenants by bringing them within the scope of the landlord and tenant act <e>", "<cs> my lords i have gone no futher than to say that with my colleagues we shall look at the present system to see whether perhaps the need element is required <e> <s> i do not think that i could go nearly so far as my noble friend suggests <e> <s> that shows your lordships how complex the whole field is <e>", "<cs> my lords it is my understanding that the question is about training and not about ethics <e> <s> i can tell the noble lord that one characteristic of the s and s was the inadequacy of training arrangements in british industry <e> <s> yet in that same period we had a multiplicity of compulsory training boards <e> <s> there is no substitute for industry recognising the need to train in its own right <e> <s> nothing will change that <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the voluntary arrangements will result in a closer arrangement between the various statutory and professional bodies and the industries themselves <e> <s> at the end of the day companies have to realise that it is in their own self-interest to train with the increased professionalism that that brings <e> <s> until they do so no acts of parliament and no exhortation by ministers will change the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness <e> <s> i understand that this very day the engineering industry training board has written to my right honourable friend the secretary of state for employment suggesting that it transfers to a voluntary basis <e> <s> i am aware of the many programmes that the board has run and i have supported them in the past in a previous incarnation <e> <s> in particular i pay tribute to programmes such as those for women technicians and the like <e> <s> the board will of course have to make arrangements to ensure that those continue <e>", "<cs> my lords no amount of external monitoring will change the reality that companies have to recognise that they must train for themselves <e> <s> it is true that in the past many companies poached staff <e> <s> undoubtedly at times of skill shortage some may do so today <e> <s> however in my travels around industry and i spend a great deal of time travelling around industry i have noticed a fundamental change in the attitude of many companies in this country towards training <e> <s> i think that today we are at long last beginning to make proper provision for the future <e>", "<cs> my lords the arrangements will have to be made by the engineering industry on its own account <e> <s> it is the engineering industry which has been responsible for the engineering industry training board and which has come to my right honourable friend to suggest that the scheme be put on a voluntary basis <e> <s> those up and down the land in the engineering industry know that statutory boards have in the past led to increased bureaucracy and precious little new training <e> <s> the sooner we recognise the reality of the situation the better <e>", "<cs> my lords i suspect that i am more susceptible to flattery than the next man <e> <s> i therefore gratefully accept what the noble lord says about the activities of bodies with which i have been connected in the past <e> <s> however we must decide which is the best way to go about the matter either through statutory boards which have clearly failed or voluntary boards which are working well in many industries <e> <s> at the end of the day whether the boards are statutory or voluntary change depends upon the attitude of those who run industry <e> <s> it is that attitude which in the long run must change <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear that such a levy did not work in the past <e> <s> and there is no way in which it will work in the future <e> <s> there were some statutory bodies when i first arrived at the manpower services commission one by one they have gone <e> <s> we now have voluntary schemes <e> <s> the industries support the voluntary schemes with enthusiasm whereas they supported the statutory schemes with great reluctance <e> <s> however as i fear i have already stated at the end of the day it is a change of attitude by industry not monitoring by external bodies or a decision to make the scheme compulsory that is needed <e> <s> i am now convinced that industry is changing <e>", "<cs> my lords only this very day has the application from the engineering industry training board been received by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i pay tribute to the noble lord lord scanlon and to the work that he did at the engineering industry training board <e> <s> but it was a different industry then and there were different requirements <e> <s> it was a time when computer-controlled machines had not appeared and the whole shape of the industry was different <e> <s> today one man does eight mens work in that industry because of the way in which modern technology works <e> <s> industry must train for the future and not consider itself hidebound by the past <e> <s> it is my understanding that the engineering industry training board has voluntarily asked to be disbanded and to become a voluntary scheme <e> <s> the government have not turned it in that direction <e>", "<cs> my lords my reply may well be anodyne but it happens also to be accurate <e> <s> what the court of auditors does is to show shortcomings in procedures <e> <s> it is for member states to enforce those procedures <e> <s> the commission now has an anti-fraud unit that we have supported <e> <s> indeed we keep in close touch with it <e> <s> as a result of that for example on export refunds an area which has been suspect in the past the commission would like per cent <e> <s> of all consignments eligible for export refunds to be checked <e> <s> in the united kingdom the customs and excise has an objective of checking per cent <e> <s> it is for us and for all member states to put our own houses in order <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i bow to the knowledge of the law of my noble and learned friend <e> <s> the law on fraud must be a very complex subject covering such matters as those which concern aspects of my department other than this specific matter which is a fraud on community payments <e> <s> i should not have thought that there would be any great difficulty in the law on fraud <e> <s> where people were claiming refunds or payments from the community on an incorrect basis that would seem to me to be a matter that could easily be checked <e> <s> however i shall certainly take cognisance of my noble and learned friends remarks and inquire of the appropriate authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble and learned lord will realise that the use of the word notorious has to be proved by evidence to exist rather than there just being allegations that it exists <e> <s> i am quite sure that in a previous time he would have made that point equally to me <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord knows full well that the prime minister has been to the forefront in seeking to bring a sense of reality into the cap <e> <s> we are also well aware of the amount of fraud <e> <s> it is a little dangerous to give estimates of the amount because they are only estimates and they have to be proven <e> <s> however it is for us to put our own house in order <e> <s> i have already mentioned that the commission wants an objective of per cent <e> <s> of consignments set <e> <s> we have set an objective of per cent <e> <s> we already concentrate checks on high risk consignments and products <e> <s> additional training has been given by customs to some officers in order to begin to implement this enormous task of checking on fraud <e> <s> cap liaison officers have been appointed to improve the flow of information concerning the cap fraud <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not a question of new laws but of enforcing those that already exist <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know to which conference it is that the noble lord refers <e> <s> his question is a long way from the question on the order paper but there is no shortage of international conferences in this world today about a whole variety of subjects <e> <s> the only meetings that my department attends are those which it presumably considers are worth attending <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to make a statement on a major japanese inward investment project in the motor sector by honda <e>", "<cs> my lords never before has the noble lord lord williams of elvel ever made a more accurate statement <e> <s> i cannot understand the noble lord said two or three times and he demonstrated that completely <e> <s> will not understand may perhaps be a more accurate expression but i remind the noble lord precisely what he would have said had i not come down to the house for it was exactly a year to this very day that i announced that the arrangement with british aerospace was being completed <e> <s> here is british aerospace selling off one-fifth of its company to honda and honda selling one-fifth of its company to british aerospace within the united kingdom <e> <s> all who were consulted on this matter advised that it would be of concern to your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend because he at least recognises something which noble lords opposite have not <e> <s> it is that we provide the most welcome climate for manufacturing investment anywhere within the european community <e> <s> that is not my judgment and it is not the government who say so <e> <s> it is that of those who come to settle within our shores <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to assure the noble lord that the new plant which will be in addition to the existing engine plant in swindon will add some new jobs to hondas existing workforce <e> <s> it will also provide additional opportunities for rover groups swindon facility from which it will source pressings <e> <s> pressings will come from the fisher plant and that will be an extension to it <e>", "<cs> my lords i require notice of that question but i can say that it is quite low <e>", "<cs> my lords for the answer to my noble friends question one must look back over the past years <e> <s> in particular one must look at the history of british leyland from the moment that it was nationalised to realise that the course of conduct upon which it then embarked was such as to ensure that it could never be in a position to invest the kind of money which japanese companies have invested <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure to which report my noble friend refers <e> <s> however i can assure him as i am sure he knows already that section of the lloyds act granted lloyds immunity from suits for damages by members <e> <s> it is similar to sections in the financial services act which granted immunity to the sib and the self-regulating organisations <e> <s> the purpose of these sections is to ensure that those regulatory bodies are not inhibited from taking appropriate action by fear of civil suits <e> <s> i hear what my noble friend says but do not think that i could easily contemplate the changes that he proposes <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful for the testimonial given to me by the noble lord <e> <s> we read a great deal in the papers but it seems <e>", "<cs> my lords in there was a surplus in trade in manufactures of billion on a balance of payments basis <e> <s> this surplus continued until <e> <s> in there was a deficit of billion <e> <s> i have arranged for the figures to be available in the library <e>", "<cs> my lords for the three months to may for which i have the figures there was a visible trade deficit of billion compared with billion in the previous three months <e> <s> what we have to appreciate is that the balance of payments deficit is not in itself of great importance provided that it can be financed <e> <s> the present current account deficit is being readily financed by the inflow of private sector capital which shows great confidence in this country as a base for investment <e> <s> we have seen recent evidence of that in the motor car industry <e> <s> recent deficits come after a long period during which the united kingdom has run large current account surpluses <e>", "<cs> my lords speaking for myself i gave up reading professor godley many years ago <e>", "<cs> my lords it is true that we lost the market in refrigerators a good many years ago but it is fair to say that only a quarter of the growth in imported manufactured goods in was in consumer goods <e> <s> a large part of imports are for industry raw materials semi-finished manufactures intermediate and capital goods <e>", "<cs> my lords if i gave the noble lord a forecast over the next years i trust that no one in your lordships house would believe me <e> <s> these are matters which are not within the wisdom of ministers to say <e> <s> however at the present time quite a part of our deficit is in the import of motor cars <e> <s> we have seen from the results in the past few months that far more cars will now be manufactured in the united kingdom and that is one part of the balance of payments deficit which will disappear over the years <e>", "<cs> my lords i said that a large part of the imports were raw materials semi-finished manufacturers intermediate and capital goods for industry <e> <s> what we have seen is manufacturing output going up year by year <e> <s> it stood at a record level in some per cent <e> <s> higher than in <e> <s> we have also seen our exports continuing to go up month after month <e> <s> it might be of interest to your lordships that in emerging markets such as japan where through my department we have been running an opportunity japan campaign for the first five months of this year exports to japan are per cent <e> <s> up against an equivalent period last year <e> <s> that is very good news indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no question that part of the balance of payments problem is due to the increased demand which has appeared in the united kingdom during the past two years and which has exceeded our capacity to manufacture <e> <s> any country which has had a resurgence japan was a parallel case in the s will go through a period of balance of <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord believes that i am being complacent i ask him to question his own judgment <e> <s> i am not <e> <s> it is not financed by borrowing <e> <s> the noble lord knows perfectly well that we had massive inward investment in this country that is one way to pay for deficit payments <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure what the noble lord means nor is it possible to discern it <e> <s> he may as well have asked what proportion of goods around the world are manufactured from designs originated in this country <e> <s> as regards the motor car industry if that is what the noble lord means we have a position where we shall have per cent <e> <s> sourced within the united kingdom <e> <s> this is a matter upon which we are prone to put ourselves down <e> <s> i have far more confidence in british industry <e> <s> during the past two years i have continually travelled around the country and have detected a tremendous spirit of optimism among those in manufacturing industry <e> <s> also there is the realisation that the markets are theirs if they know how to go and get them <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord peston is a reputed economist <e> <s> i shall not argue economics with him <e> <s> however reluctant as i am i must point out that i did not say what he suggested <e> <s> i said that recent deficits came after a long period during which the united kingdom ran large current account surpluses <e> <s> the noble lord must not confuse today with <e> <s> the imf is no longer in the habit of calling on our shores <e>", "<cs> my lords it is true that we run a considerable deficit with the ec <e> <s> i am not sure about there being a surplus with the rest of the world but there is no doubt that we have a considerable deficit with the ec <e> <s> that shows precisely how important we are to the community <e>", "<cs> my lords i congratulate the noble lord lord williams of elvel on the robustness of his views <e> <s> there is a director general of an organisation known as the tuc which i suspect is known to the noble lord <e> <s> of course it must be known to him as it is the paymaster of his party <e> <s> the director general of that organisation wrote to me expressing views which seemed to me to be slightly different from those of the noble lord as he asked me to ignore the vast proportion of the mmcs report <e> <s> there is also another organisation known as the transport and general workers union whose representatives came to see me <e> <s> they also asked me to ignore the report entirely and i referred them to the noble lord <e> <s> obviously they have not yet contacted him <e>", "<cs> my lords he has obviously been demoted <e> <s> he is the general secretary <e>", "<cs> my lords of course in talking of the tuc i was referring collectively to all unions <e> <s> i accept that <e>", "<cs> my lords i totally reject everything that my noble friend has said in this particular instance and i accept in full the conclusions which the mmc found in regard to the supply of beer <e> <s> to look again and have consultations is the correct way to remedy defects of the market place <e> <s> i believe time will show that what we have done is a very subtle way of ensuring that the market works <e> <s> i remind all in your lordships house that the director general of the office of fair trading will look again at this matter in three years time together with my right honourable friend the secretary of state at the home office and indeed the lord president of the council <e> <s> they will be looking at ways in which licences are granted <e> <s> i can accept that at times the noble lord lord williams has to scrape to the very bottom of the barrel albeit a beer barrel to find ways to criticise the government and that is always understood in these difficult circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that i have to say anything about the work of the monopolies and mergers commission <e> <s> i have followed all its decisions on merger cases unlike someone roy hattersley by name who was the <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i should make one thing quite clear <e> <s> the fact that the economy of the united kingdom has come round so much during the past years is because it is competitive <e> <s> the guardian of that sense of competitiveness is the monopolies and mergers commission <e> <s> let us never forget that <e>", "<cs> my lords the madrid summit noted that job creation should be given top priority in the achievement of the internal market and that the role to be played by community standards by national legislation and by contractual relationships should be clearly established <e> <s> that is the right approach but it may well be that the noble lord has forgotten what conditions were like or years ago when government tried to impose these things <e> <s> what we have seen in the past few years is an enormous explosion in the creation of jobs and wealth something which the governments present policies have brought about <e>", "<cs> my lords as i look round the united kingdom today i find no absence of the right to strike <e>", "<cs> my lords freedom of movement is one thing <e> <s> freedom of movement is already established <e> <s> i very much believe in diverse systems <e> <s> the system in the united kingdom which has seen the creation of million new jobs over the past five years is one which we should uphold <e> <s> the system across the water which has seen an increase in the rate of unemployment and where statutory work protection applies to all kinds of jobs is not one which i think it would profit the united kingdom to adopt <e>", "<cs> my lords i fail to recognise that wholesale corruption exists in the european community <e> <s> however that is another question <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful indeed to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords as i am sure the noble lord will recognise that question is a rather long way from a draft social charter <e> <s> however if he cares to put down a question i shall be delighted to answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords of course there are elements in the social charter which we not only approve of but have led europe in practising <e> <s> there are other elements which we have practised and which we know have failed <e> <s> we have no wish to return to those <e> <s> our position is very simple to each his own <e> <s> we know what makes the united kingdom economy work and we should not like to change it <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much agree with my noble friend <e> <s> what we are doing is to suggest that the social charter that works in the united kingdom could be copied well by other countries in europe <e> <s> what we would never wish to do is to impose it upon other countries <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not recognise the description surly of my reply to the noble lord lord murray whom i have known for many years <e> <s> all i pointed out to the noble lord was that there appeared to be no shortage of the right to strike in the united kingdom at this time <e>", "<cs> my lords i would rather we stimulated the entire wealth creation process of the economy including manufacturing <e> <s> but as my noble friend knows that is a matter on which we have already agreed to differ many times in the past <e>", "<cs> my lords we have considerable protection against aggressive advertising <e> <s> first the law provides that advertisements must not be deceptive or misleading secondly consumers must be given sufficient <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear that the noble lord has misread the statistics on this occasion <e> <s> lending by the main high street banks moved last month in the opposite direction <e> <s> it was million in may compared with million in april <e> <s> it has gone down <e> <s> the volume of retail sales also fell in june <e> <s> there is little evidence of any recent worsening of the position <e> <s> in the case of mortgages there were fewer repossessions by building societies in the second half of last year than in the first <e> <s> fewer building society borrowers had arrears of more than six months <e> <s> this is very much a matter for the indiviual citizen to decide <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly look into the suggestion made by my noble friend <e> <s> however i think it would be slightly unusual if anyone who took a charge or a mortgage on his home even if it were a second mortgage did not know at the end of the day that it would threaten the ownership of his property <e>", "<cs> my lords other countries including the united states japan germany and france have abandoned any controls they had on the amount of consumer lending recognising them to be ineffective unfair and indeed at the end of the day damaging <e> <s> moreover exactly like us such countries rely primarily upon interest rates <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful that the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon is concerned to ensure that the governments economic policy succeeds <e> <s> i share the noble lords sentiments in the matter <e> <s> however i should point out to him that the amount outstanding on consumer credit is bound to rise as disposable incomes rise and the ability to repay loans increases <e> <s> that has been the great change in this decade <e> <s> personal sector financial assets are three times greater than financial liabilities <e> <s> indeed they are actually growing faster <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may suggest to the noble lord that he should consider most carefully all articles that he reads in the newspapers <e> <s> but having said that so far as concerns the amount of credit we live in a world in which the level of personal income is rising sharply <e> <s> we live in a world where happily the citizen is at liberty to decide how he or she wishes to dispose of that income <e>", "<cs> my lords i have two interests to declare this afternoon <e> <s> first i wish to say that i have the honour to be the deputy chairman of the conservative party <e> <s> for that reason alone i doubt whether i would have intervened in your lordships deliberations this afternoon <e> <s> however i have a second interest which i believe overrides that <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend not agree that the department which i had the honour to head during this particular time demonstrated a commitment to and to the european community which is unmatched by any other department or by any other government within the european community <e> <s> will he further agree that as part of my responsibilities as secretary of state i had to take into account not only the claims of brussels but also the claims of people who worked for rover and their families the people who work for the distributors and their families and the many tens of thousands of people who work for the suppliers of rover <e>", "<cs> my lords this is the first time i have had the pleasure of addressing your lordships house since i had the privilege of sitting on the front bench <e> <s> this is in many ways my real maiden speech for this time the words are all mine and not those of nameless officials labouring deep into the night <e> <s> if your lordships house has benefited from my absence for the past months as i suspect it has i have to say with great sadness that i fear that the <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down since he was kind enough to refer to me during the course of his speech although i found the use of the word bogus perhaps a little unkind perhaps he would explain to your lordships house how the very witty refrain years old and further in debt applies to the national debt <e>"]
