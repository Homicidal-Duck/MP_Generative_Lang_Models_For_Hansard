["<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that answer <e> <s> i have no specific case in mind rather it is a more general case <e> <s> i should like to ask the noble lord by way of a supplementary question whether the war widows in addition to the pensions they receive under the war widows scheme are eligible for national insurance scheme pensions in the same way as are other widows <e> <s> more specifically and this is the point of my question are very old war widows those aged over eligible for the old persons pension in the same way as other widows over <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> perhaps it would help if i were to table a question for written answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i should dearly have liked to follow the noble lord lord brockway and to test some of his rather cosy assumptions about the desire of the world powers for disarmament <e> <s> like the noble lord lord hankey i attended disarmament con-jerences in my case for six often weary and frustrating years and i can only say that this desire for universal disarmament was not to me at any rate very evident in the attitudes of any of the great powers who took part in those conferences <e> <s> however i shall not follow the noble lord <e> <s> i have another subject upon which i should like to speak <e> <s> but <e>", "<cs> my lords may i join in the congratulations to those noble lords who have made maiden speeches in this debate <e> <s> i hope that the other three maiden speakers will forgive me if i mention only that of my noble friend lord hill-norton partly because of my own personal association with him and partly because his speech brought such a depth of wisdom and wealth of experience to the debate <e> <s> i think it is perhaps not insignificant that almost every senior military and diplomatic adviser when he leaves his post and comes to this house delivers the same message <e> <s> perhaps some day someone will listen to it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am reluctant to believe that it is a reflection of our priorities that a house that was so full and attentive during a debate on laboratory animals should become so relatively empty for the unstarred question of the noble lord lord buxton of alsa <e> <s> i personally am extremely grateful to him for raising this question this even <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i return to one point in his very eloquent reply concerning the apparent decision of the government not to cut services as i understood it to countries which do not have access to free news and information services <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that this is a situation that can change overnight and that this is the great danger of the governments policies <e> <s> countries which today have access to free news and information might not have it tomorrow <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that once the government have made those cuts there is no restoring them <e> <s> that is the danger of this kind of policy <e>", "<cs> my lords may i begin by thanking the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter for making this debate possible and also by congratulating the noble lord lord holderness on his distinguished maiden speech <e> <s> if i do so briefly it is because i do not wish to speak long if only because i think almost everything that needs to be said about this subject has now been said <e> <s> indeed i feel a deep sense of irony and of world weariness as i listen to the almost unanimous voice of your lordships house joining the great thunder of the national press outside saying things with great cogency and unanimity that a few short years ago were being said by only a few voices crying in the wilderness and being met often by scepticim and even derision <e> <s> but i am happy to say that we hear less nowadays about reds under the bed and the hawks and the cold warriors because it seems to me that at last people have begun to awake <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that reply but may i ask him if he would not agree that this is not simply a matter of local interest <e> <s> is he aware that these premises have been bought by a government which has a certain reputation in international affairs especially in connection with its support for international terrorism <e> <s> is the noble lord further aware that these premises are suitable for all kinds of users <e> <s> is he satisfied with the use that is proposed for them <e> <s> and perhaps the most important question of all can her majestys government give an assurance that these premises will not be given diplomatic immunity <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for dealing in the way that he has with an extremely complicated and knotty question <e> <s> i should also like to thank him for his categorical assurance that these premises will not be given diplomatic immunity <e> <s> may i ask him one final simple question for information only namely as the local education authority has the duty to inspect regularly private educational establishments as well as public educational establishments can the government give an assurance that they will discharge their responsibility in respect of this particular school <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister if this amiable exchange is not based on a serious misconception <e> <s> is he aware that there has been no dismantling of soviet missiles around moscow <e> <s> is he aware that the galosh missiles which were there before are still there whereas the united states has in fact dismantled all of its antiballistic missiles <e> <s> is he aware that all we have is an uncorroborated press report that the soviet union intends to dismantle them and they will probably do so because they are becoming obsolete anyway <e> <s> is he aware that since the soviet union has been engaged in an intensive programme of research and development of new anti-ballistic missiles and would he not agree that whatever may be our opinions about this debate we should at least get the facts right <e>", "<cs> my lords at the risk of seeming to be simple-minded may i ask why if the fees are fixed from the beginning of the academic year they cannot be fixed on the basis that on st january greece will be a member of the common market <e>", "<cs> my lords if the defence of these resources in time of war is a matter for contingency plans in nato may i ask the noble viscount whose responsibility is it to defend them in times which are not times of war <e>", "<cs> my lords may i perhaps make my question a little clearer for the noble viscount to understand <e> <s> suppose that there is as i suppose the government to believe possible a potential terrorist threat to oil platforms in the north sea oilfields may i at least ask the noble viscount to assure us that there are good and sufficient contingency plans of a national kind to meet that threat <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join other noble lords in <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the treaty to which the noble lord refers applies specifically to nuclear weapons and not as he suggested to weapons in outer space <e> <s> would he not also agree that at the moment the most military satellites operating in outer space are reconnaissance and intelligence satellites by which the super powers monitor each others activities and is not an exchange of intelligence of this kind at the highest possible level desirable <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the secretary of state two supplementary questions <e> <s> one concerns the strait of hormuz <e> <s> does the fact that part of the passage through the strait is in oman territorial waters loom very large in his calculations and are there any contingency plans for a situation in which the territorial waters of oman might be invaded by some ill-intentioned <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join other noble lords in thanking the noble earl for giving us the opportunity of this debate today <e> <s> i am especially <e>", "<cs> my lords that is not quite my point <e> <s> we of course also say that we will use ours in retaliation against the soviet union <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord for allowing me to make this point <e> <s> the difference is that the soviet union makes no bones <e>", "<cs> my lords that may be so but the basic military doctrine of the soviet union still includes the use of nuclear weapons in any war in which it might take part <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way before he moves on from that point <e> <s> he has been very courteous and kind <e> <s> i should like to explain the position regarding my remark referring to lord mountbatten and to lord zuckerman and to what they said and how it has been interpreted <e> <s> of course i and many other noble lords have subscribed fully to what was said there <e> <s> but that has been turned by unilateralists into an argument for unilateral disarmament by this country <e> <s> that is not what lord mountbatten meant nor what lord zuckerman meant <e>", "<cs> my lords may i join other noble lords in extending very good wishes to the noble viscount on the assumption of his duties and equally extending warm good wishes to his predecessor <e> <s> can the noble viscount confirm that no accident involving a nuclear weapon has yet resulted in the loss of a human life and that in fact most of these accidents presented no danger of escape of fissile material <e> <s> would not the noble viscount agree that a record of accidents in years with not one of them resulting in the loss of a human life is a record which we should keep very much in perspective in talking about the terribly grave consequences of these accidents <e>", "<cs> i was not actually making a political point my lords <e> <s> in my view successive governments have shamefully neglected our defences <e> <s> i am not directing blame at one side or the other <e> <s> i wonder whether i may now continue with my speech <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e> <s> i think there was a slip of the tongue and it would be unfortunate if it found its way into the <e>", "<cs> my lords i burdened the house at the beginning of this debate with a long speech and therefore i would not wish to keep your lordships much longer <e> <s> indeed i would have closed matters in three or four minutes had it not been for the noble viscounts most recent remarks in reply to the noble lord lord kaldor <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord need have no fear i shall do it in five minutes precisely <e> <s> first of all i would say that i must really contest the noble viscounts statement and i think i do so on the highest authority that the trident missile has not the accuracy and penetration needed to strike at pinpoint targets in the soviet union <e> <s> that is what it is for <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister if he will confirm that in his reply he was referring exclusively to the trident c missile <e> <s> will he also confirm that it is not the intention of her majestys government to acquire the d missile which is equipped with ten warheads not eight <e> <s> the mark a warhead which has an accuracy of feet and is specifically designed for the destruction of point targets such as soviet missile sites <e>", "<cs> my lords may i intervene briefly partly to congratulate the government on an extremely throughtful statement even if one does not agree with all of it it at least shows welcome signs of having been filtered through some fairly rigorous mental processes and that is a very welcome thing in defence matters <e> <s> may i ask one very quick question the minister may not be able to answer it now but i ask it so that if possible it can be answered at the time of our debate <e> <s> can he say what in terms of the trident agreement with the united states is the position with regard to what are called late spares <e> <s> in other words if the trident production line goes out of action in the united states how do we ensure a continuous supply of spares for trident in the future <e> <s> i should like the noble viscount in answering that question to bear in mind the unfortunate experience we had over chevaline on the polaris missile <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl agree if he does would he not also agree that it is important to make clear that in the event of a nuclear attack upon this country those carrying it out would be most unlikely to respect the wishes of the elected representatives in these rather bizarre nuclear-free zones <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope i shall be forgiven if i refer only briefly to the admirable maiden speeches of the noble lord lord thomas of swynnerton and the noble earl lord orkney <e> <s> my only reason is that time is very short and we shall have an opportunity of hearing them both again on future and perhaps more spacious occasions <e>", "<cs> my lords i should much prefer not to enter into that argument <e> <s> as i said i do not <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> perhaps i might begin my few brief remarks on the unilateralist movement with one more quotation from a leader of public opinion <e> <s> from the communist newspaper <e>", "<cs> my lords i ask the noble lord to give way for a moment because i think that he is totally misrepresenting what i said <e> <s> the views of my noble friends in this house and of my noble colleagues are indeed a matter for them and i have the greatest respect for them <e> <s> what i said and what i stand by is that there are thousands of people in this movement the campaign for nuclear disarmament who are not so intelligent and sophisticated as they are and who are being manipulated by the communists and let us not forget it <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord has made a very serious accusation perhaps he would give way <e> <s> in my speech which the noble lord has called smearing i stated a number of facts from which people may draw their own conclusions <e> <s> will the noble lord deny any of the facts or will he confirm them <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise i would have inscribed myself to speak in this debate had i known for certain that i could come here <e> <s> i shall therefore speak very briefly <e> <s> i want not to join in any disobliging comments about the foreign office or even about the government on this occasion <e> <s> i simply want to say from a personal point of view why i feel so strongly in support of the two motions that have been placed before the house tonight <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that not very informative reply <e> <s> may i ask him what was the reaction of the lord privy seal to the representations made by the south african ambassador <e> <s> may i also ask him whether he is aware that the film referred to accused the south african forces of atrocities including the bayoneting of babies and pregnant women allegations which the film was totally unable to substantiate <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that my question does not refer to the foreign or domestic policies of the government of south africa which i am not here to defend <e> <s> the question refers to a film which the independent broadcasting authority itself has said was not impartial and did not rise even to the minimum standards of journalistic integrity <e> <s> is the noble lord further aware that when the government of saudi arabia made a similar representation to her majestys government about a film which had offended them his noble friend the secretary of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs made a public apology <e> <s> has such an apology been considered in this case <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord not agree that the business of making selective quotations from public figures of this stature to support causes which they never themselves supported is somewhat distasteful and questionable <e> <s> if there is to be a recommendation regarding the inscription on lord mountbattens statue would not the other quotation to which the noble viscount referred <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps it is appropriate that i should follow the right reverend prelate in this debate because i want mainly to talk about the subject to which he referred in the second part of his speech and i want to approach it from perhaps a different angle <e> <s> in the precious time at my disposal in this important debate i want to comment on what seems to me a dangerous phenomenon in the thinking about these matters in the west and to reflect a little on the impact <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall go from this house today enormously encouraged if the leader of the british section of the campaign for nuclear disarmament will assure us that he does not support unilateral nuclear disarmament by the united kingdom <e> <s> if he will do that in the course of his own speech to which i shall listen with great care i shall go away much reassured <e>", "<cs> my lords as the remark was put to me before i sat down perhaps i may say once again as i said earlier to the noble lord that in so far as any political movement is aimed at multilateral disarmament under effective international control i am one of its strongest supporters <e> <s> if in moving towards that it wishes first to make unilateral concessions by this country or the west without comparable concessions from the soviet union i am resolutely and violently against it <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way for one moment <e> <s> when i was making my speech he intervened to say that he was going to say something about the policies of cnd and indeed he has <e>", "<cs> my lords i intend to make it no longer <e> <s> i have made the quotations which seem to me to speak for themselves and i ask the noble lord whether this pamphlet represents the official policy of the campaign for nuclear disarmament <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that in the report to which he referred earlier the calculations are that the soviet union is spending something like million a year on disinformation and destabilisation of nato and that of that something like million a year is being spent on financing peace movements in western europe <e> <s> is he further aware that the question is not whether money is coming into the coffers of this or that organisation but whether or not if the soviet union are spending that kind of money on that kind of operation it is reasonable to infer that all peace movements in western europe are benefiting from it <e>", "<cs> my lords i had originally intended to follow the noble earl lord cathcart and other noble lords in concentrating on the questions of nuclear deterrence and trident and allied problems <e> <s> i decided not to do so for two reasons <e> <s> the first is that like the noble lord lord mayhew i do not believe that this country will ever have trident <e> <s> i believe that the only question is whether the decision not to have it will be made before or after the next general election <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the right reverend prelate my lords and that was entirely my point <e> <s> i wish to exonerate myself from the accusation of the noble duke because that is what i meant as soon as the demonstrators knew the date of the meeting of the world council of churches they arranged their demonstration <e> <s> it was no coincidence <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a critical time in the diplomatic phase of this crisis and like many others of your lordships i was not surprised that there was not much information forthcoming from the government at the beginning of the debate <e> <s> there are some things that are better carried out without a great deal of sound and fury and away from the glare of publicity <e> <s> perhaps i may here interject a small personal parenthesis <e> <s> i think that the government at some stage might regret the lavish endowment of press representatives and media persons who are <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble viscount the minister can he say whether the attack on hms sheffield was an isolated incident or whether it was part of a general naval military engagement which was going on at the time <e> <s> in that context will he assure the house that there will not be too obsessive a concern with the principle of minimum force <e> <s> if we are at war with argentina whether declared or otherwise perhaps it is time for some of the more time-honoured principles of military engagement to come into operation <e> <s> does the noble viscount not agree that the principle of minimum force is more appropriate to internal policing that to a war with a foreign power <e> <s> finally will he assure the house that this one military reverse tragic through <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount is not i fear the last speaker nor indeed i understand am i i had not intended to intervene in this extremely important debate because of the constrictions of time but having heard some of the speeches that have been made and realising that perhaps we have a few minutes left i hope that your lordships will bear with me if i make one or two comments on some of the things that have been said <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join other noble lords in thanking the noble baroness for her impressive statement of the governments case this afternoon <e> <s> it is part of a remarkable manifestation of the working of a parliamentary democracy in which the details of a negotiation and the views of a government can be made clear in the houses of parliament while the crisis is still at its height <e> <s> it is a most heartening demonstration of what this house and the other place are all about <e>", "<cs> my lords although this matter seems to have been treated with a certain amount of levity and amusement may i ask the minister whether it is not a bizarre state of affairs that while the armed forces of the crown arc engaged in hostilities in defence of britain it should he forbidden to display the union jack and to play the national anthem even allowing for the fact that great difficulties were confronting the police <e> <s> if in future a choice has to be made between a demonstration of that kind and one which gives aid and comfort to the enemy would it not be better to ban the latter and not the former <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble viscount some questions and assure him that i ask them in the full knowledge of their implications <e> <s> is it not a fact that some of the tragedies which have taken place in the falkland islands have been the result of setting aside for one reason or another the fundamental military principle that every effort should be made to protect those in the operational area from attack by the enemy by air <e> <s> may i ask her majestys government i ask this in all seriousness and solemnity for how long they can sustain a policy which appears to grant total immunity to the bases from which those air attacks are made <e>", "<cs> the second part contained the whole point of the question my lords namely that one of the elementary ways of achieving air superiority is to attack the bases from which the air attacks are made <e> <s> i recognise that there are difficulties but i am asking a serious question <e> <s> for how long can her majestys government sustain that policy <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i must <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first endorse wholeheartedly the sentiments of the noble lord lord colyton regarding the need for a global strategy to meet a global threat <e> <s> i think that it is something that cannot be said too often <e> <s> may i also echo the sentiments of other noble lords in offering a very warm welcome to the noble lord lord maclehose of beoch <e> <s> i have known him over the years first when i was a transient minister in the foreign office and he was one of its most permanent and distinguished officials and subsequently in my many visits to hong kong where he has been i think one of the most outstanding governors that that island has had the fortune to entertain <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord help me and i think some other members of the house in one respect <e> <s> in comparing the two sides in this way and leaving aside whether there is overkill or not does he agree that one side one alliance and one power is aggressive and the other is defensive <e>", "<cs> my lords since the noble lord insists on suggesting that he might incur my wrath is he aware that it is not my wrath that he incurs but my astonishment <e> <s> is he now telling the house that in the view of the liberal benches the soviet union is not an aggressive expansionist and imperialist power when compared with the united states of america <e> <s> is he denying on behalf of his party that the warsaw pact is an aggressive organisation and that the north atlantic treaty organisation is a defensive one <e> <s> i shall be most grateful for a straight answer to a straight question <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a very great privilege indeed to follow the noble lord lord carrington in this debate and i think that most of your lordships will agree that his speech today has been yet another example of the dignity and the integrity which have characterised his behaviour throughout the whole of this momentous episode <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord lord molloy will permit me to intervene i believe there must have been some terrible misunderstanding <e> <s> i did say in the course of my speech that i thought there was a threat to the security of the west from the soviet union <e> <s> if the noble lord does not believe that perhaps he will say so <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble earl lord cathcart for giving your lordships house the opportunity of this debate <e> <s> i should like to concentrate on a single area which he has mentioned that is the area of central america <e> <s> it seems to me that a good deal of the information and many of the perceptions about this area are somewhat suspect for a number of reasons <e> <s> for example we have had on the television recently and especially on the bbc a series of programmes which have been deplorably one-sided on the subject of events in central america <e> <s> they culminated in a film quite recently i think it was last week which seemed to me to be even more disgraceful than those which preceded it <e> <s> a more recent manifestation has been a remarkably strident and unbalaced article in <e>", "<cs> my lords i do draw that inference from the noble lords speech <e> <s> he seemed to point out for example that in the middle east it was resurgent islam that was causing the instability and that in other areas such as southern africa the great enemy was south africa and apartheid and not the soviet union <e> <s> in central america he pointed to the right-wing oligarchies and their records of brutality over many years <e> <s> i am simply pointing out that there is also the soviet union which seems to me to be a much greater threat to our future than any of those <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that perhaps some facts are sometimes a valuable corrective to the more extreme kinds of fantasy and opinion <e> <s> i should like to look at this area of central america for a moment and to produce if i may in the short time at my disposal a few facts without very many opinions <e> <s> if noble lords can look in their minds eye at that very important area which starts with the northern frontiers of mexico which has a common frontage with four of the southern states of the united states of america which then goes down an ever-narrowing piece of land towards guatemala and honduras through el <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not going to intrude in what appears to be a private fight on the other side of the house and i apologise to the noble lord lord caradon for not following him down the very interesting paths which he trod <e> <s> it is possible as we have already heard to have dissenting views about some of the things which he said <e> <s> i certainly hold some dissenting views but this is not for me at any rate the time to express them <e>", "<cs> i was afraid that this might happen <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already listened to the noble lords arguments very closely <e> <s> i am simply intending to indicate as briefly as possible that i disagree with almost all of them <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that answer <e> <s> will he accept that my supplementary question is purely in the spirit of objective inquiry because the gleneagles agreement seems to me to be somewhat ambiguously drafted <e> <s> is it in fact the policy of her majestys government not to encourage sporting links with countries where as the gleneagles agreement says <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister one final question which is in two parts <e> <s> will he confirm because i want to be absolutely clear about this that the government interpret the gleneagles agreement as requiring not integration in sport but the total abolition of apartheid and secondly are the government convinced that in no other country in the world especially in the british commonwealth is sport organised on the basis of race colour or ethnic origin <e> <s> are the government totally convinced that that exists nowhere else in the world except in south africa <e>", "<cs> my lords i do beg the leave of the house to return to this because that is not the answer to my question <e> <s> i know what is implicit in the gleneagles agreement because i have read it with great care <e> <s> do the government interpret this as being binding upon british policy that before sporting links with south africa may be resumed apartheid has to be abolished <e> <s> that must be a simple yes or no answer <e>", "<cs> my lords as a welshman the fortunes of the english rugby union are not normally a matter of great concern to me <e> <s> however this is a question which goes much wider than that <e> <s> i too like the noble lord lord hatch of lusby have played rugby all over the world <e> <s> i believe that the game of rugby is a great builder of real bridges between people in spite of the noble lords reservations about the value of those bridges in the case of south africa <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that the noble lords question is either too profound or too complicated for me <e> <s> i do not quite understand what he is asking me <e> <s> if he will allow me to get on with my speech the answer to his question may become clear <e> <s> my belief is that if one does not reward in some way the south africans for the changes that have taken place they will eventually resort to that condition which we know so well as the laager syndrome <e> <s> they will withdraw completely from the international community <e> <s> they will say if everything we do is dismissed as cosmetic as unreal and as ineffective <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way just for one moment on a point of definition <e> <s> the south african rugby board consists of all africans <e> <s> there is not a non-african on the board <e> <s> perhaps we can take this up later <e> <s> it is just a question of semantics <e> <s> there are white south africans black south africans and coloured south africans <e> <s> the south african rugby board consists entirely of africans of whom one is black and one is coloured <e>", "<cs> no my lords not native africans black and coloured africans <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the noble lord two questions <e> <s> the first arises from the questions asked by the noble lords lord mishcon and lord paget concerning the right or the privilege of <e>", "<cs> my lords i raised the matter of the school in chelsea <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister confirm that an analysis of these occasions reveals that some of the resolutions would have resulted not in smaller armouries but in larger ones and others would have resulted not in smaller armouries but in the abolition of nuclear weapons which so long as the soviet union retains an overwhelming conventional superiority is not acceptable to the west <e> <s> also will she confirm that none of the resolutions would have resulted in verified balanced arms control <e> <s> that as every serious person knows is the criterion for real arms control agreements <e> <s> will the minister assure the house that the government will continue to vote against any agreement or resolution which does not meet that criterion <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the first question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that at any given time upwards of six cars with diplomatic number plates can be seen parked in the playground of this school and that there is a constant coming and going of people whose appearance leads one to suppose that they have only a tenuous connection with the education of small children <e> <s> will the minister assure the house that these premises have no form of diplomatic immunity and that there is in force a security operation which would give us early warning if the premises were being improperly used <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble baroness for that answer may i ask whether the government are aware that of the eight founder members of this organisation which purports to consist of nato generals four are members of the world peace council a notorious soviet front organisation <e> <s> is she further aware that the founder and controller of this organisation until very recently was dr gerhard kade who is a senior figure in the soviet propaganda apparatus <e> <s> is it not a matter of grave concern that an organisation posing as nato generals for peace might be the instrument of disseminating soviet disinformation <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness the minister aware that i am grateful for the robust answers that she has given to my question <e> <s> is she also aware that i accused no one of being a traitor least of all the british member of this strange organisation <e> <s> is she aware that in my view the links between this organisation and the soviet propaganda organisation are a matter of concern <e> <s> would she not agree that the fact that ex-nato generals who held very high positions should now be meeting serving soviet generals to discuss strategy in western europe is a matter of the gravest concern <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that answer but only moderately <e> <s> is it not ironic that the government should say that they cannot intervene in the relations between the bbc and its employees whereas the case of mr david dimbleby indicates very clearly that there are other people who can interfere in this way <e> <s> is it not outrageous that the bbc should have been dictated to on the question of which reporters it should send to cover party conferences <e> <s> would it not have been proper for the director general of the bbc to tell those who said that mr dimbleby was not acceptable that in that case they would not report the conferences at all <e> <s> is this not an outrageous case of interference with the freedom of the press <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that he has not really answered my question <e> <s> my question was are the government aware of the circumstances and if so do they cause the government any concern <e> <s> i am not suggesting that the government should have intervened or directed in any way <e> <s> my question is does the fact that a journalist has been deprived of the right to pursue his profession because of the pressure of a political organisation cause the government any concern <e> <s> will the noble lord please answer that question <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether or not it is true that the implication of some of these questions whether or not they are directed to the loss of this log is that there was something wrong or doubtful about the sinking of the general belgrano <e> <s> is it not true as the noble lords lord kennet and lord paget of northampton have said that this ship whatever its course speed and destination presented a potential threat to the safety of her majestys ships <e> <s> was it not right therefore that the general belgrano should have been sunk as it was sunk <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may begin by adding my congratulations to those of other noble lords on the two maiden speeches by the noble lord lord eden of winton and the noble lord lord moran <e> <s> they were distinguished contributions to the proceedings of your lordships house <e> <s> i am sure that they will be the first of many such contributions from both noble lords <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that there is at least one occupant of these benches who believes that the supplementary question was relevant <e> <s> is the minister aware that at about the time of the visit to which the noble lord lord orr-ewing has referred one of the periodic soviet planning meetings was taking place and was discussing what is known in soviet strategic jargon as the long march through the institutions of which a principal target is the trade union movement of the west <e> <s> despite some of the very valid representations that have been made from one side of the house is it not truly alarming that a british trade union leader should have made something like to visits of an apparently friendly kind to countries in which democratic trade unionism is systematically and ruthlessly repressed <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether she will convey to the diplomatic service i am sure on behalf of the great majority of your lordships house our admiration for the courage they display in carrying out their duties knowing that they are now the prime targets for international terrorism <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to add a few remarks to what has been an absorbing and informative debate <e> <s> i shall be very brief as i think that this debate has displayed all the qualities of your lordships house indeed all those qualities which some of us fear might be damaged if the motion tonight is carried <e>", "<cs> my lords i speak with some feeling and indeed with some experience of these matters having been a minister in the foreign office responsible for arms control and disarmament matters and having followed this subject very closely ever since i left government <e> <s> when i saw the motion in the name of the noble lord lord molloy i thought that i would be very sharply at odds with him because of the phrase which refers to effective world disarmament <e> <s> however i found that in his speech the noble lord did not seem to be calling for world disarmament but for some more modest measures of arms control <e> <s> i should like therefore simply to take up one or two of the points that he made in what i hope will be a constructive manner <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise if i gave the noble lord the wrong impression <e> <s> i understand what he said and sympathise with his view <e> <s> i am pointing out that it is not the super-powers that is a phrase used often too loosely in the debate but it is the soviet union that has the monopoly of chemical weapons in europe <e> <s> i wish people would understand that this is not a kind of symmetrical competiton between two equals <e> <s> we talk about the super-powers as if able to say a plague on both their houses <e> <s> that is a false and dangerous road to take <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i agree entirely with the noble lord lord kennet <e> <s> the answer to arms <e>", "<cs> my lords i have read the agreement and i have read dr owens letter to the prime minister <e> <s> all i am at pains to point out to the house at the moment is that the prime minister did not oppose the presidents strategic defence initiative <e> <s> i am making that clear and i am seeking to commend her for taking that point of view with the president <e>", "<cs> my lords i really am being interrupted <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i contest that version of events but this is something which obviously we must not continue in the chamber of your lordships house <e> <s> perhaps we can continue it at some other time <e>", "<cs> my lords it bans the stationing of what are virtually nuclear weapons in outer <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord goes on may i set the record straight <e> <s> i said that the soviet union was a potential enemy and not an enemy <e> <s> we are not at war with it <e> <s> secondly i think that the expression i used was that our two systems are irreconcilable <e> <s> my views on co-existence with the soviet union may or may not be of interest but to set the record straight what i said was that totalitarian communism is irreconcilable with liberal democracy <e>", "<cs> my lords before i make my brief contribution to this debate it would be proper to remind your lordships house that through my business directorships of a multi-national computer company a london merchant bank and a business consultancy i have close associations with defence and aerospace industries in the united states in western europe and in the united kingdom <e> <s> this i know will immediately qualify me in some quarters for the description of merchant of death but perhaps in compenstion i might claim that it does give me a <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first congratulate the noble lord lord renton on introducing a debate on this most important subject and also thank the noble lord lord elton for taking us through the governments existing policy on civil defence <e> <s> i am not entirely convinced that that policy is yet vigorous or comprehensive enough especially in the context of whatever action needs to be taken to ensure that local authorities discharge their statutory obligations in the context of civil defence <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the point that the noble lord is making <e> <s> i return to my earlier point that no one knows what would be the result of this or that nuclear scenario <e> <s> i think it would be foolish if we simply assumed that there was only one scenario which was universal holocaust and annihilation and therefore took no action to deal with what might be lesser catastrophes <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord not agree that the experience of the war in the south atlantic demonstrated if it needed demonstrating that a strong merchant fleet is essential for the successful operations of the royal navy in war <e> <s> will he accept that the progressive decline of the british merchant fleet is causing grave disquiet to those of us who are mainly concerned with the defence of this country in time of war <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister assure the house that if there is a proposal for an invitation to mr gorbachev to visit this country it should have some chance of bringing forward constructive ideas and policies <e> <s> will the minister not agree that otherwise summit meetings tend to do more harm than good <e> <s> on the question of the nuclear freeze will she reassure the house that the government are aware that a freeze of the kind now proposed would leave the west at a serious disadvantage <e> <s> will she not agree that russians bearing gifts are to be afeared even more than greeks <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> if political meetings of any kind have taken place at this establishment and there is as the minister has said substantial evidence that they have is this not in itself a matter for grave concern <e> <s> the establishment concerned is meant to be a school <e> <s> in the light of the fact that there is substantial evidence of the infiltration of terrorist groups from libya into this country in recent months does the minister not agree that the activities of this school require far more attention and supervision than they appear to be receiving at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble viscount bear in mind that this is one very rare occasion when i find myself in total agreement with the noble lord lord hatch of lusby that this is not only a matter of trade but also of national security <e> <s> the decline of the merchant navy has considerable implications for our maritime strength as a whole as i think was made abundantly clear at the time of the war in the south atlantic <e> <s> will the noble viscount give serious consideration provided resources are available to setting up a select committee on this most important matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i begin by joining other noble lords in congratulating the noble lord lord crawshaw of aintree on an inspiring maiden speech <e> <s> it is good that we have the expert knowledge of defence in your lordships house which is already quite formidable so brilliantly reinforced <e> <s> i trust that we shall hear him often in your lordships house and also in the all-party defence study group <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a little far from my original theme <e> <s> but to answer the noble lord i would say that it is difficult to lay down rules for warfare <e> <s> i suspect that if they are laid down they will be broken as often as the rules at st andrews are <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e> <s> the question was as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords while i thank the minister for that predictable answer may i ask him whether he is aware that it will come as a great disappointment to many hundreds of thousands of ex-servicemen who fought in the far east and who now see the end of the war in which they fought being marked by our national broadcasting organisation with a piece of tendentious unilateralist propaganda <e>", "<cs> my lords may i as this was originally a question in my name on the order paper ask the government if they cannot influence the bbc in these matters whether they will at least make it clear to the hundreds of thousands of people who are distressed by the appalling timing of the showing of this film which is years old and which it was decided should be released for publication over a year <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister confirm for the enlightenment of the noble lord opposite that the greatest nuclear presence in the pacific ocean is that of the soviet union with nuclear powered and nuclear firing submarines with over nuclear bombers and two major nuclear bases at vladivostok and cam ranh <e> <s> can she for the benefit of the house give some estimate of what she thinks the chances are of getting the soviet union to dismantle all that presence in the interests of bringing the pacific ocean into line with the greater london council <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to prolong the exchange much further and certainly have no wish to embarrass the government in what is an extremely complicated situation <e> <s> but i wonder if i may ask the noble baroness to clarify something which has puzzled me throughout the whole of this unfortunate affair <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not agree that these figures are to some extent without meaning in that no one has any way of calculating the firepower in world war ii <e> <s> would it not be better to stick to the facts which are that the soviet union has twice the megatonnage of the united states of america if we are talking in terms of the firepower of nuclear weapons and that since the soviet union has deployed twice as many weapon systems in the nuclear confrontation as has the united states <e> <s> is that not the main obstacle to the agreement which we hope to get at geneva <e>", "<cs> my lords will not the minister agree that in the rightful concern about who was or was not to blame for improprieties in the procedures which led up to this trial we may be in danger of losing sight of one important matter <e> <s> that matter has already been brought out by the noble lord lord wigoder and i should like to press the minister on it <e> <s> is it not clear beyond any reasonable doubt that classified information bearing upon the security of this nation was passed from this unit in cyprus to a foreign power <e> <s> if that is so and if it were not passed by those who confessed to passing it then is it not a matter of great interest to discover by whom it was passed <e> <s> as in the terms of reference the inquiry to be conducted by mr calcutt does not seem to include any mention of that matter will the minister assure the house that we shall have an inquiry into who passed that information and that when if possible it is known it will be made public irrespective of the decisions made recently in a court of law <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may begin by echoing the tributes that have been paid by other noble lords to the maiden speeches of the right reverend prelate the bishop of leicester and the noble lord lord forres <e> <s> as has been said they were indeed distinguished maiden speeches <e> <s> i should have liked to follow the noble lord lord bauer in his inquiry into the affairs of unesco <e> <s> i should have liked to support his view that this organisation is one for which our country can have very little use and from which the government should as they have given notice they will do withdraw at the end of this year <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord would not seriously expect me to reveal a whole list of sources of information in your lordships house <e> <s> as a matter of fact the figures i gave are in the public domain and were not received by me from any arcane sources <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no practical recommendation and nor did i suggest one <e> <s> i merely said that if we are told that there were grave breaches of security in cyprus and if they were not committed by those who were acquitted when accused then by whom were they committed <e> <s> is anyone else under suspicion or investigation <e> <s> i merely said that when we have the answers to those questions we can draw certain conclusions <e> <s> i make no recommendations <e> <s> frankly for the noble lord to suggest that in asking those questions i am mounting an attack on the jury system is to go way over the top and i hope that on reflection he will realise that <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down is he seriously suggesting that he would take the word of an <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may crave the indulgence of the house to reply to that <e> <s> i have not only seen the report in the <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept that in spite of the very persuasive and logical arguments that he has put there are thousands and thousands of surviving ex-servicemen from the far east campaign who were deeply hurt by the decision to celebrate or to commemorate the end of the war in the way that it was done <e> <s> for many of them the war did not end until japan surrendered <e> <s> may i put what is perhaps a constructive question <e> <s> will the government consider making some belated amends for what seems to many people to be a slight perhaps at the next meeting of the burma star association <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the minister two questions <e> <s> the first question is a simple one namely what is the reaction of her majestys government to the proposal by king hassan of morocco that a high-level international conference should be held to discuss measures against international terrorism <e> <s> secondly does he not agree that a recent disgraceful programme on independent television in which a known terrorist was given minutes of prime time underlines the danger of giving <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the minister aware that many people who have been involved in the discussion about ballistic missile defence since the beginning of the strategic defence initiative will congratulate the government upon this imaginative agreement with the united states of america <e> <s> would the minister not agree that the points which have been put about the escalation of the nuclear arms race are wildly without substance <e> <s> the entire strategic defence initiative is concerned with non-nuclear defence against nuclear weapons <e> <s> is the minister not as surprised as i am that it is characterised in some quarters as an escalation of the nuclear arms race <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness the minister for that reply <e> <s> given the constant increase in the rate of terrorism and the effects of it will she not agree that it will be very little use defending ourselves against acts of terrorism unless we do something about those nations which sponsor and harbour international terrorists and which are proved to have done so <e> <s> this is not a question of alleged sponsors this has been demonstrated and it has been proved that they are sponsors <e> <s> if the noble baroness thinks that economic sanctions are not effective and i have seen no clear evidence of that in other contexts what measures does she suggest that we should bring to bear on states which sponsor international terrorism in order to prevent them from doing so <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether it would be in order to return to the question on the order paper <e> <s> would the minister agree that the danger of further massive acts of terrorism possibly directed against the people of this country is very real <e> <s> the trend shows that this is likely to recur and become more severe in nature <e> <s> in the light of that will the minister assure us that the government will keep an open mind about any kind of riposte which is made against states which sponsor harbour and train terrorists and that they will not be too rigid in their attitude towards economic sanctions <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that there are two nations which possess nuclear weapons which do not take part in any of the discussions on nuclear arms control and would be unlikely to take any notice of a comprehensive test ban anyway <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that although he dismissed the supplementary question of his noble friend somewhat cursorily in fact it contains an important subsidiary question <e> <s> is it not true that the use of merchant ships in wartime is an extremely important element of royal naval operations <e> <s> would it not be possible to include anti-submarine devices on merchant ships converted for the purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord would give way may i ask him on what possible authority he states that president reagan called his programme star wars <e> <s> it is a designation which he loathes and in fact it was invented by a headline writer on one of the american national newspapers <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to beg the indulgence of the house at the beginning of my remarks on two counts <e> <s> the first is that i fear my speech may be slightly longer than would seem apropriate for someone speaking from the back-benches late at night on an unstarred question <e> <s> the second is that what i have to say may be somewhat tedious and technical in content <e>", "<cs> my lords that may well be so as i have as yet read nothing of what either the noble lord or the right reverend prelate has said <e> <s> i shall do so with great interest tomorrow morning <e> <s> if i find i am wrong i shall at once apologise <e> <s> i somehow suspect that i shall find myself right <e>", "<cs> my lords i could quote several cases of people saying that research is forbidden under the terms of the treaty because it will inevitably lead to development and deployment and there are those who have suggested and i do not say that the noble lord has done so but he asked the question that the experimental research going on at the moment in the <e>", "<cs> precisely my lords <e> <s> of course it does <e> <s> the united states president has made clear as i shall make clear again in a moment if the house will be patient for a short while longer that he will not proceed to development and deployment without such discussion <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will be patient i will quote some facts to him which will make it clear i think that the united states takes a very restrictive view of the treaty and has said so <e> <s> if the noble lord will contain himself in patience for a moment i will come to that point <e>", "<cs> yes precisely my lords <e> <s> we are at one on this <e> <s> i do not contest this with the noble lord for one moment <e> <s> what i am saying and he will know i hope is that articles and of the treaty provide for the treaty to be amended under a special standing consultative commission and that if the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord but i feel that this exchange should not go on the record without at least a comment <e> <s> what the pentagon said in was that the united states was ahead in some technologies of space defence and that the soviet union was ahead in others <e> <s> i think that we should be quite clear and quite accurate about these things <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact that this bill has had to be introduced at all is a sad reflection on contemporary standards of integrity in much of british public life <e> <s> the conventions which have governed the conduct of local government for generations have broken down or rather they are being progressively dismantled by a growing group of political activists who as the noble lord lord bellwin said having failed to achieve a power base in national politics now turn to the local councils to seek and to seize power which they use both to propagate extremist political dogma and through the new concept of the local state as it is called to pursue policies in areas of national importance which are reserved constitutionally as other noble lords have said for this parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> in the context of this bill i am not prepared to comment on the use of money by central government <e> <s> my understanding however since the matter has already been brought up in the house is that propaganda by the major political parties in this country in terms of national government is paid for by the political parties themselves and not by the exchequer <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that this might turn out to be a somewhat futile exchange <e> <s> there is a vast difference between the expenditure of money by government public relations in putting forward the policies of the government and the action of extremist political parties in local authorities peddling the propaganda of their parties and not of their authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords it is proof experience <e> <s> i have looked through this list and checked every single item on it <e> <s> i have looked into its background <e> <s> there is not one single group on that organisation which does not campaign in a sense which is favourable to the ruling group in the camden council <e> <s> i shall give the noble lord this list and if he can show me one which does not i shall withdraw accordingly <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by apologising for the fact that soon after i complete my speech i shall have to leave the house for a while because <e>", "<cs> my lords in spite of what members of the opposition may have assumed when i said that i shall return immediately after my long-standing appointment <e> <s> so they need not breathe any sighs of relief <e> <s> first i should like to join the noble baroness lady cox in the tribute that she paid to the many hard-working professionally conscientious teachers in the schools of this country <e> <s> nevertheless there remains a problem <e> <s> i should like to concentrate on one important aspect of that problem namely peace studies <e> <s> they were mentioned by the noble baroness and have since been taken up by other speakers <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will be patient he will find that in my speech i shall give some indication of the extent to which this process is happening <e> <s> i hope that i may be able to develop my argument without too much interruption but i quite understand that at times noble lords will want to put their own points even in the middle of my speech <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry if this is not adequate evidence <e> <s> i have studied not only this one syllabus i have studied many of the syllabuses <e> <s> what i have done is to choose the mildest and most modest of them all <e> <s> if that is not evidence then i shall have to try to do better in future <e>", "<cs> my lords in considering the possibly disastrous effect that armed police may have on tourists at london airport will the noble earl also bear in mind the deterrent effect that it might have on terrorists <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree that there are people in south africa for example chief gatsha buthelezi and mrs helen suzman both of whom are freedom fighters of impeccable reputation who are against the imposition of sanctions on south africa <e> <s> is it not strange that the freedom fighters in south africa are less extreme than some of the freedom fighters in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like if i may to express my appreciation as other noble lords have expressed theirs to the noble lord lord rhodes for allowing us to debate this question briefly in your lordships house this afternoon <e> <s> the noble lord certainly qualifies under the rules laid down by the noble earl lord limerick as a very old friend of china <e> <s> as it seems in order to advance ones qualifications for speaking in this debate perhaps i may say that my first visit to china took place years ago as a young army officer but as that was before the revolution it is perhaps somewhat irrelevant to todays debate <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister give the house an assurance that the so-called minister for sport will not use his position to influence individual citizens in their rights to play their sport whether the sport be rugby football judo darts or anything else anywhere in the world where they may wish to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept that in asking my question i was not referring to the gleneagles agreement which as he will know refers to representative teams and not to the activities of individuals <e> <s> may i ask again if the minister will give an assurance that pressures will not be brought to bear on individuals as opposed to representative teams to prevent them from playing their games and sports anywhere in the world where they may wish to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept that there are many people both in your lordships house and in the country who are becoming somewhat tired of the instant adversarial politics in which any statement by the government is the subject of instant and pavlovian hostility by the opposition <e> <s> will he further accept that if it is indeed true that he declined an invitation to appear on breakfast television to discuss this problem he is to be congratulated on declining to trivialise a problem which is of enormous importance and which on that programme would probably have declined into a punch-up with an opposition spokesman <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the supplementary question put by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter in considering the publication referred to by the noble lord lord jenkins will the government also take note of another publication namely the italian newspaper <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister ensure that there is no confusion when he comes to promulgate plans for the plant breeding institute <e> <s> because to many of us in this house pbi means poor bloody infantry <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble viscount will allow me to place this matter in a slightly broader context <e> <s> is the noble viscount aware that since when records of terrorist events were begun there have been between and separate serious terrorist incidents <e> <s> during the course of those incidents rather more than people have been killed and rather more than people have been seriously injured <e> <s> of those incidents all except a very small percentage something like per cent <e> <s> or per cent have been against people citizens or property of western democracies <e> <s> ought we not to take that into account when considering this one single example of the use of military force in an attempt to bring the assault upon world structure and western democracy to an end <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that some of us are rather surprised and concerned at the expressions which seem to be very prevalent at the moment that this country has been dragged into the front line in this war <e> <s> would she not agree that we have been in the front line for many years in this war <e> <s> would she not also agree and would she accept from me that in this war between terrorism and the forces of civilisation many of us would not wish to be anywhere else but in the front line <e>", "<cs> my lords recent events have been argued and rehearsed fully both in another place and in your lordships house today <e> <s> i should like to concentrate on two lessons for the future that emerge i believe from these events <e> <s> if i may be allowed to begin on a personal note i have spent the greater part of my adult life in terrorism or perhaps to save misunderstanding i should say counter-terrorism of one kind or another <e> <s> in my service in the army i fought in three counter-terrorist campaigns <e> <s> since then i have been involved for nearly years in studying terrorism with colleagues in the united states and elsewhere <e> <s> it may interest your lordships to know that we are in the process of setting up in london an international institute for the study of terrorism and methods by which we might effectively combat it <e> <s> it has however seemed to me for some time this was underlined today by the speech of the most reverend primate that perhaps the true nature and scale of terrorism is still not fully understood <e> <s> people pay lip-service to it <e> <s> they say that terrorism is a great problem and that we must deal with it <e> <s> and then they go on to more important matters <e>", "<cs> my lords they have done so consistently when faced with international terrorism for reasons of economic self-interest commercial greed and short-sighted nationalism <e> <s> it seems to me therefore that two grave and urgent problems now face us <e> <s> one is certainly the defeat of international <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of the reference in the original question to the ultimate abandonment of nuclear weapons will the government bear in mind the implications and indeed dangers of abandoning nuclear weapons in isolation from other measures of arms control and disarmament <e>", "<cs> my lords if my question goes too wide of the answer to the private notice question i am sure the noble lord will tell me <e> <s> however i wonder whether the government have any comment to make on the circumstance in which the common market is now exporting to libya meat and butter at a fraction of the prices at which they are available in this country <e> <s> if this circumstance is true is it not strange that we should be deporting libyan nationals and at the same time exporting to libya material which will enable them to divert resources to the terrorist activity in which they have been engaged for too many years <e> <s> is this not an example of the curious attitude of the ec towards the libyan problem <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister make it clear that the view of the government on this matter is irrespective of what are called the underlying problems in the middle east that no political situation of any kind justifies the indiscriminate murder and maiming of innocent men women and children m the pursuit of political aims <e>", "<cs> my lords what we are talking about here <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for not allowing the noble baroness a fair hearing <e> <s> is the minister aware that what we are talking about as regards the bookspace is an area which used to be the restaurant of the festival hall with a beautiful view over the thames an area which the new authority intends to return to that use <e> <s> is he further <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness tell us exactly how the consumer is supposed to know whether a bottle has been tested or not as in the case of some italian wines it might be difficult to do so simply by tasting <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government aware that when the noble lord says that to prohibit the use of nuclear weapons was precisely what the protocol was intended to do he is inaccurate because there is nowhere in protocol i or protocol ii of the additional protocols to the geneva convention which mentions nuclear weapons at all <e> <s> indeed during the negotiation of these protocols it was repeatedly made clear that nuclear and micro-biological weapons were not meant to be included <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for intervening twice in the course of one question but would it not be useful as a point of information in the context of this question and answer to point out that of the five nuclear powers two have not signed the protocol and those three that have signed have not ratified <e> <s> furthermore is it not true that articles and of the protocol only come into effect when there is a state of war which is precisely what the nuclear deterrent is supposed to prevent <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of this accident which may yet prove to be even more serious than we suspect does the minister draw any useful conclusions from the fact that most of the protests against it in this country have taken place against our own department of energy rather than against the soviet embassy <e> <s> will the minister care to speculate on what would be happening in grosvenor square now if this accident and the secrecy surrounding it had taken place in the united states of america <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that there is considerable evidence that the american action has caused certain governments to think twice about supporting international terrorism and that there is further evidence that the terrorists themselves have been deprived of some of the support that they have enjoyed over recent years <e> <s> should we not take that into consideration when looking at the weighty deliberations of the security council and the third world conference <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by expressing mild dismay at the increasing recurrence of occasions upon which it is required that noble lords should deploy arguments on matters of extremely profound international importance in the space of five to seven minutes <e> <s> that seems to me to be an unreason-able demand to place upon members who often have deep knowledge of the subject under consideration <e> <s> i ask the usual channels to pool their undoubted wisdom to see whether we can avoid these occasions in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord can of course add on time for stoppages if he wishes <e> <s> the noble lord criticises my policies and those of any other noble lord but i do not believe that he has the faintest idea of what my policies are <e> <s> indeed i have given no indication of them this afternoon <e> <s> i have made some descriptive facts available to your lordships house <e> <s> they do not give any reason for the noble lord to deduce any policies from them <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have liked to take the speech of the noble lord lord hatch very much more at length than i shall be able to at this late hour of the evening <e> <s> i should however at the end of my remarks like to take up one specific point that he made <e> <s> before i make my brief contribution to tonights debate i offer my personal congratulations to the right honourable gentleman the foreign and commonwealth secretary for the patience courtesy and fortitude with which he carried out a mission which was probably one of the most difficult missions ever undertaken by a british foreign secretary and which was undertaken in circumstances of enormous personal difficulty <e>", "<cs> precisely my lords <e> <s> that is why i am surprised at the remark <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord leaves that point i want briefly to say that if the noble lord will read <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount aware that one of the attacks against which a nuclear power station is particularly vulnerable is an attack by terrorists with heat seeking missiles of some kind <e> <s> is he further aware that in france where nuclear power accounts for a substantial percentage of electricity generation this threat is taken very seriously indeed <e> <s> is he also aware that the french criterion is that their nuclear power stations should be proof against all but an all-out missile attack directed at the nuclear power stations themselves <e> <s> can he give the house an assurance as i am sure he can that our own nuclear power stations are as secure as that at least as far as we can make them <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the minister of state agree that it is a matter of profound regret that this soviet front organisation is for the first time holding its bogus peace conference in a nato country <e> <s> is the noble baroness aware that some of us remember that in when the organisation tried to hold its conference in the united kingdom the government of the day refused to issue visas to the delegates and the world peace council had to take its trojan horse elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords following the exchange concerning the incidence of aids in prison is it true that medical statistics show a close correlation between aids and promiscuous homosexual activity <e> <s> if that is so are we in any way inhibited from making that clear in the information which we give to our people to enable them to avoid this dreadful disease <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that not all of us were shocked by the result of the reykjavik meeting because not all of us were terribly surprised by it <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble baroness whether it is not true that the policy of <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister confirm the findings of a report i read recently <e> <s> one of the conclusions stated that the problem was not only the provision of facilities but persuading women to attend for screening especially on recall <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that his reply to the noble lord lord kennet might be misunderstood <e> <s> would it not be a more accurate formulation to say that nato will not be the first to use military force but that that does not preclude the first use of nuclear weapons in response to a conventional attack <e> <s> secondly does he agree in the light of other questions put to him that it is indeed desirable that there should be a great deal of linkage in these negotiations <e> <s> in other words would he not agree that it would be dangerous to agree on radical measures of nuclear disarmament without dealing with the conventional balance <e> <s> does he not also agree that any arms control agreements of radical kind should not be concluded without some linkage with the soviet attitude on human rights <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for prolonging this exchange which i think your lordships will admit is an important one but may i ask the minister whether he agrees that when the noble lord lord gladwyn says that if intermediate range nuclear missiles are removed from the equation but one has the capacity to retaliate with strategic missiles the balance of conventional forces does not therefore matter that is the classic enunciation of the doctrine of massive retaliation <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with mounting concern to some of the exchanges which have taken place so far <e> <s> is it really possible that people do not understand what is going on in vast areas of this country especially in our centres of higher education <e> <s> i wonder were we not moved recently by the cries that came from four of the eastern european countries from people who were crying out to the rest of the world to bring them back some of their freedoms <e> <s> if one had asked them as i have asked many of them what is the freedom that they most cherish and the absence of which they most regret it would be the freedom of speech <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i briefly set the record straight <e> <s> i do not have a low opinion of the vice-chancellors of universities <e> <s> for most of them i have a high opinion and great admiration but that is totally irrelevant to the purpose of this clause <e>", "<cs> my lords like many of your lordships i am sure i am grateful to the noble lord lord thorneycroft for giving us the opportunity to debate this important issue today <e> <s> i want to begin my remarks by stating quite clearly that my own views on this subject have changed radically over the years <e> <s> i hope that that may save a great deal of research on the part of those who may want to quote from my earlier writings or speeches because not only do i concede but i claim that my views have changed quite radically <e> <s> they have not changed on the subject of defence because i have always believed in and supported an unequivocally strong defence policy for this country <e> <s> however i have changed my view on the need for and the desirability of a british nuclear deterrent <e> <s> i have done so because the circumstances have changed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> that is a difference of about per cent <e> <s> we must be grateful to the noble lord for admitting his mistake <e> <s> however a more important point is that all that the noble lord said in so far as it reflects the defence policy of the labour party seems to me to be based on a fallacy which was implicit in the noble lords rhetorical question early on in his speech do we or do we not want total nuclear disarmament <e> <s> the answer is simple no we do not want total nuclear disarmament in isolation <e> <s> as part of an overall disarmament agreement yes we would want it but to suggest that we should get rid of nuclear weapons in isolation is in my view not only misconceived but positively dangerous <e> <s> i shall explain one reason why i believe that that is so <e>", "<cs> my lords no the figures i have mentioned take account of the difference in division size because the difference in the actual numerical strength of the division is less important than the battle efficiency of that division <e> <s> i take the assumption which incidentally the institute for strategic studies takes that a soviet division although it might be smaller than some nato ones is at least as effective <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i should like to ask him whether in the interest of strict accuracy he will refer once again to the publication of the international institute for strategic studies <e> <s> there he will find that the figure of is a global figure which includes all american forces even those in the continental united states and that the figures for the confrontation in europe are respectively for tank divisions and for other divisions in other words a superiority of in the european theatre of war <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to interrupt the noble lord in mid-speech but it might be as well to ask him whether he is aware that the memorandum upon which that leader from william haley was based was part of a memorandum attacking the policy of unilateralism and unilateral disarmament and suggesting that this should be done in the context of multilateral arms control agreements <e> <s> i think it is important that your lordships house should know that <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that it might be wise to remember that in matters of disarmament and security the interests of the three countries mentioned in the question are not always identical <e> <s> can she give an assurance that even when we are co-ordinating our views with those other two countries we will bear our own special interests disarmament and security inside the western alliance very much in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for her reply <e> <s> i should like to ask whether she is aware that it leaves many very important questions unanswered <e> <s> is it not true that while the plo was occupying premises under the umbrella of the arab league it was an unlikely target for other factions of the palestinian terrorist movement <e> <s> would she not agree that now it has a separate office with the umbrella of the arab league removed and in another part of london it is a much more attractive target for factions such as the abu nidal group which has been conducting murderous terrorist activities against the plo over many years <e>", "<cs> my lords i must begin by offering an apology to the house which i have already offered to both front benches and to the noble baroness <e> <s> i shall not be able to stay for the end of the debate <e> <s> i know that this is not a popular activity in your lordships house but on this occasion i was anxious to take part in this important debate <e> <s> i hope that the house will forgive me therefore <e>", "<cs> my lords with the indulgence of the house perhaps i can say that there is published in the document a full list of people whom these people claim as their supporters <e> <s> the noble baroness quoted some of them this evening <e> <s> the list is very much longer and i think the noble lord would find it extremely interesting <e>", "<cs> my lords now that mr gorbachev has belatedly conceded that the strategic defence initiative does not stand in the way of future arms control negotiations does the noble baroness agree that it might be as well for us to accept it too and concentrate on the business of achieving serious arms control agreements <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord have any sympathy at all with the somewhat old-fashioned view that some of the publicity and advertising connected with the campaign is distasteful insensitive and in some cases downright offensive <e> <s> will the government use their influence to persuade some of the more imaginative advertising agencies to control their more esoteric exercises in appealing to what seems to be the worst instincts of the general public <e>", "<cs> my lords in the interests of strict accuracy and the best use of time in your lordships house will the minister confirm first that there is no development taking place in sdi that there is only research and that therefore there is no development to stop <e> <s> secondly will she confirm that at the moment there is no projected arms control negotiation that relies upon any conditions on sdi <e> <s> therefore is not the original question on the order paper totally irrelevant <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the noble baroness agree that nato as a military defence alliance is a most inappropriate body to be represented at arms control and disarmament discussions <e> <s> does not she further agree that if it were represented there would also be representation from the warsaw pact <e> <s> as the warsaw pact would be representing the russian point of view would not this be somewhat unbalanced <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware most people would agree with the franks committee that section of the official secrets act is a mess <e> <s> will the minister also agree that many people believe that the problem is not that the section is too restrictive but that it is too permissive <e> <s> will he bear in mind that when the government considers repeal or amendment of section we should always have some kind of inhibition against the activities of people who seek to expose real official secrets involving national security of this country to the world at large <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that this severe reduction in the mercantile marine of the united kingdom will have a very serious effect upon the ability of the royal navy to perform its tasks in wartime <e> <s> will the government take this aspect of the merchant fleet very seriously indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords i join in all the expressions of sympathy for the victims and the families of the victims of this form of terrorism but does the minister agree that expressions of outrage and revulsion are unlikely to make any impression on these people <e> <s> does he agree that the object of terrorism is to terrorise <e> <s> it is to cause revulsion and fear <e> <s> i ask the minister two specific questions arising out of these latest incidents <e> <s> first are the government content that the known and obvious targets of terrorism are given proper advice about sensible precautions to be taken in the conduct of their daily lives <e>", "<cs> my lords following upon the question of the noble lord lord jenkins will the government continue to point out in the discussions that if all nuclear weapons are by these negotiations removed from europe the only deterrent then to aggression will be strategic nuclear weapons <e> <s> we shall therefore have returned to the dangerous doctrine of massive retaliation <e> <s> i do not know whether that is what the nuclear disarmers want <e> <s> will the noble baroness also assure the house that we shall stick to one of the basic principles of all arms control and disarmament negotiations which is to treat nuclear weapons and conventional weapons together and in phase and not to concentrate on one or the other <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of these exchanges can the noble lord clear up some confusion about nuclear-free zones <e> <s> is it not true that a nuclear-free zone in the usually accepted sense of the phrase means an area in which there are no nuclear weapons stock-piled stored or deployed <e> <s> as that can scarcely be the business of local authorities would it not be more accurate to say that they are zones free of protection against nuclear attack <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that not entirely encouraging reply <e> <s> i should like to ask him whether it is not true that the evidence would be forthcoming in the course of the inquiry which i have suggested <e> <s> i have a further supplementary point <e> <s> having regard to the requirements for quality and balance of output contained in such documents as the broadcasting act the charter for the british broadcasting corporation and the representation of the people act perhaps i may ask this question <e> <s> are the government satisfied that the responsibilities laid down in those documents are being fully and satisfactorily discharged by the broadcasting authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask the minister whether he is aware that in spite of some of the comments that have been made on either side of the house my question was not in fact directed to any political bias or partiality at all <e> <s> in spite of the somewhat hilarious reaction from the other side if he looks at the acts to which i have referred he will see that they refer not only to partiality and objectivity but to the quality and balance of the broadcast output <e> <s> it was that to which i was referring and not to any question of political bias at all <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may make the point that i made that remark because from that side of the house came the suggestion that this proposal had come from this side of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i intervene only to make the point that my main criticism was based upon the fact that the bbc itself expresses editorial opinions <e> <s> i am not against people having individual opinions but the bbc is debarred by its licence from expressing opinions as it has done <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness give way for a moment <e> <s> in what way is criticism of the bbc right wing <e> <s> that is a most curious remark <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble baroness will give way for one moment while i ask her whether she does not regard the bbcs licence as imposing a statutory duty upon it <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that as chairman of the institute for the study of terrorism i attend frequent meetings in the united states western europe and elsewhere <e> <s> the government have a very high reputation for their attitude to terrorism and the extent to which they are prepared to engage in international co-operation <e> <s> in the context of the supplementary question that was asked by the noble lord lord campbell may i put one specific question to him <e> <s> can he give the house an assurance that her majestys government are keeping a very careful eye on the activities of the very large number of iranian students in london <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister comment on the report that there is to be an independent inquiry into the accuracy of weather forecasting in advance of the event <e> <s> if the reports are true will he tell the house what the point of that curious exercise would be <e> <s> is it suggested that had the forecasting been more accurate the situation would have changed <e> <s> would people around the country have stayed up all night propping up trees or sitting on roofs <e> <s> can he assure the house that there will be no public expenditure on what would seem to be an unnecessary exercise <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister care to comment on some of the criticisms and speculation which have appeared in the media regarding the tragic accident of the train in wales at the time of the floods <e> <s> is he in a position to say given the forthcoming inquiry that that tragic accident took place in spite of what i believe to have been some quite clear and thorough security precautions <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister confirm that there are nearly soviet troops in afghanistan including troops of the mvd and the kgb <e> <s> will he also confirm that fundamentalist counter-revolutionaries is a phrase used by the soviet union to describe the mujahideen <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government take steps to publicise the cluster effect in statistical analysis referred to by my noble friend a moment ago and warn the public against drawing the kind of false conclusions that have been drawn by the noble lord opposite <e>", "<cs> my lords while it is understandable that we should express revulsion and an appalling sense of outrage at these events will the noble lord accept as i have said before in your lordships house that this is very unlikely to have any effect on the people who have committed these crimes <e> <s> this is after all what they are about doing <e> <s> they want to create a sense of fear and outrage <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that answer <e> <s> however is it not true that under clause of the royal charter of the bbc the home secretary has direct responsibility for ensuring that the conditions of the charter and the licence and agreement granted by the home secretary are observed <e> <s> has anyone in the home department seen this film and recommended to the home secretary whether or not the bbc is in breach of its charter <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware of two matters that arise from his answers <e> <s> the first concerns his assertion that the programme was a work of fiction <e> <s> if he refers to the <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware i am sure he is that the conditions under which these prisoners are kept are apparently appalling even by the most primitive standards of this kind of behaviour <e> <s> in the light of the questions which have already been put to the minister will he give the house an assurance that her majestys government will collaborate not only with the united nations but with the european commission and the organs of the ec in applying whatever pressure is possible upon the government of ethiopia in respect of the barbaric procedures being followed in the case of these prisoners <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord need not convince anyone of that point <e> <s> it has never been an article of my faith that the bbc is a nest of subversives <e> <s> this is a very specific point on the provisions of the charter <e> <s> i hope that he will not misrepresent my views <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord again <e> <s> i would not have done so had he not invited me to <e> <s> nothing that i have said tonight has any relevance to the media monitoring unit <e> <s> none of my evidence comes from it <e> <s> i have not referred to it <e> <s> it is totally irrelevant to my argument <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the house and to all those who have taken part in an extremely valuable and stimulating debate <e> <s> the arguments on both sides were adduced for the most part constructively and thoughtfully <e> <s> before begging leave to withdraw the motion i shall make two brief points <e> <s> the first is that there seemed in some speeches to be a misunderstanding of the aim and the object of the motion <e> <s> it was not my intention to suggest that the bbc is as someone said a nest of subversives or that it is as someone else said a left-wing conspiracy <e> <s> that is not my view therefore it would have been surprising had i put it forward <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister confirm to put this matter in a broader context that any citizen of this country whether sportsman or businessman is perfectly free to conduct his business anywhere he wishes in the world whether in the soviet union south africa or anywhere else <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble baroness who is to speak next for intervening at such short notice <e> <s> i do so briefly and for one reason which is this <e> <s> in the debate so far there has been no shortage of remarks and comments on the deficiencies of the draft basic law document <e> <s> it is therefore right that someone at least should say that it is also in many ways a remarkable document considering the problems <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the efforts of the government especially the department of trade and industry to raise the level of awareness of business and industry in this country are much admired and appreciated <e> <s> nevertheless can he assure the house that the government will try to ensure that our eyes are not taken off the ball of the single european market in by irrelevant arguments about european federalism <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the minister agree that the abolition of mi <e> <s> or our security services is almost as unthinkable as the abolition of the noble lords lord molloy and lord jenkins of putney <e> <s> does he not further agree that if it came to an agonising choice most of us would decide in favour of keeping mi <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not ask this question in a carping mood but does the minister accept that it might be possible to add a note of dissent to that answer <e> <s> if we hope that <e>", "<cs> my lords in order to complete the statistical picture before we leave the subject is the minister able to say from figures in the governments possession how many people in this country were struck by meteorites last year <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we are more than usually grateful to the noble lord lord home of the hirsel for introducing this motion today <e> <s> he introduced it with the authority and experience that we should have expected <e> <s> i suspect that many members of your lordships house will not be surprised when i dissent from some of the more enthusiastic reactions that there have been in the west to the phenomena of <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble baroness give way <e> <s> this is the way that myths are created <e> <s> i never said that i had a mistrust of the soviet leadership <e> <s> what i said was that they had motives of their own and that they might fail <e> <s> i never used the word mistrust nor did i indicate it <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister assure us that if after one problem is that of accommodation for the gurkhas when they leave hong kong he will investigate fully the possibility of stationing another battalion in brunei where the training facilities are excellent <e>", "<cs> my lords i must begin by declaring an obvious interest <e> <s> as deputy chairman of the independent broadcasting authority and chairman-designate of the radio authority which will be established when the bill comes on to the statute book i naturally reflect the collective views of both those bodies though i emphasise that the opinions i express in this debate today are my personal opinions and i alone am responsible for them <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> what i am saying is that in the case of the three national commercial radio channels we are not talking about local radio now which as your lordships know has no quality threshold and it is simply a matter of selection among the various applicants there are now two provisions <e> <s> one is that the three channels must be different in their programme content <e> <s> that already provides the radio authority with one instrument of ensuring a degree of quality <e> <s> if one takes that together with the provision that in certain exceptional circumstances the radio authority is not required to award a franchise or licence to the highest bidder one has a sufficient instrument in the hands of the radio authority to determine that the national commercial channels will be of a high quality <e>", "<cs> given my interest as the deputy chairman of the independent broadcasting authority and my future position in the itc and the radio authority i am like the noble lord lord barnett reluctant to intervene in a committee stage of a bill <e> <s> i shall not venture to express any opinion on these amendments nor shall i vote upon them should a vote be required <e>", "<cs> i am speaking as a member of the committee and in no other capacity <e> <s> i declared my interest at the beginning as i am required to do <e> <s> i said that i would not comment upon the amendment or vote on it <e> <s> i sought to give the committee what i believed would be some valuable information about matters which are under discussion <e> <s> what i said about the code of practice outlines what we in the iba there is no such thing as the itc or radio authority at the moment propose in due course to circulate and publish <e> <s> we shall consult all those interested before the code and the guidelines are formalised and finalised <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may make one brief point with the indulgence of the committee <e> <s> there seems to be a new mantra in the debate who is to be the judge of impartiality <e> <s> it is absolutely clear in the bill who is to be the judge of impartiality <e> <s> clause states that the independent television commission shall do all it can to ensure impartiality it shall draw up a code of conduct governing impartiality and it shall punish those who fall below those standards <e> <s> this curious rhetorical question of who is to be the judge of impartiality is answered in the bill <e>", "<cs> as the chairman designate of the radio authority it would obviously not be appropriate for me to become too closely involved in the philosophy of this debate <e> <s> however i said on second reading and i have said also in conversation with members of the government that i believe it to be important and possible to distinguish community radio from other forms of commercial radio <e>", "<cs> my lords i must declare as i always do my interest as chairman designate of the radio authority <e> <s> perhaps i may remind the house that when we speak of the revenues of the radio authority the sole source of revenue of the radio authority will be the programme companies themselves <e> <s> therefore were the radio authority to use some of those revenues to prop up unsuccessful stations which seems to be the thrust of this amendment it could only be at the expense of the programme companies and logically the successful programme companies <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be of service to your lordships house if i very briefly reiterate the position of the independent broadcasting authority and that of the shadow itc on both of which bodies i serve as deputy chairman <e> <s> an opinion has been expressed on several occasions during the debate on this amendment today <e> <s> sometimes it has been represented not entirely accurately and on other occasions people have sought to interpret it to place glosses upon it and to refer to the advice upon which it was based <e> <s> it is not my intention at this late stage to rehearse any of the arguments about the history of the amendment or to go into any detail <e> <s> i simply wish to reiterate precisely what is the position of the shadow itc and the iba <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may trespass on the patience of the house to make two points <e> <s> the first is simply to point out that the radio guidelines which have been referred to twice today in the context of religious matters are contained in a consultative document which has been issued for the moment purely for consultation <e> <s> there will be no radio guidelines until that consultation is complete <e>"]
