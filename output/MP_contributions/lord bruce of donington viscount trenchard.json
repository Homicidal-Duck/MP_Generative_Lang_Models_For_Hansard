["<cs> may i make clear as my noble friend lord cullen was going to do in replying to the points on this amendment that amendments nos <e> <s> and are the two amendments which we plan to accept with the leave of the committee <e> <s> but we shall wish to speak to the detail of clause and clause of the bill <e>", "<cs> i would assure the noble lord that we shall study the implications of the fourth directive in relation to this issue very carefully indeed <e> <s> we have spoken at length in relation to this subject of loans and i will not detain the committee but merely say that i hope in view of what has already been said and the assurance that i have just given the noble lord will not press this amendment <e>", "<cs> my recommendation is that the committee should accept this amendment <e> <s> i am not entirely clear about the procedure as to how we get schedule moved in the way that the noble lord lord bruce of donington suggests <e>", "<cs> i confess to being not content and also to being lost <e> <s> if i have to do so i shall promise to go back and look at it but i understand this to be part of a subject which we have not agreed <e>", "<cs> i have some points to make of a general nature later and i shall hold them but may i just deal with the technical points in relation to these amendments before the noble lord lord rochester speaks because that might be helpful <e> <s> the words or to a nominee of his which these amendments seek to remove are necessary to avoid a difficulty which could arise under section of the companies act <e> <s> this is because some of the provisions of a limited liability company would not apply if there is only one member of a company <e> <s> for these provisions to apply there have to be two or more shareholders <e> <s> that is the whole purpose of the words which the amendments seek to remove <e>", "<cs> my lords we explored very fully the purposes of clause both technical and substance at the committee stage and i resist the amendment for the same reasons as we adumbrated at committee stage <e> <s> the noble lord lord bruce of donington has raised two issues which i suppose by a thread could be attached to clause of the bill and i think it necessary for me briefly to comment on them <e>", "<cs> my lords in our view planning agreements do not have a part to play in the kind of way in which we believe the government can steadily not all at once with any magic wand improve the climate and conditions for the efficiency of british industry <e> <s> they really were a dead letter from the start <e> <s> there have been only two planning agreements one with a company which was being rescued by the government and the other with a nationalised industry <e> <s> both agreements have lapsed and will not be renewed <e> <s> therefore we believe that this power which is certainly fundamentally inconsistent with the governments approach to their relations with industry should be removed <e>", "<cs> i have some sympathy with some of the thoughts of the noble lord lord bruce of donington on this subject <e> <s> i feel that he has not got off his pram but he has gone a little over the top <e> <s> i will reserve my main remarks for an amendment that among others is down in my name amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i do not think i could support the noble lords amendment because it is phrased so deliberately anti-import and the practicality of exact reciprocal agreements between different countries is something that no secretary of trade under either government has ever been able completely to achieve <e>"]
