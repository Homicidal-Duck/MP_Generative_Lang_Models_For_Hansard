["<cs> i find myself so much in agreement with what has been said by my noble and learned friend lord gardiner that i am not going to take up time in saying it all over again <e> <s> but there are two points that i should like to make <e> <s> to start with may i adopt what has already been said about the importance of simplicity <e> <s> it is of the utmost importance that whatever we say on this subject we say it clearly and simply otherwise i envisage the first day of a trial being given up to stultifying arguments on these lines <e> <s> surely we must do something about that <e>", "<cs> if your lordships supported this amendment and introduced the right of appeal there referred to you would be departing entirely from the accepted policy and practice in this regard <e> <s> for obvious reasons there cannot be appeals against every decision which is taken and wherever you go in the criminal law you find a point beyond which no appeal is allowed <e> <s> in the case of a magistrates decision there is no provision for any kind of appeal until the case is finalised in the sense of a conviction and then an accused person can appeal looking back over the history of the case to point out what if anything was wrong <e>"]
