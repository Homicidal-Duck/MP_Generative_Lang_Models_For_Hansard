matter altogether <e> <s> my noble friend lord belstead put his finger on it in that something has to be done <e> <s> as the noble lord lord hill of luton and others who have put their names to and

amendment which is proposed to be moved by the noble viscount would it be in order as this is a house of lords bill and as it originates in this house for me to suggest that the title might be varied

comply with the ruling of the leader of the house by varying the title so that it does admit this <e>", "<cs> my lords is my suggestion not valid that we might make the variation in the long title which the noble viscount suggests <e>", "<cs> my lords it is only in order to agree with the noble and learned lord that i made the suggestion that i feel we must be guided by the leader of the house unless we can alter the amendment <e>", "<cs> the only thing that seemed to interest the press about our proceedings over the last month was sodomy in scotland <e> <s> however my lords that is enough

amendment has been detained by an obligation to speak in edinburgh other <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask a question on procedure <e> <s> i came here to discuss amendments on third reading put forward by the noble viscount lord simon and the noble lord lord airedale because i feel that i have a contribution to make <e> <s> but am i not right in saying that some of this discussion is related to the

that the bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> after amendment my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords as a vice-president of the pedestrians association i am inclined to oppose my noble friends amendment on the grounds

noble lord lord john-mackie but i also feel with my noble friend lady macleod that enforcement would be extremely difficult <e> <s> my experience of country roads is that the worst trouble is caused by tractors <e> <s> the other day i was held up for a long way by a tractor which had gone into town and was bringing back a load of fertiliser on a trailer <e> <s> that is against the law <e> <s> but i do not think it could be enforced there <e> <s> how is it to be enforced <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the noble lord lord underhill in this amendment <e> <s> the noble lord emphasised that it is the local authoritys business to see that they are right <e> <s> i would like to emphasise the point which i made on second reading and refer your lordships to page clause c <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment wholeheartedly my lords because it is important in view of our channel tunnel problems that the inland waterways of this country should be expanded to the utmost so that in the years to come long before any channel tunnel is built there will be pick-a-back arrangements so that british barges can go to bulgaria via the rhine and danube <e>", "<cs> i have listened to every word of this debate and i hesitate to intervene except for one factor which has not been mentioned <e> <s> there have been references to the sentimental the political the legal and the economic considerations which affect this issue but nobody has mentioned the rock itself <e> <s> i rather hoped that the noble and gallant lord lord carver would have mentioned it <e> <s> i had a lifelong friendship with general mason-mcfarlane who spent many years there during the war <e> <s> but the reason why i support the amendment of my noble friend lord bethell is that i feel that nothing should be done which in any way weakens the bonds which bind gibraltar to our country <e>", "<cs> my lords my first task is to give you a message from the noble lord lord willis who has sent me a note asking me to apologise to the house for his absence <e> <s> he says <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the noble lords point <e> <s> i foresee though perhaps i am wrong a crystallisation of the diplomatic services <e> <s> this seems to me and to my consultant from the european parliament to be an inevitable consequence of the eecs development <e> <s> it will produce a difference in function between ambassadorial representation and broadcasts by the bbc <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the fixing of the may bank holiday stems from the very long series of negotiations which went on in this house about the fixing of the date of easter <e> <s> am i not right in saying that it is fixed under the banking and financial dealings act which arose out of the problem of the moveable whitsun holiday that it was decided by the socialist government at the time that the right thing to do was to make a may holiday and that this is what has been done <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down may i say that i listened carefully to what my noble friend on the front bench said about these people working overseas engineers employees and the like and as an ex-east india merchant i feel your lordships should bear in mind that when my noble friend on the front bench talked about people going abroad then coming back and then going abroad again there is a class of british individuals who are merchants and they want to come and go <e> <s> i have in my hand my mothers birth certificate dated and issued in nagasaki <e> <s> it shows my grandfathers rank or profession as merchant <e> <s> i hope that in giving the further consideration that my noble friend has asked the government to give the government will bear in mind that there is a very important class of british entrepreneurs who are merchants and may want to go come back and go again <e> <s> they are still british wherever they are <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the vast majority of her majestys lieges are fully satisfied with the regulations now established in regard to this very intricate trade and are quite happy to leave them in the hands of government if they are going to have an inquiry <e>", "<cs> my lords i came to london this week to raise a couple of matters on the economy which i believe to be of importance <e> <s> but however as amendments have been tabled it is necessary to speak to them briefly as i could not get my name down for tomorrows debate <e> <s> it is not my intention nevertheless to be deterred from the points that i have in mind about the gracious speech <e>", "<cs> my lords i fail to understand what the noble baroness has in mind <e> <s> i was not referring to the amendment when i said that people are using the prime ministers name in connection with the government <e> <s> i was referring to the fact that many leaders and the media are always talking about mrs thatchers government <e> <s> i myself am not a little concerned <e> <s> i am one of her millions of supporters <e> <s> but that is what i feel and mrs thatcher is the prime minister <e> <s> i say more strength to her elbow <e> <s> i am confident that she will win through <e> <s> i was heartened by the speech of our noble leader this afternoon and as i said i look forward to the contributions of my noble friend lord cockfield tomorrow <e> <s> one must bear in mind that the public have been pressurised by biased reporting on the television particularly by the bbc <e> <s> i think especially of the reporting of the conservative party conference which seemed to be one continual plug of those people who are doubters <e> <s> i think that the itv was more balanced in its reporting <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am grateful to the noble lord lord byers for raising this question again and i look forward to hearing the ministers reply in the face of the facts which this debate is laying before him <e> <s> i suggest that he will require all the ingenuity with which he is undoubtedly blessed to deal with it as he would wish <e>", "<cs> my lords when i referred to bias to the left i was not referring to the overseas services at all <e> <s> i too listen to them in english <e> <s> i was referring to the general trend in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i wonder whether with his wide knowledge of europe and his multilingual gifts he can tell us to what extent an audience such as that referred to by the noble lord lord kilmarnock listening to a vernacular programme are capable also of listening to the same thing in english and comprehending it either in spain or in italy <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to interrupt the noble lord on this but i asked whether there was a vote in another place and what the figures were <e> <s> gather there was no vote <e>", "<cs> but on the rd july <e>", "<cs> my lords while appreciating the extent to which by-passing of heavy traffic contributes to the improvement of city centres can my noble friend say to what extent the secretary of state for scotland goes along with him in the proposals outlined in his statement <e>", "<cs> my lords do the figures which the minister gave include scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords i join with other noble lords who have expressed their thanks to the noble earl lord perth not only for his speech in introducing this debate but for his long years of attention to the whole subject which we greatly appreciate <e> <s> in my view this is a very important report and the matter it raises is very important <e> <s> this should be an important debate which it is not <e> <s> i say that because it is tucked away into a corner which it should not be <e> <s> the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords on this question of outreach my point was that this might be something which is first class but which in view of the financial problems could well wait and might come later <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to congratulate the noble baroness who has just sat down not only upon the robust nature of her speech which saves me several pages of what i was going to say but also upon her reference to the noble lord lord crook whom we remember so well <e> <s> my memory of his taking part in debates in this house goes back years or more and i hope that the noble baroness will convey to him the extent to which we miss him <e> <s> while on the subject of people who are not here i would mention that in his opening remarks the noble lord lord rugby referred to optical glass used for spectacles <e> <s> i vividly recall talking with my old friend lord ritchie-calder <e> <s> in none of the obituary notices that i have seen was there any reference to the fact that as a young man he had a lot to do with h g wells and i remember his confirming something that i said to him <e> <s> h g wells in one of his books i think it was <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord permit me to interrupt him <e> <s> i certainly did not mean to say what he thinks i did <e> <s> i am highly critical as i said in my speech of the national health service where it does not take on more as it should over chiropractics and think that it should not cast some away as proposed in this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise the importance of this as the noble lord lord ross of marnock said to places such as glasgow <e> <s> i look forward to hearing what my noble friend lord mansfield has to say in reply because in rural areas where taxi hiring is becoming increasingly important this places very great power in the hands of local authorities to limit the availability of taxis to people living in those areas <e> <s> i am not yet prepared to make up my mind one way or the other on the amendment but i look forward to hearing what the noble earl has to say <e> <s> this is a point to which the house should give serious consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the loss of productivity arising from back pain may i ask my noble friend to agree that it might be wise to consult the anglo-european college of chiropractic who i am sure would be pleased to advise on the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords like the rest of your lordships i am grateful to my noble friend lady gardner of parkes and to the luck of the draw for having this interesting debate introduced today <e> <s> the matter is one deserving of very careful thought and it is thought which must be careful and farsighted <e> <s> in saying this i am not going to follow what was said by my noble friend lady faithfull except that one of my daughters who was a teacher said to me some years ago daddy if ever you get the chance you must beg for spaces where the children can play <e> <s> this is very important to the environment of a community as my noble friend lady faithfull and the noble baroness lady birk have both said <e>", "<cs> my lords may i remind my noble friend that we had a statement earlier and that at least minutes remain before we shall have completed two and a half hours on this debate <e>", "<cs> my lords before i turn to my prepared speech i am tempted by something which was said by my noble friend lord orr-ewing and the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe about the cost of rail travel to commuters <e> <s> my noble friend said that the commuter services are absolutely essential and are part of our way of life certainly in the metropolitan areas <e> <s> the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe said that motoring is more expensive than the train <e> <s> i have occasion when i fly down from scotland to come into london at the middle of the day and i see line upon line of expensive railway rolling stock lying idle from oclock till oclock <e> <s> i should like to know we can talk about it afterwards and perhaps there is something in british rails figures whether although they say that the highland lines are very expensive they are anything like as expensive as the commuter lines in london <e> <s> i want to know whether that factor of capital lying idle has been taken into account in some of these figures <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down is there not a new regulation that motor-cycle learners shall not ride machines of greater horsepower than <e>", "<cs> my lords would not one of the remedies be to adopt the double ballot system of election <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise on the contrary to support this motion because i feel so strongly that reform of our laws regarding trade unions is overdue and that this bill provides the basis on which we can work <e> <s> the fact is that the people as a whole are fed up with the way in which the trade unions are conducting their affairs today <e> <s> there are far more folk who believe that we could do without the unions than there are who think that we can do without the house of lords <e> <s> i myself support neither of those views <e> <s> we cannot do without the trade unions any more than we can do without our second chamber <e> <s> as my noble friend lord de la warr said the trade unions are an important part of our body politic <e> <s> however the situation today is tragic in that the conduct of the unions buttressed as they are by the egislation is bringing the whole important movement into disrepute <e> <s> it must be wounding to many noble lords opposite that this is so with the strikes in the health service and so on <e> <s> i need not add to what the noble lord lord marsh said in his slashing indictment of the trouble that we are in today <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that railway electrification represents a considerable off-take of steel quite apart from track replacement <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel that i owe it to my fellow back-benchers on this side of the house to make three points <e> <s> first i want to protest at the implications which have come from the other side of the house that we are not in favour of trade unions <e> <s> that is not so <e> <s> secondly i want to refute the remark which has been made on the other side of the house to the effect that this bill has been spawned by hatred and greed <e> <s> i do not mind saying that i take offence at that <e> <s> that just is not so <e> <s> thirdly i want to support what my noble friend lord renton has said that it is not wise to use words such as live to rue the day when we are dealing with the law of the land <e> <s> to go back to the attitude of this side of the house in dealing with this bill i know that i am right in saying that a number of back-benchers have not hesitated to vote against the government in divisions <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend rises to reply may i say that something has recently been said about the areas concerned <e> <s> like the noble lord lord houghton i am not an agriculturist but i am devoted to wildlife and to the prevention of cruelty to animals <e> <s> the only case of bovine tuberculosis of which i have heard recently in our neighbourhood was in cattle imported from ireland <e> <s> i should like to ask my noble friend whether there is any limit in terms of region or latitude and whether badgers in scotland are just as likely to be infected as are badgers in southern and warmer areas <e>", "<cs> my lords there are two particular mattters arising out of the gracious speech to which i seek to draw attention tonight <e> <s> the first is in regard to the proposed measures to reform the telegraph acts read with the paragraph in the gracious speech referring to the improvement in social services <e> <s> some of your lordships may recall that in march in a debate on an unstarred question i urged that the telecommunications authorities review their policy regarding installation and standing charges <e> <s> these two gravely concern the aged and the retired and handicapped people who may live at a distance from a village or the like the shops a post office the doctor <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely support what my noble friend has said in moving that this somewhat narrow issue should be referred to the committee and i look forward to seeing their report <e> <s> nevertheless it will be recalled that this forms a part of a protest about some of the bbcs performances which took place in the debate on the humble address on th november <e> <s> i take this opportunity which is presented by this short debate to request the powers that be the usual channels to remember that there is another part of the complaint that i personally made about the bbc <e> <s> it may be wise for the house to have an opportunity to debate some of the imperfections they are not many but they are important in the performance of the bbc as soon as possible after this report has been received <e>", "<cs> my lords with others i am grateful to the noble lord lord marsh for introducing the debate in the way he did <e> <s> it was a relief to me because i did not know which way he was going to bounce and i was only too glad to find that i could largely agree with his remarks about the report <e> <s> i was surprised and sorry that he said he had no sentimental attachment to the railways <e> <s> the remark of my noble friend lord nugent about the magnificence of the railway engine made me look up my rupert brooke and read again his line about there being among the things he had loved <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lady sits down on her reference to war i suggest that that is part of what i meant by conra-entry <e> <s> the railways should be paid something for that provision <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend imply that the addition of p to the cost of a bottle of whisky is not inflationary <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by going all the way with my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter particularly as regards his opening remarks welcoming this green paper as a means of discussion <e> <s> that statement was confirmed by my noble friend lord gowrie <e> <s> how welcome it is that we are able to discuss this matter without feeling that the hounds of hell are after us as regards having to make a decision now <e> <s> the ground is difficult enough as we have seen <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend agree that on many occasions doctors welcome visits from pharmaceutical salesmen since they are the source of information about the latest developments <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend tell me whether it is within the terms of reference of the commission to deal with complaints as to the publication of views about proceedings in parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords the handbook tells me that it is not up to the mover of a motion to take note to withdraw the motion <e> <s> however there are two things that i want to say <e> <s> one is that both the lord chairman of committees and myself were right about the meeting that was referred to <e> <s> i think that i am right in saying that i kept my mouth shut until after the bbc people had withdrawn <e> <s> so though i was present it was only after they had gone that the lord chairman of committees was kind enough to let me take part in the discussion <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to preface my remarks by a mild complaint <e> <s> this is the second time that the second reading of an important bill has been <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know quite where to begin because when my noble friend lord orr-ewing asked if i minded him taking the place of the noble lord lord donaldson i said that i did not mind at all because i think that that ends the range of noble lords who are inclined to become rather outspoken and almost hysterical on this matter to the great distress of a number of us who are ordinary men in the street <e>", "<cs> my lords on my track record your lordships would expect me to welcome this bill with open arms as being some measure of restraint upon the bbcs powers in relation to reporting the proceedings of parliament <e> <s> but the other day on any questions the question was asked why is there not some restraint by parliament on the bbc <e> <s> it is clear from what other noble lords have said in the debate so far that there are obvious technical problems in this bill which cannot be overcome <e> <s> although there has been very little time i have glanced hack at some of the debates which have taken place on this matter and i have transcribed one sentence of a speech by the late lord egremont in which he said <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to step in where angels fear to tread but i think i am right in saying that the issue of capital punishment was not mentioned in the gracious speech at all <e>", "<cs> my lords before i turn to what i believe may be the most important contribution that i shall make to this debate concerning the penultimate sentence of the gracious speech there are one or two other points which i feel should be developed in this debate on home and social affairs <e> <s> my first point relates to the remoulding of the telecommunications system and i particularly refer to the telephone system <e> <s> the bill when it is published will i imagine be a revised edition of the proposals which have already received the attention of this house but the point i wish to emphasise particularly in reference to the subject of this debate is the social aspect of the availability of the telephone <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say whether he knows whether the secretary of state for scotland has in mind the acceleration of the completion of the edinburgh by-pass so that it can be finished before the commonwealth games in <e>", "<cs> my lords i too thank the noble lord lord molloy for introducing this important subject though i will not conceal the feeling that the earlier debate was a great disappointment <e> <s> we seemed to spend so much time beating up over old complaints and not looking to the real title of the debate which is to consider the future of the national health service <e> <s> it enabled my noble friend lord glenarthur to give a number of figures which are as dry as dust to many people although they have been illuminated by some of the later speeches <e> <s> the noble baroness lady mcfarlane of llandaff and my noble friend baroness cox have shown how much they care but earlier we did not make it clear beyond peradventure that we all care <e> <s> it is quite wrong to repeat the old claptrap about <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not three-quarters of an hour since we began discussing the statement is it not now amounting to a debate and is that in order <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by expressing sympathy and agreement with what the noble lord lord hughes said about the timing of this debate and how it is carried on <e> <s> it is only the statutory days since the bill received its first reading <e> <s> therefore it is manifest that amateursor people who are not official or who are not attuned to the type of subject that we have listened to for an hour from people who know the business inside out have difficulty finding anything to say without risking the feeling that what they say need not be said at all <e>", "<cs> my lords may i suggest that a bevelled kerb is regular in a number of english counties and i think in parts of lanarkshire <e> <s> bevelled <e> <s> they call it a bevelled kerb <e>", "<cs> high time <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> he mentioned the power of the secretary of state to control the outlay of finance <e> <s> what is he going to do about the proposed outlay of million which is contemplated by the edinburgh district council for the western relief road <e>", "<cs> my lords i make no apology for jumping in at this moment <e> <s> i have been provoked to speak by the speech of the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe and to some extent by my noble friend lord stodart talking about tourists coming to scotland having to go through london <e> <s> what is wrong with prestwick <e> <s> i daresay we shall hear more about that from the noble lord lord ross of marnock when the time comes but it so happens that i have had two recent experiences which have a bearing on what has been said today <e>", "<cs> my lords i know about that i travel myself <e> <s> are you aware that the bus which you have to take from the central to queen street charges p and no change is given <e> <s> it is no trun by the railways at all it is run by the glasgow corporation <e> <s> i have had trouble there though not for myself because i am wise enough to carry change but there are people with children who are unable to find the change to pay the p <e> <s> no the service is perfectly possible it would be possible for british rail to introduce a through service via the central <e> <s> i think there is one train you do not have to wait about an hour for but they do not co-ordinate otherwise <e> <s> all i was saying was that i think it would be in aid of the tourist board if they had somebody to keep an eye on british rail <e>", "<cs> my lords considering the connection that i had with the original experiment here the select committee and the debate that followed it i gather that some peers took the view that i was sure to support today the televising of the house of lords <e> <s> this is so but not altogether so because my concernover a quarter of a century has been to facilitate and improve the reporting of parliaments proceedings to the people by the media whether by the press sound broadcasting or television <e> <s> if what we are discussing today is a contribution to that end then i am in favour of it <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree and i am coming to my final point <e> <s> be that as it may i return to the words with which i began namely that my concern over the years has been to improve the reporting of parliament to the people <e> <s> this motion would he a small step in the right direction <e> <s> that is why i support it <e> <s> my heart goes out to the folk who stand in the street and sit in rows in st stephens hall waiting for the chance to get into the gallery <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i say that he did not mention the possibility of video cassettes of debates <e>", "<cs> my lords if the figures given in the noble lords question are even approximately correct do they not indicate that no time should be lost in introducing a measure of chiropractic help in dealing with cases of this nature <e> <s> there should be no further delay <e> <s> there has been enough delay hitherto <e> <s> i should like to know what my noble friend has in mind as regards this particular angle <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that my information is that the assistance of chiropractic would greatly reduce the backlash of these waiting lists and that considerable financial savings could accrue to the national health service if these facilities were used <e>", "<cs> my lords arising out of the noble lords question may i ask as one who smoked a pipe for more than half a century and has had to give it up whether the government appreciate that the use of snuff is tremendously helpful in assuaging the pangs of withdrawal if one gives up smoking <e> <s> if possible that should be encouraged if only to help people who want to give up smoking and find it very difficult to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords while welcoming the figures which my noble friend has given would she agree that the pressures which still exist on the orthopaedic side of the national health service could be relieved if there were more acceptance of complementary medicine which provides manipulative therapy such as chiropractic therapy <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord appreciate that the absence of a bypass for the city of edinburgh means that the main route for traffic including heavy vehicles between england and scotland is deeply concerned with facilities on the a and that there is a link between the two <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say to what extent if any the requirements for children of british merchants engineers and the like differ from those mentioned in the question <e>", "<cs> my lords i find it very interesting to follow the noble lord lord scanlon <e> <s> i find his speeches always well worth listening to and entirely audible <e> <s> i should like to take up his point in suggesting that this government suffer from paranoic detestation of trade unions <e> <s> i dare to differ from him this is not the case <e> <s> speaking as a life-long conservative i want to say that we must have trade unions <e> <s> as has been mentioned already the object of this bill is to get it right <e> <s> i go so far as to suggest that if the labour party is in difficulty today the blame lies very largely with the <e>", "<cs> i do not propose to repeat what i said on a previous occasion but i support this amendment and everything that my noble friends and the noble lords lord ennals and lord wallace of coslany have said <e> <s> to my mind the trouble is that a lot of passion has entered this argument <e> <s> one has only to listen to the noble lord lord northfield or to my noble friend lord orr-ewing to realise that this seems to be a subject that is very worrying to people <e>", "<cs> the situation is not the same as it was then <e> <s> this bill makes a muddle of our approach to the national health service act <e> <s> it amounts to fiddling about with it <e> <s> i do not like it <e> <s> i have said so before and something similar has been said in another place <e>", "<cs> there is plenty of time <e>", "<cs> my lords i see from my notes which i made some time ago that i began with the words it is going to be very difficult to know where to begin <e> <s> but it is easy in a way because i can thank the noble lord lord henderson for introducing this debate and his royal highness for topping it up <e>", "<cs> i wish to support the amendment <e> <s> the speech made by the noble lord lord ennals highlights the point i made in the debate on clause namely that the proposals in the bill which is before the committee amount to an impairment of what are described in the long title to the bill as general ophthalmic services <e> <s> as the noble lord lord wallace of coslany said this is an attack on services which are covered by the existing legislation of a caring society <e>", "<cs> it would be foolish of me to press the amendment at this juncture <e> <s> however i have had such support from all sides of the committee and indeed from my noble friend who has just sat down who pointed out that the short title as it stands is misleading that i must ask him to reconsider the matter and raise it at a later stage <e>", "<cs> it would be wrong for me to press this matter but i am not at all satisfied with my noble friends reply <e> <s> i hope he will return to this matter again <e> <s> under protest in view of the late hour and the important business which will shortly be before us i will ask the permission of committee to withdraw the amendment despite the support i have received from all sides <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say whether the british caledonian aircraft which was recalled by lagos was on a scheduled flight <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support what my noble friend lord cullen of ashbourne has said <e> <s> i hope that this amendment will be accepted by the house <e> <s> it represents some measure of redemption for the ground which was lost when earlier in the proceedings on this bill we retained clause as part of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that at this moment there is an element of transition about the whole practice of operating telephones <e>", "<cs> my lords the speeches that we have just heard make clear that this bill was not wrongly described as a rag-bag of a bill <e> <s> it would not serve any useful purpose for the house to divide over its passage at this juncture but from what your lordships have heard in the last two speeches it is clear that there are a number of features of the bill which have caused me and others to described it as a rag-bag of a bill <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that there is talk in edinburgh of the discontinuance of some very guid-going research into this problem by the edinburgh medical school due to financial shortage <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the edinburgh inquiry to which i referred is concerned with the question which the noble baroness has asked <e>", "<cs> my lords in sympathising as i think we all do with the government in the present situation is my noble friend aware that there are a large number of people in this country and i include myself who would prefer not to hear the word sovereignty mentioned again until such time as the caribbean <e> <s> central america and the panama canal are made secure to the free world <e>", "<cs> my lords further to what my noble friend lady elliot has said i am not directly interested myself but i should like to draw attention to a point in connection with peeresses coming to london <e>", "<cs> my lords may i point out that there is no provision in the regulations for hire cars <e> <s> there are a number of peers who by virtue of living a great distance from an airfield and/or age and/or infirmity are compelled to hire a car <e> <s> perhaps my noble friend could apply his mind to making a provision whereby the cost of hire cars in such circumstances can be defrayed <e>", "<cs> my lords when my noble friend writes to the noble lord will he send me a copy of the letter or perhaps have the information published in the <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl agree that the fact that the house has broken all the rules by turning question time into a debate is indicative of our deep sympathy with the problem and our anxiety that it should be settled without delay and that we really must wait until certain people at the other end of the corridor tackle it direct <e>", "<cs> my lords anybody who has listened to this debate will appeciate that the problem to which my noble friend lord teviot addressed himself is a very complex one <e> <s> it is extremely complex in every possible way <e> <s> therefore your lordships will be glad to hear that i propose to make only the shortest possible contribution because i am concentrating on only one point <e> <s> it is a point which has been touched on already by my noble friend lord mottistone <e> <s> it is the importance to the possibility of saving and improving the service to people in remote areas of the sharing of the existing transport systems <e> <s> the noble earl lord attlee also mentioned the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it would be agreeable if i mentioned the pleasure it gives us to hear the well-known tenor voice of the noble lord lord davies of leek <e> <s> much as we may disagree with nearly everything that he said we are glad to see him back obviously very well recovered from his

steamers with their yellow funnels macbraynes queens of the coast the iona and the columba the north british railway the glasgow and south-western railway and their steamers trading to and fro between

mountaineer or the like and up to fort william <e> <s> that was a great development <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i have your lordships permission to urge him to pursue my suggestion about the clyde sailing club <e> <s> yachting may be a leisure pursuit but it is an absolute money spinner in terms of the cost of boats and the cost of sailing equipment and the engines

where it was found that he had to finance the improvement of the pier <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not expect to be following the big guns as i find myself doing <e> <s> on one thing i absolutely agreed

lords will my noble friend not agree that many of the interesting answers that he has given do not necessarily apply to scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the large number of speakers in this debate is indicative of the general acceptance of the importance of this subject <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say whether these estimates will include a calculation in respect of the police customs and security staffs who will be necessary for the hour-a-day watch that will have to be kept in respect of any such bridge or tunnel <e>", "<cs> my lords i also join the other speakers in thanking the noble viscount for bringing forward this matter for discussion in your lordships house <e> <s> strongly as i support the case for complementary medicine i am not willing at this stage to support his suggestion about a register for the institute for complementary medicine <e> <s> i was much persuaded by what the noble lord lord colwyn said that a register would be of great benefit but register to what end <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i correct a misunderstanding <e> <s> what i said about the british chiropractors association not wanting to be associated with the association is my view based on the opinion which was expressed to us that the professions supplementary to medicine act is not acceptable to people who insist that they should continue to have the right to see the patient directly and not always after referral from a doctor <e> <s> i believe that last years chairman of the bca is a member of the council of complementary and

problems such as those produced by the noble lord lord somers the individual problems relating to the use of the railways <e> <s> what i shall concentrate on arises to some extent from the speech of the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that there is a large body of opinion which anxious as we are for a permanent link with france feels that there are

noble friend confirm that the eec authorities have approved the curriculum of the anglo-european college of chiropractics at bournemouth <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support my noble friends motion that this bill should receive a second reading and that it should do so very speedily <e> <s> i noticed that it does not apply to scotland and i think that my noble friend explained why that is

the activities of the anti bodies <e> <s> is it possible that this bill might be a vehicle whereby a clause could be introduced to prevent the vicious and often violent methods of the various anti

<e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for that disarming reply may i ask him whether he is aware of the increasing number of people from scotland and the north and south who are distressed by the prospect of a direct link because they regard it as a potential danger <e>", "<cs> my lords i am instructed that i have a right to reply <e> <s> i assure the house that i am not going to spend much time over it because the one thing that has been proved absolutely by this debate is the extent of the difference of opinion over this road that exists in edinburgh <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend be relentless in pursuing the post office to see that it carries out the suggestion from the other side of the house that the solution to this problem is adequate staff <e> <s> if one postman in a rural area has influenza it means that the whole area gets its letters late <e> <s> there

noble friend aware that large numbers of listeners feel that something should be done about the noble baronesss suggestion as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that this

of the noble earl had time to study the report of the board of science working party on alternative therapy <e> <s> is he aware that it contains practically no reference to the steps which have been taken by chiropractors and osteopaths to train and qualify professional people for this purpose <e> <s> in view of the fact that both the noble lord lord willis and i have motions down will my noble

this amendment whether at the back of his suggestion is the thought that we must safeguard the position of prestwick airport in scotland and for this reason the word throughout is therefore acceptable

represented <e>", "<cs> my lords conscious as i am of the support that the government offer to the bill and agreeing with the noble lord lord underhill that we do not want another second reading debate i must express the view that i have a good deal of sympathy with what the noble lord lord sefton said in proposing the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend agree that much of the muddle which exists stems from the inability of our government to fix the date of easter and that this difficulty arises from that <e> <s> would my noble friend refer to the debate which took

raised the question of what the cost of insurance would be <e> <s> i also wrote to the minister and received a reply <e> <s> i did not think that that reply was satisfactory <e> <s> however i was not prepared to argue further about it <e> <s> on the other hand this is an opportunity for me to say with some certainty that insurance is one of the indeterminate aspects of the whole plan which causes

noble friend assure the house that despite this substantial and welcome boost which the government are giving to the national health service they will not relax their efforts to improve the service in
