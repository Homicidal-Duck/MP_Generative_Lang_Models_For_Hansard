["<cs> my lords there were two petitions against this bill <e> <s> one was from the british acupuncture association and register limited which the select committee of your lordships house disallowed a decision which happily has been found to be in accord with that recently reached by another place in connection with a similar clause in the west midlands bill thanks to the opportunity given to them by the noble lord lord derwent <e> <s> the other petition from the national federation of building trades employers is a matter on which i must briefly detain the house <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first add my tribute to the chairman of the select committee the noble and learned lord lord cross of chelsea <e> <s> he steered the long proceedings with such unerring skill and unfailing good humour that i am sure the whole house will feel greatly in his debt <e> <s> for those of us who sat with the noble and learned lord it was an educational experience which will stand us in good stead if we should ever be selected for such tasks again but the house might reasonably decide that we are by now over age <e>", "<cs> my lords on the substantive point that the noble earl has made about the committees choice of the word adjacent rather than the word adjoining i should like to reassure him inasmuch as the proposed new site for the market is only feet distant from the old site <e> <s> i hope that that will not only reassure him but the house and indeed the market traders <e> <s> meanwhile the select committee will be grateful to the noble earl for the general welcome he has given to our report <e>", "<cs> i am a little surprised by that last intervention <e> <s> the noble lord lord sefton knows liverpool a great deal better than london <e> <s> we are all grateful to hear from him about liverpool <e> <s> i do not think his recent suggestion is practical <e>", "<cs> there is an appendix to the report which goes at great length into all the alternatives <e> <s> i honestly do not believe that it is practical to choose a greenfield site on the southern outskirts of london it has to be to the south as i am sure the noble lord accepts which will serve the purpose <e> <s> we must be able to move people <e> <s> some per cent <e> <s> of those who will use the tunnel will wish to go to london <e> <s> that is their wish and it is no good frustrating it <e> <s> i do not believe that we should decant them into an area south of the river where the tube <e>", "<cs> i think there is an element of confusion here <e> <s> even among the members of my committee there was an occasional moment or two of confusion <e> <s> we are speaking about two entirely separate matters <e> <s> we are speaking of controls on trains for those who are not coming to london and for those who are coming to london <e>", "<cs> if i may intervene briefly my noble friend lord hayter has not fully appreciated that neither this committee nor the safety authority is yet in a position to make the necessary judgments about these matters <e> <s> therefore if i may be allowed to use one of the least attractive words in the english language the amendment of the noble lord lord underhill is otiose <e>", "<cs> i am sure that neither the noble lord lord underhill nor the minister will be surprised that i wholeheartedly support the first part of this amendment <e> <s> it would be somewhat eccentric if i did not do so as it covers one of the many recommendations that the select committee made and in fact is one of only two that the government have not embraced <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may intervene before the noble lord lord underhill finally makes his decision on what he is going to do <e> <s> i am not certain that the minister has been well advised that a renegotiation of the treaty is called for but that is an impression which i am not in a position to support absolutely <e> <s> i think he has ample opportunity to investigate that aspect of it between now and report stage <e>", "<cs> perhaps i might correct my noble friend on two very small points of detail <e> <s> curiously enough in europe rats do not carry rabies <e> <s> there has been one instance of a bat having rabies <e> <s> it came on a ship from south america and arrived in holland <e> <s> on those two points i think honestly my noble friend can be reassured <e>", "<cs> if i may answer that very small point the evidence comes in appendix of our report from mr crowley who is without question the greatest living expert on this subject <e>", "<cs> it is dreadful for the minister to have to sit this geography exam just before dinner <e> <s> however i hope that he will be able to comment on the possible extension of the a <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to take this opportunity to thank the noble lord lord galpern for his extremely generous remarks about me <e> <s> the noble lord grossly exaggerates as the house will be fully aware <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to support the principle behind the amendment <e> <s> as the house will be aware this matter was the subject of a recommendation of the select committee <e> <s> it received what i think was the dustiest of all the answers in the governments repsonse <e> <s> this is largely because it was never given in evidence before us that there were traders with customs facilities on their premises <e> <s> i think that what we recommended in the select committee would not have been so forcibly expressed if we had been aware of that information <e> <s> nevertheless i believe that there is a merit in the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i share the concerns expressed by the noble lord lord harris <e> <s> i congratulate the noble lord lord walston on his second attempt at this amendment <e> <s> it is obviously a great improvement on its predecessor <e> <s> however i fear that it is impossible to draft a clause which will deal with this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a great deal of sympathy with this amendment but i do not believe it to be necessary <e> <s> the noble lord lord mulley has just said that nothing will happen before <e> <s> i think in our report in paragraph we made it quite clear that we expected that the director general of the office of fair trading would keep these matters very much in the forefront of his mind from now on <e> <s> the ferries already have a problem <e> <s> they are not very profitable <e> <s> the part that worries me most and i think it worried the select committee most is that in the year or two before the opening of the tunnel there will be a sore temptation for the ferry operators to withhold further investment <e> <s> that gives cause for alarm in that the ferry service might deteriorate rapidly in the year or two before the tunnel actually opens <e> <s> i have enormous confidence in the director and i am certain that he will keep these things very much in mind from now on <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a splendid amendment but with the small disadvantage that unfortunately it has no place in the bill <e> <s> it is splendid in that it provides an opportunity to discuss one of the curiosities in the ways in which the department of transport decides whether or not a road needs improvement <e> <s> when one extricates oneself from london one enjoys eight lanes six lanes or four lanes until one reaches the village of lydden situated between six and seven miles from dover <e> <s> at that point the road deteriorates into a single carriageway <e> <s> in moving the amendment the noble lord has sufficiently explained the awfulness of that section of the road <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the fact that i was so extremely unkind to the minister on the last amendment perhaps i may be the first to congratulate him and thank him very warmly indeed for this amendment <e> <s> it follows upon the recommendation of the select committee and i believe it goes as far as one could possibly wish to go <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know what the minister means when he talks about an amateur chairman being out of his depth <e> <s> but i am rather unhappy with the situation in which we now find ourselves <e> <s> i am not very happy as i have made the <e>", "<cs> my lords i should be very grateful if the noble lord would do that because when he reads <e>", "<cs> my lords with great regret i do not feel able to support this amendment of the noble lord lord tordoff <e> <s> as the noble lord lord underhill has just said all of us who sat on the select committee indeed the whole house are deeply grateful that the government have followed the recommendation that we made and have agreed that what we now call in shorthand trains travelling to the north of london will have this facility <e> <s> i personally remain of the conviction that the bulk of travellers per cent <e> <s> seems to be the agreed proportion who will be travelling to london from either paris or brussels will find it more convenient if airport-type facilities are available at the terminus rather than if they had to go through the business on the trains <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister and the noble lords lord underhill and lord tordoff for the generous tributes which have been paid to the select committee and its chairman <e> <s> the former are certainly deserved i am not so sure about the latter <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord the chief whip would allow me to intervene since i may be in a better position to answer the question about the limited service <e> <s> as i am responsible for the refreshment department perhaps i may take the opportunity to express my very great regret that this event has occurred <e> <s> the origins are by no means certain yet it will take many days of research before the cause of the outbreak is established <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the advantages of a shortage of space is that we have very little storage room for frozen or chilled food <e> <s> most food consumed is fresh but there is a fair amount of frozen food because we never know the numbers for which we shall have to cater <e>"]
