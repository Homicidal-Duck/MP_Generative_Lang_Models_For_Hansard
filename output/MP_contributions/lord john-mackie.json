["<cs> my lords like my noble friend on my left i also rise with due humility to address this august house for the first time <e> <s> i should like to thank the noble lord lord ohagan for giving me the chance to speak on what i consider to be a very important subject indeed <e> <s> i think that the noble lord lord carrington was perhaps being a little mischievous in trying to persuade us into controversy but when he reads what i have to say and what my noble friend lady ewart-biggs has said he will at least find that there is no controversy between us <e> <s> that is as far as i shall go on the point of controversy <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister satisfied that the county councils are co-operating with cosira in dealing expeditiously with the planning situation mentioned by the noble baroness lady sharples <e>", "<cs> my lords having some experience of how carefully answers to questions are worded i should like to ask the minister how far the word favour commits the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not say there was not a market <e> <s> i said it was a bad thing to sell <e> <s> i said that to get that market you have to sell cheap <e>", "<cs> my lords first and foremost i should like to apologise for saying that the noble earl had not accepted some amendments <e> <s> admittedly as my noble friend lord ross of marnock said there were some very small amendments and they did not make much difference to the bill <e> <s> they were made in another place and i did say that i had not read the committee stage there <e>", "<cs> my lords may i help the noble lord on the time factor <e>", "<cs> my lords may i help the noble lord on the time factor <e> <s> if he can find a good solicitor and a quick typist within five minutes of bush house the whole thing can be done in half an hour <e>", "<cs> my lords with the permission of the house i think i said how it could be done <e> <s> if there is a police car on the road and there has to be a police car on the road before you can get speed limits enforced and so on just the same as any other law is enforced <e> <s> if there are people there willing to report you do not necessarily need to pass the people you take the number of the vehicle <e> <s> there are a hundred ways that you can report something and enforce it <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord bellwin is very persuasive and very nice but he has not really satisfied me <e> <s> it is the same old story <e> <s> i am no lawyer and i took this almost word for word from the <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that the forestry commission adopted a policy of displaying large signs saying take your litter home and stopped providing bins and that in many areas it was a huge success <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the circular that he mentioned gives local authorities the right to refuse everything in the green belt and conservation areas irrespective of whether or not there are buildings there <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether there is any system of arbitration to decide whether land should be released from these various bodies <e> <s> they take the decision <e> <s> all over the country one sees land that could have been released long ago still held by the railways the dockyards the army the navy and so forth because they make the decisions <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say a few words on the farm structure variation scheme which the noble earl lord ferrers thought could be got out of the way fairly quickly <e> <s> if the other three are to be a help for we farmers as the noble baroness lady elliot has just said i will accept with gratitude <e> <s> but as the noble earl lord ferrers will know i have been in correspondence with him on the question of farm structure <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i say this we were warned about making off-the-cuff calculations but i have the feeling that in one year british leyland has had three times what agriculture gets <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise for rising a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not be a nice gesture if the duke of cornwall bought it <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not be much simpler and more effective if the police had powers just to let the air out of the tyres of these cars <e> <s> it is the best immobilisation that i know of <e>", "<cs> my lords on the point made by the noble lord lord bishopston as to what was covered by marine sea farming would that cover pumping sea water into a reservoir for the job <e>", "<cs> my lords years ago in another place i initiated a debate on urban housing and took the then government to task about their lack of a programme <e> <s> the then minister of housing now lord hill of luton very kindly came down on a friday to reply to the debate but he was slightly taken aback when i suggested to him that he might do better driving a bulldozer pushing cable street into the thames <e> <s> here i am years later taking part in a debate on rural housing in which i of course have a great interest <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e> <s> there is nothing in the cla-nfu plan that has anything to do with tied housing or agricultural housing <e> <s> it relates only to the rents of farms <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords i too am delighted that my noble friend lord oram has initiated this debate <e> <s> i am also delighted that he and other noble lords mentioned the name of my old friend lord ritchie-calder <e> <s> it is just years since i entertained him in my then home in scotland and my other two guests were lord boyd-orr and aneurin bevan <e> <s> during a very stimulating evening one of the subjects of conversation was what we are discussing today <e> <s> i am sure that those three gentlemen whom we all miss would be disappointed at how little progress perhaps i am being a little hard has been made during those years <e>", "<cs> i have been accused by the noble lord lord dulverton of not knowing an awful lot about red deer but i do know something about deer destroying crops <e> <s> if one is a farmer and sees deer on his crops the point which the noble viscount lord thurso made is valid enough <e> <s> but the point is if you see deer in a field you do not look for a lamp or something you go for a rifle immediately <e> <s> to say that you have to phone up somebody i believe the suggestion was made that you might even have to telephone the noble earl lord mansfield is rather ridiculous <e> <s> the noble lord lord burton says it is baloney but i would say that he is talking baloney if i may say so on this occasion <e> <s> under clause a it is quite ridiculous to expect the farmers to do that <e>", "<cs> the noble lord mentioned shooting at night but on this occasion we are talking about shooting in the daytime <e> <s> i have great experience of deer on agricultural land in epping forest not miles from where your lordships are sitting <e> <s> fallow deer there do as much damage to agricultural land as red deer <e>", "<cs> it is rather difficult to know whether noble lords are against a pension or against an index-linked pension <e>", "<cs> i must declare an interest as an ex-chairman of the forestry commission <e> <s> i have a small pension <e> <s> this two days a week usually develops into three and sometimes four <e> <s> i know that the present chairman of the red deer commission is a very good chairman indeed and has done a lot of work as do a lot of chairmen who have these positions as the noble earl lord mansfield mentioned <e> <s> i see no reason why we should be different from anybody else <e> <s> after all if i remember rightly and the noble earl lord mansfield will put me right we pay a subscription from our salary for this pension <e>", "<cs> during my three years in the forestry commission i spent many days inspecting deer damage in the commissions forests <e> <s> there is nothing more tragic i would almost use those words than to see the enormous amount of damage that deer can do and the conservators and foresters disappointment at not being able to use every means of trying to control the deer <e>", "<cs> i am sorry i did not catch the first point the noble lord made <e>", "<cs> the forestry commission like any other employer can pay overtime and the rangers are perfectly prepared to work any overtime they are asked with reasonable overtime <e> <s> as regards roe deer so far as i know roe deer do not stop causing damage in the close season <e>", "<cs> before this amendment is negatived may i say a word or two to the noble lord lord dulverton <e> <s> spotlights are not to be used <e> <s> broad beamed lights will be used to give plenty of light <e> <s> the spotlights which poachers use will not be allowed <e> <s> the forestry commisson have come in for some stick and i should like to defend them <e> <s> it is very easy to be wise after the event <e> <s> the noble duke said that the forestry commission plant large plantations <e> <s> i doubt very much whether the noble duke has ever said to anybody never plant those until the situation arises <e> <s> roe deer have multiplied in large quantities in plantations <e> <s> it is ridiculous to have the night shooting of red deer but not to have the night shooting of roe deer <e> <s> if night shooting is to be allowed for red deer roe deer should be allowed to be shot too <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord dulverton feels strongly about this <e> <s> may i point out to him that i think that the forestry commission will see that the rangers who are put on this job of night shooting will be experts at the job and will carry out the code of the red deer commission in every way <e> <s> i cannot see any difference between shooting red deer and sika deer and roe deer at night with good light and good shots <e> <s> if that can be done why duplicate the operation <e> <s> the operation that the noble lord mentioned of controlling during the day can be carried out as well <e> <s> i am simply saying that there does not seem to be any more cruelty involved in shooting roe deer at night by good shots than in shooting red deer or sika deer <e>", "<cs> if i may delay the committee for one moment first i should like to declare my interest <e> <s> i am a farmer and a dog owner <e> <s> the point has been made that somewhere round about cases of dog worrying take place every year <e> <s> anyone who has seen as i have the result of dog worrying among a flock of sheep especially at lambing time will realise that some control of dogs is very necessary indeed <e> <s> whether this is the right method or not i leave the government to decide but i support some system of the control of dogs <e>", "<cs> my lords i have often been thankful that my noble brother is about years younger than me which has shortened the period that i have had to play second fiddle to him <e> <s> as the noble lord lord mottistone said on behalf of the subcommittee i was very lucky to be sent over to strasbourg to listen to the two-day debate on this subject <e> <s> he mentioned the difficulty of getting papers here <e> <s> i can assure him that there was no difficulty over there <e> <s> it was quite amazing how the report or any document one wanted was produced literally within minutes over there <e> <s> like him i see no reason why it should take so long here and i am glad he has put it to his front bench that they should do something about it <e>", "<cs> my lords i should not like to be so depressing as the noble viscount who has just sat down <e> <s> i do not think this bill is one just for the nfu and the forestry commission <e> <s> i think the battle has been between those who own deer forests and those who get the depredations from deer <e> <s> i think that if the bill does something to help those people because i can assure your lordships that the depredations are very large indeed then i hope it will not only the private owners of forests but the forestry commission itself <e> <s> i hope this bill does go through the other place <e>", "<cs> my lords may i reply to the noble lord lord cottesloe who criticised the point i made about the difference between traffic wardens and dog wardens <e> <s> traffic wardens are unpopular with owners of cars and have little or no effect on the general public or those not using a car at that moment <e> <s> but the general public are greatly affected by the work of a dog warden <e> <s> although dog wardens may be unpopular with owners of dogs the general public would be very happy to have dog wardens looking after the dogs stopping them fouling the pavements dealing <e>", "<cs> my lords before asking my supplementary i had better declare an interest in that my brother maitland was a member of the committee which recommended the change <e> <s> would the minister agree that it is much better to have civilised drinking rather than the backdoor stuff we had before the remission was made <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we would all agree with the noble lord lord lyell that something like this was necessary in this bill because of course there is a tremendous amount of deer farming but trying to define what is enclosed land with deer inside it is very difficult indeed as the noble lord who has just spoken knows only too well <e> <s> the other point which i too was going to raise and which the noble lord has already raised is this question of being conspicuously marked <e> <s> most deer on small deer farms of course are ear-tagged but that is anything but conspicuous <e> <s> although as my noble friend behind me says it is necessary to accept this amendment some thought should be given in the future to doing something a little more concise and meaningful than this particular provision although as iv said we do not want to hold up the bill because of it <e>", "<cs> your lordships may wonder why a renegade scot is standing at this box but regrettably because of happenings in spain we are short of scottish peers to deal with this very important bill <e> <s> if my noble friend lord ross of marnock were to return today i feel that his humour might exacerbate the debate considerably and prevent the noble earl from giving any concessions at all <e> <s> i hope that i can slightly ameliorate the situation in that respect <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble earl for that reply which is very satisfactory in many ways <e> <s> i would have thought looking at the cosla report they were almost applied at what was happening in various areas it would not be necessary to consult them a second time <e> <s> however in view of what the noble earl has said i beg leave to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> as my noble friend lord hughes has said we welcome this clause which is very necessary there have been some very nasty fires and loss of life because of lack of proper fire escape equipment <e> <s> i would like to make a practical point on subsection of this clause where it says <e>", "<cs> i think the noble earl has misunderstood the point <e> <s> the relevant words are having regard to its age character and location in other words the reasonable repair could be very weak if the age of the house is taken into consideration certainly disregarding the internal decorative repair which has nothing to do with it <e> <s> i was simply saying that if it is an old house it seems to suggest that one could get off with something not quite so good <e>", "<cs> my lords i should very much like to support the noble viscount who asked this question <e> <s> i am very sorry that the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe is not here because the economic forestry group have a first-class example of blending caravans into woodlands in a forest in the south of scotland <e> <s> that is something i commend to anybody who wants to see how well it can be done <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise for not being present at the beginning of this short debate <e> <s> does it take three pages of the most dreadful officialese that i have read to say that pet foods come under the feeding stuffs act <e> <s> the noble lord lord bishopston quoted some of it but when you read at the bottom of page <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to apologise for not putting my name down on the list of speakers but i was sure that the two points i wanted to make would be made by other speakers <e> <s> however they have not been so if your lordships would bear with me i should like to make them <e> <s> first and foremost i should like to agree strongly with the noble lord lord nugent about taxi drivers <e> <s> when one thinks of the number of taxi drivers who drive out to london airport more than half the distance on a motorway at very fast speeds the fact that they are exempt from wearing seat belts is in my opinion quite ridiculous <e> <s> what is more as the noble lord said very few of them leave their seats anyway when carrying passengers in town <e> <s> i think the question of taxi drivers is something which will need to be looked at <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i am sure that companies engaged in tractor manufacturing in which this country is the biggest in europe will be delighted at this but could the noble earl say what he means by early <e> <s> it would be delightful for tractor manufacturers if they knew when the noble earl said early and i would like to know when early is <e>", "<cs> my lords there is much to respect in the ideas of my noble friend lord melchett although many of them i disagree with but i think we are all very grateful to him for raising this topic today because i think your lordships will agree that it has developed slightly wider than he probably thought <e> <s> i think that is a good thing because this is a subject of great importance particularly to the west of scotland and the western isles themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords this document is what is going out to the people in question and it is mentioned there <e> <s> in the general picture of people who are very environmentally orientated there is always this term destroy the environment <e> <s> but you do not destroy the environment by schemes such as this you change the environment <e> <s> i should like to emphasise that <e> <s> in my opinion a scheme such as this for the western isles will change the environment only for the better <e> <s> but using this term destroy the environment is all wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to start to quote again but the last sentence states <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord like to consider the question that arose over agricultural chemicals which i think has some bearing on the question of the noble baroness <e> <s> when we went abroad to buy these chemicals we found that sometimes we could buy them at a price up to per cent <e> <s> less than the price at which they were sold in this country <e> <s> since then the price in this country has been brought down by per cent <e> <s> per cent <e> <s> or per cent <e> <s> in many cases <e> <s> if the same happened with drugs we would find them cheaper in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the reverse of what my noble friend lord beswick said be the case that for her majesty to fly in old aircraft shows how long these aircraft last <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have the power to claw back in recompense their million <e> <s> who is going to recompense the people who have paid too much for their spectacles <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his reply but it does not really answer the question <e> <s> has the department concerned done anything about the propaganda or is it as the noble lord said just leaving it to the common sense of people who would ignore the conservation societys remarks <e> <s> does the noble lord know whether the department concerned has done anything about two schemes in the machair areas which have been held up by the nature conservancy <e> <s> can he make any reply to the fact that the schemes are being held up <e> <s> how long will it be before the department concerned is likely to give a reply <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think it probable that there is a delay but if one is in say south uist or any of the islands that would benefit from the scheme one would think twice before going into it when this kind of propaganda is being issued <e> <s> in a debate on the matter a few weeks ago my noble friend lord melchett mentioned the frustration that is being felt and it is this frustration that delays things <e> <s> i think that the noble lord knows something about agriculture and if i may i should like to put to him a point regarding the effects of delay <e> <s> one has to plan far ahead <e> <s> if one puts forward a scheme to reseed a machair area and then perhaps keeps ones lambs to feed in the spring only to find that the scheme is delayed one then has a lot of lambs and no pasture <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the target which the government gave in the forestry bill last year was the average for the last years before and that if he looks up the figures he will have to write to my noble friend lord ross and change his mind <e>", "<cs> my lords we are very grateful indeed to the noble earl lord ferrers not only for his explanation of the bill itself but for his very lucid explanation of the background and of why the bill has been brought forward <e> <s> it is quite a while since i stood at the dispatch box and dealt with the complexities of legal language in bills and i well remember that when this bill was going through another place the now chief whip there came to me and said do you understand the bit about roses john <e> <s> i said vaguely and he said well that is fine because i am in the same position <e> <s> so we got on well during the committee stage on that particular point <e>", "<cs> my lords i well remember in when the coypu order was first laid suggesting that the people who let coypus loose should pay for the destruction caused and should also pay something towards trying to do away with these creatures <e> <s> this suggestion was not received very well by the government at that time they felt that it might be a little difficult to administer <e>", "<cs> my lords has the minister any idea whether this decision will affect the decision at stansted <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may refer to the reply which the noble lord gave to my noble friend lord cledwyn of penhros we all know that there are difficulties and that they create distortion in the trade in some of the countries to which food aid is given <e> <s> we hope however that these difficulties will not be used as an excuse for stopping that aid or not doing our best to get it to the right places at the right time <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not equally important that the householder should know whether his house requires rewiring <e> <s> in my opinion there are far too many who are scared into rewiring where only repairs are required <e> <s> in my home in scotland we are still using wiring which was put in in <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord beaumont raised a very interesting point as to whether the reduction in the number of seedspeople has made a reduction in the number of new plants that we have <e> <s> my experience as a farmer is that over the last or years the number of new seeds and new plant varieties that we have has exceeded the demand by a long way <e> <s> in fact it is very difficult today to decide which new variety to sow <e> <s> the one point that i should like to make is that it has certainly not reduced the number of varieties coming on to the market <e>", "<cs> i had better declare that i have a fairly large glasshouse before i start throwing any stones my lords <e> <s> if there were prohibition alongside motorways which there is a lot of talk about of say half a mile that would be a safe distance regarding smoke affecting a motorway that might affect roughly million acres i have done the calculation based on half a mile on either side of miles of motorways half of which might go through arable land <e> <s> it would be a very severe penalty on farmers if there were such a prohibition and i therefore trust that the government will not think along these lines but will instead rely on the code which contains a penalty if anything goes wrong and i hope that will remain the case <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all obliged to the noble earl lord ferrers for the well-documented way in which he has put these matters across to us and has saved us the pain of going through the long operation of dealing with all the codes of practice which are second third and fourth on the order paper <e> <s> perhaps i may look first at the first two orders <e> <s> i am sure we would all agree with some of the operations that are forbidden in the first order <e> <s> on the question of the second order the noble earl admits that the government gave way on the question of the three-month limit for lambs <e> <s> i am therefore surprised that a dog may be castrated at six months that seems to me to be rather old for a dog to be castrated <e> <s> i have no particular knowledge of dogs but i wonder why it may be left so long <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl says that this is a simple order <e> <s> the only point i would make is that it aifects sheep only and as we all know the balance between beef animals and sheep on the <e>", "<cs> my lords according to the radio this morning hunting is the most dangerous sport that there is <e> <s> is there any suggestion of registering each horse <e>", "<cs> my lords we are obliged to the noble earl for repeating that statement a very disappointing one creating an unfortunate situation <e> <s> it appears that it is more a danish problem than anything else although of course it affects all the other members of the eec <e> <s> it is certainly unsettling the fishing industry particularly in scotland <e> <s> while i am not too conversant with the situation there i understand that the federation is having great difficulty with its members and that some of them are not very happy and are thinking of resigning if they have not already done so <e> <s> it is therefore a situation which is upsetting the fishing industry very much indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble earl lord ferrers brought this bill forward on second reading he explained very fully what was its purpose <e> <s> basically it was to rationalise the eec regulations on the number of years for which plant breeders can claim their royalties <e> <s> the main object of the bill was to amend the original act to that extent <e> <s> but the noble lord lord beaumont has widened the bill very considerably by his amendment <e> <s> i have been lobbied by various people on the whole bill on what it does to developing countries and on the fact that it may be keeping back development of various genes that they have although the noble earl gave us an indication of the huge storage of genes that we have in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the fishing industry are bound to be delighted with million and i think they deserve it <e> <s> they have been in an uncertain state since all the argument started in the eec <e> <s> they are an industry that we have got to keep going and i think this is the right way to do it <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the minister a little worried about the imbalance in the figures <e> <s> the rise in meat production is less than per cent <e> <s> while the rise in cereal production is per cent <e> <s> if my quick calculations are correct and i think they arethis shows an imbalance in agriculture which is worrying many people and it should be worrying the ministry of agriculture too <e> <s> i am wondering whether the minister has any views on the subject <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord who gave the advice not to fill the bath <e>", "<cs> my lords who gave the advice <e>", "<cs> my lords in opening for the opposition on this bill i too should like to say that we are looking forward to hearing the maiden speech of the noble lord lord northbourne <e> <s> the noble lord like his father is looking to the land <e> <s> his father not only looked to the land but wrote about it <e> <s> he was also a very prominent member of the agricultural war committee in his native county <e> <s> we look forward to hearing from the noble lord and for his experience to be made available to this house <e>", "<cs> my lords we thank the noble earl for repeating the statement made in another place by the minister of agriculture fisheries and food <e> <s> we are very glad to have it and very glad that at long last we have a common fishing policy <e> <s> we can only hope that it does not run into some of the troubles that the common agricultural policy has run into which have been very difficult to solve <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down may i point out to him that i said that i was quoting from an article in <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble kinsman has just said the unanimity in this debate has been tremendous and it does not leave one very much to say at the end except to agree with almost everything that has been said <e> <s> before doing so i should like with everyone else to congratulate the noble earl lord kinnoull on initiating the debate and his good luck in initiating it on such a day <e> <s> it shows the character of the man when he started by expressing sympathy for the men out of work those losing their jobs and the tribute he paid to the societies helping these men <e> <s> that showed a nice human concern and i thought it was a good opening to this debate <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earls reply to his noble friend lady elliots supplementary was slightly unsatisfactory to me at any rate <e> <s> could the noble earl tell us how much plantable land has been sold as i understand it there has been plantable land sold from the forestry commissions reserve <e> <s> as he i hope knows they were given a minimum target of hectares <e> <s> does he feel that selling off plantable land will be in any way a danger to achieving that target <e>", "<cs> my lords i made it perfectly clear i hope the minister appreciates the point that i was referring to plantable land <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that many of the people who come and look at these buildings have rather short-term ideas which leaves a problem on the rating side if a farmer applies for change of use <e> <s> does the noble lord have any ideas for some sort of short-term rating system which would help because from my experience of this matter there is a lot of short-term use of these buidings <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble kinsman has done a great service to this house in raising this subject on behalf of his party and there could be no more complex a subject no more complicated a subject and no more important a subject than the one that he has put before us today <e> <s> i have only one quarrel <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord but the noble lord lord nugent of guildford must admit that as has been said several times per cent <e> <s> of the landlord and tenant system has disappeared in the last or years and is still disappearing <e>", "<cs> rose to move that this house takes note of the report of the european communities committee on the olive oil market rd report hh <e>", "<cs> into the mafia <e> <s> we all know of my noble friends anxiety on this subject but i think that he is inclined to widen the debate rather much when he gets to his feet in this chamber or anywhere else for that matter <e> <s> the very end of his remarks contained the crucial point the quality of the goods <e> <s> i was brought up on a farm in central aberdeenshire <e> <s> and in those days all the hens were free-range <e> <s> when i think of what the hens ate whether or not i had been squeamish as a small child i do not think i would have eaten eggs at all <e> <s> but today when i can see hens with controlled feeding and everything else i have no scruples about eating the eggs <e>", "<cs> my three noble friends have very ably expressed their worries about the continuing role of the ccahc and what help the lsa will get to continue with marketing co-operatives <e> <s> i cannot put it any better than my three noble friends <e> <s> i endorse all they have said <e> <s> i am sure that the noble earl lord ferrers is seized of their worries and will give a very satisfactory answer to the various questions which have been put to him <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earls preamble before he came to the clauses of the bill was very good <e> <s> he is quite right noble lords will forgive him for not going through the bill clause by clause even without prodding from his whip <e> <s> as he said this disease was known here in <e> <s> there is no doubt about it successive governments marked time on doing anything about it <e> <s> i gather that in the bva at a conference in london listened to a dutch vet who had great experience of the disease <e>

was being driven home by his wife from a dinner and another driver with milligrammes per millilitres in his blood driving on the wrong side of the road hit my friends car and killed him <e> <s> at the inquest the blood sample of the other driver was given as was my friends blood sample <e> <s> my friend was not driving and whatever one says and i know that many of us would have a reading of milligrammes on many occasions we are not breaking the law unless we are driving <e> <s> i cannot understand what happened and i would ask the minister why my friends blood sample was taken and why it was made public at the coroners court <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the noble lords answers i shall let him have particulars of the case and will look forward to his investigation of it <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the minister agree that it is an unfortunate coincidence that sir ralphs non-reappointment coincided with the row about the somerset levels <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord

negotiations <e> <s> in the past we have always had a very long delay far into the farming year before these price proposals have been agreed <e> <s> that is rather upsetting to the farming community

noble lord said that it is not a big figure <e> <s> however it is rather peculiar to choose the storage of grain as a subject for making cuts <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the number of employees in agriculture per farm is something less than two <e> <s> the inspectorate for that sort of situation must be much greater than for factories where you can go in and inspect for a

who remembers those days and i hate to think that there will ever come a time again when landlords particularly in east anglia go down on their knees to scottish farmers to come down and have a years free rent if they take over a farm <e>", "<cs> we seem to have established what the noble lord lord howard of henderskelfe meant by his amendment but what we have not established is whether it is a good thing or a bad thing <e> <s> this situation arises in many cases <e> <s> it arose in my own case on a -acre plot of land between me and my neighbour <e> <s> i happen to know what he paid for that

it a mouse <e>", "<cs> we would very much agree with that because our amendment is very much like that of the noble earl lord kinnoull and i am sure it would save a lot of time if they were discussed together <e>", "<cs> i must thank the noble lord for being what is called conciliatory at the committee stage <e> <s> the noble lord lord walston said that to all intents and purposes he is retired

be very brief indeed <e> <s> whatever happens i think that when the arbitrator is appointed he must be seen to be fair by the tenant and the landlord <e> <s> it is always considered that in appointing arbitrators the ministry has been as fair as it possibly can be <e> <s> however if one hands this task to an association such as the rics then it is bound to be biased i think my noble kinsman used a rather stronger word in which case there would be some doubt <e> <s> i think that the government must be seized of the fact that nearly everybody is against this clause and i am sure that the noble

much cheaper i should think than going to the goodwins and dredging <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask who actually gives the authority for this dredging <e>", "<cs> my lords i think first and foremost i should like to congratulate the noble earl lord cranbrook not only on the way he has introduced the report but on the work he and his committee have done in producing it <e> <s> it is of course a

it <e> <s> it is much better to have a chairman who is at the receiving end of damage rather than a chairman who provides damage <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i need to say much about this scheme <e> <s> the noble lord has very ably explained it to the house <e> <s> however i would just say that i had quite a lot to do with the introduction of the scheme as i was a junior minister at the time <e> <s> the scheme had much criticism <e> <s> i notice that the noble lord says there are applicants each year and that is not many <e> <s> it was considered that amalgamating farms when there was such a demand for them was a had thing <e> <s> but there are many farms in this country particularly in scotland that are so small they are completely non-viable <e> <s> the scheme helps those people who generally are not well off to obtain some help to retire from them and enable the farms to be amalgamated with neighbouring viable farms <e>", "<cs> regardless of what we think of this amendment the noble earl lord waldegrave if he had listened to his noble friend the leader of the house would have realised that it is parliament that is dealing with this and not the cla and the nfu <e> <s> i must make it clear that the noble earl lord kinnoull has every right to bring this forward <e> <s> we have agreed that we are dealing with a bill in connection with which amendments have to be debated and that the cla and nfu package has nothing to do with it <e>", "<cs> i think everyone agrees and certainly the noble earl lord waldegrave will agree that this bill is meant to retain as many farms large and small as possible in the landlord-tenant system but up gets the noble viscount lord ridley and damns it <e> <s> the amendment may not be very well worded hut as everybody has said it is something that we should look at very carefully <e> <s> i am obliged to my noble friend lord northfield for what he has said and he put the case very well <e> <s> as the noble viscount can

he has said <e> <s> we on this side are very disappointed at the reply of the noble lord lord belstead <e> <s> i do not know that we have any evidence that a local authority has sold any smallholdings

probably correct in what he said <e> <s> when i talked about the taxation point i was referring to the fact that the income from a tenancy after expenses have been paid is investment income not management income and i understand that there is pressure from landlords to have that altered <e> <s> i can quite see the point about vat but that does not alter the fact that i do not know of any recent tenancy agreement which has not been a full repairing and insuring one <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord northfield said that we were getting hysterical about <e>", "<cs> that was the word he used and he evidently used it about us as we put forward the amendment <e> <s> i would say that he got hysterical at the end of what he was saying about the situation <e> <s> it is easy to produce

we have made arrangements with the local people so that instead of using a footpath they can go round the field up a lane or various other ways and it seems to work <e> <s> but there may be an occasion when someone digs in his toes and says there is the footpath it is on the map <e> <s> you may have made a private arrangement but i am not having anything to do with that <e>", "<cs> if i can just say a word on this we studied this amendment very closely and on the face of it it has attractions but we could see great anomalies because of the succession in the act <e> <s> the noble lord has put us right there he says that would have to be repealed in which case that convinces us that we cannot support it at all <e>", "<cs> i have experience of this <e> <s> i used to rent a farm on the borders of the london borough of enfield which at one time had given off quite a large area for allotments <e> <s> as the noble lord lord hylton says the demand for allotments goes up and down quite considerably <e> <s> in this case more than half of them were not being used <e> <s> i suggested to the borough officer concerned that i should move the fence back and take into the farm the piece of land that was not being used <e> <s> he was quite agreeable just to do that without any consideration of the legal side of it and although i do not agree with the noble lord lord mottistone about farmers being better at using democracy than council officials i could have had that back and probably played at agricultural tenants and they would not have got that back <e> <s> actually i did not do it because the demand for allotments started to increase again and it was not necessary <e> <s> but the noble lord has a real point in this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that

the right to be cautious about foot and mouth disease but the veterinary committee which met in the middle of last week and no doubt on very good advice allowed the exports from holland to start again

smaller number of points of entry to give better control and not having to spread over the previous number <e> <s> we have to remember that article of the treaty of rome allows individual countries different health standards for entry <e>", "<cs> my lords on the question of british lamb being cheaper than french lamb i notice from the press report that the french minister of agriculture told a

much for that very full explanation <e> <s> i can see the point that with their high potency some of these medicines may be misused <e> <s> of course a farmer is not pevented from using lower potencies of medicines which are approved <e> <s> but the point i was making was that most of these medicines are approved and the noble lord seemed to be saying that it is not the medicine but the mixing of it that is the difficulty <e> <s> modern farm mixers will do as good a job probably a better job than a huge mixer in a feedmill so the noble lord has not made a very strong point <e> <s> the incorporation of the medicine is what he was concerned with not the medicine itself <e> <s> i do not think any farmer would put in more than was necessary because these medicines are expensive <e>

listened to what every speaker has said so far it seems to me that that is the feeling of the house <e> <s> it will be interesting to see what happens in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl lord kinnoull mentioned my name when he mentioned the scottish bill <e> <s> i cannot find the precise reference <e>", "<cs> my lords we have now heard the word dotty together with the word muddle applied to the bill <e> <s> this seems to be an argument about the meaning of the word appreciable against substantial or the legal meaning of the word scarcity <e> <s> frankly i do not want to take part because i am neither a lawyer nor an english scholar <e> <s> but substantial seems to emphasise it better if emphasis is required <e> <s> i therefore support my noble friend on the word substantial <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend who has left his seat used the word hysteria earlier and he said he was not including me on an earlier amendment <e> <s> quite frankly i would suggest that a good number of noble lords opposite are getting almost pathological about succession and i use the word advisedly <e> <s> if you take a look at a report which <e>", "<cs> my lords it was the

place <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to go back to what the noble earl lord swinton said during second reading when he pointed out what his family had done in the way of estate management and the letting of farms <e> <s> i think he said that was the proportion of land they had in hand and that that was about the correct amount of land <e> <s> he also said that they had always re-let to sons and even looked for second sons to let to but when it became mandatory to do that they objected to it <e> <s> it is like the seat belt legislation <e> <s> i remember that a noble lord who is not here was very much against the seat belt legislation <e> <s> he always wore a seat belt before but when it became mandatory he objected co it <e> <s> it seemed an extraordinary thing to do <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we would all welcome this clause and the schedule <e> <s> i read it through <e> <s> it seemed to take an awful lot on paper to carry out what one would think would be a simple amendment <e> <s> however we must accept that the draftsman has gone into it carefully and that it requires this long schedule <e> <s> the point that the noble viscount mentioned that the landlord should have the right to insist on the retirement of a tenant who he thinks is not farming well or is just aged is a difficult point <e> <s> we had the argument about whether we should fix an age when we

i have nothing to add <e> <s> if the noble lord is going to withdraw his amendment my amendment falls anyway <e>", "<cs> my lords i have discussed this amendment with my noble friend lord northfield and i can certainly see his point <e> <s> i happen to know that a friend of mine has built up a series of tenancies in a particular county milking somewhere between to cows scattered over quite a wide area <e> <s> it would seem unfair that he could leave all that to one son <e> <s> it would certainly create far more tenancies if he were limited to some size of unit <e> <s> but as my noble friend lord northfield has said deciding the size of unit is a very difficult question indeed <e> <s> supposing that a farmer had the tenancy of a -acre farm and of a -acre farm <e> <s> if he dies or wants to pass on the succession who does the choosing as to which farm the successor gets the landowner or the successor <e>", "<cs> my lords i can see that enormous difficulties could arise in such situations <e> <s> but we agree with the principle and we would like to hear what the noble lord lord belstead has to say as <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord the minister care to do something about the appalling noise of two-stroke motor-cycles which are worse than heavy lorries <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the minister for repeating the statement i think i should offer my condolences to him for having to read such a disappointing one <e> <s> frankly as a politician and as a farmer i must declare my interest the statement is very disappointing indeed although the last paragraph which announces that payment of compensatory allowances for livestock schemes is to start at last will be welcome news to hill farmers in all three countries who have been awaiting the money for a considerable time <e>", "<cs> my lords we are obliged to the noble lord for putting down this instrument today and also for saying a word about the structure of the industry as well although that is outside this particular instrument <e> <s> we are glad that it is proceeding and i am sure that it will do a lot to restructure the industry and help our fishermen <e> <s> we were talking earlier about grants to farmers and we get a lot of stick for receiving these grants <e> <s> i am glad that fishermen do not seem to get that stick because they do a hard job often a dangerous one and i am sure that the british public does not begrudge them the grant they receive <e>", "<cs> my lords i was about to ask the noble lord and i think he mentioned the fact that million of the million would be likely to come back from the commissionwhether the national government could use that money for redundancy payments <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord john-mackie would say you have no business taking a risk with my money <e> <s> you buy that land and you let it which is a safe way to handle my money <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just say to my noble friend that his report came out in <e> <s> it is now and my graph shows that we still have a decline so that all his appeals to private landlords and institutions are of no avail <e>", "<cs> my lords we spoke in favour of this amendment earlier when it came forward <e> <s> we have not altered our opinion <e> <s> i believe however that my noble friend lord northfield is a little optimistic <e> <s> i wonder how many multiple tenancies there are which will make such a great difference <e> <s> if it makes a difference then the noble lord lord belstead has something in his favour <e>", "<cs> my lords first i must declare my interest which i always have to do to remind <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord tell me how many people read the <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that if noble lords would learn to park head to tail with the passenger doors close together and only one gap between cars it would be possible to park six cars where only five are accommodated at present <e> <s> is he also aware that if chauffeur driven cars would leave the car park as soon as they have dropped their passengers this would relieve congestion considerably <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i think that my noble friend has a point but we would have grave difficulties in putting this into the bill <e> <s> he mentioned the farmer rushing around i think that was the expression he used in all directions looking for land to farm on which he thought he could make a profit <e> <s> a few sentences later he said adjoining land <e> <s> there would be a strong case for putting something in to the bill that adjoining land farmed with a holding should be taken into consideration but i do not think one could include land far away on a different farm altogether <e> <s> if my noble friend would agree to that we might support the amendment <e> <s> but to try to do it on the scale he was suggesting might be difficult <e>", "<cs> my lords as your lordships will know we were very much against this page and a half of verbiage instructing arbitrators what to do but if it is there and if we are to have words at all i wonder why discounting was used in the first draft and i think in the second draft as well and now we have the word disregard <e> <s> i should like to know the difference between the two because they have been bandied up and down in the bill <e> <s> if we are to have a word on the scarcity we would prefer appreciable <e> <s> i agree with the noble earl lord onslow he is not in his place at the moment that substantial is stronger than appreciable and we do not want a stronger word <e> <s> i think that my noble friends word excessive is stronger still so while disagreeing with the whole thing if we are to have a word we should prefer appreciable <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord belstead if i may say so has carried through this bill with his usual charm and good will <e> <s> he says that he is pleased with it and we have done a good job but that some people may disagree with that <e>

great pleasure that the noble lord has at last given way on something although in a small way <e> <s> i quite see the point that he makes that adding the words subject to any exceptions is probably as far as he can go at the moment <e> <s> but i am sure that when the time conies he will see the necessity particularly in the case of small domestic killings of birds on a farm of making an exception <e> <s> i thank the noble lord very much for what he has done <e>", "<cs> my lords i must admit that i looked at my noble friends amendment and wondered what the difference was <e> <s> the wording is different but the meaning seemed to me the same <e> <s> i had not his line toothcomb to extract the word withdraw <e> <s> i should like to come to the ministers help here it i may in that i can quite see there may be occasion when the minister might have to withdraw a code <e> <s> if the straw burning bill sees the light of day again and we are forbidden to burn straw there would he very little use for the straw burning code and it would need to be withdrawn <e> <s> if by any chance we are stopped from keeping animals on slats and there was a very strong move to do that we should need to remove the code governing keeping animals on slats <e> <s> i felt that my noble friend is going a little too far <e> <s> i quite see the point that he wants to hamstring ministers as much as he can <e> <s> with those few words i leave it to the minister and will hear what he says <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i am afraid that i am not quite in line with my noble friend here <e> <s> whoever pays for the services of the veterinary surgeon it costs money <e> <s> i always remember the late sir stafford cripps demanding an economic survey <e> <s> he had a wad of stuff and he said for goodness sake give me something that i can read quickly <e> <s> it was reduced to four pages and he said cant it be on one page <e> <s> the desperate official then said to him theres no such thing as a free lunch <e> <s> that is an economic theory that we should remember <e> <s> whoever pays for the veterinary surgeon it costs money <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask a question on this point <e> <s> if i remember rightly if something is reported to the rspca that society then approaches the person concerned and if its officer does not gain entry by agreement he then reports the matter to the police <e> <s> is that not the procedure <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a very useful bill and it brings up to date the legislation necessary to keep up with the present situation in agriculture where we have developments in animal breeding in the keeping of animals and of course in the rights of veterinary people to collect material that may be required in the control of diseases <e> <s> i know that my noble friend lord houghton of sowerby may have liked to go a little further than the bill has gone but so far as we are concerned it fills a useful gap because of the developments that have taken place in the keeping of animals in the slaughtering of animals and in the control of diseases and we give it our blessing <e> <s> i am glad that the minister was able to say that he would make exceptions in the slaughtering provisions so as to allow housewives to kill their christmas turkeys without a licence <e>", "<cs> my lords we must thank the noble lord for repeating that statement <e> <s> i may say that it is like the curates egg good in parts <e> <s> i note under the first section of it that the next meeting is next week <e> <s> we have been promised year after year that a decision will be taken by the end of march by the beginning of the farming year <e> <s> farming is a long-term business and i should like to ask the minister whether this year there is any chance of this decision being taken in time <e> <s> we know there will have to be considerable cuts and changes in agricultural production and we should have adequate warning about what is to be done <e> <s> the minister mentioned in the statement the individual national positions <e> <s> what are those individual positions <e> <s> are some of the countries not agreeing <e> <s> does he know that <e> <s> as we all know the council of ministers put forward the question of phasing out mcas which is an important thing for the british farmer <e> <s> i wonder what the position is there <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for repeating here the answer to the question <e> <s> it is rather disturbing that these two outbreaks were so very far apart <e> <s> i wonder whether the minister knows whether or not there is any connection between them <e> <s> if there is not i would say it is rather serious <e> <s> we seem to have been shifting our policy on dealing with newcastle disease of fowl pest <e> <s> over the years <e> <s> i was a very humble member of the plant committee which reported in and i telephoned the ministry to find out what had happened to our recommendations <e> <s> i was rather put in my place and told that nobody knew anything about the plant report <e> <s> the slaughter policy i gather was brought in in <e> <s> that was the policy brought in after the serious outbreaks at the end of the s and in the early s <e> <s> i wonder whether the ministry is satisfied with the slaughter policy <e> <s> no doubt they went back to it because the industry is financing its own insurance scheme <e> <s> however if we get more outbreaks is the minister still happy that the slaughter policy is the right one and that we should not do as the americans do which is to vaccinate <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords at the time of the last statement there was considerable questioning about the fact that all the inspectors had not been appointed and that the log books had not been printed <e> <s> i wonder if the noble lord can tell us whether this has now been rectified and whether the inspectors have all taken up their work <e> <s> is it not a fact that the scottish fishermen are not too pleased with the closing of the mackerel box in the south-west of england and that they have produced figures to suggest that this is not necessary <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble lord would like to comment on that <e> <s> i think the argument is that hand-liners will be able to supply the demand but i understand that they produce only about per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord also remember that the people of bishops stortford epping and harlow will be delighted with developments at heathrow and gatwick <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the minister for repeating this statement given in another place i venture to think that everyone would agree that it is a very long and complicated statement and one which requires quite a lot of study <e> <s> i am sure that <e>", "<cs> in moving this amendment the noble earl said that there was a world of difference between burning straw and stubble <e> <s> today we have wheats from which we can literally take the top and leave two feet or two and a half feet of stubble <e> <s> i feel that has done quite a lot especially with the new combines we have and there is the grave danger that people will use that method as a means of overcoming the by-laws if the noble earls amendment is accepted <e>", "<cs> i would like to make a plea <e> <s> i quite agree with the noble lord that there is a difference between burning stubble and burning unbaled straw but what i meant the noble lord to appreciate was that there are almost equal dangers from burning stubble and burning straw <e> <s> that is the point i wanted to make <e> <s> of course there is a difference in burning particularly short stubble <e> <s> my experience was with barley stubble and it was quite a dangerous situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i have two apologies to make the first is for putting my name down late for this debate and the second is that unfortunately i have a meeting at half past five and my time was put out by the statement taking so long <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the noble viscounts point that mistakes were made in the early days of the forestry commission but these were put <e>", "<cs> my lords that may be but the point is that it is not the spruce that creates the acid <e> <s> the acid comes from acid rain from factories elsewhere <e> <s> the noble lord is simply blaming sitka spruce i have it from the forestry commission that any conifer has the same attraction and does the same thing <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the two noble lords are taking in that stricture from my noble friend that is that none of us knows about acid rain <e>", "<cs> i think that we all agree together with the noble lord lord stanley of alderley that nothing will be done properly to control straw burning unless there is a licensing system <e> <s> the only point of disagreement may be who should run the system <e> <s> i am afraid that i must disagree with the amendment to put that in the hands of the minister <e> <s> i do not think that the minister would want it but as the noble lord said if such an amendment was passed he would just have to accept it and make the best of a bad job <e>", "<cs> i should like to take my erstwhile pair in another place to task because i do not see anything inconsistent in what i said on second reading <e> <s> the noble lord lord belstead brought driving licences into the picture

<e> <s> as far as i can see we can discuss them if we put down an amendment but not otherwise <e> <s> i think that it is rather important that there should be some method <e>", "<cs> there seems to be a desire for speeches to be as short as possible but i should like to point out that i did not arrange the business of the house and i feel one should not be gagged in discussing this bill <e> <s> the noble lord lord alport said affirmative resolution although it is not in his amendment <e> <s> i should like to suggest that the words affirmative resolution must be in the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords we are very grateful to the noble lord lord plowden the chairman of the select committee <e> <s> in fact he went through the report so fully that i think we may be wasting a great deal of time repeating what we want to say because the noble lord has done a good job in putting the matter so quickly and so well before the house <e> <s> we are equally grateful to the noble lord lord belstead for bringing us up to date with the various fresh proposals which are being put forward some of which make me shudder as i am just starting a new beef project <e> <s> i think he said that there is likely to be a per cent <e> <s> cut <e> <s> when he told us that tonnes of beef is in store one can see the reason for it <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of my noble friend straw burning is an

sure of this but perhaps the minister can confirm it that the disease is spread not so much by the contagious contact with the crayfish as by the release of the water from the crayfish beds or wherever they are kept and would not that come under the pollution act <e>", "<cs> my lords we have to thank the noble lord lord belstead for repeating that statement <e> <s> it is one of many and i do not know whether it is the final one <e> <s> we hope that it is well on the way to being the final one although as the minister said there are a few outstanding points <e> <s> it is a very important statement <e> <s> it naturally affects me personally and i must declare my interest as a farmer <e> <s> milk is still the big problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether the noble earl lord ferrers is satisfied about what is to happen to his extra gallons <e> <s> i cannot follow the argument at all <e> <s> we get a national quota based on but it is distributed in this country

question standing in my name on the order paper which unfortunately has been rather overtaken by events <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his reply which i anticipated <e> <s> is he aware that one can still buy forestry land where there are trees under a certain size which have been put there at public expense grub them up and put the land back to agriculture thereby tremendously increasing the value of the land and almost certainly getting drainage grants and so on <e> <s> is that not something which should be stopped when we have a surplus of cereals and a very large sufficiency somewhere in the region of million in wood and wood products <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that i gave way to the noble lord lord glenkinglas because he has made a real point <e> <s> is the minister aware that i took down the sums of money involved <e> <s> can he say how many acres these sums affect <e> <s> is he aware that the publicity that this situation has received has led people to look and see whether they have anything that could come under this category <e> <s> if he wants instances i can give a personal one <e> <s> a neighbour asked me why i did not apply to grub up scrub woodlands next to epping forest in an area of outstanding beauty and make a claim <e> <s> is he aware that i know of two other cases along the same lines <e> <s> it is definitely time that the government took this matter seriously <e> <s> i wish to preserve these areas but the minister must look at the matter carefully <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble lord lord belstead for explaining the scheme <e> <s> one thing that must be said about any of these schemes is that there is never a lack of paper on the subject <e> <s> it is a good thing that now as the noble lord has told us fresh water fish farming comes under the last scheme <e> <s> i remember that when it was brought in i asked a question <e> <s> the grant was to relate to salt or brackish waters i think they were called and i asked whether or not the grant would be made where someone pumped brackish water up into an inland lake or reservoir <e> <s> as far as i recall i did not receive a reply to that question but now i do not need a reply because fresh water fish come under the scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords did jardine matheson give the government notice of what they were going to do <e> <s> if they did what steps did the government take to dissuade them <e>", "<cs> my lords referring back to the question about solar energy asked by the noble lord lord collison can the noble earl confirm that there is a grant for insulating a house and thus saving heat <e> <s> would it not be a good thing to give a grant for producing heat by solar energy <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords what effect will the figures which the noble lord has quoted have on the stansted inquiry <e>", "<cs> my lords we are indebted to the noble lord lord renton for putting the bill before us <e> <s> a few days ago i met him in the corridor and said to him how important the bill was <e> <s> he said its a fiddling little thing and will go through in a minute or two <e> <s> the noble lord has taken rather more time than the one or two minutes which he suggested to me <e> <s> i am pleased to look again at the agriculture act <e> <s> i spent many hours in committee helping to pilot that act through the

privatise because it is linked up with the research stations in the country the plant breeding institute at east craigs in edinburgh and at aberystwyth in wales <e> <s> how can they privatise them without giving a complete monopoly to some private company to develop public assets <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so the noble lord must be aware that there is an awful difference between a public monopoly and a private monopoly <e> <s> if the government sell it for arguments sake to dalgety spillers i think that nickersons would create a fearful row if only one company was to get the monopoly of the pbis work <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the point that was raised about the staff is a very real one and that all the rumours investigations and so on are very upsetting to the skilled and devoted staff of this organisation <e> <s> the government must think a little more about people and a lot less about money <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether the penalty is big enough <e> <s> i believe that no penalty is too big for a drug pusher <e>", "<cs> my lords arising out of the question asked by the noble lord lord hunt i am sure that the minister appreciates that the farm and wildlife association which is run mostly by farmers is having a tremendous effect in regard to dealing with the very problem he is afraid of <e> <s> i thought that i would just make that point <e> <s> the minister mentioned a figure of farmers within the new area and a further farmers who may come into the picture within the less-favoured areas <e> <s> the latter have to be decided by ministry officials <e> <s> is the minister happy that that will be an easy job for the officials <e> <s> my experience is that if one looks at less-favoured areas in devon one finds that they would be considered to be very favoured areas in scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble baroness lady macleod had a very good point but if she will excuse me for saying so i think she put it badly <e> <s> it is not saying no to it it is the publicity it gets which makes children inquisitive <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> arising out of the question of the noble and learned lord lord scarman may i ask whether it would not be a nice gesture for the survivor of the knob which fell down that in october there should be a celebration at the same time as the ceiling is unveiled <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships will know that when the bill was first brought before us it contained this provision <e> <s> i do not know the nature of the persuasion or the blandishments that came from behind the noble lord but they succeeded in removing the provision <e> <s> i have here about columns of <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has raised an interesting point <e> <s> it is something that could be used as it is unfortunately in the buying of council houses which the government are keen on <e> <s> somebody with an elderly person in the family steps in and helps them to buy the house in anticipation as the noble lord said of the death of the tenant <e> <s> it is the same picture when you come to what can he done to get the tenancy of a farm <e> <s> it is a real point that has been picked out and certainly we would support preventing this sort of thing happening <e> <s> that is all i want to say about it <e> <s> it is an essential thing to do and we shall leave it at that but one can see the difficulties that can arise in these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to make the point that along with the bill i received some corrections to the bill <e> <s> one of the corrections states <e>", "<cs> my lords noble lords opposite have posed the question very ably indeed but they have not suggested the answer <e> <s> surely the answer to this is that paying people to do nothing is quite ridiculous <e> <s> i am not arguing about whether or not it is right that the environmental lobby should require these marshes to be left alone but if that is the case and if it is decided that that is the case then surely the crown should take over the land and then let it with proper conditions attached <e> <s> is not that the solution <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper which deals with a slightly more mundane matter than the subject we have just been discussing <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble earl for that answer i would ask whether he is aware that there is a rumour i hope it is only a rumour that the government are thinking of doing away with the apple and pear development council <e> <s> this would b a huge mistake in the circumstances of today in which we have a lot of eec fruit coming in <e> <s> i hope he can scotch that rumour straight away <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not right that todays report in <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards going in for alternatives would the noble lord agree that a drop of scotch is much more relaxing than the other two <e>", "<cs> my lords i am rather at a loss to find where the commons passed amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i have looked through both the committee stage and the report stage and i cannot see amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it may be due to my lack of knowledge of procedure but i cannot find amendment no <e> <s> passed by the commons anywhere <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we would all agree that this is a very necessary amendment because of that unfortunate incident when newcastle disease was linked to a feeding stuffs place in liverpool and we thoroughly agree with the noble lord in what he says <e> <s> i am sorry to say that i still cannot find where the commons passed this amendment at column <e> <s> i have the <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for explaining this amendment <e> <s> it is a very necessary one because there is always a great deal of worry over the wholesale slaughter of poultry in the large slaughter houses <e> <s> i note in the commons debate on the amendments that that worry was raised <e> <s> there is no doubt that automatic stunning can miss birds here and there and that inspection is sometimes a little lax <e> <s> i am sure that tightening up will help to relieve peoples minds of that worry and reassure them that the welfare of the birds is looked after <e> <s> i am glad that this will not affect various items including the one i mentioned when we discussed this matter at the report stage of farm slaughtering for the farmers wifes own use or of a few birds for sale <e> <s> with that we support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that everyone in the house would agree with the noble lord and thank him and the government for giving us this amendment and tightening up and making sure that there are sufficient inspectors <e> <s> of course the veterinary inspector is the important one as there is no doubt that inspecting is the key to animal welfare <e> <s> i am sure that the interest of my noble friend lord houghton here should be satisfied as should the welfare bodies which have pressed for this for a long time <e>", "<cs> my lords does it make sense for the government to state in the gracious speech that they are going to introduce legislation to help the tenanted sector of agriculture and to pay lip-service to that intention with a bill and then to sell off tenancies and seem to be proud of it <e>", "<cs> my lords that has not quite answered my question if i may say so <e> <s> i should say that people would be pleased that the government are selling off farms at the discount that they are <e> <s> that does not alter the fact that they were tenanted farms <e> <s> there is a scarcity of tenanted farms and to sell off such farms while at the same time paying lip service to the tenancy sector of agriculture seems ridiculous <e>", "<cs> my lords does the figure the noble lord quoted include agriculture <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord belstead has put these instruments before us and has done a tremendous lot to explain them to us <e> <s> we are very grateful to him for that because they are by no means simple in any shape or form and as he knows they have been altered quite often over the past couple of months <e> <s> i am not sure that we yet have the final <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord the minister for giving way <e> <s> he laid stress at the beginning of his reply on the point that a per cent <e> <s> cut in price which would be disastrous would be required to reduce production <e> <s> if he studies the figures very carefully as i have

cows and the drop in the price of culled cows is difficult to quantify into price per litre but the two figures are nearly the same <e> <s> i do not think it is a very good argument for accepting quotas <e>", "<cs> my lords i am getting a new pair of spectacles and may then be able to do away with the use of this box in due course when the government introduce cheaper spectacles <e> <s> we are really very indebted to the noble lords lord greenhill and lord adrian for introducing the two reports so concisely and so briefly <e> <s> they did both in minutes <e> <s> the minister took slightly longer and perhaps your lordships will excuse me if i take a little longer still but i will try to be as brief as i can <e>", "<cs> bearing in mind where the noble lord comes from he should realise that it is the kingdom of fife <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the statement which he has just made will be very well received by the fishermen in this country because they are very worried indeed about the situation that might arise if spain were given more fishing rights than she has at present <e> <s> i hope that her majestys government will stick to the principle that spains fishing rights should stay as they are under the present agreement irrespective of whether or not she joins the community <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is very good that her majestys government have agreed to keep this act <e> <s> the point has often been made and i think that i agree with it that there is no such thing as a weed it is only a plant in the wrong place <e> <s> nevertheless the fact that the act has been used only twice shows that over a whole area of land particularly urban blight land the weeds are not cleared <e> <s> as i happen to farm in these areas i would ask the minister to make sure that if i make a complaint the act will be used because there is nothing worse than seeing thistledown floating over ones farm from unused land next door <e>", "<cs> my lords further to the point made by the noble lord lord maude about there being a short-term problem within a long-term one is the minister aware that the noble lord lord walston mentioned a period of to months while i would put the long-term problem at to years <e> <s> the period to which the noble lord lord maude referred i would put nearer to years <e> <s> when you consider that it took us from to the present day to achieve a per cent <e> <s> increase in our food production it would take just about as long if not longer bearing in mind the conditions in these areas <e> <s> so we have really three problems the short-term the -month one of feeding these hungry people the long-term one of meeting the needs of million people in the world who are below the level of proper nutrition and then the very long-term one <e> <s> i recall that when i first came into this house there was a debate on this subject when the noble lord lord renton made this very point <e> <s> it has taken us a long time to take real cognisance of the point <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord have any figures that tell us how much help in cash terms has been given to agricultural exports during this past year <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has made a very good job of introducing this bill <e> <s> he has apologised for taking rather a long time <e> <s> quite frankly he indicated to me that he might be longer so it is a surprise that he took less than minutes which i shall do my best to emulate <e> <s> it is amazing how brotherly love spreads across political parties <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble lord lord stanley for having put down this amendment <e> <s> i mentioned at second reading the question of what could happen and he has detailed it better than i did <e> <s> it is a real problem <e> <s> if through no fault of his own a neighbouring farmer sprays and it drifts over on to your farm and then the whole area is isolated if that is the right expression during a harvesting period or during a period when work has to be done then there could be considerable loss <e> <s> i looked for somewhere in the bill at which to put down an amendment along these lines <e> <s> it is difficult in this bill to find a place at which to put down some amendments <e> <s> we are very grateful to the noble lord for placing it where he did <e> <s> we give it full support in every way <e>", "<cs> i do not think there is any speaker who would not agree that the polluter should pay if he can <e> <s> what we are looking for is some arrangement where if he cannot pay then the farmer or person concerned is compensated <e>", "<cs> i am glad the noble lord has given some company to that solitary phrase does nothing else <e> <s> i agree with the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble earl knows that i raised this point in a slightly tenuous way on second reading and he is quite right to pinpoint this issue because it should be covered <e> <s> fish farming in these areas is growing to a tremedous extent particularly in the west of scotland <e> <s> it needs the same protection as everything else and it is best to include such a provision in the bill rather than leave it to be covered by some regulation <e>", "<cs> when we looked at this amendment we could not quite follow what suspended meant <e> <s> we had a lot of guesses and then somebody said that it could be something suspended at the edge of a cliff or suspended at the end of a pier not necessarily suspended from a boat <e> <s> i do not know whether the noble lord lord craigton meant something like that or not <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is so persuasive that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> we should be grateful to the noble lord lord stodart for raising this point again <e> <s> i raised the question on second reading that references to the minister and the secretary of state all the way through made it very difficult to follow exactly who was referred to <e> <s> i cannot see the logic behind the ministers point that particular secretaries of state should not be mentioned <e> <s> i did not follow his explanation <e>", "<cs> for once i should like to congratulate my noble kinsman and his two co-amenders on bringing this forward <e> <s> something like this should go into the bill <e> <s> i am not sure whether this is the right place but as we all know part iii is the most important part of the bill and to start with this certainly would remedy the fact that there is nothing on this point in the bill <e> <s> i have looked at my noble friends amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> as the noble lord lord belstead said it goes a bit wider than this one <e> <s> we should certainly support this going at the beginning of this particular part of the bill <e>", "<cs> i too should like to thank the minister for being so accommodating on this <e> <s> the main thing is that we agree today on the principle of it that there should be a preamble and the minister has offered to consult with my noble kinsman about the wording <e> <s> i think we should all accept it and thank him very much indeed <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord craigton produced an advertisement <e> <s> does exposure for sale mean advertising a product <e> <s> exposure for sale is a difficult term <e> <s> i should have thought that advertising for sale was more suitable but i do not know <e>", "<cs> i think the noble earl lord radnor did a good job by inserting a word of caution here <e> <s> while fully agreeing with the principle that we must see that everything that we export is suitable for the job i should not like to think that we might scare off developing countries from perfectly genuine and useful sprays by means of something in the bill or something in the regulations that might do just that <e> <s> i well remember the great argument about banning ddt <e> <s> a medical officer representing some african countries put forward a very strong case when he said that the amount of good that the use of ddt did in controlling mosquitoes and thus controlling malaria far outweighed the danger <e> <s> as he puts it you would have to breathe in so many millimetres a day and live for years before the stuff would kill you <e> <s> we should be careful about the wording of any regulation so that it does not scare off countries that really need some of these sprays <e>", "<cs> i think there is no doubt about it that the application of spray is almost as important as the spray itself in many cases <e> <s> this is a very important amendment indeed and we thoroughly support it <e> <s> but there are complications <e> <s> the noble lord lord northbourne mentioned that if one has close examination of ones crop and finds that there are insufficient pests beetles i think he mentioned it would be a good thing not to spray and would save money <e> <s> i am in that position today but then i read a report which tells me that brassica growers in our area in the lea valley are worried about any of those beetles and they say it is the duty of the farmer to spray whether or not there are sufficient beetles to damage his crop <e> <s> this question of application is always complicated but certainly it should go into the bill <e> <s> we shall no doubt be told that something covers it elsewhere but we support those amendments raised by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> these three amendments grouped together are very important indeed and will warrant a very long debate <e> <s> i understand that there has been agreement between the usual channels that we should try to rise at ten oclock <e> <s> i should like to know what the committee feels on the subject before opening up a very wide debate <e>", "<cs> this is a very difficult point <e> <s> there is no doubt that you could not possibly fault the machine <e> <s> it must be the operator who is ultimately at fault <e> <s> later in the bill there is an amendment to see that all operators are well trained <e> <s> this should meet the point about ensuring that he would not use a faulty machine <e> <s> if he is a certificated operator that will solve the problem raised by the noble lord lord craigton <e>", "<cs> this is also a very difficult question and i quite see the concern of the ramblers and walkers in the countryside particularly if they <e>", "<cs> i feel there is a little difficulty in this amendment in terms of trying to decide how much residue would be left if you are spraying a different thickness of crop <e> <s> i presume although i am not sure whether i am right in this that if you spray a thick crop of barley there will be less residue whereas with a thin crop you will very probably use the same amount of spray but the residue will be greater <e> <s> so i feel that the amendment falls on that count alone <e>", "<cs> i think that no one could disagree with what the noble lord lord northbourne has said about the soil in this country <e> <s> whether or not his amendment is correct i do not know but i think we should give considerable thought to what we are doing to the soil by using the various sprays that we are using <e>", "<cs> i was going to say that i almost completely agree with what the noble lord <e> <s> lord stodart has said and he said it better than i can probably say it except that i do not understand the point requiring manufacturers to do anything about it <e> <s> the supplier surely is the important person <e> <s> as the noble lord said the detail required is far too much to expect an ordinary farmer to cope with <e> <s> we keep reasonable records which should satisfy without going into these details which i think the noble lord shattered fairly well <e>", "<cs> in spite of his board meeting i am glad that my noble kinsman has arrived here at last and we are grateful to him for tabling this amendment <e> <s> as he rightly said aerial spraying has given rise to the fear of spray drift by the public <e> <s> i should like to divide aerial spraying into spraying by fixed-wing aircraft and spraying by helicopter <e> <s> i have done both in scotland and in essex and i am perfectly certain that in arable areas we could ban fixed-wing spraying without there being much loss to any situation <e> <s> a plane can spray only at a speed of about miles per hour <e> <s> if the pilot is in the process of climbing and at the same time forgets to switch off the spray in those one or two seconds it is very easy to make a mistake <e> <s> we were speaking about drift earlier if spraying is being carried out at about feet with wind drift the chances of making a mistake are very much greater <e> <s> apart from hill and forestry spraying i think that we could safely ban fixed-wing spraying in arable areas urban districts and so on <e>", "<cs> the noble lord could not have been listening very carefully <e> <s> i said quite distinctly that fixed-wing aircraft should be allowed for forestry and hillside bracken spraying <e> <s> i said that on second reading and i repeated it a few minutes ago <e>", "<cs> before we finish this short debate i should like to say that there is a slight suggestion from most noble lords that there was criticism of the pilots <e> <s> i certainly did not want to make any criticism at all of the pilots <e> <s> i was simply criticising the margin of error that there is in using a plane particularly a fixed-wing place in spraying <e> <s> i had some experience when with the forestry commission of spraying large areas of woodland in the north west of scotland <e> <s> a new zealand pilot did it with a fixed-wing plane and i had nothing but admiration for the way he handled that plane and the accuracy with which he carried it out <e> <s> but he was operating over a large area and a very sparsely populated area <e> <s> also on my own farm i have seen pilots with helicopters operating among the trees and their skill was quite extraordinary <e> <s> but whatever you say there is a very large margin of error <e> <s> anyone who has seen the errors that we make with tractors travelling at five to six miles an hour opening up too quickly and blotting things out with double spray and so on can imagine what could happen with a fixed-wing plane irrespective of how skilful the pilot was <e> <s> i thought i should like to make that point <e>", "<cs> our amendment no <e> <s> is on very much the same lines as my noble kinsmans amendment <e>", "<cs> before my noble kinsman withdraws this amendment i should like to say that it seems quite ridiculous that all through this bill there has run the thread of the great dangers of spraying through every amendment that has been brought forward has been about the controls we must have and the dangers against which we have to do everything possible but when it comes to the crunch the man who has to put on that spray oh no <e> <s> you can train him if you like but as my noble kinsman says he could be a complete idiot and fail the training nevertheless he may go home and work a spray <e> <s> i do not think that the government are being rational about this at all <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> in view of the ministers reply i think we should return to it at the next stage of the bill <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for his reply and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> this is rather an important amendment because there is a tremendous lot of implantation of animals and there is also quite a lot of dressing of animals for instance for warble fly and so on <e> <s> i think it is essential that animals should be included and we support this amendment <e>", "<cs> this is a rather interesting amendment and i feel we want to look at it very carefully <e> <s> farmers are not altogether fools and i think that they should judge for themselves whether or not a representative of a spray firm should be allowed about the place <e> <s> personally i find them on the whole very helpful <e> <s> you can always check their advice with adas <e> <s> i should be loath to support my noble friend on this amendment <e>", "<cs> it is an assurance which says that a lot of things are available under the bill <e> <s> the noble earl is right many things are available under the bill but he is unwilling to write them into it <e> <s> however in view of what he said i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for that reply and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord care to hazard a guess at which political party will benefit most <e>", "<cs> my lords referring to the noble lords point about trolleys and porters one of the most important things at the station is to see that there is a slope instead of steps to push a trolley up <e> <s> there are far too many steps at stations and not enough slopes <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is having a busy morning and i should not like to hinder him too long <e> <s> he has given us a very clear explanation of the regulations but i wonder whether a hardworking hill farmer would understand the appalling official language in the regulations <e> <s> had there been more time i should have entertained your lordships by quoting a few passages which i cannot understand and i have experience of reading such documents <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord and his colleagues in the ministry of agriculture will see that there is an explanatory leaflet that a farmer can understand concerning what he can do when he can do it and so on <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord said that the subject raised by the noble lord lord sandford would be discussed when orders were brought in on the new capital grants <e> <s> a very important and novel situation will arise when capital grants are used for or biased towards conservation <e> <s> i hope that we can have an assurance that they will not be discussed at ten oclock at night or just before a recess <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that answer which is slightly <e>", "<cs> if i may return to the point about who owns the quota if there is an ownership of the quota then there must be a value to it <e> <s> if the tenant owns the quota then there must be a value attached to it and he should surely be paid something in his tenant right <e> <s> i do not know who advises the arbiters <e> <s> do they simply take advice from the government or from the eec <e> <s> but in the meantime i know of tenants who have left the farms and received nothing at all for the quota <e> <s> the government must take this in hand and look into it a little more seriously <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister a few questions on this point <e> <s> do farmers know their liabilities for this levy and has any of it been collected <e> <s> if it has been collected what is happening to it <e> <s> is it being retained by the board or being invested <e> <s> what would happen if everybody took the attitude we are not going to pay unless you pay <e> <s> there would then be a bit of a deadlock would there not <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister answer my first question <e> <s> do farmers really know what their liability is if the levy is collected <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that my noble kinsman has gone far enough with his amendment <e> <s> i know that the bill is in three parts <e> <s> will this cover an accident by spraying which can happen and has happened in the past and would it be obligatory for farmers to insure as well as against an accident of spraying <e> <s> i have and i know that most farmers have an all-risks insurance <e> <s> whether it would cover this type of thing i do not know but i feel that it should be looked at along with the question of cases like flixborough etc <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may just miss out the commercial plug for a political party i entirely agree with all that my noble kinsman has said <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl lord swinton assures us that there will be a regulation to cover this point <e> <s> that of course is the problem with the bill <e> <s> many of the amendments put down have been dealt with in that way <e> <s> we have been told that the government will bring in a regulation <e> <s> i agree with the noble earl lord onslow that because of that we should have an opportunity to discuss the regulations when they are ready to see that they cover these points <e> <s> i in no way suggest that the noble earl the minister will not carry this out but we should have the opportunity just to make sure that such promises are carried out <e> <s> however in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister must be aware of the fear there is that the public will not appreciate what he said in committee stage to the noble lord lord craigton <e> <s> when he very kindly met us to discuss various points of the bill a few days ago he reiterated what he had stated then and said we have the powers and we shall be prepared to use them <e> <s> we accepted his word then and i think we still accept it <e> <s> however i think noble lords who have spoken are emphasising the general publics fear and the fact that they do not necessarily read <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down <e> <s> i have been reading his reply when he dealt previously with this matter <e> <s> the whole of the reply relates to the powers of the caa on control of flying and spraying <e> <s> there is no word about any particular kind of spray <e> <s> it may be contained in the caas regulations but he said nothing about it <e> <s> this amendment refers to particular pesticides <e> <s> there is a big difference <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say that the amendment of the noble lord lord stanley is one of which we would approve mainly because of the tremendous saving in spraying costs that there is in tank mixes <e> <s> but as he rightly said there are dangers <e> <s> people are stupid and mix the wrong things but if this amendment allows us to be stupid so be it <e> <s> but the instructions that one gets on most packages and in leaflets are very clear and there should not be any major mistakes in tank mixing <e> <s> i think that this amendment is one of which we would approve <e>", "<cs> my lords although agreeing with the spirit of this amendment i am under tremendous difficulty about the fact that we do not know how much residue various different pesticides leave <e> <s> we would get into very great difficulties if this amendment were accepted as it is written now <e> <s> there is the other problem that it may be perfectly safe to put on a particular pesticide with a controlled droplet sprayer or an electrostatic sprayer but dangerous with a hydraulic sprayer <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we should all agree with the spirit of this amendment <e> <s> the noble lord lord stanley said he agreed with the amendment which we put down in committee which suggested a sub-committee <e> <s> i have just gone through what we said on that occasion and i cannot find any word at all of a sub-committee <e> <s> it was a plain amendment to make the acp statutory with powers that a statutory committee would be given <e> <s> but i think there is no question about it widening its powers might if i may say so i am not quite sure what the right word is slightly dilute them <e> <s> a sub-committee to deal with the matters which the noble lord lord stanley mentioned particularly the development of new techniques etc <e> <s> might not be a bad idea because it is a specialised job which includes looking at sprayers and all the techniques that there are today compared with the general principle we have been discussing today the safety of pesticides the testing of them and everything else <e> <s> i certainly should support the amendment along those lines <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord finishes perhaps i should point out that a code of practice is not mandatory <e> <s> we only dealt with straw burning effectively when it became a by-law and was enforceable by law <e> <s> i do not think his analogy is worth tuppence <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so i did not say that the suggestion of the noble earl lord peel was not helpful <e> <s> i said that his analogy was not good <e> <s> that is a slightly different thing <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> i always give way to youth my lords <e> <s> is the minister aware that in spite of the publicity campaign which i think is a good idea so far as we can see the problem of sheep worrying by dogs is still very bad <e> <s> i have two neighbours who had their sheep worried last month <e> <s> is he also aware that the identification of the dog is the biggest problem <e> <s> we often know where the dog is but the police have no powers to go into the house and say we want that dog out to give it an emetic and prove that it has worried sheep <e> <s> we had an amendment if i remember correctly on the police bill in this respect but it was turned down <e> <s> until that happens and dogs are identified it will continue to be a very big problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for putting forward this scheme which advances the date to when these grants will be available <e> <s> the noble lord said that million had been paid out and that the government were anticipating paying out another million this year <e> <s> i am sure that we all appreciate the need for these grants to the fishing industry and i certainly have no objections to or criticisms of this scheme although i warn the minister that i shall have some on the next order which he is about to move <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has given a full review of what the order means <e> <s> he pointed out the two main items in it the savings and the fact that it was doing something to integrate grants which would help the environment situation which is much to the fore at the present moment <e> <s> i make no point at all about the governments policy on savings <e> <s> it is the ministers job i suppose to find something from agriculture and they have done it by reducing these grants by i think the estimate is million <e>", "<cs> my lords may i <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord made the point about this per cent <e> <s> for the less favoured areas but only per cent <e> <s> for the lowlands in the new grants to affect the environment <e> <s> but may i point out that it is in the lowlands that the great criticism is heard not in the less favoured areas <e> <s> i have heard little criticism about what is happening in the less favoured areas <e> <s> all the criticism is in the areas such as the eastern counties where the grant has been increased only to per cent but it has been increased to per cent <e> <s> in the areas where there has been no criticism <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to follow up the question that was asked by my noble and learned friend on the front bench <e> <s> would it not save a lot of money if they desisted from coming here <e>", "<cs> my lords i take it that we are discussing the three amendments in the noble lords name <e>", "<cs> the noble earl lord radnor has certainly spoken on the three amendments as far as i can see and he appears to be nodding his head in agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords i would agree with the noble earl lord onslow that this is not a particularly good amendment but i think the noble earl lord radnor has a point <e> <s> the cost of insurance makes it almost uninsurable <e> <s> i do not know what rates he was quoted or what the circumstances were but he has a point there <e> <s> there is a precedent for insisting on insurance that is the motor-car <e> <s> you must cover your motor-car with third party insurance so there is a case there <e> <s> i wanted to make those two points <e> <s> probably the amendment is not suitable for this bill and i think we are going to hear that in a few minutes from the noble lord the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords we very much support the noble lord lord stanley though we would not put it in the flowery language that he used <e> <s> if the minister is to have an advisory committee and we discussed to a great extent what the composition of that committee should be and if it is to be a fairly powerful one full use should be made of it <e> <s> it should not only be asked for advice but should be able to give advice always at the centre of things and not waiting to be asked <e> <s> i support the amendment in every way <e>", "<cs> my lords i have read this amendment and discussed it with my noble friend lady nicol <e> <s> it refers to prohibiting the export of a pesticide <e> <s> it is not the case as the minister suggested that every pesticide has to be examined <e> <s> it involves a pesticide which has something wrong with it <e> <s> the amendment refers to a pesticide and not pesticides <e>", "<cs> my lords at the beginning of our proceedings on the bill my noble friend lady birk made the point and i thought she made it very well that this was a bill we all thought was necessary and that we would do everything necessary to help its passage through the house <e> <s> i think we have done that although we have had a couple of votes tonight that may have enlivened the proceedings and perhaps given the government chief whip some degree of worry over the second one <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we would all agree that it is a step in the right direction to co-ordinate all the various environmental and agricultural issues in the list that the minister gave <e> <s> but is he aware that farmers are a little worried not by the emphasis on planting trees which is correct but by the emphasis on the kind of trees <e> <s> a farmer gets a grant when he plants deciduous trees and emphasis is being placed on the economic value of planting trees <e> <s> should not a farmer also get a grant for planting conifer trees the results of which he will not see in his lifetime <e> <s> the point applies particularly to tenant farmers <e> <s> as the minister will recall he removed any chance of a grant being paid in certain cases <e> <s> i should like the minister to give some thought as to how exactly grants are given for the type of trees that are planted <e>", "<cs> my lords the one thing we must do is to congratulate the noble lord lord alport on what he has described as his mark iii effort <e> <s> i had it down as mark ii i had forgotten about mark i his persistence is to be admired and also his persuasiveness because he has done much research into everything that has happened since the last bill <e> <s> he has included what the councils have done and the number of fines and the damage including that unfortunate case in lincolnshire <e> <s> i am not sure where he obtained all his particulars about the number of farmers who have given up burning but he made an interesting point there <e> <s> there is no doubt that the noble lord has persuaded himself and is now doing his best to persuade us and everybody else that a complete ban will be necessary in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down he must remember and i know and am taking into account his age that when he was a boy living in the vale of belvoir there was simply no grain <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister put the case for the bill very well and we thank him for doing so <e> <s> he also explained and we all agree with him that there was very good reason for action because of the milk surpluses costing the community an enormous amount of money <e> <s> therefore we thoroughly agree that action had to be taken <e>", "<cs> my lords the important question i think was the last one i asked about future allocations <e> <s> there is still a huge surplus of milk <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the minister for that reply may i say that he has not told us very much <e> <s> can i put it to him and is he really aware <e>", "<cs> i have my lords <e> <s> is the minister aware that if efficiency in farming is to be maintained in the face of falling prices agriculture <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the noble lord whether he is aware that if the industry is to give help to research it will need more time to organise <e> <s> will he see that the cuts are phased over a longer period to allow this to happen <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that he made a mistake in saying that the figure for was million <e> <s> it is million <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble lord lord belstead for putting these orders before us and for his good and commendably brief speech in doing so <e> <s> i no longer grow potatoes but i could not agree with him more about the free market in potatoes <e> <s> i suffered from it from onwards <e> <s> there is no question about it the potato marketing board has been a boon to farmers <e> <s> i know that recently as the minister said there has been unhappiness about it from some sections but on the whole the national farmers union is happy with the orders and the draft amendments <e> <s> indeed i know that because there has been no lobbying about them which is unusual <e>", "<cs> my lords we welcome the statement from the other house and wish to thank the minister for repeating it <e> <s> on the question of the two quotas i am perfectly certain that producer retailers will welcome this <e> <s> as the statement says it is open to abuse <e> <s> i am presuming that the policing of it will be done by the mmb <e> <s> i wonder whether the minister can tell us whether or not that is right <e>", "<cs> my lords i almost found myself tonight like the scottish elder who had a reputation for being able to produce a short prayer very quickly <e> <s> he ultimately admitted that he had it written inside his hat but one day he duly lowered his hat correctly and looked into it and started my lord pause this is not my hat <e> <s> a few minutes before i thought this debate was going to start i looked at my papers and found that i had lost a lot of my notes <e> <s> it was only the length of the debate on northern ireland that helped me to produce a rather truncated version of my original very carefully summed up and written down notes but this may help your lordships to get to dinner a little earlier <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl has put his case across very fairly and in no way do i wish to oppose this instruction <e> <s> he emphasised the word unprecedented which i think is the word which is creating a lot of difficulties <e> <s> as he mentioned so i too should like to mention the importance of scrap dealers in this country <e> <s> in this year and age if the number of motor-cars that go off the road and the number of wireless sets and television sets and so on which pile up in the countryside were spread all over the place and not collected by scrap dealers we should have quite a mess <e> <s> i know this because we as farmers seem to accumulate an enormous amount of scrap in a very short time and so we are very much obliged to the scrap dealers who come to collect it and keep our places tidy <e> <s> sometimes they do not pay us what we think is enough nevertheless they do a useful job <e>", "<cs> my lords if scrap dealers had planning permission and were asked to put a ft screen around their premises which they agreed to do and then piled cars ft high would the noble lord give compensation to build a higher screen to cover them <e>", "<cs> my lords if a scrap dealer gets planning permission which says that he must have a screen ft high and then behind that screen he piles cars ft high what will the noble lord do <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that answer but is he aware that the plan that the operators have issued shows a proliferation of these masts all over the country somewhat less than or miles apart <e> <s> does he not think that the government should have consulted at least the association of county councils if not the local planning officers before sponsoring a project which will litter the countryside with masts up to feet high <e>", "<cs> my lords i can give the noble lord the information that two companies have issued a map showing circles where all these masts are to be and they cover almost the whole of the southern counties of england up to the midlands <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl not agree that stockmanship is the key factor and that any number of codes will not replace good stockmanship <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that our animal health record is second to none in the world and that it would be a pity if the government took any action as a result of this wide-ranging report with its recommendations that impaired that <e>", "<cs> my lords it is left to me to wind up <e> <s> i could comment on many things but i think that is completely unnecessary <e> <s> what has delighted me about this debate is that it has been conducted in what i might call an atmosphere of consensus from all sides <e> <s> i simply want to thank all noble lords who have taken part for their contributions and to thank the minister for his <e> <s> i hope that he will be able to carry out not the promises but the statements he has made and with that i beg leave to withdraw the motion <e>", "<cs> my lords we are very much obliged to the noble lord for repeating the statement that was made in another place <e> <s> it is a pity that it is so late <e> <s> as your lordships know the agricultural year starts at the end of march or the beginning of april and here we are into may <e> <s> it was mentioned the other day i forget in which publication that the council of ministers seem to have their heads in a heap of grain <e> <s> our minister certainly does not hide his light under a bushel so far as this report is concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords we all know the difficulties in deciding where the line of the less favoured areas should begin <e> <s> i have had experience in ec work and in the ministry <e> <s> does the advisory committee help the assessor <e> <s> i know that that is the case with local farmers <e> <s> it helps the situation considerably if the advisory committee helps or advises the assessor who has a very difficult job <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has said that notes were unsuccessful in some other countries <e> <s> in what way were they unsuccessful <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all grateful to the noble lord lord gallacher for putting this bill before us and congratulate him on the various points he has made which are very relevant to the situation <e> <s> like the noble lord lord bruce of donington i want to take this opportunity to make a point i have always wanted to make about agricultural training <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord stanley who has a lot of experience in hill farming has put this bill before the house in the hope that we will pass it and i think that his hope should be granted <e> <s> muir burning as we call it has always been a bit of a contentious subject in hill farming and i hope that this extension of control by regulation will not increase that contention because a lot of hill farmers do not feel there is enough muir burning as it is to give them better grazing and better keep and i know that the grouse people do not like too much <e> <s> they just like <e>", "<cs> my lords we all know the difficulties which the forestry commission has in making checks because per cent <e> <s> of our wood and wood products come from abroad <e> <s> but such checks are essential because none of us wants to see something like dutch elm disease spreading to this country <e> <s> i should like to ask the noble earl whether the dunnage used to pack wood on ships is being checked as carefully as it should he <e> <s> this is not taken away from the ports and those responsible are duty bound to burn it or otherwise dispose of it properly <e> <s> in order to save the expense of doing that dunnage is often taken back out to sea and thrown overboard and it is then washed ashore <e> <s> does the noble earl know whether or not that aspect is being checked as carefully as it should be <e> <s> i know that there were great difficulties about that at one time <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord shinwell raised the question of getting access to this place <e> <s> my problem is getting away from it <e> <s> if one tries to drive into parliament square from here streams of pedestrians prevent you every time the traffic is clear from bridge street and the moment that they have crossed the traffic appears again <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord is giving advice to whoever is dealing with the glc could they take a look at the problem there <e>", "<cs> my lords thank you <e> <s> who on its staff knows about agricultural estate management <e> <s> it is ridiculous to hand over acres with no arrangements for their management <e> <s> i could go on pointing out the chaos as <e>", "<cs> my lords i was given the particulars of exactly where the farms were going to go <e> <s> the borough of enfield certainly is getting acres and one or two other boroughs are going to get quite a lot <e> <s> but the point that i was making was that more than half was going to the boroughs and of course less than half going to the counties <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i should like to try to correct the situation about the land <e> <s> the figures i have given refer to the land that is present in the various boroughs <e> <s> as i understood it a statement was made that that land would pass to the boroughs and the land in the counties would pass to the counties <e> <s> if that is not correct then i think the noble lord will need to tell us <e> <s> but it does not alter my main argument that it is a major mistake to break up an estate of acres which is working so well at the present moment and of great benefit to smallholders and farmers <e>", "<cs> my lords i moved this amendment earlier and i see no reason why we should not test the feeling of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness able to say whether any help can be offered in the way of asylum by the various countries that have made representations <e> <s> would this help the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble viscount lord mountgarret i rise to make a last minute plea to the government <e> <s> before doing so i too should like to congratulate the speakers on our front benches including my noble friend lady birk <e> <s> her remark to the noble lord lord elton that he was pitchforked into this is not an inelegant one if i may say so to the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> pitchforking is a very rhythmic operation if done by an expert but that may not apply to the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lady birk started her speech after her compliments to everybody by commenting on her concern about various matters <e> <s> my concern is what will happen to the farming estate and the three demonstration farms <e> <s> this is an estate of acres and it will be fragmented among a plethora of local authorities which will do no good to it at all <e> <s> the importance of the farming estate during the goings-on on the bill was lost because for some unknown reason it is under the arts and recreation section of the glc <e> <s> i know that farming is an art but i do not consider it a recreation <e> <s> any amendments that were put down did not cover the farming estate <e> <s> one of the remarks made and i am pleased to see the noble lord lord belstead here during the agricultural holdings bill by the <e>", "<cs> my lords arising out of the supplementary question of my noble friend lady <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the noble lords question have been much better if he had left out the word lanes <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure whether it is in order for one to make two speeches but we are in a good mood and have plenty of time for the noble lord to have two bites at the cherry <e>", "<cs> my lords how good is the isolation of these fish if they are put into coastal waters <e> <s> it is very difficult to isolate fish <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord can explain the difference between under the sea-bed and sub sea-bed <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord said that the codes were to be given legal status <e> <s> i do not <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the minister has twice used the expression that the government have not yet reached a decision <e> <s> like the noble lord lord stanley of alderley who is also a farmer i am always suspicious of the word reasonable in anything that we have to pay for <e> <s> i wonder why it is that an expression such as a calculated fee of the actual cost could not be used instead of the words a reasonable fee <e> <s> why not <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord suggested that he would be receptive to new ideas <e> <s> does not current research cover new ideas as well <e>", "<cs> my lords we are very much obliged to the noble earl for explaining this scheme <e> <s> if one listened carefully to the noble earl going through all the various regulations numbers dates and one thing and another one understood how really one would need a research assistant to research everything properly which i am afraid i did not do <e> <s> so i am obliged to the noble lord the minister for doing it for us and for explaining how all the various regulations tied together over the years <e> <s> anything that helps marketing and of course processing is very welcome as anybody would know who listened to the noble lord lord sieff when he opened the royal show appealing to farmers to make their marketing better <e> <s> of course as he pointed out they cannot do that unless they process their goods much better than they do at present and he gave some instances which were very interesting indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl i think said that these regulations were even simpler than the previous ones but there are about six items on the back page which one has to follow before arriving at a conclusion <e> <s> however we shall let that pass <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the minister for putting these instruments in front of us and for the explanations he has given which in many ways welcome some of the changes <e> <s> the noble lord emphasised in the latter part of his speech the question of the environment a subject with which my noble friend sitting behind me will want to deal <e> <s> some of the changes and improvements will be welcomed particularly by the top fruit growers who are getting help by the glasshouse industry which of course needs help and by the young farmers <e> <s> i have not read the scheme as closely as i should have done but did i hear the noble lord say that the younger farmer was somebody under <e> <s> that seems to be the older farmer <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount is quite right that you get per cent <e> <s> for any other shelter belt but it does not alter my argument that it is stupid to give per cent <e> <s> and insist on per cent <e> <s> of hardwood <e>", "<cs> my lords i want first not only to congratulate the noble lord lord plowden for putting this report before us but also to thank him for all the work that he did towards it <e> <s> i do not think we realise how much he contributed behind the scenes <e> <s> we had rather a short time to prepare the report <e> <s> it <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down i think i should correct her on the question of labour for forestry and for agriculture <e> <s> statistics show that on comparable land forestry employs three times as many men as hill farming <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware of the size of the problem <e> <s> committee d produced a sea fishing report at the beginning of the year <e> <s> the evidence was that out of a total north sea catch of million tonnes the industrial catch was million tonnes <e> <s> if we take it that the per cent <e> <s> which is allowed for the period will become per cent <e> <s> that means that tonnes of edible fish is going into fishmeal <e> <s> the figures should be widely known and our minister should press this matter very hard indeed <e> <s> as the noble lord lord boothby says it will ruin fishing if such figures persist <e>", "<cs> my lords those are important figures that the minister has given and they are very encouraging <e> <s> however must we not widen the whole conception of food from britain into either an ec body or a national body in order to develop the process of getting rid of the enormous food surpluses that we have in this country <e> <s> there are rumours that the national farmers union has been trying to interest some body of that description and there has also been talk in the ec <e> <s> it is important that something should be done so that we may have world-wide trade in these surpluses at an early date <e>", "<cs> my lords i am deeply honoured to follow the noble baroness <e> <s> the moment that the whips see the word fish or the word salmon on the order paper they simply attach my name to the business <e> <s> when i pointed out to my noble friend lord cledwyn that this was really a foreign office matter he said that he felt sure that i was perfectly capable of dealing with it and he gave me yet another honour the honour of taking his place <e> <s> indeed my noble friend apologises for not being here <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl not give consideration to his reply to the noble baroness lady sharpies that the so-called fast outside lane is only a passing lane <e> <s> what does the inside lane do about passing <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl the minister for that to say the least of it rather alarming answer <e> <s> i have two further questions to ask <e> <s> first does the minister have any estimate of what the figure will be by the time the government have completed their reorganisation and cutting exercise <e> <s> secondly presuming that the noble earl has read the first paragraph of lord selbornes forward policy does he not agree that the challenge stated there cannot be met by cutting scientific staff at the rate at which the government are cutting them <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl is very cagey about figures <e> <s> is he aware that the institute of professional civil servants looking at the matter over a long period is emphatic that there will be a per cent <e> <s> loss of scientists from the service <e> <s> that is quite alarming <e> <s> the noble earl should take seriously what many of his noble friends obviously think of the situation and look into it more than he obviously has done <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that so far as farmers are concerned it looks as though we are now starting on the gold plate before we have finished selling the silver <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that pbi east craigs and aberystwyth along with the selling organisation nsdo have since they were initiated done more for farming than possibly any other research organisation <e> <s> if as he said to us it was last may one-and-a-half years ago that consideration of this subject began is it not pretty obvious that this is a difficult operation which should be left alone <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister laid great stress on profitability presumably to private enterprise and so on which will ultimately help the industry and the government <e> <s> i am sure that he must have looked at the profitability figures of the nsdo and will be aware that the royalties from the pbi which must ultimately have found their way to the treasury are enormous <e> <s> i doubt very much that he can make a calculation to show that the treasury or anybody else will be better off after this move <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the minister for repeating the statement made in the other place <e> <s> i should like to say that there has been criticism at how long the government have taken to produce this statement but personally i appreciate the difficulty <e> <s> it is very difficult in the circumstances to decide on areas etc <e> <s> and who should get help in this very difficult year weatherwise for farmers <e> <s> may i ask the noble lord the minister whether there was any survey made as to where the losses were greatest <e> <s> it seems to me that there were areas of arable particularly where people had gone out of dairying and with lower grades of land where in some cases there would have been lost per cent <e> <s> of the arable crops <e> <s> yet they do not come into this picture at all <e>", "<cs> my lords we do not need to delay the house over these two orders <e> <s> as the minister rightly pointed out they are simply designed to correct matters <e> <s> there is one rather amusing sentence in the first order where it states that sheep <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble lord for explaining the reason for the regulations <e> <s> the regulations involve a big change reducing the area from cubic metres to cubic metres <e> <s> of course it is the old old story these provisions have been made necessary because a minority of people have taken advantage of the situation <e> <s> it is extremely exasperating for those people who do the job properly <e> <s> after all as the noble lord has said woodland management covering a fairly large area of wood involves quite a few trees <e> <s> however the clearing of areas is a different matter <e> <s> the taking down of trees here and there and replanting could require the figure which has been in existence in the past <e> <s> i just wonder for how long that figure has stood the test of time and why it is necessary to make a change now <e> <s> has it been shown that large areas are being cleared <e> <s> i think that the new regulations will stultify many people who manage their woods in this way <e>", "<cs> my lords i made the point that having got a licence to fell the old quantity would an owner get a licence to sell the old quantity as well <e>", "<cs> i am sorry my lords but if an owner wants a licence to fell up to the old quantity that is his requirement will he be allowed to sell the same proportion as he is allowed to sell now <e>", "<cs> my lords the spirit of goodwill which always pervades this place is very prominent today <e> <s> my noble friend said earlier that he has no wish to alter it and neither have i especially when we are looking at an order which gives something to my fellow farmers <e> <s> i thank the noble lord lord belstead for explaining the order most of which is very welcome indeed <e> <s> the early payment is welcome because cash flow not only in the uplands but elsewhere is going to be difficult before this financial year ends <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for the reply <e> <s> he has a real point about the size of the area that is taken out rather than the size of the whole farm <e> <s> that is an important point which i missed <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that a rail link at stansted will not be very popular unless facilities from the underground at liverpool street station to the main line are improved immensely <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord will pay attention to the depth of feeling which exists in regard to this matter because it is very high indeed in aberdeen <e> <s> i was there last weekend and the feeling is very high indeed <e> <s> may i ask the noble lord what is going to happen to craigiebuckler and the grounds <e> <s> that property was left by mr macaulay to an institute <e> <s> it is run by trustees <e> <s> does the noble lord know whether the macaulay family still have any interest in it <e> <s> i hope the government will not get their grubby privatisation hands on the grounds and house of the macaulay institute <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord gallacher for the able brief and efficient way in which he put this report in front of your lordships <e> <s> i thank the noble lord not only for that but also for the very efficient and able way that he handles our committee and the witnesses <e> <s> we are all very grateful to the noble lord for that <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i feel that his noble friend lord radnor and i would like a little more

listed <e> <s> it shows that people get accustomed to buildings <e> <s> if the noble lord lord stanley had just kept his silo a bit longer the neighbours would not have wanted it knocked down because

argument but i could go back a little and spoil it very successfully <e>", "<cs> my lords if a letter is addressed with just a name and a post code will it get there <e>", "<cs> my lords arising out of the ministers reply to my noble friend lady nicol is the minister saying that there is no co-operation between his ministry and the local people as regards this monitoring <e> <s> if there is no such co-operation why is that so <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister tell us which ministry actually deals with the forestry commission <e> <s> the rumour came from the ministry of agriculture but

about the closure of this hospital <e> <s> is she also aware that the epping district council is asking for a judicial review on the subject admittedly on the procedure of the closure and that the local people have the support of all the elected bodies in the area <e> <s> she may say that the community health council represents that i do not know but it certainly has supported it in that way <e>", "<cs> my lords all right there will be time in the future <e> <s> i shall leave it at that for the present <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble baroness to confirm that in regard to the three places that she mentioned which are to help the ancillary services they are all about two miles apart <e> <s> the coronary clinic is in stewartson road and the other clinic is a mile away <e> <s> what the people in waltham abbey would like is a health centre with all these services under the roof of the present hospital <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a long and very interesting debate <e> <s> the first thing i want to do is to congratulate our two chairmen on the way they have put forward their reports <e> <s> they put them forward very clearly and concisely <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord templeman put his forward so well that he almost made my case for me but that will come out later in what i have to say <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that europe is deficient in wood and sufficient in food <e> <s> the areas being cleared to grow food would be much better used for forestry <e> <s> can we not swap food that we can grow in europe for the trees which we are short of but which they can grow <e>", "<cs> my lords at this time of night i had intended merely to dot the is and cross the ts of what the noble lord lord taylor said but so much has been said in this debate that requires an answer that i must go a little further <e> <s> we are obliged to the noble lord for putting down this unstarred question and giving us the opportunity to deal with some of these points <e> <s> it is a pity that it had to be so late but that is the way of things in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i stand corrected <e> <s> the noble lord said that he could see the advantages of the forestry commission and of imaginative planting and he thought that the government should not mess about with the commission <e> <s> i could not agree with him more <e>", "<cs> my lords we are very grateful to the noble lord for repeating the statement <e> <s> i am sorry to hear that the minister is not too well and we hope that he will have a good recovery <e> <s> he has had a very busy time indeed this last week because i think there have been six solid days of negotiation <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to raise a point for clarification <e> <s> the minister referred to per cent <e> <s> all over and then he said per tonne <e> <s> it does not seem to add up <e> <s> is it per tonne or per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords why has the noble earl concentrated on italy <e> <s> did not all this start in austria <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord belstead is very good at putting across a bill like this <e> <s> he does it so extraordinarily well that one is almost forced to agree with him sometimes <e> <s> i must congratulate him on the way he managed in a few sentences almost to put across the ten pages of schedule <e> <s> i am obliged to him because it does help me a little to understand what on earth the government are trying to do in this case <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we must congratulate the noble lord lord stanley on the brief and very efficient way he has put this bill forward <e> <s> i am sure many of your lordships would like to see it done more often in such a brief and concise way <e> <s> there is no question about it this short bill is a very good one in that it keeps up the standard of graded produce and sees that any bad grades are not used as the noble lord said out of the back door where they may be not regulated where nothing is done and they try to go through the market again <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought i was going to be under the scowls of the chief whip but i see that he has departed <e> <s> i shall be very brief in what i have to say <e>", "<cs> my lords as a farmer i would certainly hate the very thought of these people coming on to my farm without permission and doing the damage that they do <e> <s> but these people have adopted the attitude stop the world i want to get off and when one sees the conditions of the world today perhaps one cannot blame them <e> <s> i have great sympathy therefore with what the noble lord lord mellish was saying that we really should try to find a place for them to go <e> <s> in view of the situation in agriculture today where we are told to take land out of production surely land is available all over the country to give them permanent sites <e>", "<cs> we must thank the minister for his reply and for the fact that he has been very much seized of the committees feelings on the subject <e> <s> my amendment was perhaps a little abrupt <e> <s> the noble lord lord stanley made his proposal rather better by attaching amendment no <e> <s> to it <e> <s> on clause <e>", "<cs> we certainly support my noble friends amendment but i hope he does not wish adas to be chivvying people into the countryside and forcing them to enjoy it <e> <s> it rather gives me that impression nevertheless we support it <e>", "<cs> my noble friend has raised an interesting point <e> <s> as he said he raised it for discussion and he does not feel that the amendment should be put into the bill <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble lord is not suggesting that the farm building service provides an architectural service as well as a design service <e> <s> it can give only a design service not an architectural service <e>", "<cs> i do not want to delay the committee but nothing that the noble lord the minister has said has changed my mind in any shape or form <e> <s> may i point out that the mix-up between conservation and commercial advice is not one of my main points although it is an important one <e>", "<cs> i have already talked about the simplicity that would be required in making the charges <e> <s> this amendment would complicate the <e>", "<cs> i do not envy the ministers job in making up this code <e> <s> it is going to be one that has got to satisfy the noble lord lord houghton and me and that is going to be very difficult <e> <s> he made it perfectly plain earlier in the debate that he did not think that wheat was very important at all <e> <s> in fact he wanted to condemn all wheat to perdition and so far as i could see cover the countryside with hedges <e>", "<cs> the minister confirms what i said <e> <s> no sooner does one give way to one then one has to give way to two more and then yet another two to make the number <e> <s> the minister sees no reason why the figure should be further increased <e> <s> i have my doubts <e> <s> however he has given an explanation and although i am not satisfied i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has spoken to me about this <e> <s> we are perfectly agreeable to this suggestion and i think that it is sensible <e>", "<cs> many years ago i had a talk with the noble lord lord diamond a former first <e>", "<cs> it seems an eminently fair point that the minister has put forward and i think we would agree to it <e> <s> i presume that should the succession not be agreed to it would go back to the deceaseds or retiring tenants executors <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord middleton said and i think the noble lord lord belstead would agree putting figures across in committee is not easy and it is difficult to follow where they get one <e> <s> the amendment certainly seems to get somewhere in the calculations <e> <s> the noble lord gave us two examples which i quickly noted <e> <s> having forgotten my arithmetic i always carry a calculator in my pocket which i have used in trying to work out how this amendment would operate against figures that have been given to me on how little differences in the calculations can make such a variation in the percentage that the tenant might get <e>", "<cs> i am in some difficulty <e> <s> although the milk marketing board seems to have been eminently fair the amendment proposed by the noble lord lord middleton is too hard that proposed by the noble lord lord stanley goes the opposite way and the government amendment is about halfway between <e> <s> one wants to be fair <e> <s> i have received some calculations this afternoon while sitting on the front bench <e> <s> it appears that the noble lord lord stanley is being too kind to his friends and the noble lord lord middleton too kind to his <e> <s> i should like a solution somewhere between the two but also one that is simple <e> <s> however as the noble lord lord belstead has said whatever the outgoing tenant gets the incoming tenant has to pay for <e> <s> a balance has to be struck <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord lord stanley feels that he can enter a scottish argument i think that a renegade scot can enter it as well <e> <s> quite frankly to me these or pages containing an extra schedule seem to be quite ridiculous <e> <s> i have farmed in both scotland and england dairy and arable land at the same time and i could never see any difference whatsoever between the two <e> <s> i cannot for the life of me see dairy farming in scotland in less favoured areas as being very different from dairy farming in wales in less favoured areas <e> <s> i should be glad to know how the noble lord was persuaded by the scottish nfu that there is this great difference <e>", "<cs> the word maintenance to a farmer always means something physical <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> which talks about <e>", "<cs> i see this in a slightly different way from the way the noble lord lord monk bretton sees it <e> <s> we are told by the fao that there are million people in the world today whose state of nutrition is a disgrace and that half of them are actually on a starvation diet <e> <s> at the same time we have surplus food in the world <e> <s> i know the difficulty that my noble friend lord oram has described <e> <s> this surplus put on the market or given away free can have an effect on agriculture in countries that we want to see developing their own agriculture and feeding themselves as much as possible <e>", "<cs> like my noble friend i do not believe there is any question of bulls being trusted <e> <s> years and years ago we had a bull which we thought was as quiet as a lamb <e> <s> but suddenly it broke out on a dairyman in scotland and he was fortunate not to have been seriously hurt <e> <s> on my farm in essex i had an aberdeen angus bull <e> <s> he was in the field for a few years and was never any trouble at all <e> <s> there was a footpath right through the middle of the field <e> <s> i do not know whether people noticed the bull or whether or not they used the footpath but somebody left the gate open and the bull got out <e> <s> they then discovered there was a bull in the field and i had to remove him <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lady nicol seemed to suggest that the alteration <e>", "<cs> we do not know how big these areas will be and how many farms there will be <e> <s> it may be a major job to consult all the farms <e> <s> i should have thought that the amendment of the noble earl lord peel is much better <e> <s> if farmers are notified they can <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord buxton has a very real point here that there has been very little word on the management of these areas <e> <s> as the noble lord lord renton says this could be a very big job if farms in an area are to be managed in this way <e>", "<cs> we cannot but agree with the noble lord lord gisborough who has very carefully put the forestry commissions point of view as to what the situation would be <e> <s> we must congratulate the noble lord lord kilbracken who has looked at this matter in a slightly different way <e> <s> somebody who had disregarded the law comes under the same conditions as the law-abiding citizen <e> <s> i think that the noble lord lord kilbracken wanted something a little harder for someone who had broken the law <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness is perfectly correct there are people who hold different views <e> <s> like the noble lord lord taylor who was my predecessor in the forestry commission i have tremendous respect for the noble lord lord dulverton and for all that he has done for forestry conservation and the environment not only in this country but also abroad <e> <s> i have seen a great deal of his work <e> <s> he is the right person to put forward this proposal because nobody could possibly criticise what he has done <e> <s> he put the case very clearly and i cannot but support him <e>", "<cs> surely if esas are to work properly this amendment of my noble friend should not be necessary <e> <s> i hope the minister will be able to tell us today how the esas are to be managed and when we know that we shall be able to judge whether this amendment is required <e> <s> that is the main point i should like to make <e> <s> this is a perfectly good amendment and will do no harm but if it is unnecessary and if the management is right there is no sense in cluttering up the bill more than it is at the present moment <e>", "<cs> i have just a small point <e> <s> would it not be nicer to use the words agricultural change rather than agricultural threat <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord walston said we are delighted to have support for my noble friends amendment from so many noble lords on the other side of the committee <e> <s> as the noble lord lord stanley said there is no sense in having something like this which is a completely new concept in environmental issues if we do not know how it is working <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> is an essential part of it <e> <s> we look forward to hearing what the minister has to say about amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> as my noble friend said he has half answered it already but we should like it expanded on a little more <e>", "<cs> there are different views as i think i said two or three days ago about forestry <e> <s> i should point out that the forestry commission has local regional advisory committees <e> <s> these committees <e>", "<cs> i should like to take the opportunity of correcting my noble friend who sits behind me on the issue of non-grant-aided forestry <e> <s> i was talking about numbers while he was talking about acres <e> <s> from my most recent discussions with my friends in the forestry commission i understand the system is that the conservators report relates to very small areas here and there that are planted <e> <s> an estimate is made of how many cases there are <e> <s> the acreage has been increased by the two cases in scotland consisting of over hectars each which makes my noble friends point in acreage <e> <s> but as to numbers the commission thinks that these are going down <e> <s> however because of these two cases the acreages are going up <e>", "<cs> i have considerable sympathy with the point that my noble friend is making about the reduction of water levels in areas which are environmentally sensitive <e> <s> he has put forward the case <e>", "<cs> may i just make the point that the noble lord lord moran was right to be worried that the tax situation in forestry where you are making profits in another business and can invest them in forestry over a period creates a very good tax situation for the individual concerned <e> <s> i think he linked that <e>", "<cs> although i also privately at least felt that this would be abused or at least that it was not a good way of doing it unlike the noble earl lord onslow i have never thought about how one could do it and how one could defeat the authorities <e> <s> i am obliged to the noble lord lord melchett for reading out how it could be done <e> <s> he could have done this in a little less time although i agree with what he was saying <e> <s> it is rather disappointing that we did not have this report <e> <s> i gather that it was only put in the library a few days ago and it would have been better if we had had it <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord moran my noble friend lady white and my noble friend lord melchett seem to me as if they do not want an afforestation policy in this country <e> <s> if that is the case they should say so <e> <s> the areas that they are speaking about will only grow coniferous trees or at least most of them because there are some small areas in the hills that may grow scrub oak and so on but on the whole it has to be conifers <e>", "<cs> i should reply to some of the statements that have been made <e> <s> all the figures that i have and unfortunately i do not have them at my fingertips show that forestry compared with hill farming employs people in the ratio of three-to-one <e> <s> that is for the whole process of forestry <e> <s> my noble friend lord melchett said that at the moment private forestry was in the ascendant <e> <s> i know that private forestry goes in for a lot of gang labour brought in from outside the area and certainly that does not help rural employment though it is employment as such <e> <s> i am prepared to look up the figures and provide them to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> we have sssis and now esas <e> <s> we should wait a little while i believe before having anything like lcos <e> <s> much as i appreciate the noble earls wish to protect the landscape we should see how we get on with esas before going any further <e>", "<cs> my lords we are obliged to the minister for repeating the statement from another place <e> <s> we would all agree that these restrictions are a very necessary precaution in the circumstances <e> <s> the noble lord may have noticed that this issue was raised on a question in the house on wednesday so it is not altogether new <e>", "<cs> my lords there is not much that one can say which was not said on friday when the statement on wales and cumbria was made <e> <s> however i think that the importance of letting the public know what is happening should be re-emphasised and the noble viscount has done so because there were some considerable scare stories in the press last saturday morning <e> <s> however this is a difficult task to carry out and i understand that there has already been a drop in the price of lamb <e> <s> my own wifes reaction is that she will not buy lamb unless it is new zealand lamb <e> <s> this has a rolling effect which is seen in the fact that lamb prices have come down in spite of the fact that many of these lambs are not yet of marketable size although in days they can come a long way <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble viscount about another point which might worry farmers <e> <s> if the price comes down i hope the government will not rely on the variable premium to make it up <e> <s> there is a limit to the variable premium and it would not make up a loss of per cent <e> <s> which is the figure stated <e> <s> i do not know how accurate that figure is but it has been quoted in some of the reliable press <e> <s> that is something that must be carefully watched the government who are pretty good at this kind of thing relying on the variable premium which i do not think they can do in this case <e>", "<cs> my lords we must thank the minister for explaining and putting forward the order to us <e> <s> as usual he has done it very clearly <e> <s> it is a fairly straightforward order to which we can agree <e> <s> it is simply to raise money to help to pay for research and development in the horticultural industry <e> <s> this is to cover the million and million cuts which the government made between and up to <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord the minister very much for his assurances to the plymouth brethren i am sure that they will be delighted <e> <s> at the same time i should like <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not agree that it would help the situation if easter was fixed and not moved about over a whole month <e>", "<cs> my lords first i thank the noble lord lord belstead for the tremendous help that he has been since committee in keeping us up to date with his thinking and for the amendments that he has tabled <e> <s> this has been a great help to us <e> <s> i do not suggest that we agree with all the amendments but he has been a great help in every way for which i thank him <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for at least giving some thought in putting down this amendment <e> <s> in speaking to it i should like also to speak to amendment no <e> <s> if i may because the two are complementary in some ways <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that any of us could disagree with the minister in taking this opportunity to put a wrong right <e> <s> he has done so very well <e> <s> i recognise that retrospective legislation is frowned upon by most people but as the noble lord says in this case it is in a good cause <e> <s> we shall therefore allow it to slip through <e>", "<cs> my lords quotas having been introduced in the early days they have not been followed through <e> <s> some difficulties may appear when <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble kinsman made the remark that this was a complex bill in every way <e> <s> the amendments are an attempt to do something to simplify that <e> <s> i think that it was summed up in a letter that i received from the national farmers union scotland which said that to be acceptable and practicable the procedure adopted must be fair simple and easy to understand and operate <e> <s> whatever one can say about the governments plan it certainly does not stand up to those criteria by any manner of means hence the amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords there is one thing about the noble earls amendment it would certainly solve all our problems straight away if we accepted it <e> <s> quite frankly i agree with his amendment in one way except that he has come with it too late <e> <s> if we had <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say a few words <e> <s> i said at earlier stages of our debates today that i liked the noble lords amendment and that it helped the smaller man <e> <s> i think the noble lord agrees there <e> <s> at the same time i think that that help runs right through it which is the kind of thing you cannot help <e> <s> that is what i meant when i said i thought it went too far <e> <s> but as my noble kinsman has said it is our last chance to do something about the results of the governments schedule and i would give the amendment unstinted support <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not settle the argument if we had the average figures for milk production per cow in scotland and in england <e>", "<cs> my lords we have footpaths they are rights of way <e> <s> the public have the right to use them <e> <s> we have stock on the farms which have the foothpaths <e> <s> the farmer feels that he has the right to put the animals in the fields particularly if he is a dairy farmer using a beef bull or has suckler herds with beef bulls <e>", "<cs> the noble earl lord ferrers has taken the words right out of my mouth except that i had only four items listed and he had five i did not know about the landscape development order which he mentioned <e> <s> i would be worried not so much about this order which might come along but rather about the question of who is to operate it and who is to decide about the landscaping <e> <s> is this going to mean a whole host of extra officials for the councils <e> <s> i think we would need to know a little more about how it is going to be operated who is to take the decisions and whether there will be a right of appeal and so on <e>", "<cs> my lords since my noble friend raised the question of the common agricultural policy and the surpluses and others suggested that nothing was being done i should like to point out and i only have the figures in my head that the levy which is being raised in order to deal with those surpluses will cost ec farmers somewhere in the region of million <e> <s> british farmers share of that will be million and i have just worked out that j mackies share of it will be about <e>", "<cs> my lords must it take eight years to complete this work <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not read this document but may i ask whether there is as much emphasis on urban conservation as there is on rural conservation <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the words of the noble lord lord middleton and if the noble lord lord belstead says that the lawyers are satisfied then i believe we are too <e>", "<cs> my lords surely if there is a difference as small as that would it not satisfy the noble lord lord stanley if you just made it the same <e>", "<cs> my lords as your lordships know we argued this point about fairness to the tenant for a long time during the committee stage and again on report <e> <s> i do not feel for once that i can improve on the arguments of my noble kinsman <e> <s> he has put the case very well and i think it is a very strong case <e> <s> as he said it is a pity that agreement could not have been reached between the cla and the nfu <e> <s> i spoke to the noble lord lord middleton and asked whether they would not agree on but he was not keen on that <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord belstead put it in a nutshell when he said that we had passed or amendments i forget the exact number <e> <s> of course many of those amendments were drafting amendments <e> <s> when such a number is mentioned it looks as though we have managed to amend the bill to a considerable extent but i do not think that the picture is quite so rosy as that figure would suggest and as the noble lord makes out <e> <s> however we are all entitled to make the best use of figures that we can and the noble lord is very good at doing it <e>", "<cs> my lords it is many years since i left another place and often very late at night when i was in government and in opposition i stood up at the box to find probably one or two people in front of me and very few behind me <e> <s> i thought i had left those days behind but here i find myself in much the same position <e>", "<cs> my lords we are obliged to the minister for putting this order before us and explaining as he did a week or two ago the necessity for change because of some faults <e> <s> he is right in saying that it is better to bring in a completely new order rather than to amend the old order <e> <s> have there been any recriminations or claims because of this fault <e> <s> it would be interesting to know whether there has been anything of that nature <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for those figures <e> <s> is he aware that the governments reasons for and i paraphrase transferring these two bodies to the private sector are to ensure the maximum benefit to agriculture and the united kingdom economy <e> <s> is the minister aware that the pbi has produced seed that is now growing per cent <e> <s> of the wheat in this country and per cent <e> <s> of the potatoes <e> <s> does he think that a private company in the past has anywhere near matched those figures or is likely to match them in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble earl as we know that he has a report from lazard on the situation whether lazards figures agree with the figures he gave me a few moments ago <e>", "<cs> my lords much emphasis has been put on developing agriculture <e> <s> does the noble baroness not agree that this should not in any way influence direct aid of food to people who are actually starving

minister aware that the million acres of green belt land puts the farming community within it in a difficult position in carrying out the governments wish for us to give up buildings for small industries and so on <e> <s> we are at a great disadvantage as compared with our colleagues outside the green belt <e>", "<cs> my lords apart from congratulating the minister as a member of this house on his first appearance i should like to congratulate him as a farmer on his reply which will be very well received <e> <s> is he aware that although the technicalities of incorporating straw mainly on lighter land have been solved perhaps i may add on this point that they have been solved by the scottish niae which the government have taken in hand almost to abolish the burning of straw has always proved a sanitation action against straw-borne diseases <e> <s> however we still do not know whether the steady incorporation of straw year by year creates a problem of which we are not yet aware <e> <s> i think the ministers reply will be welcomed by farmers <e> <s> after all it is a very sick code indeed and i think he will be aware of the difficulties it sometimes raises <e> <s> nevertheless farmers have been much better in attending to it this year <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that there are other areas of the country where people may feel they should have some weighting in their salaries <e> <s> i refer particularly to the north-west of scotland where expenses such as petrol education and a whole host of things need looking into <e> <s> when i was in the

better if all animals for slaughter were slaughtered in this country and exported dead <e> <s> that would save the terrible situation that we have seen recently in the press and on tv of animals dying on the way <e>", "<cs> my lords we are very grateful to the minister for repeating this complicated interesting and important statement <e> <s> i should like first to congratulate the minister of agriculture on the tremendous amount of work which he has put in on this subject <e> <s> he has achieved what are in many ways very good results indeed <e> <s> however i think that the press have become rather euphoric about this matter <e> <s> for the <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that

restrictions for beef which were announced recently by the ec <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the minister is not in agreement with the point he made that price fixing is to be the sole way of dealing with these surpluses <e> <s> it is generally agreed that that system would hurt british farmers very badly <e> <s> at present we have quotas for various items and i hope that the minister will think about quotas along with some price fixing <e> <s> does the minister consider that the ec plan announced this morning with which the british government agree will have much effect on the total

for the whole of the ec <e>", "<cs> my lords all i can say in winding-up the debate and in withdrawing the motion is that it has shown very clearly that the problem is a critical one as everybody who has spoken has agreed and the minister emphasised that in his final words <e> <s> all i shall now do is thank everybody for taking part in this debate <e> <s> we are very pleased that the minister is seized of the problem and that he has well taken note of all we have said <e> <s> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the motion <e>", "<cs> my lords i have had discussions with the three companies concerned and i must admit that tate and lyle and ferruzzi almost convinced me that their cases were correct but when i talked to british sugar the manager there pointed out to me that the situation had changed over the last year to months <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord hesketh said that this was a straightforward order <e> <s> i am afraid that i must disagree with him <e> <s> i certainly agree with the idea that keeping a sheep from being broken mouthed which is the expression used in the trade is a tremendous saving to flock owners particularly in hill sheep areas and in my

must congratulate her on telling us exactly the right amount about this important subject <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness <e> <s> it is a low amount and it is very safe indeed <e> <s> as the noble baroness has said one receives more radiation when crossing the atlantic in concorde <e> <s> i think there was an incident when a noble lord visited sellafield <e> <s> he had a watch which produced so much radiation that it set off an alarm <e> <s> the public can therefore be assured that the government are taking adequate action in terms of the amount allowed <e>", "<cs> my lords we are delighted that the noble baroness has brought these regulations forward for discussion <e> <s> there is no question particularly so far as concerns the battery production of eggs that there is a lot of feeling one way or another and i think that these regulations should help to give some succour to the people who feel that battery egg production should be banned altogether <e>", "<cs> my

margarets <e> <s> sometimes it is hardly possible to cross <e>", "<cs> the noble earl lord cranbrook said that he did not want to make a second reading speech <e> <s> it would have helped if he had given some guidance on how the grants should be paid whether per tonne production or per gallon of milk <e> <s> how would they be worked out <e> <s> i know that the bill is an enabling measure <e> <s>

her last piece of advice i cannot take <e> <s> i can only withdraw amendment no <e> <s> and we will see what happens when we come to nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps the deputy chairman of committees can tell my why amendment no <e> <s> was not called on clause <e>", "<cs> i think that we can agree with the noble lords amendment especially paragraph d <e> <s> many farmers use woodlands for shelter for stock <e> <s> to take that stock out and to leave the woodlands for environmental purposes would mean a loss <e> <s> i asked the noble earl lord cranbrook how he would estimate that loss <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble lord lord moran has any ideas <e> <s> it may be difficult to give a figure <e> <s> cattle would have to be taken out of the woodlands for the winter and that may be difficult to administer <e> <s> i can see the point however <e> <s> if farmers do that and the woodland is next to pasture it must be fenced <e> <s> fencing is expensive nowadays <e>", "<cs> my lords would it be possible for every car involved in an accident to be registered and not be allowed on the road again until it was motd <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware of the feeling in the country that it is better to distribute some of the food in this way than to give it to russia and other places cheaply <e> <s> i am glad the minister has taken up the point <e> <s> is he aware of the report in the <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is always emphasising that the government are considering the implications <e> <s> have the government accepted the scheme or not <e>", "<cs> my lords we are much obliged to the noble baroness for putting across these two instruments so well <e> <s> way back in when the first orders were produced for this job i ventured to suggest being in opposition then <e> <s> that the people who let coypus loose and the well-off people who wore the expensive coats etc <e> <s> should pay for the work to get them caught again or eliminated <e> <s> i was told then that it was a little difficult to identify each coypu or mink and who they belonged to <e>", "<cs> my lords again i thank the noble baroness for so clearly putting forward why this order is before us <e> <s> however the noble baroness disappointed me slightly <e> <s> i was hoping that she would read out all the names in paragraph <e> <s> i shall not attempt to do that but it would have been interesting to have heard the noble baroness read out those or names <e>", "<cs> my lords first we must thank the noble lord for being quick to give us so many details on this matter <e> <s> on one occasion i ticked off the noble baroness for giving us too many details but on this occasion that is what we have been looking for <e> <s> we thank the noble lord again for doing it so well <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may intervene for one moment <e> <s> i am very intrigued by these amendments <e> <s> that is why i supported them from the point of view of the rspb which is always worried about changes in habitat <e> <s> in these areas where farmers have improved their land the habitat has changed but the birds and so on have accustomed themselves to it <e> <s> now people want to preserve what they were against in the first place <e> <s> i think we should agree to that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that we cannot support this amendment <e> <s> there is no question that broadleaves as the noble lord has said are attractive from the point of view of amenity but i <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble baroness is probably right that three years is sufficient <e> <s> i hope that at the end of that time the review will satisfy the noble lord lord moran that a lot of deciduous trees have been planted <e> <s> i look forward to the review and hope that i shall survive until it comes along <e> <s> with that observation i shall withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that

blowing away from danger areas or areas likely to be affected <e> <s> i have found that to be a successful practice <e> <s> a country person sprays his own land and not somebody elses <e>", "<cs> my lords i said that i do not think that any farmer would refuse to give the information appearing on the label of the package to someone who thought that he had been affected <e>", "<cs> my lords before we let the bill slide off to another place i think that we should congratulate the noble baroness <e> <s> i think that this is the first bill she has put to the house in her new post <e> <s> she has done it with good humour considerable skill and perhaps some mistakes small ones but we naturally support this bill which we consider should do a good job <e>", "<cs> my lords this is the third time since i came to the house that i have been landed with something due to the short-windedness of the agricultural lobby which evidently has not dawned on some of my colleagues who seem to be elsewhere <e> <s> however i am particularly interested in training and the construction industry because i have spent my life building farm buildings building houses for farm workers and altering houses for farm workers <e> <s> i have considerable experience of people in construction work not knowing their job <e> <s> training as in every industry is essential <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that because of what has happened in the reviews in the past few years as she well knows at her very own doorstep there was the taking over of the pbi etc <e> <s> any review now is looked on as suspect by the staff in all these research stations in adas and elsewhere <e> <s> it really would be better if they could be given some indication of what is happening as soon as possible because there is no question that morale is going down again <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness lady robson and i are the only two speakers who are not members of the committee <e> <s> nevertheless we can sincerely compliment the noble lord lord gallacher on the way in which he introduced the report today <e> <s> he covered a great deal of ground but there is still a great deal of ground to be covered <e> <s> i note that one of the first matters he mentioned almost in the second sentence was set-aside and i shall return to that subject later <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister have a breakdown of those figures <e> <s> can he tell the house how many people went to south africa <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the noble lord agree that it would be much better if pedestrians wore light clothing or a light arm band <e> <s> i have had several nasty experiences involving dark-clothed people on well-lit pedestrian crossings <e> <s> on a bad night one cannot see them <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister said that he was satisfied with some of the results <e> <s> can he pinpoint an area where one could see the results because i have not seen any <e>", "<cs> my lords did i understand the minister correctly <e> <s> did he say that it was the chocolate that attracted the value added tax <e> <s> if that is so perhaps i may point out that the bulk of the stuff that goes into easter eggs is synthetic chocolate <e> <s> that information can be obtained from the food people who are looking into the matter <e> <s> if that is the case then it is a false vat <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the minister can tell the house the logic of withdrawing the tax relief which has created wealth and jobs in scotland and elsewhere and giving relief in another way which means that the money will be spent elsewhere and probably abroad <e> <s> what is the logic of the exercise that the chancellor has undertaken <e> <s> the minister said that he hoped that a reasonable level of planting would be maintained <e> <s> the government must know that the target of hectares has fallen short by an average of acres over the past eight years <e> <s> how will the government get a reasonable level of planting when up to now they have failed <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to congratulate my noble friend lord carter and thank him for introducing this very important debate the importance of which has been shown by the number of speakers and the extraordinary wealth of points that have been made <e> <s> there is very little left for me to say <e> <s> any thunder that i may have had has been stolen already <e> <s> in fact i should like to say that i am rather sorry for the noble lord lord sanderson <e> <s> if ever a government minister got a bellyful he has had it tonight <e> <s> i shall try to be as brief as possible in order to give him a little more time to reply to all the points that have been raised <e>", "<cs> my lords i know the difficulties which face the minister over this question but delays are leading to a situation where farmers simply do not know what to do <e> <s> if these delays affect the crop it is going to be very difficult for any farmer to plan ahead we need something very soon <e>", "<cs> my lords i asked the minister a second question <e> <s> it was whether in the discussions consideration is being given to the question of the levy against farmers who take per cent <e> <s> of their land out of production <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we all wish the commemoration next year the best of luck <e> <s> however there are strong rumours that the prime minister wants to do away with the ministry of agriculture fisheries and food <e> <s> i hope that that will not be part of the commemoration <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say where this land is available <e> <s> is it around hospitals <e>", "<cs> my lords what is the difference between the deprivations that millions of people suffered to defeat nazism and african people doing the same to defeat apartheid <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all grateful to the noble baroness lady carnegy of lour for the very clear and concise way in which she put forward the bill and explained to us the various clauses which on the whole are fairly simple and straightforward <e> <s> they are to be welcomed <e> <s> like most of the other speakers i confess to the universal liking for scotch and as my noble kinsman said the family on both sides have a fair record of consumption in the past and the present generation are keeping up that heritage <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that answer <e> <s> i should like to ask him why he is so sure of his figures when since when the government set it the target has failed by per cent <e> <s> because of what in my opinion has been the governments ham-fisted handling of the tax relief aspect i believe that the situation will be worse this year <e> <s> does the minister not believe that the way to solve the problem is to let the forestry commission come back with its target of roughly half of private planting which would solve his problem immediately <e> <s> i am sure the minister is aware that the question is promoted by the focus articles in <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister made the point about present supplies <e> <s> however we are interested in future supplies <e> <s> it is because of the planting that was done in the past that the present supplies are sufficient or reasonably sufficient <e> <s> that is the point i should like to make <e> <s> is the minister sure <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister help with the technicalities of the matter <e> <s> the noble lords question states <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has emphasised how well the forestry commission and the committees which have been formed are dealing with the problem <e> <s> the noble earl lord stockton who is not present in the chamber and other woodland owners have said that despite forestry commission grants the clearing up expenses are very high and some help in that matter would encourage people to get on with the job <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister seemed to indicate that the cutting down and clearing of trees and restocking is all one operation <e> <s> that is true in a regular forestry operation <e> <s> however blown timber is much more expensive to clear than clear felling <e>", "<cs> my lords i should first like to suggest that this is not a party matter <e> <s> there may be some party cracks in another place <e> <s> in this house the noble viscount lord st davids raised several points and in a humourous way so did the noble lord lord burton <e> <s> i like to think that noble lords from all sides of the house can agree that something should be done about the control of firearms <e>", "<cs> my lords if the minister will allow me i was not criticising the consultations <e> <s> i have read the clause read the home secretarys speech and listened to the minister <e> <s> why has there been so much criticism that there was no consultation <e> <s> that was the point i was making <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble baroness will agree that this is not by any means an ambiguous question when one considers the supplementary questions that have been asked by those behind me <e> <s> is she aware that there has been a long delay <e> <s> there have been rumours and counter-rumours about the coming report <e> <s> that has created this situation <e> <s> farmers are worried because as the noble lord behind me said a few minutes ago farming is an industry consisting of about units <e> <s> to try to levy that separately for different items of research would be ridiculous <e> <s> i hope that the research committee will look into that very carefully before it reports <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the government have not had an appreciation of the possible situation <e> <s> is the minister aware that considerable discussions have been taking place particularly with landlords agents and general farmers <e> <s> in respect of farms up to acres it is almost worth taking the lot and taking a job <e> <s> up to acres it is a difficult proposition because on per cent <e> <s> one cannot reduce by one man or one tractor so one is stuck there <e> <s> that leaves the good land situation <e> <s> i doubt whether it is very attractive to those on the good land from where the surpluses are coming <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness explain to my noble friend sitting behind me that the bulk of the subsidies are not paid to farmers but for the restitution of prices and for storage <e> <s> they do not go into the pockets of the farmers <e>", "<cs> my lords have we given up all hope of teaching esperanto <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that rumour has it that the ministry of agriculture will only ante in <e> <s> that seems to be a very unenthusiastic amount for such a major programme about which the minister is so enthusiastic <e> <s> perhaps the british food and farming year celebration can be co-ordinated with the centenary of maff <e> <s> however if the rumour that maff will be abolished is correct perhaps that would not be suitable <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness has given very interesting and encouraging figures <e> <s> is she able to tell us what percentage of the total area of esas those figures represent <e> <s> if in a particular area per cent <e> <s> of the land is taken up what will the government do to ensure that uptake for the area is per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords why not develop stansted as an airport for the use of scottish flights and then improve the end of the m into the centre of london <e> <s> would that not solve a lot of the problems of the noble lord lord campbell <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may intervene briefly on this very difficult subject of the self-loading or pump-action rifle and shotgun mentioned by the noble earl lord balfour a moment ago <e> <s> there is no question that there is very strong feeling in clubs about this matter <e> <s> the whole question of disabled <e>", "<cs> if i may i correct the noble lord lord marsh <e> <s> they have not moved to self-loading rifles they have moved to automatic rifles which is a different matter altogether <e>", "<cs> i should like to make the point that such weapons would surely be in the imperial war museum and if anyone wanted to see them they would be able to view them there <e>", "<cs> it may be that the noble earl lord ferrers wishes me to reply to the debate myself <e> <s> i have never heard so many people in opposing something so effectively giving away their case <e> <s> they have referred to the guns being spread over keepers farmworkers and children <e> <s> that was the point i was making <e> <s> these guns are spread over so many people that it is impossible to keep track of them <e> <s> the only person who made a valid point was the noble viscount lord brookeborough when he said that if all the guns are numbered properly then they can be traced <e> <s> at present there are literally millions of guns in the country spread over all these people whom members of the committee have mentioned <e> <s> that is why it is necessary for the chief constable to have some control over people buying eight or guns <e>", "<cs> there are exceptions to the rule of course <e>", "<cs> i have held myself up to the strictures of members of the committee <e> <s> the amount of support i have received from behind me does not warrant that i do much more than beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> am i right in thinking with the noble lord lord swansea that all guns are not ejectors <e> <s> if one takes off the fore-end of an old dog-head gun one can fire it any way one likes if one is prepared to have ones fingers nipped <e>", "<cs> i said that we had lawyers drafting these amendments <e> <s> i am sure that the noble earl lord ferrers understands the spirit of them <e>", "<cs> one of the members of the committee said that the minister was very good at putting his case and wrapping the amenders case around it <e> <s> that is what he has done with my amendment <e> <s> he has had further consultations with the bma and top medical people <e> <s> if he is satisfied that the police can be sure about the references in the way that he suggested i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i think that the principle behind the amendment moved by the noble earl lord peel is a very good one as is the principle behind many of the amendments tabled under clause <e> <s> i come from an area in scotland where especially in the hills behind the farm where i was the shooting was good <e> <s> nearly the whole of the shooting was let to visitors from abroad <e> <s> that did a tremendous amount of good to the local villages <e>", "<cs> i listened carefully to what the noble earl lord peel said in moving the amendment <e> <s> i understand that he corrected the amendment at the public bill office but the correct version is not what appears on the marshalled list <e> <s> we are therefore discussing the incorrect version on the marshalled list <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the noble earl lord ferrers has appreciated the feeling that there is about clause <e> <s> i must declare an interest in that i let my shoot and as the noble earl lord peel pointed out it makes a big difference to the finances of the farm <e> <s> that is on a very small scale however <e>", "<cs> it does to a certain extent <e> <s> what arc the government going to do with all the rifles and guns <e> <s> arc they going to sell them for the market value and make a great deal more money <e>", "<cs> where <e>", "<cs> the minister may say that the matter is clear but the noble lords lord burton and torphichen did not make it all that clear <e> <s> despite that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> we should like to support this amendment <e> <s> it is very awkward if one has a guest who says that he would like to have a shot and one asks whether he has a gun licence and he says no <e> <s> it is on your land and you can see no harm in it <e> <s> however i must admit that i once had a guest whom i took out on a shoot and discovered he had never held a gun in his hands before <e> <s> i was glad when the lesson was over <e> <s> nevertheless i think that it is something that we could safely allow <e> <s> i hope that the noble earl will agree to the amendment with some of the reservations of some of his noble friends sitting behind him <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the fences are too low they are below the centre of gravity of most vehicles <e> <s> as the vehicles hit them they will topple over into the next carriageway <e> <s> therefore the fences should be higher <e> <s> the strength is not important but the height is <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure we all agree that it is absolutely necessary for this document to be produced because the public are a little afraid of the amount of spraying that goes on <e> <s> it is reassuring to them to know that there are now regulations of maximum residue levels which are harmless <e> <s> i never realised that pesticides were used of which are used on cereals and on the other crops listed in schedule <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the noble baroness has a difficult job tonight <e> <s> she began well and has been concise <e> <s> she emphasised that time was tight and i cannot agree more <e> <s> within the next two months farmers will be busy harvesting and their minds will not be too far ahead <e> <s> i hope that they will be able to find time to look at the question of registering before the end of september <e> <s> time is tight and sometimes it

<e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that in this era of tremendous change in the production consumption packaging and displaying of food this is not the time to upset research which is being carried out at present <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord campbell of alloway made a point which i have discussed with my noble friend <e> <s> if one reads the reports from police stations at the moment bucketfuls of old ammunition are being handed in that could fit some of the guns <e> <s> although i have every sympathy with somebody like the noble lord lord renton who has a weapon of that description that is of sentimental value i am not sure that the amendment which applies to section of the original act would solve the problem simply because not only can ammunition be manufactured but there is so much of it lying about as we have seen from the handing over of so much over the past year <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it the grouping is for amendments nos <e>

profit or margin is included in the price that the person paid for his rifle <e> <s> i do not see what on earth that has to do with vat on farming which the noble and learned lord mentioned <e> <s> he seemed to think that i was making some kind of comparison in that <e>", "<cs> my lords i can add little to the excellent presentation of the amendment by the noble earl <e> <s> as he said there have been other examples of codes <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords lord stanley of alderley and lord hooson and myself are the three non-members of the committee who are speaking tonight <e> <s> the three of us must congratulate the noble lord lord gallacher and his committee <e> <s> fifty per cent <e> <s> of the members of that committee have spoken here tonight on this report <e>

reports were less than pages long it would save an awful lot of time <e> <s> therefore i congratulate the committee not only on the content of the report but also on its terseness <e>", "<cs> my lords the problem with being the last speaker before the minister replies is that practically everything has been said <e> <s> my noble kinsman who often follows me always makes that complaint and says that i have said exactly what he was going to say <e> <s> that is slightly unfair <e> <s> but that is just the way of things <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i said the s <e> <s> i hope that someone will back me up against my noble kinsman i am sure i referred to the s <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for explaining this order <e> <s> as he said it is a simple measure but it required some explanation which he did very well <e> <s> i see no need to say anything other than that i cannot imagine anyone who has put down a golf course ploughing it up after five years <e> <s> apart from that

butter mountain was built up at the expense of a lack of milk for cheese-making <e> <s> has that situation now changed <e>", "<cs> my lords has the minister seen the picture of the sergeant and six children on the front page of the magazine <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble earl noted that one of the causes of the greenhouse effect is deforestation in some countries and the lack of afforestation in others including this country <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that one of the biggest faults in signing is having three names indicating the same direction but at the next sign when there are only two names one believes that one has gone the wrong way <e> <s> i have often seen drivers with a map on the steering wheel and that strikes me as being a dangerous operation

congratulate my noble friend lord gallacher on moving this motion and in particular on the way in which he put the government on the spot <e> <s> i hope that the noble baroness will be able to satisfy

committees remit was asking it to make cuts <e>", "<cs> my lords has the minister seen the report on research that the forestry commission has undertaken which indicates that a hectare of trees laps up tonnes of co <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the analogy of this problem of ripe time is with fruit <e> <s> if one waits too long it goes rotten <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a reasonably satisfactory answer <e> <s> i ask the noble lord whether it would not be better now having achieved a programme of rationalisation as well as the financial one to put the forestry commission on the basis of a phrase contained in the statement as regards the commercial effectiveness of the enterprise <e> <s> does the minister agree that it would be better to leave the forestry commission to spend the money that it raises particularly at this time when we are asking for public forests in urban areas <e> <s> would it not be much better to do that rather than to tie it down to a programme of raising so much that i believe it has found things a little hard in the past eight years <e>", "<cs> my lords in his original answer the noble lord said that there would be a review <e> <s> the period ends in days time <e> <s> will we hear the result before the end of days <e>", "<cs> my lords as agriculture has been blamed for the nitrates in water can the minister say whether any costings have been done to see if it would be cheaper to clean up the water or buy in foreign wheat <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure we are delighted with the noble baronesss reply or the gist of it anyway <e> <s> perhaps i may ask her what she meant by industry-funded <e> <s> does that relate to the whole agricultural industry or purely to the deer industry <e>", "<cs> my lords we are getting a little tired of this passing of the buck to the ugc <e> <s> was there any prompting by the government of the ugc to appoint the riley committee <e> <s> that is a little suspicious in my opinion <e>",

fishing areas <e>", "<cs> my lords presuming that every car was originally licensed is there any computerised system capable of discovering how many cars are not relicensed and how many are redundant

"<cs> my lords before i speak on the business in hand i should like one piece of research to be carried out <e> <s> that is why when this house empties on a cold day instead of the chamber being heated we have nothing but a cold air-conditioned draught coming up around our feet and legs making waiting to speak very uncomfortable <e> <s> i am sorry that there is no official present other than the noble baroness to take note of that complaint but i hope it will be raised in the proper quarters <e>", "<cs> my lords with reference to the concern for bird life the magpie is the biggest possible killer of bird life <e>", "<cs> my lords surely the government the ministry of agriculture and whoever is responsible must appreciate the long-term situation in forestry <e> <s> the cut was made over one year and approximately trees were burnt <e> <s> that is a result of not looking at the matter on a long-term basis <e> <s> i do not know whether the minister saw the television programme shown on monday night about the ozone layer <e> <s> the prince of wales made an appeal for more forestry in this country <e> <s> after all we have planted just under per cent <e> <s> and are the fourth lowest in the european community <e> <s> i believe that the target area of acres is ridiculous and that it should be almost doubled <e> <s> it would help if <e>", "<cs> my lords which research institute has been given the million <e> <s> is it bristol <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that the stealing of cattle sheep and pigs from farms is increasing immensely <e> <s> in my

they will help the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords as someone who will become part of next years statistics on this subject i take a great interest in pavements <e> <s> would the noble lord care to send one of his officials to the street that leads to finchley road tube station <e> <s> he will there see an appalling situation with many pedestrians and a pavement that is beyond belief <e>", "<cs> my lords nearly every car carries a service record and if the public demanded to see it before buying a secondhand ca r that would overcome many of the difficulties <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say whether it has been proved that centralisation is so good for research <e>", "<cs> my lords has centralisation of research been proved to be the best way <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that his noble friends question would have been much better asked before the budget <e> <s> if some assessment of what might happen had been made then we would not have had this cock-up which as the noble lord said is messing up million young trees <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the advice i received from the police after i had a burglary at my farm in essex was that it was a good idea to have sufficient light and a good barking dog on farm buildings and farm houses <e> <s> electricity is expensive and i hope that the government will take note of that advice when we deal later on with the first amendment to the electricity bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot add a lot to what the noble lord lord stanley of alderley has said on these amendments except to say as i pointed out in my earlier efforts at question time today that we in farming have to provide our own roads and our own street lighting or at least lighting for buildings and houses outside <e> <s> that is very expensive as was pointed out earlier <e> <s> any discrimination which would make that more expensive for farmers would be completely unfair <e> <s> i had experience of the early days in scotland when the scottish hydro-electric board came into being <e> <s> that board was going to charge a lot extra for laying electricity to remote farms <e> <s> if i remember rightly it had to change its policy and try to spread the price <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask the minister two questions based on his right honourable friends statement in another place in the middle of june in which he stated that rationalisation has been a success over the past years <e> <s> how long does it take to rationalise <e> <s> i understand that most of the management rationalisation has been done <e>", "<cs> my lords there is one further point <e> <s> what does the minister mean by forest land <e> <s> is that land that has been planted or land that is plantable <e>", "<cs> my lords what is the position in agriculture if a helicopter pilot makes a mistake while spraying and sprays a neighbours field <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that acidification mentioned by the noble lord lord moran does not come from the trees <e> <s> it is collected by the trees from the outlets of some fossil fuels for example factories and coalmines <e> <s> is <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that in order to buy a new farm implement today one is forced to borrow money and that it is high interest rates that are creating the situation referred to by my noble friend lord carter <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise for entering the debate without having put my name on the list of speakers <e> <s> i am what might be called a hybrid <e> <s> i am very much a scotsman but i am an english peer <e> <s> i thought that i should leave the harvest field today and come to this debate <e> <s> i have only one point to make and i shall come to it in a moment <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell us why they are called acid parties <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister ensure that new regulations will not affect innocent barn dances that are held all over the country <e> <s> we had a barn dance a week ago and someone telephoned the police to say that an acid house party was taking place <e> <s> it was an innocent barn dance and as we knew the local policeman well everything was all right <e> <s> it would be a pity if new regulations had such an effect <e>", "<cs> my lords i spent a couple of weeks in poland nearly years ago looking at agriculture in that country and i was impressed with it <e> <s> before we give aid now should we not investigate why production has dropped so badly as to require aid <e>", "<cs> my lords is the environmental lobby against spraying to kill the fly <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords i think that the noble lord lord middleton is to be congratulated on his report <e> <s> of course he did not do it all himself <e> <s> his committee helped a bit as did the officials <e> <s> the report is reasonably short compared to some of the reports we get <e> <s> however it might have been better to have a glossary of pronunciation to deal with -letter words which appear here and there and to which my dictionary did not rise although they were explained in a later paragraph <e> <s> the report gives a tremendous amount of information which should be useful in countering the recommendations which have been made and i hope that it will be used by the government in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister is speaking of weeks and months <e> <s> my head taxi driver <e>", "<cs> my lords is there any connection between ambulances and hospitals so as to prevent people being taken to a hospital which is too busy to

few minutes but there are a number of points i should like to make <e> <s> unfortunately or fortunately the right reverend prelate made a point which i feel i must take up <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that satisfactory answer <e> <s> however is he aware of the background to the question <e> <s> it was at a meeting at the kirk door of a small church near where i lived in scotland

shooting up the lorries which are delivering that wheat to the areas where the starving people are <e>", "<cs> my lords aberdeen has an all-seats stadium <e> <s> my friends and family who attend that stadium say that it has made a tremendous difference <e> <s> the time that the government are giving football clubs to provide all-seats stadia is too long <e> <s> the minister should pay attention to what the noble lord lord dean said about the government helping through taxation <e> <s> the minister said that it is a leisure issue and should receive no help <e> <s> however other leisure areas such as tourism receive help <e> <s> the government should not shut their eyes to that aspect <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord care to take a walk along the corridors of this house and take a look at all the empty rooms with lights blazing <e>", "<cs> my lords the words competition competitive and so on are mentioned several times in the statement <e> <s> i have a mile of line to my farm supplied by the present electricity board <e> <s> i presume that it will be taken over <e> <s> that will be the line from which i obtain my supply <e> <s> if i quarrel with the company does the noble viscount suggest that there is someone competitive enough to build another mile of line to supply me with electricity <e> <s> people in many outlying areas are worred about the competition <e> <s> can

be the fairest way and it would not put all the responsibility on the coal board <e>", "<cs> i am sure that everybody agrees with the noble viscount that the polluter should pay <e> <s> i am asking for some mandatory system of collecting money from the people who might pollute and for that money to go into research if the minister is not going to give my noble friend million out of government funds for such research <e> <s> the money has to come from somewhere and the research has to be adequate <e> <s> the minister mentioned one piece of research but i was hoping that there was a lot more

of veterinary services would be a major mistake in view of such difficulties <e>", "<cs> my lords many of the arguments which have been put forward today particularly by the noble lord lord jenkin of roding have been based on estimates <e> <s> i propose to put forward the actual figures as they affect the people who live on the farm which i occupy in essex <e> <s> there are seven houses on the farm <e> <s> three of them are let that is because of the increased efficiency in agriculture over the past years or so since i built the houses and because of the reduction in production <e> <s> if my noble friend lord stallard has his way the other three will also have to be let in a few years time <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that because of the depression in agriculture and the effects of cutting back there are a great number of empty buildings <e> <s> i must declare an <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister know whether any cases have been reported from an organic farm
