["<cs> my lords i am sure that other noble lords will recall with mixed feelings of anxiety and pride the occasion on which they made their maiden speeches and that they will make due allowances <e> <s> i should like to thank many noble lords for their warm welcome and also to say how well served we are by the staff of the house who go out of their way to be helpful <e>", "<cs> my lords noble lords will i hope forgive me for rising to my feet so quickly after my maiden speech and i must declare my special interest in being chairman of the development commission englands rural development agency the parent body of cosira <e> <s> it is not of course in that capacity that i speak but as someone who shares with the noble lord lord john-mackie a deep concern for those who live in the countryside and a desire to do something about it <e> <s> i am only sorry that an inescapable long-standing engagement may prevent me from attending the whole debate but at the rate we are proceeding i may be all right <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall try to be brief <e> <s> first perhaps i may declare an interest in that for most of my life i have been a member of the cpre <e> <s> i am also a member of the national parks authority for northumberland <e> <s> thus you could say that one side of me has fairly green antecedents <e> <s> one the other hand i must declare my interest as chairman of the development commission englands rural development agency <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that we were led to believe earlier today that that advice might have been erroneous <e> <s> your lordships will forgive me if i misunderstood the noble and learned lord lord denning but i thought that he indicated that it was surprising that that particular joint committee had appeared to exceed the precise point which they were asked to look into which was the question of the transfer of common land <e>", "<cs> my lords we are indeed grateful to the noble lord lord gallacher for introducing this motion because the structure of industry affects the lives of every one of us <e> <s> i have a particular interest in that for a number of years i have been both chairman and president of the industrial participation association a body which for the past years has been striving to create a sense of common purpose at work <e> <s> i am deeply perturbed by the current wave of merger mania because i think it does nothing in the long run for industrial relations and precious little for industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i hardly like to say it but i too must apologise in advance because an inescapable appointment means that i may have to leave before the end of the debate <e> <s> but at the rate we are going all may be well <e> <s> the government are indeed to be congratulated on their clever use of interest rates to bring about exchange rate stability during this unprecedented period of falling oil prices and they have kept interest rates up for good reason <e> <s> for the past two years we have been told by the foreign currency dealers that sterling would remain extremely volatile until oil prices had fallen or stabilised <e> <s> to a <e>", "<cs> my lords in welcoming this bill at this late hour i should like to concentrate primarily on the cost of retirement provision pensions and where the money comes from <e> <s> i am sure that in this house we would all wish to see that those in retirement have the highest possible standard of living relative to the economic fortunes of the country <e> <s> but outside this house much of the debate is conducted by company pension fund managers and of course they are primarily concerned with the sector whose members are fortunate enough to have three pensions basic state old age pension the contracted-out state earnings-related pension and on top of that a company pension <e>", "<cs> every one of us in this chamber has a vested interest in retirement and i must declare my personal interest in it <e> <s> but it seems to me that we are making too excessive an issue of this <e> <s> we have now nearly million people self-employed who have personal pensions of a sort currently on the market <e> <s> i am not aware that noble lords opposite have highlighted any great scandal in the administration or the marketing of such schemes so we are not talking about anything new we are merely talking about broadening the market <e> <s> we all have concern to see that people are not exploited or cowboyed but i do not think that is happening at the moment and the more pension providers there are the less likelihood there is that this will happen because of the greater interest in competition <e> <s> so i think that this is a non-worry <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may be permitted in support of the government to make a further point <e> <s> we seem to visualise that the pension market and pension provision will remain much as it is now but once personal portable pensions are more freely available on the market one can visualise many pension departments and pension managers adopting a very benign and helpful attitude to their employees <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may reply to that <e> <s> their advice will be free because it will be part of the service that they offer to their employees <e> <s> as they will be able to recommend the cheapest and the lowest commission for personal pension schemes those schemes will flourish and the worst schemes will be highlighted no doubt there will be a league table so that the market will sensibly and properly work and protect those who invest in this way just as it protects the self-employed currently <e>", "<cs> much heat has been generated in the pensions industry over the per cent <e> <s> inducement <e> <s> i hope that the amendment suggested by the government will reduce that heat and will be regarded when it is fully worked out as a satisfactory compromise by which the government still stick to their principle of encouraging people to go into personal portable pensions but recognise the understandable worries that pension fund managers have about the withdrawal of some of their membership <e>", "<cs> the question of compulsion really stands at the heart of alternative pension provision <e> <s> we need to look forward to the labour market conditions that are rapidly developing in this country where we are seeing a contraction of the sort of cradle to the grave jobs that we had in the past and an inevitable increase in part-time employment or multiple employment <e> <s> the existing pension arrangements that have been built up over the years and very often for the best possible reasons will simply not be satisfactory and are even now unsatisfactory for a great many people of the wider national workforce <e>", "<cs> we seem to have strayed on to amendment no <e> <s> and i was rather looking forward to the opportunity of agreeing very much with the noble lord lord banks and the noble viscount lord hanworth <e> <s> there is much merit in amendment no <e> <s> which i believe should be supported <e> <s> as we have reached discussion on amendment no <e> <s> already i take this opportunity of saying that i wholly agree with it <e>", "<cs> i am sure that we are all grateful to the noble lord lord swann for drawing this matter to the attention of the committee but i should like to put the case the other way round <e> <s> we do not necessarily want the existing occupational scheme to stress all the negatives to anyone who wishes to move to a personal and portable pension scheme <e> <s> the fact is that an employee who has relatively recently joined an occupational scheme would probably obtain life cover because that is very cheaply bought and most occupational schemes throw it in as an addition but it is very unlikely that his widow would get anything more than a pension that was <e>", "<cs> all of us would like to see an increase in the basic state old-age pension <e> <s> indeed i believe i share with the noble lord lord banks the belief that were we starting from scratch we would abolish serps and increase the basic state old-age pension which would be far more equitable as it would treat all our citizens alike whatever the work or employment pattern of their careers <e> <s> but the fact remains that it is inescapable that we are sharing the rice in the rice bowl and the greater one increases retirement provision the greater one raises regressive taxation <e> <s> it is inescapable that the higher the pensions paid the more difficult becomes the problem of the poverty trap <e> <s> there is no such thing as a free pension it has to be paid for by the working <e> <s> what we are talking about in simple terms is how we divide the rice bowl between rewarding the working and rewarding the retired <e> <s> this is the dilemma that lies at the basis of all our discussions tonight <e>", "<cs> i hope the noble lord lord banks will forgive me for coming back again <e> <s> he said that we this generation will be paying for the pension <e> <s> of course he is absolutely right <e> <s> but the point that i think he should dwell on is that it is not the better off in society who will be paying for it it is actually the very low earners in society those who are the victims of the poverty trap <e> <s> the higher the pension you pay the more rice you dish out to those in retirement the less rice there is to pay for those who are actually earning <e>", "<cs> i feel somewhat handicapped in replying to the noble lord lord ennals and the noble baroness lady turner of camden because we share <e>", "<cs> of course <e>", "<cs> i was speaking about the state earnings-related benefit <e> <s> if one does not happen to earn then one does not get the benefit <e> <s> there is a whole raft of our citizens particularly women who do <e>", "<cs> we have heard a number of speeches here tonight and earlier on in the evening i have said how much i agree with the ultimate goals of the noble lord lord ennals but really his speech just now was a triumph of hope over actuality <e> <s> things will not necessarily work out that way <e> <s> as he rightly says the only way that higher pensions can be ensured in the future is by having a more prosperous economy <e> <s> indeed he recognises that the government have raised pensions substantially faster than he might have anticipated years ago which i think shows that the government have great confidence in their future policies <e>", "<cs> i am sure that on all sides of the committee we share a deep concern to try to improve the job prospects of young people <e> <s> that must be completely common ground <e> <s> i wonder whether it would be helpful if i gave an example of the adverse working of the law as it stands at the moment and how in many instances it prices young people out of work <e>", "<cs> something did happen <e> <s> in that instance that young person lost her job <e> <s> she was extremely happy in her job <e> <s> in relative terms because she had a free meal and free transport she was probably doing rather better than she would have done had she been on the statutory minimum and not had free transport and a free meal <e> <s> jobs are relative to one another <e> <s> i know that we do not have to argue that among ourselves <e> <s> severe damage was done <e> <s> in that instance the girl was happier to have a job at marginally less than the statutory rate than not to have a job <e> <s> the problem with leaving matters as they are is that we shall cause great damage to the economy <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may return to this subject and in particular the question of young peoples wages differentials <e> <s> the noble lord lord mccarthy has rightly said that these differentials are beginning to open out again <e> <s> historically it might be valuable to go back to the point where we on this side of the committee believe that most of these problems began <e> <s> when the age of majority was lowered from to that effectively meant that somebody leaving school at had two years as a junior before he or she began to pick up an adult wage <e> <s> the trade unions as one can understand perfectly well were always anxious to get rises at the bottom as it pushed up the rates for everyone else at the same time <e> <s> when young people were adult at and in those days very often they left school at there were then six years between starting work and reaching adulthood and an adult wage <e> <s> this gave six years in which people gradually learnt and improved their skills <e> <s> by the time they reached their earning power was the equivalent of an adult at <e> <s> therefore they were absorbed into the labour market so much more easily <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a great privilege to follow so many learned contributions to todays debate on her most gracious majestys speech and it is through such debates that economic policy develops <e> <s> i think it was the famous german general von molke who made the remark that no battle plan survives contact with the enemy <e> <s> it is probably equally true to say that no economic policy survives without adaptation and that whatever the undoubted success of the governments policies and undoubted success they have had in reducing inflation i am sure that they would be the first to admit that there is always room for improvement <e> <s> my desire is to make good policies better <e>", "<cs> my lords we should indeed be grateful to the noble lord lord dean of beswick for raising this timely debate <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a happy coincidence that i should follow the noble lord lord murray as we came to this house more or less simultaneously <e> <s> i welcome the general provisions of this bill not least because it will help to overcome some of the remaining labour market rigidities that are preventing the creation of jobs <e> <s> that is something which i am sure we all want to see <e> <s> the bill also enhances personal freedom and philosophically i believe that that is always desirable <e>", "<cs> oh no no <e>", "<cs> may i interrupt <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down perhaps he would clarify one point <e> <s> i understood that the full name of the nazi party was the national socialist party <e> <s> was that not the case <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we are all grateful that the order gives us the opportunity to discuss this matter which was last considered some to years ago because there have been major economic and social changes in that period which i believe strongly reinforce the case for an extension of the existing period of summer time <e>", "<cs> my lords i think polonius was advising his son when he said <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister agree that over the years the design council has played a very important part in trade promotion <e> <s> if that part of the councils activities is to cease it will leave london as the only major capital city in the world without a permanent standing exhibition of the best of its products <e> <s> can the minister assure us that his department will look favourably upon and encourage alternative arrangements to promote british exports in such ways <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may join with other noble lords in welcoming this amendment <e> <s> i do so as chairman of the industrial participation association which is a body that has been promoting wider ownership for over a hundred years <e> <s> it seems to me that the amendment is eminently sensible and very much in line with the governments whole philosophy of widening share ownership and diffusing economic power <e> <s> i therefore hope that the minister will give it very serious consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may support the previous two speakers <e> <s> one is concerned about the attempts to raise the purity and general standard of water and about the introduction of controls <e> <s> but while the noble lord lord mcintosh suggested to <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment because i believe it is the only practical solution to provide an adequate provision of low-cost housing in rural areas <e> <s> i should like to declare an interest as the chairman of the governments rural development commission <e> <s> i have been in that position now for nine years <e> <s> our task is to encourage jobs and to promote the welfare of communities throughout rural england <e>", "<cs> my lords i broadly support the purpose of this amendment <e> <s> with other noble lords i remain deeply unhappy about the right to full staircasing <e> <s> i personally should like to see it limited to a lower level <e> <s> without that i fear that despite the assurances of the cla many owners will be unwilling to release land for low cost housing and local authorities will be unwilling to grant exceptional planning consents <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the significant support that this amendment has received from all sides of the house <e> <s> in the general hubbub <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am grateful to the noble lord lord boardman for this timely debate and am privileged to follow the wisdom of the noble lord lord benson <e> <s> i must be one of the few members of your lordships house who describes himself on his passport as an inventor a description of which i am still proud although i have to admit that the justification for that happened some years ago <e> <s> as a former inventor i hope that your lordships will forgive me if my speech moves the debate from the general which has been so well covered by other noble lords to the specific <e> <s> i should like to advance two ideas which i hope might strengthen this countrys wealth creating base and reinforce the success of the governments policies to date <e>", "<cs> the government having willed the end by suggesting per cent <e> <s> should try to help industry provide the means <e> <s> one form of inflation pro of ing would be for them to issue more tranches of index-linked gilt stock which would effectively allow the private sector to have the same base and security of funding as the public sector now has <e>", "<cs> i share the noble baronesss desire to see those in retirement receive the maximum <e>", "<cs> although i welcome the move along the right road down which the clause takes us it may be overtaken to some degree by an ec derogation <e> <s> however in this instance i would go much further than the other side of the committee <e> <s> the government should state unequivocally that the money in pension funds belongs to those in receipt of pension those with a deferred pension and those likely to receive a pension the present contributors <e> <s> although this is a major step forward we are all appalled at the way in which so many pension funds are gratuitously used as a slush fund for senior directors to prepare for their retirement <e> <s> that behaviour is reprehensible <e> <s> i should have liked a clearer and a more positive statement that the money in pension funds belongs to the pensioners and no one else <e> <s> however i welcome the measure as a first step and give full marks to the government <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may deal with some of the points raised <e> <s> the minister has slightly overtaken my second amendment by giving his reply before i had made the point <e> <s> perhaps i may catch up <e>", "<cs> briefly i support these amendments <e> <s> they are eminently sensible and i hope that the government will take them on board <e>", "<cs> it gives me great pleasure to support the noble baroness <e> <s> i see exactly eye to eye with her on it <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment in general terms of moving towards an equal retirement age for men and women <e> <s> however i should like to grasp the most stinging of nettles and say that in practice we should be considering the raising of the retirement age to or more for every one <e> <s> the economically active people of this country carry the cost of the economically inactive <e> <s> thanks to the advance of medical science that burden is ever increasing <e> <s> every projection shows that over the next or years working people will have to carry the cost of a larger percentage of non-working people that is the retired <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness does not need reminding that more people are working in this country than ever before <e> <s> when considering changing the retiring dates for the future we must remember that there is only so much rice for the rice bowl and only so many people to cultivate it <e> <s> we must encourage people to work <e> <s> the decade of retirement is an excellent idea <e> <s> the problem should not he approached with the aim of diminishing the number of economically active the emphasis should be on increasing them <e> <s> the more people who work the more money they generate and the more they raise the base from which dependants can be looked after <e> <s> there is more rice for the rice bowl <e>", "<cs> my lords no one could argue with the general thrust of the argument <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise <e>", "<cs> my lords one cannot but help support the general principles behind the amendment but will my noble friend the minister bear in mind that any attempt automatically to increase or to index pensions in payment unless there is a fairy godmother who can provide the money at some point would be putting an unquantified obligation on company balance sheets or the provider of any money purchase scheme be it aggregated or disaggregated <e> <s> there is only one way to meet that dilemma that is to make available to the private sector the same levels of indexation as are available to pensions given to those in the public sector <e> <s> that calls for a continuous issue of generous tranches of index linked gilt-edged bonds <e> <s> with that aggregated money purchase schemes which are company schemes or straight money personal purchase schemes can knowingly and positively meet their future obligations <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will have that thought in the back of his mind when he makes his reply <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the fact that some deaths or very serious accidents would be prevented by adopting continuous british summer time which is perhaps a better way of putting it and as the government have now taken us into the erm might this not be the right moment to adopt european central time <e>"]
