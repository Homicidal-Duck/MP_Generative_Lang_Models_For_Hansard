["<cs> my lords i am deeply conscious of the fact that i have the privilege perhaps awesome privilege of addressing this distinguished house for the very first time <e> <s> the bill we are considering today has perhaps a more massive capacity to foment powerful passions in delicate areas of british life than perhaps almost any other legislation that parliament could initiate <e> <s> this is understandable in that the bill is concerned with that intimate and fundamental link between the state on the one hand and the governed on the other <e>", "<cs> i rise very briefly to support the amendment of the noble lord lord hunt <e> <s> in my <e>", "<cs> may i respectfully suggest that there are two fundamental defects <e> <s> i refer not merely to the subject matter of this amendment i trust that i shall be allowed to deal with the whole issue in a slightly wider way <e> <s> one of those fundamental defects is the employment test <e> <s> it is narrow and rigid and as i know the minister will agree in many cases it will be irrelevant to the situation in hand <e> <s> the other fundamental defect is the test of a close connection which is the wording of paragraphs <e>", "<cs> i wish to express my thanks to the noble lord for the computer-like speed and accuracy with which he replied to my question about the words close connection <e> <s> i should have known better <e> <s> one should have remembered i suppose the words of that greatest of all legal historians f w maitland who speaking of the parliamentary draftsman of the middle ages said there was no plethora of words in the middle ages and the draftsman had to use the scanty currency that was available <e> <s> apparently the draftsman of is no different from <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise very briefly to support the remarks of my noble friend lord boston in this matter <e> <s> there is of course ample justification for the order and as my noble friend has said there have been periodic reviews of these limits <e> <s> i believe that the parent act as it were of county courts in their present form was in and the jurisdiction then was <e> <s> in it was for tort and contract jurisdiction and for equity jurisdiction <e> <s> some very bright statistician has calculated that taking into account changes in the value of money since the halcyon days of it would give us as a common law jurisdiction and for equity jurisdiction <e> <s> so the decision of the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor here is well within those limits <e>", "<cs> the issue before the committee as i understand it is not the question of what has or has not been said in any green paper or what has or has not been enshrined in nationality legislation from onwards or what has or has not been done by home secretaries from both sides of politics <e> <s> as i understand it and i speak with great reservations as a very junior member of your lordships house the issue is what principle should be attached in relation to a most important issue in a most important bill the issue whether a secretary of state for home affairs from now onwards if this bill becomes law should or should not adopt a more liberal stance and attitude towards naturalisation issues and the method by which they are to be determined <e>", "<cs> my lords on the wider question of criminal procedure generally would the noble lord the minister give us an undertaking on behalf of the government that no consideration of short-term expediency or suchlike would make the government erode in any way the right for serious offences on the part of a defendant to trial by jury it being a principle which is so utterly central to the concept of human liberty <e>", "<cs> i suspect that the true motivation for this new clause was to stimulate thought and to inspire consideration of some of the deeper elements involved in this legislation and the longer effects thereof <e> <s> if the noble lords lord rawlinson and lord renton were narrow-minded lawyers which they are not and wished to indulge in sterile and arid considerations of the technicality of legislation which they do not wish to do then no doubt they would have a field day in attacking many of the words and phrases involved in this draft clause <e>", "<cs> we have some precocious children in our country but they are not that precocious <e> <s> i will say in a moment what i do support <e> <s> the sum total of the rights and privileges of the british people is to be found i accept in dozens and scores of different enactments and in common law <e> <s> it may indeed be premature short of having a comprehensive bill of rights to include such a statement of rights in a provision such as this <e> <s> nevertheless i believe it is right that your lordships committee should consider deeply the issue of principle which has been raised by my noble and learned friend <e> <s> if a visitor from mars were to look at this british nationality bill he would say to himself assuming that he were male <e>", "<cs> he would say what is the purpose of it <e> <s> is it a democratic exercise <e> <s> what is the point of spewing out three categories of british nationality of dividing british nationality into three parts like ceasars gaul <e> <s> what is the purpose of it <e> <s> i have a suspicion which i hope i expressed in suitably restrained terms in my maiden speech on second reading that this is merely the groundwork and foundation for more restrictive immigration legislation <e> <s> if that is the purpose then that is not as yet enshrined in this legislation <e> <s> but the legislation standing as it does alone seems very incomplete <e>", "<cs> my lords the arguments that have been articulated on behalf of the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches welcome this amendment and accept it as something which extends the liberalising provisions of the bill <e> <s> the noble and learned lord advocate said in the debate at committee stage on th july that it was the view of her majestys government that british citizenship would carry with it a right of abode and should reflect a real tie with this country a tie substantial enough to justify the unrestricted right to enter this country freely <e> <s> since the european parliament and to a large extent the european institutions constitute a position of overlordship in relation to the british parliament no doubt that tie is established in relation to those bodies <e> <s> however may i enter one <e>", "<cs> my lords in the circumstances i certainly would not invite the house to divide upon this matter <e> <s> i am sure the house does appreciate <e>", "<cs> my lords since i had the unexpected pleasure of moving the amendment understand that i now have the right to reply which i shall do very shortly <e> <s> the argument for the amendment has i think been put by the noble lord the minister at the very end of his speech <e> <s> it appears that her majestys government in relation to the independence of both antigua and indeed belize have come to the conclusion that the old order has to change <e> <s> under the old order that had been accepted by governments of various hues whenever a colony became independent the citizens of that colony lost their british citizenship unless they registered <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord avebury it seems to me has given voice to a worthy case a case which is founded in reason in principle and in consistency <e> <s> it is a case that to a large extent was endorsed by the decision of the then home secretary in february in this context to place the two sexes on a par of total equality <e> <s> therefore i urge the minister to consider that this is a very proper case to exercise that understanding and chivalry which has characterised our deliberations in this bill so far <e> <s> there are no dangers for the safety net of ministerial discretion is present to deal with any inappropriate case <e> <s> i have been greatly impressed by the remarks of the noble lord and heartily endorse them <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches welcome the governments amendment no <e> <s> and consider that though limited in scope it undoubtedly has a very proper liberalising effect upon clause <e> <s> it is surely right in principle that a person who has renounced british nationality in favour of a state that is outside the commonwealth should be treated on exactly the same basis as a person who has renounced british nationality in favour of a country within the commonwealth <e> <s> i do not think that it would be realistic or proper to seek to draw any distinction between those two classes <e>", "<cs> my lords while i agree with the noble lord lord renton that there is absolutely <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> i appreciate that these are not matters which can be dealt with within the space of a few minutes <e> <s> my noble and learned friend lord elwyn-jones and i have put down an amendment to clause <e> <s> that will be dealing with rather wider eec issues <e> <s> it may well be that the noble lord lord belstead might then like to avail himself of the opportunity of dealing with those matters which i apprehend will not be reached today <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord renton as usual has deployed his arguments with great skill and great charm <e> <s> however one thing we can be sure of is that his amendment if it were carried in no way could improve the bill <e> <s> the same anguish that will be created in the hearts of hundreds of thousands of people would remain the same doubts the same fears and the same suspicions <e> <s> nor indeed would the bill be any less complicated <e> <s> i am sure that this bill if it does become law will be regarded as one of the most complicated pieces of legislation that parliament has managed to spawn in the last decade <e> <s> it may well be that when the lord advocate years on with the weight of years heavy upon him looks back upon this bill he will remind himself of what lord melbourne is supposed to have said of the great issue over schleswig-holstein in the middle of the last century <e> <s> he is reputed to have said that only three people were able to understand that complicated issue so complex was it <e> <s> one he said is dead the other is mad the third is myself and i have forgotten all about it <e>", "<cs> on reflection my lords i think that very probably it was lord palmerston and if anything that even adds to the tale and to the validity of the point that i was seeking to make <e> <s> chronologically speaking it would of course have been proper to deal with the provisions of clause previous to the provisions of clause <e> <s> but for once i am totally with her majestys government in this matter because clause deals with a fundamental change in our law by changing the historic foundation of <e>", "<cs> my lords as the house already appreciates we on these benches support the amendment moved by the noble baroness lady elles <e> <s> it seems to us that it provides a means by which people born outside the united kingdom and registered as citizens by descent may upgrade their citizenship to one with the same rights as if they were british citizens otherwise than by descent <e> <s> british citizens by descent are of course dealt with fully in clause <e> <s> children <e>", "<cs> my lords whether this amendment is or is not carried the situation undoubtedly will remain that all passports issued in respect of the persons dealt with under part i part ii and part iii of this bill will be british passports <e> <s> they will carry the imprint of the royal arms they will be issued in <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord lord belstead for the very full way in which he has answered the questions which i posed to him and for the characteristic courtesy with which he dealt with my requests <e> <s> concerning his contention that article deals basically with the movement o <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful for the assurance and in the light of that assurance i of course beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to express very briefly the support of those of us on these benches for the efforts which have been made by the noble viscount lord colville of culross in moving this probing amendment <e> <s> it is vitally necessary where it is an entitlement case and the subject wishes to challenge the decision of authority that the subject should be reasonably placed to get his case off the ground <e> <s> the lingering fear that some of us have is that in cases where the secretary of state has come to a firm decision but has given no reason whatsoever beyond the publication of the bold decision there will still be difficulties <e> <s> if the minister can remove those fears from our minds then we would indeed be extremely happy <e>", "<cs> my lords i would respectfully suggest that the issue is not whether the amendment is absolutely watertight but whether the amendment is an improvement upon the phraseology adopted up to now by the government <e> <s> in my submission the situation is still highly unsatisfactory <e> <s> a loose and indeterminate wording inevitably makes bad law and i have no doubt will create a great deal of difficulty <e> <s> the provision is not in conflict nor can it be with clause since that clause is intended to be all-embracing and therefore must by definition be governed by and subject to it <e>", "<cs> the amendment will not be pressed my lords <e> <s> we are disappointed though not perhaps totally surprised <e> <s> we are however sorry to see that the fluid and able mind of the minister is now settling and cooling in the rigid mould of the <e>", "<cs> my lords surely that cannot be entirely correct <e> <s> it has an application in relation to two or three other acts which are referred to in the schedules to the bill and to which my noble and learned friend lord elwyn-jones referred in the course of the debate earlier this afternoon <e> <s> so now that we know that this wording applies to at least three acts of parliament i think the question that ministers should apply their collective mind to is whether or not it would not have been appropriate after all to have <e>", "<cs> my lords the logic of the arguments of the noble lord lord tanlaw in my submission are utterly irrefutable and his arguments flawless <e> <s> i too have the utmost sympathy with the motivation behind this amendment <e> <s> the house may remember that when i had the privilege of addressing your lordships for the first time during the second reading debate on this bill i made the exact point <e> <s> there is a world of difference between nationality and citizenship <e> <s> nationality is basically a concept of sociology and ethnography <e> <s> citizenship is a legal concept <e> <s> it is very unfortunate i think that they should be regarded as interchangeable <e> <s> in terms of nationality i regard myself as welsh <e> <s> i am sure that my noble and learned friend lord elwyn-jones would say the same as would my noble friend lord cledwyn and many others in this house <e> <s> but in terms of citizenship we are british and although one can say that certainly this confusion has existed in statute for a very long time certainly since it is none the better for that and the mischief that such confusion can create is now greater than at any other time <e>", "<cs> my lords my first task indeed a pleasant task it is is to join with all those who have extended their sincerest congratulations to the minister the noble lord lord elton on the distinction with which he introduced his first bill <e> <s> it is his legislative baptism <e> <s> baptism in adult age is a time undoubtedly for conversion <e> <s> we shall look forward with very great zeal to many conversions on his account at a later stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords the point made by the noble lord is a fair one <e> <s> it is however qualified to some extent by the fact that there is already provision in the bill to deal with situations where the patients life is in danger <e> <s> there are many situations covered in the bill i will not seek to quote them now at this late hour where it is obvious that the commission to do the work that the bill requires it to do will have to act within a fairly confined space of time two three or four days at the most <e> <s> it is a point but with the greatest respect i do not believe that it is a point that undermines the basic principle that concerns noble lords in every part of the house <e> <s> it may well be that the body that should exercise that multi-disciplinary decision should not be a body such as the commission itself <e> <s> i know not i am very prepared to be swayed by argument <e>", "<cs> my lords we join the noble lord lord belstead in welcoming the opportunity to debate the content of the report of the noble and learned lord lord scarman as well as the massive issues which stem therefrom <e> <s> we wholeheartedly endorse what the noble lord has said and what indeed has been said by so many the length and breadth of britain by way of tribute to the skill and wisdom of the noble and learned lord lord scarman <e> <s> for the way in which he has discharged his massive task the conscientious incisiveness with which he has analysed the facts and the clarity with which he has presented the issues this report must be regarded as a model of its kind <e>", "<cs> my lords that is indeed so the moment i said it i appreciated that i had slipped <e> <s> the principle remains the same <e> <s> does the ordinary citizen conceive of a body upon which there is a substantial one-third representation of magistrates as being possessed of that independence that is utterly necessary if accountability is to mean anything at all in practice <e>", "<cs> my lords that is one of the problems that has brought about the situation that we are debating today <e> <s> i am sure the noble lord would <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always a pleasure to listen to a speech by the noble lord lord renton and indeed a personal pleasure to be able to allow him to precede me in this debate <e> <s> it is also a temptation to follow him in some of his remarks relating to the act of union of scotland and england if it were only for the stimulus that that instrument gives to think about two other acts of union one of which is a topic upon which i have thought a very great deal and in which i am deeply interested <e> <s> that was an act of uniformity <e> <s> i think that we should leave that matter for the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords the house is deeply indebted to the noble lord lord renton for the opportunity of considering matters of great public concern and of current interest <e> <s> i am sure that the house also is most appreciative of the balance and restraint with which the noble lord has presented his argument <e> <s> there are few here who would not accept the fundamental precepts of the noble lord lord renton <e> <s> no sensible society can view rising levels of crime as other than a matter of the gravest concern <e> <s> no responsible legislature should ever cease to be vigilant in relation to these issues <e> <s> every enlightened community would wish to add to the efficiency of its police forces <e> <s> crime figures however as we all know tend to conceal rather more than they reveal <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> in fact i thought that i paid the highest possible tribute to the police <e> <s> i accept that we have police officers of probably the highest quality in the world <e> <s> taking a whole decade the respect of the british public for the police is higher than that found anywhere else in the world <e> <s> i am most grateful for the opportunity to make that absolutely clear <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish the house to misconceive what i said on that matter <e> <s> i was totally supporting the sentencing policies of her majestys judges but making the point although having taken up so much time with the rest of my speech perhaps i did not deploy it as best i might that sentences should never be longer than are necessary to carry out their objective <e> <s> when a person is a first offender if a sentence of six months can achieve everything there is no purpose in keeping that person in prison for a further six months <e> <s> that is all i was saying nothing beyond that <e>", "<cs> my lords does that mean that the government still have an open mind on one of the most important of the scarman recommendations namely that the period of police training should be six months as opposed to the present weeks in the metropolitan police district and weeks in the provincial forces <e>", "<cs> may i as one of the persons who raised this matter at second reading say how deeply grateful i am to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for the care and the humanity with which he has in accordance with the undertaking given at second reading reflected upon this matter <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord rawlinson asks the rhetorical question why should there be a case for compensation <e> <s> i think it is clear from the contributions of noble lords and noble baronesses who have spoken in support of this proposition that the overwhelming case is because the spouse concerned is at the very centre of the disaster area that has been created in that family unit by the death <e>", "<cs> the amendment as drafted by my noble friend lord mishcon and my noble and learned friend lord elwyn-jones is far from perfect <e> <s> that is accepted <e> <s> the principle however is one of considerable significance <e> <s> your lordships have already been told that after all in committee it is possible to give further thought to the technical forms of amendments and to deal with them later at report <e> <s> i accept that the amendment is defective in that it does not make it clear that the presumption that it gives rise to is a rebuttable presumption <e> <s> a presumption which can be rebutted by evidence which at the end of the day establishes on a fair balance of probability or better that the defendant was in no way causative of the accident would lead to the success of the defendant <e>", "<cs> my lords i join with those who have congratulated my noble friend lord longford for initiating this debate on a matter of pressing public concern <e> <s> i also join wholeheartedly in the congratulations and good wishes tendered to the minister on his translation to a distinguished but nevertheless difficult post <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to join in the congratulations that have been offered to the noble lord lord elton upon piloting his first major bill through parliament as a home office minister and indeed to note the ease with which he has stepped into the distinguished shoes of his predecessor the noble lord lord belstead <e> <s> this bill is undoubtedly one of the most important and significant pieces of criminal justice legislation to come before <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord elton has made the admirable point that it is the first few days if not indeed the first few hours of a custodial sentence that have the greatest impact upon the offender <e> <s> i am sure that no one would seek to contend to the contrary but with great respect it does not seem to me that that answers the argument <e> <s> that of course will be the case whether you sentence a person to seven days or to seven years custody <e> <s> it does not deal with the question of what the appropriate length of sentence should be in any particular case <e> <s> in any event in so far as the category that we are dealing with here is concerned there is the range of from days to months less remission already catered for <e>", "<cs> it seems to us on these benches that as regards the question of the age of an offender in the context of any line that is drawn at law the choice must really lie between his age at the date of the commission of the offence or his age at the time he is dealt with by the court <e> <s> no doubt there are many situations that will render either of those two dates less than appropriate <e> <s> but the lesser of the two evils in our submission is the date at which he is dealt with by the court <e>", "<cs> i agree with the sentiments of the noble lord on the liberal benches it would be better if it were put in that particular way so that a court would not be allowed to come to that conclusion unless it had had the benefit of a medical report <e> <s> i hope very much that the government will be able to accept this amendment for it seems to me that the arguments in favour of it are wholly irrefutable <e> <s> the situation in law at the moment falls only barely short of what the amendment seeks to achieve <e>", "<cs> is not the situation this <e> <s> if it is an offence which is punishable for an adult with imprisonment then the crown court or the juvenile court can make a care order <e>", "<cs> although with his usual courtesy the noble lord has explained in full the effects of the governments decision in this matter with the very greatest respect to him i do not think that he has really justified the distinction drawn between young offenders in this case <e> <s> the general policy of the present government and of previous governments has been to expunge that difference <e> <s> indeed in this very bill there is a very substantial provision that deals with making time spent in custody by young offenders count as against eventual sentence in exactly the same way as for adult offenders <e> <s> having therefore endorsed that principle of equality why should the government fly in the face of their own basic philosophy in this matter <e> <s> we are mildly disappointed but not altogether dismayed by the governments attitude and we hope to return to the matter at another stage at one trusts a more propitious hour than the present <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the house is deeply grateful to the noble lord lord mottistone for this opportunity to discuss matters which are of prime interest and of profound public concern <e> <s> may i join with the noble lord who opened the debate in saying how much i too look forward to the maiden speech of the noble lord lord st john of bletso <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will allow me to intervene and i am most grateful certainly what i say is that if according to the governments own argument there is a real danger of nuclear war and if they really want to protect millions of lives then shelters certainly should be built <e>", "<cs> my lords unreservedly i do unless it can be shown that the risk is a negligible one and at the moment the risk is not a negligible one <e> <s> i do not think i could be clearer than that <e>", "<cs> trident <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord trefgarne has said the government have indeed sought to give legal form to an undertaking which was given at report stage in another place <e> <s> most certainly the view which we on these benches take is that the government have come a very long way towards fulfilling that undertaking and i have no doubt at all that they genuinely intended to carry out the very letter of the undertaking given in the other place <e> <s> the question which arises however is whether the wording of the new provision in fact executes what clearly was the intention of the government all along <e>", "<cs> the proposals in this clause to give the courts new powers to impose supervised activity requirements on juvenile offenders are an important step forward in giving the courts greater confidence in using intermediate treatment schemes as a genuine alternative to custody or residential care for young offenders at what might be described as the heavy end of the delinquency spectrum <e> <s> there is however as the noble baroness lady faithfull has said the gravest danger that these provisions to borrow the words of st paul could be but the tinkling of a cymbal if the financial resources arc not deliberately and specifically channelled to this purpose <e>", "<cs> while welcoming what the noble lord the minister says about his sympathy for the underlying principle for this amendment may i say on behalf of those of us on these benches that we consider that this amendment is in any event a very poor substitute for what is enshrined in amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i hope i am not out of order in encouraging the minister to consider very very carefully whether or not a judicial review hearing should not after all be the answer in these cases <e> <s> the matter has been put very clearly by the magistrates association in their publication of <e>", "<cs> would not the minister agree that whether or not it is called custody and i would suggest there is no profit whatsoever in dissecting legal hairs of that sort whatever it is called it is a constraint upon physical liberty <e> <s> it is the order of an authoritative body backed by sanctions that that person shall live in a certain place <e> <s> in that respect it has everything in common with a custodial order <e>", "<cs> the question of whether or not britain is in breach of the european convention is one of the most paramount importance as i am sure every member of the committee accepts <e> <s> before i come to that matter i should like in support of the amendments to mention one or two other matters <e> <s> i hope that the house will forgive my indulging in a shattering manifestation of the obvious but these amendments are really wholly in line with the basic philosophy of part i of the bill <e> <s> i suppose that if one wanted to summarise that in one sentence one would say that the main object of part i of the bill is to substitute determinate sentences for areas where before there were sentences of interdeterminate length <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i misunderstood him and i am sure that the committee is grateful for that further elucidation <e> <s> of course it is always open and this is the very heart of the matter as far as these amendments are concerned to the local authority to say that the person concerned must spend a substantial part or the whole part of his time under that order in a residence designated by themselves <e> <s> i would not argue as to whether that was custody or not most clearly it is a deprivation of liberty and no noble lord opposite would seek to argue to the contrary <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the minister for giving way <e> <s> with the greatest respect to the minister he must be more specific than that <e> <s> the mental health case had its judgment delivered on th november last year it was the case of x v <e>", "<cs> it highlights with great respect the same principle <e> <s> that is why i mentioned it as the starting point of what should have been the detailed consideration of the government in this matter <e>", "<cs> i may or may not be satisfied but i appreciate how far the minister has come <e> <s> with the leave therefore of the committee i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> despite the lucidity and force with which the amendment was moved by the noble and learned lord lord hutchinson we on these benches would say that we regard this particular amendment as being unsatisfactory <e> <s> indeed without going into the detail of our reasons we accept broadly the reasons eloquently put forward by the noble lord lord harris of greenwich whose views i am sure the committee greatly welcomes particularly as chairman of the parole board although strictly speaking it may well be that he should not in fact be regarded as eligible to take part in these debates for another two days <e> <s> i am sure <e>", "<cs> my lords since it is known that a very high percentage of seizures of heroin take place in consequence of information that emanates from abroad is the minister satisfied that the custom and excise are getting all the support and assistance which could be expected from foreign police bodies and agencies <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord why her majestys government subscribed to a communiqu which had the glaring omission of not declaring unequivocally that the plo should leave lebanon <e> <s> does he not agree that the communiqu envisages that residual units of the plo should still remain in lebanon <e> <s> does not the minister also agree that there would be no hope for stable statehood in lebanon once there was a base in lebanon for the plo as an international terrorist organisation and a base for acts of murder and destruction against northern galilee <e>", "<cs> paragraph <e>", "<cs> we on these benches support the amendment since we believe that if it is carried it will at any rate achieve one of the main purposes of this piece of legislation <e> <s> i quote the words of the noble lord the minister uttered but a quarter of an hour ago <e> <s> he said that the whole purpose of the bill is to see to it that fewer people go into prison and to guarantee that more people will come out of prison sooner <e> <s> that second limb of the governments laudable purpose will be achieved if the amendment is carried <e> <s> but it is our submission that if the amendment is not carried nothing else either already dealt with in the bill or yet to come can possibly achieve the purpose <e> <s> that being so the bill would contain a massive vacuum in regard to the central purpose of reducing the menacing level at which the prison population now stands <e>", "<cs> we on these benches are deeply disappointed that the minister has not seen fit to describe the colorado beetle according to its latin classification term <e> <s> having said that we are too deeply committed to the campaign to eradicate the colorado beetle and to take a realistic account of the roar of inflation <e> <s> we commend this amendment totally <e>", "<cs> as one who had the privilege for some years of representing a country constituency and as a countryman and who revels in his agricultural forebears it gives me great pleasure to support the amendments moved by the noble lord lord stanley and to do so not only on behalf of myself but on behalf of all my noble friends on these benches behind me <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches are deeply disappointed that the noble lord has taken so rigid a line in relation to this matter an attitude which is markedly different from that taken by his honourable and learned friend the minister of state in another place who at committee stage was prepared to give the matter further consideration <e> <s> the basic point has been avoided by the minister <e> <s> it is not a question of giving young offenders the same benefits as older offenders <e> <s> the basic point is that a young offender is on risk of recall for a longer period <e> <s> he is on risk of recall to the end of his sentence whereas the older offender is on risk only to a point in time two-thirds through his sentence that is the first release date <e> <s> that is the difference <e> <s> it is a difference that has not been justified either today or on the earlier occasion on i think th june when we last debated the matter in committee <e> <s> no cogent argument has been put forward for that distinction <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join the noble lord lord trefgarne in congratulating the law officers on having so expeditiously delivered a joint opinion on this most important matter <e> <s> it would come as no surprise to any member of the house that it is now beyond any doubt that the united kingdom is in breach of the european convention <e> <s> indeed anyone who looked carefully at article paragraph of the convention would say that there is no way in which the present provisions could ever have come near the four corners of that most important paragraph <e> <s> as the house will remember the paragraph stresses two matters <e> <s> it states <e>", "<cs> my lords the house is deeply grateful to the noble lord the minister for repeating a statement made in another place <e> <s> we on these benches join in expressing our revulsion at these cowardly and barbaric acts which give a new and obscene twist to modern terrorism <e> <s> there is no language strong enough to use in their condemnation <e> <s> may we too express our deepest sympathy with the families of those who have lost their lives and with those who have suffered injury as well indeed as expressing our gratitude and admiration for the courage and the competence of those who have taken part in rescue operations <e> <s> may i also register our anxious hope that those who have perpetrated these deeds will soon be brought to answer for their outrages <e>", "<cs> my lords i well remember in in another place on the opposition front bench being involved with the parent act and indeed on behalf of my colleagues in that place giving the act a cautious welcome <e> <s> we all appreciated that the act was very much a stop-gap measure and it had been put together rather hastily to deal with a situation that few people had foreseen was likely to develop <e> <s> the interpretation given to certain statutory provisions by this house in its judicial capacity turned out to be rather harsher than certain people had anticipated and i make no criticism whatsoever of that decision <e>", "<cs> my lords there are three points which the noble lord the minister has not touched upon and in my submission each and every one of them goes to the very root of the issue <e>

against such questions very often in daily practice <e> <s> first there is what might be called <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches have very considerable support for this amendment and very great sympathy for the reasons underlying it as those have been articulated by the noble lord lord wigoder <e> <s> inevitably the passing and making of a suspended sentence involves some element of casuistry on the part of the sentencing court <e> <s> the task which parliament has placed upon the court is indeed a difficult one <e> <s> the court in the first instance has to consider whether or not the offence that it is dealing with merits imprisonment <e> <s> then having decided that it does and having decided upon the term of imprisonment the very next second in theory that court has to constitute itself into a parole hoard and to ask itself is it necessary that that man whom we have just sentenced to months imprisonment should remain in custody a moment longer <e> <s> it is a difficult consideration and it is one that cannot be avoided in the context of suspended sentences which form a very important part of the armoury of the courts <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord the minister for giving way <e> <s> while accepting everything that has been said in relation to arson would he bear in mind however the next offence that is aggravated arson arson with intent to endanger life which is in a rather different category <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble lord the minister he is quite right <e> <s> that offence is in fact included <e> <s> i am sorry for wasting the time of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords this is the last opportunity that the house will have at this stage of the bill of inserting a provision that will make it certain

preceding amendment <e> <s> may i say in parenthesis that i regard it as a pity that one has to discuss these various and alternative proposals individually rather than all together when one would be able to weigh the merits and demerits against each other and come to some sort of global conclusion at the end <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord is deemed to have sat down may i say that the noble lord has said very fairly that the government wish to see in principle the benefits of parole extended to a wider community <e> <s> of course the noble lord has said at an earlier stage as indeed has his ministerial colleague in another place that a review is now taking place with regard to the powers that might be taken under clause of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly would not wish to be out of order and if the minister does not wish to deal with that particular matter there is no way that i can take it up <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that <e>", "<cs> my lords i speak on this not only as a countryman but on behalf of my noble and learned friend lord elwyn-jones and my noble friends lady david and lady llewelyn-davies whose enthusiasm on this matter knows no bounds

unrepentant in relation to those matters and utterly unremitting in our attitude <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches greatly welcome the amendment <e> <s> it gives magistrates courts a highly desirable degree of flexibility and previous to the decision of the court of appeal in <e>", "<cs> my lords may i invite your lordships to consider a matter as a preliminary point before my noble and

decision of <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord skelmersdale has said that a claim is in the process of contemplation that is what i understand him to have said <e> <s> if that be the case will he confirm that at some stage a claim will be made and if so with what authoritative body will that claim be filed <e>", "<cs> my lords by its very nature this issue is one that cuts through party boundaries in many cases <e> <s> nevertheless in supporting the order as i do i apprehend that i shall be speaking on behalf of the vast majority of my noble friends on these benches <e>", "<cs> my lords the riots which occurred in the spring and the summer of last year were undoubtedly the very worst challenges to law and order that our community has experienced in this century <e> <s> what they signified and what they might indeed portend in the future was of such nature as to send a chill of horror into the heart of every responsible citizen <e>", "<cs> my lords undoubtedly i do <e>

that probation has existed in our statute law there has never been a stage in my judgment at which it was so essential for the probation service to enjoy the highest morale and also to be assured of the understanding and support of her majestys government <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask <e>", "<cs> no that was not the question my lords <e> <s> i was merely going to ask the minister for his comment on the fact that the number of applications in had fallen by as compared with and <e> <s> so we are already on a downslide <e>", "<cs> my lords in deciding whether or not these concessions should be made can the minister tell the house what consideration is given to the excessively high levels of unemployment particularly in wales and the parlous position of the welsh economy <e>", "<cs> the

under the duty the amendment seeks specifically to place upon him <e> <s> if he did not act equitably then he would be placing himself in the greatest jeopardy <e> <s> it may be however that the inclusion of the words suggested in this amendment will place the matter beyond any doubt and in an even more public way than the assurance which i am sure the minister will be prepared to give would allay any fears that might exist as to the restrictive right of the applicant to articulate his case <e>", "<cs> we on this side of the committee are disappointed at the response of the noble lord the minister <e> <s> i am afraid that this amendment like one or two other amendments tonight has not brought out the best in the noble lord and he has not exhibited to the committee his sparkling personality of which we are all well aware <e>", "<cs> we would be glad if the noble lord would reconsider the situation after i have addressed the committee <e> <s> he has not shown us his sparkling personality but rather has exhibited the mustiness of bureaucracy that lies heavy on his notes from the home office <e> <s> as my noble and learned friend lord gardiner has put it so succinctly the white paper laid specific emphasis upon the registrars function of pursuing complaints <e>", "<cs> while accepting of course that the complaint procedure whether it is a formal procedure written into the bill or whether it is an informal procedure which the noble and learned lord chancellor says will be open is open to abuse does not the minister accept that it is necessary for the success of this legislation that the ordinary data subject should know that there was a sympathetic and patient ear for his complaints <e> <s> if that sympathetic and patient ear is not to be the registrar who else could possibly discharge that role <e>", "<cs> my lords i doubt whether there is in this house any noble lord or noble baroness who does not feel some sympathy for the noble lord the minister who will shortly be replying to the debate <e> <s> we feel sympathy with him in the unwholesome task that has been thrust upon him <e> <s> we have no doubt that with superb advocative skill he will <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it would be appropriate that that information should be conveyed to the data subject as soon as reasonably possible <e> <s> i agree that it is a difficult matter but since the person who is primarily to be protected by this legislation is the data subject rather than the data user i should have thought that logically it should be relayed as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it i have a right of reply since i moved the amendment <e> <s> i well appreciate the argument put forward by the noble lord the minister and i also appreciate that there could well be difficulties if the registrar were to be expected to communicate with thousands or perhaps hundreds of thousands of people <e> <s> however i am sure that the minister will readily concede the force in the argument put forward from these benches that there will be many cases where the only way in which the data subject can find that his name is included in a situation highly prejudicial to him will be through the medium of the registrar himself <e> <s> if the registrar sets his face against communicating to individuals then one of the main purposes of this legislation will have been totally frustrated <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house in the light of that assurance at this stage most certainly the matter will not be pressed to a division <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches consider that this is an amendment which would to a large extent undermine one of the main purposes of the bill itself <e> <s> the situation under clause as it now stands is that the power of entry can be exercised if information on oath is supplied by the <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not merely in the hope that i may be readmitted to the good will of the noble lord lord mottistone that i find great pleasure in saying that we on these benches totally support the amendment <e> <s> any invasion of privacy in particular one which involves entry onto private premises is a very serious matter but there are <e>", "<cs> my lords we are in the fullest sympathy with the amendment and we agree with its principle <e> <s> however it may be that the period of two days is rather short <e> <s> after all circuit judges are not really geared as are magistates to discharging substantial administrative functions <e> <s> i can well imagine a circuit judge viewing with great disfavour the fact that he has to determine one of these issues on a day when he has a very full list of pleas or alternatively when he is due to carry on with a part-heard trial at with a jury waiting <e> <s> it may be that much time would be taken up by these matters <e> <s> i should have thought that in the circumstances perhaps a period of five days would be more appropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that the time has once again come when the noble lord lord mottistone and those who sit on these benches must part company albeit temporarily <e> <s> if there was no such thing as the bundle of remedies which lie at common law to a person who suffers an abuse of powers such as this amendment deals with then no doubt there would be irresistible force in the argument put forward by the noble lord lord mottistone <e> <s> however those powers in civil law exist and in the submission of those of us on these benches are adequate <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may with the leave of the house deal with that point at this stage that is a complicated technical matter <e> <s> but in my understanding it is a matter which crops up regularly in relation to the issue of privilege and the courts will allow severance where severance is possible <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i appreciate that my rights are limited in relation to reply <e> <s> therefore i shall deal with the matter when i come to reply to the amendment <e> <s> but the answer in short is that the courts will sever whenever they can <e>", "<cs> my lords to some extent we are relieved by the assurances which have been given by the noble lord the minister but we are far from satisfied <e> <s> i beg the minister in considering this situation as i know he will over the next few weeks to consider that there is something utterly inconsistent between on the one hand the provision with which we are now dealing which allows a search to be made and an invasion of an area of total privilege and privacy as it is in every other context and on the other hand under clause of this bill saying that a person who is himself the subject of certain data comments which have passed between a data subject and let us say his solicitor is not entitled to intervene in that area <e> <s> it would be strange would it not if this bill were to become law in its present form in relation to that provision which would allow that search to be made and to invade that most private of territories <e> <s> in our criminal law no matter how serious the case even if it were a case that involved the very security of the state itself there is no judge who would allow trespass even to an inch upon that area <e> <s> it is on that basis that we urge the noble lord to reconsider the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl give us a piece of information which many members of this house believe is central to the whole issue <e> <s> how many well-qualified students in the current academic year have failed to find placement in any university in the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first of all on what i am sure will be a wholly uncontroversial note endorse completely what the noble lord lord harris of greenwich has said by way of tribute to mr dennis trevelyan <e> <s> i had the opportunity of being well acquainted with his skill and distinction many years ago when i was a very junior minister at the home office <e>", "<cs> my lords i was quoting from a second leader that appeared in the <e>", "<cs>

issue of the refund will the leader of the house give the figures for the net deficit suffered by the united kingdom in respect of those payments since st january <e>", "<cs> i am extremely grateful to the noble lord the minister for his words of welcome <e> <s> i am equally grateful to my noble friend lord mcintosh of haringey and to the noble lord lord avebury for their support in varying degrees for this amendment <e> <s> i suspect however that the situation is one that is far more fundamental than the noble lord the minister would have us believe <e> <s> although i welcome his assurance in relation to reading clause of the bill together with the principles set out in schedule there are matters which remain unresolved <e>", "<cs> it was a slip of the tongue <e> <s> the noble lord said data user <e>", "<cs> in the light of everything that has been said on this side of the committee we feel that very strong indeed irrefutable arguments have been put in favour of the amendment <e> <s> however we respect the viewpoint of the minister and in the weeks ahead we shall consider carefully what he has said but we reserve the right to raise the matter again if that be necessary in the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> we certainly agree that the noble and learned lord has put his case as clearly and as cogenty as one would ever expect him so to do although it is not a legal matter <e> <s> we are not totally satisfied and i hope we do not sound churlish on that account <e> <s> we are with great respect begging leave to doubt the total correctness of what the noble and learned lord says when he doubts whether it will be the humblest in the land who on occasions will have resort to these searches <e> <s> we believe that in many cases that could well be so and that it would be a failure of this legislation if it were to be thought that it was confined to more privileged groups <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the committee would be so kind as to allow me to speak not only to this amendment but also to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the view that we take is that amendment no <e> <s> seeks to bring about exactly the same result as that which is enshrined in the purpose of amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the effect of amendment no <e> <s> if carried would be to delete completely the provisions of subsection of clause <e> <s> it would still mean of course that although no reference was made in that part of the bill to those conditions disclosure would still be possible under compulsion of law <e> <s> that is the very wording of amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i have listened with very great interest to what the noble lord has said and i must say that on a superficial reading of article it seems that it is neck or nothing that it must be either wholly inside or wholy excluded from the data provisions <e> <s> however i am not quite sure that i understand the interaction between article and article and it seems to me that article refers specifically to exemptions under articles and <e>", "<cs> we certainly welcome that assurance from the minister <e> <s> i am sure that his statement of the constitutional position is well understood on this side of the committee and certainly by me as a former junior minister in the home office dealing with police matters <e> <s> upon that very full assurance by the minister we are pleased to ask the leave of the committee to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i express the sincerest sympathy with police officers who daily are at risk from the most savage attacks <e> <s> does the noble minister agree that the cases referred to differ widely in their character <e> <s> does he agree also that there is an infinite variety of different factors that can be involved and that in the circumstances to place a minimum penalty would indeed be to put the sentencer in an intolerable position <e> <s> or put another way that in the context of such crimes and indeed of gravely serious crimes in general our community can properly place its trust in judges to act with fairness wisdom and balance <e>", "<cs> my lords this debate is one which is of supreme importance and relevance to this house and to the community at large and i welcome this opportunity to congratulate my noble friend lord cledwyn of penrhos on initiating it and indeed on the stimulating way in which he has as usual opened his case with great lucidity with good humour and with his usual fair-minded balance <e> <s> i was very glad that my noble friend lady white widened the scope of the consideration here to remind us that we are dealing not just with the basic physical assets that we regard as part of the infrastructure but with something which is infinitely wider and more complex than that <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord concludes i wonder whether i might ask him this question <e> <s> i did not want to intervene in the full flow of his rhetoric <e> <s> with regard to what he has said about projects for the electrification of various parts of british rail and the continuous welded track developments in deciding what parts were to be modernised what heed did the government pay if any to the serpell report and to which of its options <e>", "<cs> my lords i too join in congratulating my noble friend lord prys-davies in initiating this debate and

figure for a country nation that represents per cent <e> <s> of the human population of the united kingdom per cent <e> <s> of its land surface and something like per cent <e> <s> of its animal population <e>", "<cs> my lords on any view this is disgraceful conduct <e> <s> which strikes at the very root of the rule of law and even if there were no further instances what has happened already is a very serious matter <e> <s> may i raise two matters with the noble lord the minister <e> <s> first since it seems that half the problem is disruption in the face of the tribunal itself will he bear very much in mind the point made by my noble and learned friend lord elwyn-jones and consider whether a quasi-judicial tribunal of this nature should not have the same power to refer to a judge of the queens bench division as can happen in the case of a county court or a tribunal of inquiry suffering contempt in its face information relating to that particular contumelious conduct <e> <s> secondly i wonder whether the minister can give some indication to the house as to how many abandonments of tribunals there have been in respect of such misconduct as this in the past years <e>", "<cs> my lords what is the price agreed upon and what is the total acreage now being acquired <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches have very considerable sympathy with and respect for the motivations which lie at the root of this amendment <e> <s> as we understand it this amendment is <e>", "<cs> i am sorry my lords there is a great difference between a knight and a king <e> <s> in the light of the noble lords question is it the situation then that the liability of the operator runs only from the time of the making of the final order or the confirmation of a provisional order and that there never was any liability previous to that <e> <s> if there was then it does seem to me that the fault of retrospective action can indeed lie in these provisions and that would be a very serious matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble and learned lord will kindly deal with one matter which was very much at the root of my questions and that is the matter which was raised by the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge <e> <s> apart from the mechanism spelt out in clause of the bill is there not a power in a claimant in any event to make a claim for the breach of this statutory provision <e> <s> in other words does that run parallel apart from the machinery that is spelt out in the bill <e> <s> that was the matter which greatly exercised my mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i intervene very briefly in this debate because i believe fervently that the english rugby union or so it seems are about to indulge in an act that will be injurious to human freedom and indeed may well have disastrous repercussions for international sport <e> <s> as a welshman a welshman who is religiously dedicated to rugby although more blessed with enthusiasm than playing skill i am afraid it might be tempting to speak from a height of lofty celtic self-righteousness and condemn the english rugby union for their attitudes <e> <s> i do not intend doing that <e> <s> i am afraid that one could not in any event with the greatest self-righteousness do it with confidence as a welshman <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble minister confirm that whatever decision is reached by her majestys government in relation to privatisation in this context the level of financing now enjoyed by the agriculture and food research council will not be further lowered <e> <s> i am asking that in the specific context of the welsh plant breeding station which as the noble minister knows has already suffered cuts of emasculating proportions <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister tell the house what to the last available date is the total sum due by way of rebate to coal miners who are now on strike <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble baroness confirm that her majestys government have no intention at present of depriving any defendant charged with shoplifting of the right of election of trial by jury <e> <s> although the amounts involved are very often small if not trivial for a person of hitherto good character a conviction upon a charge of shoplifting can have very grave and weighty consequences <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> thank you <e>", "<cs> i have been very greatly impressed by the case put forward by the noble lord lord hooson and by the noble lord lord hutchinson of lullington <e> <s> i venture to suggest that it is an amendment which the government can readily accept for it seems to me that it achieves everything which the government seek to bring about in this connection <e>", "<cs> although i fully accept the general argument put forward by the minister about reasonable suspicion and the way that that term has been used in other acts does he agree that the combined effect of clause and clause <e>", "<cs> the committee has heard powerful speeches for and against this amendment <e> <s> as i understand it the issue very shortly is whether offensive weapon should for the purposes of this bill be limited to weapons offensive <e>", "<cs> this amendment as the noble lord the minister divined should have been moved by my noble and learned friend lord elwyn-jones who is not here but will return very shortly <e> <s> in <e>", "<cs> i am most willing to accede to that charming suggestion and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord the minister has come a very long way and shown his usual goodwill in relation to these matters <e> <s> while i accept completely the argument of the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale and feel that those arguments are irrefutable i very much welcome the general attitude of the minister <e> <s> on further reflection he may well come to the conclusion that the noble and learned lord is right in his logic and that the point should be conceded <e> <s> for those reasons i am very content to have the matter withdrawn if the committee so pleases <e>", "<cs> i find it somewhat difficult to follow entirely the logic of the noble lord lord plant <e> <s> certainly is so far as he speaks of the officer being inhibited in making a search for drugs i believe he is misconceived because the officer already has those powers under section of the misuse of drugs act <e> <s> as i understand it anything that is done by this bill will not change that situation at all <e>", "<cs> we on these benches have the fullest sympathy with the sentiments put forward by the noble lord lord monson in support of this amendment <e> <s> in our judgment quite clearly some of the worst cases of causing death by reckless driving are not only indistinguishable from the old motor manslaughter cases but could well have been prosecuted as manslaughter cases and undoubtedly would have resulted in a conviction for that offence <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> would he agree forceful though his arguments undoubtedly are in relation to simple arson that they are even more forceful in relation to arson with intent to endanger life <e>", "<cs> if this amendment has achieved nothing else it has certainly brought the spotlight to the concentration of this committee upon part i of the fifth schedule <e> <s> i am very grateful to the minister for saying that he is prepared to look at the schedule again <e> <s> i urge upon him this consideration <e> <s> the first four items undoubtedly belong to any list of serious offences <e> <s> although there can be instances of for example manslaughter where although the consequences are anything but trivial certainly nobody could ever say that of the loss of a human life nevertheless there are cases which call for a non-imprisonment disposal for example a common assault it leads by the fact of a person having an egg-shell skull to death <e> <s> very few judges would say that it is necessary to deprive a person of his liberty on that account <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble viscount a simple but i trust a fundamental question <e> <s> is it the policy of her majestys government to continue as indeed all successive governments have sought to do over the past years since our entry into the european community to seek to bring about fundamental changes in the constitutional structure of the common agricultural policy which many members in all parts of this house regard as both inequitable and repressive <e> <s> is it the case that such efforts as have been carried out by successive governments will no longer be pursued in the future so far as her majestys government are concerned <e>", "<cs> speaking for my own part and i trust for those on these benches it would on the face of it appear that there was considerable force in the comments of the noble lord lord gifford in relation to both clause <e>", "<cs> yes the two go together <e> <s> i am most obliged to the minister for his assistance <e>", "<cs> it may save time if i intervene <e> <s> i think the noble lord is labouring under a misapprehension that at the end of hours the powers contained in this clause come to an end <e> <s> they do not because they can he prolonged under subsection for another hours and another hours <e>", "<cs> may i take the ministers last point first when he seeks to argue that

for his reply <e> <s> i am not in any way surprised by anything he said <e> <s> in fact my noble and learned friend lord elwyn-jones and other noble and learned friends indeed thought that that must

have the effect of <e>", "<cs> i certainly would not quarrel with the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter if in fact an approximate figure was to be calculated by the officers concerned <e> <s> what i think is very important however is that there should be in that report something which gives an indication of the totality of the interference with private liberty that is involved <e> <s> i would urge on the committee that the sort of data which gives some indication of that factor is in fact the number of vehicles involved <e> <s> if the noble lord can think of a better criterion i will gladly accept it of course <e> <s> it is not a question of trying to make a nuisance of oneself so far as the police are concerned but of conveying meaningful information that gives some idea of the scale and nature of the operation <e>", "<cs> chastened by those words of the noble lord lord hooson we on these benches certainly do not regard this as a matter of the utmost importance <e> <s> i accept that there is a great deal of force in what the minister said in that by and large road blocks have been conducted for decades in the united kingdom without there being any great public outcry about them <e> <s> but it is the government who in clause make it incumbent upon a chief officer of police to report about these matters <e> <s> if they were matters so utterly unimportant as the minister might suggest then there would be no reason for subsection <e> <s> it is he and his honourable friends who have put in subsection and it is on the basis of subsection that we on this side

complicated as they seem <e> <s> i think that they can be summarised in this way <e> <s> the main amendment is amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the effect of accepting amendment no <e> <s> would be to impose in two situations the very careful provisions of schedule to the bill <e> <s> this deals with the special procedures first in relation to the authorising of entry and search of premises and

"<cs> perhaps i may clear that matter up now so far as is possible <e> <s> the example i gave was of the gas board effecting entry into a dwelling-house under statutory powers <e> <s> it effected entry in order to disconnect the gas supply <e> <s> it did so but left the premises in a state where they were no longer burglar-proof <e> <s> in consequence it appears of the perfectly lawful entry of the gas board but also in consequence of its negligence in not leaving the premises burglar-proof burglary did occur not of course on the part of the gas board but by some other persons unknown and a television set was taken together with other items <e>", "<cs> yes <e> <s> as i understand it there are dozens of statutory powers which allow entry in various circumstances <e> <s> it may well be the case as the noble and learned lord has already said that there is a duty at common law and under statute generally upon those authorities exercising entry to leave the premises in a proper state but as the noble and learned lord said and i am grateful to him the bill would lose nothing of its force and purpose if such a duty were to be spelt out specifically <e>", "<cs> it is not a welsh interpretation so much as a legalistic interpretation <e> <s> in fact all the amendment seeks to do is leave the premises in no worse a state than they were <e> <s> there is no incumbency on the authority that exercises the power of statutory entry to improve the situation <e> <s> on the other hand it is the law that it must not make it worse <e>", "<cs> we very greatly appreciate the full and detailed answer given by the minister although for our own part we should not have sought to demand such intricate detail upon each and every matter raised <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble lord for his intervention <e> <s> in addition i think the point can be made that it would appear that the royal commission in chapter of its report envisaged that a receipt would be given in any event <e> <s> i must say that it seems to us that if careful documentation has to be kept of articles that are seized clearly that is the situation the police officer would not be doing his duty were he not to do that nothing would be lost by leaving such a receipt upon the premises or somewhere where the occupier has access to it <e> <s> to say the least it is courtesy and it avoids all manner of argument about these matters <e>", "<cs> in my respectful submission there are two issues here <e> <s> the first is the question of whether or not the written record should be provided in any event <e> <s> upon that matter i very respectfully suggest that there seems to be unanimity in the committee or certainly a broad understanding that that is as it should be <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble and learned lord <e> <s> the second issue is whether or not it should be left to a reasonable period or days <e> <s> i wonder whether the minister would consider the proposition that i am going to put forward as a not unreasonable compromise <e> <s> i have not the slightest desire to embarrass the police or to frustrate them in their lawful pursuits in any way at all <e> <s> would the minister be prepared to consider as regards that second issue that the general time limit shall be days <e> <s> that i should have thought would accommodate per cent <e> <s> of cases <e> <s> the provision would read something like <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful and on that basis i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> we certainly do not intend to press this matter to a division <e> <s> i am again <e>", "<cs> i thought that my amendment had touched that stream of pure charity but such was not to be the case on this occasion <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i wonder if i may put the matter in this way to the noble lord the minister <e> <s> i would be highly embarrassed if i had to try to define this in mathematical terms as i have not even a cavemans understanding of mathematics <e> <s> however will the minister accept that on the governments present wording a per cent <e> <s> doubt would presumably mean that there was within the wording of the act reasonable ground for doubting <e> <s> but before one can qualify for the situation that is described in the amendments there has to be a state where the officer is believing that the name furnished by the relevant person is not his real name in other words that he says to himself it is something higher than per cent <e> <s> it is the difference between those two conditions that make the substantial and fundamental difference between the governments wording and that of the two amendments <e> <s> i would be grateful if the minister would mull over this in the days between now and report stage <e>", "<cs> on that basis i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i have listened with interest to what the noble lord lord elton has said and i shall certainly give the matter further thought between now and report <e> <s> therefore on that basis i seek the kind leave of the committee to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> i am mildly disappointed that the noble baroness has not with her usual charming good sense and balance been able to accept the content of this amendment <e> <s> in my submission it seems abundantly clear from what the noble baroness has said that there will be occasion in each case for the information that is referred to in the amendment that is a statement of the grounds for arrest a statement of the date of arrest and the time of arrest to be entered in some document or another <e> <s> it seems to me utterly unbelievable that those entries would not be made somewhere <e> <s> all that it necessitates surely is that a carbon copy be given to the defendant <e> <s> such a copy having been given to the defendant and a copy thereof retained by the police officer how can there be an argument when the matter is raised in issue at the trial perhaps over a year later as to exactly what happened in relation to those three matters <e>", "<cs> we on these benches accept that these two amendments are very useful in that they deal with small lacunae <e> <s> we therefore welcome them <e>", "<cs> the only difference between the minister and myself in this matter is whether the provision and the protection should be enshrined in the bill or whether it should remain in the code of practice <e> <s> i believe that the argument i have put forward is a logical one <e> <s> under clause a person who has not been arrested but who has been stopped and has had property taken from him has the protection enshrined in clause of having a record made of the property taken <e> <s> the question that i ask rhetorically is where another person again with the same presumption of innocence engulfing him has not only been stopped but has also suffered the further indignity of arrest and has been searched can there in logic be any justification for drawing a distinction between this second person and the person dealt with in clause <e> <s> in my respectful submission it is wrong that such a distinction should be drawn <e> <s> i accept everything that the minister said about the code of practice <e> <s> the only issue is whether it should be written into the bill <e> <s> since parliament has chosen and accepted that it should be so incorporated in clause why not have the same provision included with the more serious conditions of clause <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord has taken on board the point that i was making <e> <s> it could be that the government take the view that all these matters could be incorporated in the code of practice <e> <s> but in relation to stop and search a different decision was taken because it was considered that the <e>", "<cs> if i may venture to do so i think that one can go further even in the criminal situation than what the noble and learned lord has said in relation to a civil situation <e> <s> i apprehend and i shall be very glad to be corrected by the noble and learned lord if i am wrong that in relation to stop and search the failure to make a documentary record would not invalidate the stop and search because it is something which belongs to a point in time later than the stop and search <e> <s> again if this amendment were to be incorporated into clause in the criminal context it would in no way invalidate the arrest <e>", "<cs> i doubt with the greatest respect whether the noble lord lord renton does make a valid point there <e> <s> his power to search for drugs i believe i am right would be contained in section of the misuse of drugs act <e> <s> if i am wrong on that matter i am sure the noble lord the minister will correct me but i think there is a clear power to search for drugs and it is a very general power <e> <s> in fact i am rather sure that it is a power which the noble lord upon reflection will remember because he and i were on a committee on that bill in another place <e>", "<cs> my argument with great respect is that we are creating a conflict between two subsections <e> <s> a person is arrested in a place other than a police station let us imagine he is arrested in his own front room <e> <s> under clause <e>", "<cs> i feel very chastened and would not seek to disagree with the noble and learned lord <e> <s> i hope that someone someday perhaps the noble and learned lord himself will coin an aphorism to the effect that the englishmans body is at least as sacrosanct as his own house <e>", "<cs> i am extremely grateful and on those terms i am delighted to beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> this is not a matter upon which we on these benches would be prepared to go to the stake <e> <s> however the noble lord the minister has been kind and gracious enough to accept that the principle which the amendment seeks to serve is laudable <e> <s> i am sure that he in turn will accept that although there are situations where it would be impossible for an officer who had been earlier involved not to be a custody officer if somebody is to perform that role those situations would occur only in a very small minority of cases <e> <s> i am wondering whether the minister would be prepared in the light of what has been said to consider as a compromise that the spirit of the amendment should be accepted but that there should be a proviso that in those circumstances where it is wholly impracticable for the officer who has been earlier involved to be disbarred from being a custody officer he should not be so disbarred <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord elton says that he will have a record of his rights <e> <s> with the greatest respect to the noble lord and indeed to those police officers who will be carrying out these duties i think it would be more accurate if the house were to say to itself that he may have such a record <e>", "<cs> the instance given by the noble lord the minister of a person who is not fit to be charged because he is in such a temper i feel does not really meet the substance of this amendment <e> <s> subsection is dealing with a different situation <e> <s> although it is accepted that there are three substantial paragraphs in the draft code of practice legislating as to when a doctor should be called none of those deals with a person who shows outwards signs of drunkeness <e> <s> it does not really meet the case of the person who is comatose stinking of drink but in fact suffering from a substantial brain condition or perhaps from a fractured skull <e> <s> i beg the minister to look again and to see whether this matter can be dealt with in greater detail so as to meet those particular cases <e> <s> in my respectful submission they are cases which lead to a number of deaths in police custody every year <e> <s> on that basis i am very prepared to seek leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the point would not be improved if i were to repeat again the arguments that i deployed in moving the amendment <e> <s> on that basis i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> with the greatest respect we on this side of the committee do not take the same rosy view of the situation as does the minister <e> <s> of course in most cases the object of the exercise will be to take the suspect along to the police station as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> i appreciate that <e> <s> i was perhaps doing less than justice to the wording of that provision although as i understand it there is no absolute sanction if there is a breach of that provision <e> <s> i accept that in most cases in the vast majority of cases the suspect will be taken along speedily to the police station <e> <s> however there will be other cases when that will not happen even when there is no question of taking the suspect outside the area in which the offence has been committed <e>", "<cs> i am sure that i do not disappoint the noble lord the minister when i say that we have no intention of pressing the amendment to a division <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> certainly i accept that <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> since i assume there-fore that it is not the amendment in its present form that will be accepted but the spirit of it i am happy indeed in those circumstances to beg leave to withdraw <e>", "<cs> these are extremely difficult questions <e> <s> the noble lord the minister mentions the case of the person who does not submit to a search <e> <s> assuming therefore that no doctor would carry out that search it has to be carried out by a police officer <e> <s> the noble lord gave the instance of a woman who had secreted razor blades into her vaginal orifice and who was suicidally inclined <e> <s> i should not like to be a senior police officer who had to decide in that case which was the lesser of the two evils either to carry out a search knowing there there was a high risk of injury and perhaps of death by the very fact of the search itself or on the other hand to run the risk of not carrying it out <e> <s> the instance the minister has given bears out the very dilemma <e>", "<cs> without going into the greatest detail at this early hour in the morning i would suggest to the minister that there are other powers that could have been invoked <e> <s> indeed there are common law powers that could have been invoked in those circumstances <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> we on these benches have very great sympathy for the amendment moved by the noble lord lord hooson <e> <s> we accept and are aware that misidentification has led to greater and more numerous miscarriages of justice than possibly any other heading in relation to the administration of our criminal law <e> <s> as the committee will be aware it was a classic case of misidentification in the early years of this century which led to the formation as it then was called or the establishment of the court of criminal appeal <e> <s> from the few years experience that i had as a junior minister in the home office i saw numerous cases of this nature where there were people of the most genuine motivation intelligent people who were not only trying to be truthful but determined as well to be totally accurate but who were wrong wrong wrong <e> <s> very often it was not a case of one person or three or four people but sometimes eight or people who were all falling into the same trap <e>", "<cs> i should like to intervene to make it absolutely clear that i was in no way suggesting that there was an active intention on the part of the police officer to encourage the commission of the offence <e> <s> that would be utterly reprehensible and wrong by every canon of discipline as far as his work is concerned <e> <s> the point that i was making and clearly i did not make it as succinctly as i might was that for people who were of homosexual disposition the very presence of the police officer was in itself a provocation <e> <s> it was only in that very limited sense <e> <s> i am very grateful to the noble and learned lord for having given way <e>", "<cs> i am sure we have all listened with very great care to the arguments and explanations that have been very lucidly as always deployed by the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor <e> <s> we accept that the amendment is far from perfect and we certainly would not seek to press it to a division for a number of reasons <e> <s> however we hope that what has been said on this matter within this chamber and in the other place will have the effect of much stricter guidelines being issued to police forces or a genuine effort being made by the home office to bring about a more reasonable level of uniformity in relation to this matter so that experienced officers and they are almost invariably officers of considerable experience have their time in the main better occupied when in many localities it is not necessary in relation to any feeling of public outrage for these exercises to be carried out on such a scale as they are <e>", "<cs> i too share the sense of disappointment of the noble lord lord renton and may i say what a pleasure it is every now and again to be able to agree with a point made by the noble lord although we disagree on certain matters <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i might ask my noble friend lord plant to reconsider the question of having a division now and to keep his powder dry for another occasion <e> <s> i make the same appeal to the noble lord lord renton <e>", "<cs> although the schedule sets out the parameters there is complete flexibility there is no reason why such a body should not amoeba-like split itself up into various parts to meet the needs of each locality <e>", "<cs> i have listened with great respect and interest to what the noble lord the minister has said <e> <s> i accept the point made by the noble lord lord hooson that clause is not to be dismissed lightly <e> <s> it tries to set out a broad pattern for the whole of england and wales <e> <s> i suspect also that as far as the pattern in the london boroughs is concerned it may be possible within the provisions of clause and with the determination of the home secretary of the day to have that interlocking agglomeration of bodies operating in the metropolitan police district <e> <s> but i suspect too that for the rest of england and wales there may be many bald patches where the provisions of clause will be only very scantily applied <e> <s> it is in the hope that it might be possible to set up some structure for every police area that would be responsible within that structure for constructing some sort of seamless web of different bodies differing according to the needs of each locality that we have put forward this amendment <e> <s> i hope very much that the minister will reflect upon that aspect as well <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> it is much too late to go into any considerable detail though it is tempting to turn to <e> <s> the matter is one that we might return to on another appropriate occasion but tonight i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord stanley raises the fascinating question of whether farmers in england love their dogs more than their wives <e> <s> i am sure that that is a topic which could well occupy the time of this chamber but i trust on another occasion <e> <s> the noble lord the minister asks the question what purpose would be served by having the dog examined by a police officer <e> <s> i believe that there is every practical purpose <e> <s> if a dog has been worrying sheep unless that dog has been very very carefully washed i would have thought that for a matter of a day or two a swab of blood from the mouth area or a tuft of wool would facilitate a forensic examination that would link a dog with a killing if the dog was the dog that had killed <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble baroness the minister can say whether or not there is any comprehensive review of the rights and obligations of the united kingdom under the extradition act and our rights and obligations in respect of commonwealth countries under the fugitive offenders acts <e> <s> i am sure that many members of this house will feel that the arrangements looked at globally are incomplete and form an inconsistent picture <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to be corrected it was a very serious lapse on my part <e> <s> i did intend to refer to the netherlands but in the context of having been condemned by the european court of justice for that very reason <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to say that we are extremely disappointed with the noble lords reply <e> <s> we are dealing with a matter of the utmost importance of that there can be no doubt whatever <e> <s> the minister sought to justify hours <e>", "<cs> my lords with the greatest respect to the noble lord the minister for whose powers of reasoning for whose wisdom and for whose personality in general i have very great admiration i do not think that that is one of the best arguments that he has articulated in the context of this bill in general <e> <s> the main argument put forward by the government is that this is a protection and not an inroad <e> <s> that argument simply cannot be sustained unless one ignores the fact that since the early seventeenth century we have had <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no doubt that the noble baroness makes a fair point in relation to that matter <e> <s> it is an absolute limit as i understand it so far as that particular session of detention is concerned <e> <s> i believe i am right in saying that if that person is released he could be re-detained again and again <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches have considerable respect for the principles which underlie the amendment moved by the noble lord <e> <s> however having said that at the same time we do not agree with the detail of the amendment nor indeed the tactical approach that the noble lord has adopted <e> <s> for one reason we think that although the modest sum that he stipulates for every hour of detention would not break police funds nevertheless it might have a somewhat stultifying effect upon the attitude which the police should properly have in relation to the conduct of their investigations <e> <s> further-more and perhaps even more important there is the danger that if parliament were to legislate that an hour should properly represent compensation here it might have some effect upon the levels of compensation which at the moment i apprehend are very much higher in those cases involving unlawful arrest <e> <s> the sums of money that are regularly adjudicated by judges in our courts are at a very different level <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness please return to the crucial question of the legality or otherwise of the act of the european parliament <e> <s> will she confirm that her majestys government have taken the advice of the law officers in this matter <e> <s> since it is a question of such crucial public interest will her majestys government consider the publication of a white paper incorporating that opinion <e> <s> if it be the opinion as many apprehend that it undoubtedly will be that there has been a clear and fundamental breach of agreement in respect of the rebates will her majestys government clearly say that they will not exclude the possibility of taking action in the european court <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches accept that the amendment undoubtedly is a clearer enunciation of the purpose of this part of the bill than the wording of clause <e>", "<cs> my lords in my respectful submission one thing is abundantly clear in relation to the whole issue of mental illness <e> <s> the house is aware that here is an area redolent with the possibility of miscarriage of justice <e> <s> very often such miscarriages of justice will occur even though there has been the greatest fairness and the greatest care taken by the investigating officers <e> <s> they arise out of the very nature and characteristics of mental illness and mental handicap <e> <s> it may well be that the gravest danger is not in relation to mental illness so much as to mental handicap where it is more difficult for the investigating officer to come to a conclusion that a person is handicapped in that way <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches wholeheartedly support the principle which underlies this important amendment <e> <s> from onwards <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches greatly welcome the change of heart on the part of the government <e> <s> we believed on an earlier occasion that this was a necessary provision and i am sure that all who live in the countryside will feel that it is a very proper step for the government to take <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches have nothing but respect and admiration for <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that there are faults in the two amendments but i had very much hoped that it might be possible to correct them in another place <e> <s> it seems that the government are not to be moved on the matter <e> <s> we do not regard it as one which would justify us in dividing the house <e> <s> therefore i beg leave to withdraw amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble baroness lady faithfull will forgive me if i do not follow her on the extremely important issue that she has raised <e> <s> may i say that i totally agree with her <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the committee will not think me churlish if i state that we are mildly disappointed to say the least by the ministers reaction in this respect <e> <s> of course it is the case that we are all mindful of the fact that there are massive wrinkles in the law of obscenity which need to be ironed out and of course it is in relation to that main problem that we have considered this amendment but we put it forward as one which has true merit in the interim between now and such time as parliament sees fit to place all obscenity law on a basis of broad consistency <e>", "<cs> the noble lord the minister divines properly that we intend testing the will of the committee by means of a division <e>", "<cs> we on this side of the chamber agree wholeheartedly with this amendment and indeed with the reasons articulated by the noble baroness in moving it <e> <s> we also take the view that it is doubtful whether the amendment if passed would really extend the law if at all beyond where it stands under section of the children and young persons act and the relevant section which i think is section of the criminal justice act <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord the minister <e> <s> no doubt these inconsistencies are well known to nearly every member of this committee and i have not the slightest doubt but that they cause worry if not indeed despair <e> <s> how can we even convince the public at large that ordinary men and women stand in exactly the same light before the law <e> <s> it surely depends where they live <e>", "<cs> i am sure we are very grateful to the minister for the very full and sympathetic way in which he has dealt with the amendment <e> <s> certainly we will not divide the committee on this matter but we will ponder and reflect deeply upon his words <e> <s> i do not consider that this is in any way a matter which is capable of easy solution <e> <s> there is no perfect answer and there is no really acceptable situation that we can aim at <e>", "<cs> we are grateful to the minister for having in suitably guarded language assured the committee that ultimately the prosecuting authority will in every area be operating from premises which are entirely separate and distinct from those occupied by the police <e>", "<cs> may i in following the noble lord lord hutchinson declare an interest here as a practising member of the bar and say how much i totally agree with the sentiments articulated by the noble lord <e> <s> i rise very briefly to make four points <e> <s> i wish that i could have given notice to the noble lord the minister of these matters but i am afraid they have been put together rather hastily <e>", "<cs> i think that my noble friend must have misheard me <e> <s> i said that per cent <e> <s> of all criminal cases are disposed of by magistrates courts <e> <s> i then gave an example of a person of let us say good character who has been acquitted has not been granted legal aid and has not been able to recover the cost of his representation <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor in a most engaging and eloquent speech has i think put forward all the arguments that could reasonably be articulated in favour of the proposition that there should be this distinction <e> <s> he has lit a small candle <e> <s> i think there is a proverb which comes out of the wisdom of the east somewhere which says it is better to light a small candle than to curse the darkness <e> <s> rather than curse the darkness and put this matter to the test today we are prepared most certainly to accept the undertaking which has been given by the noble and learned lord and we look forward very much to a more benign result ultimately being achieved in this matter <e>", "<cs> in the face of such overwhelming opinion from such distinguished quarters there is nothing that i can do but wholeheartedly agree with it and if not altogether in sackcloth and ashes nevertheless say that in the circumstances we are perfectly prepared to beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> there are two matters which i should be grateful if i might raise on the question whether clause shall stand part of the bill <e> <s> the first is whether there is any power it seems to me there is not in a crown court to order costs against the prosecution <e> <s> if i am right in that i shall gladly be corrected if i am wrong then it means that a very substantial sanction which exists at the present moment in relation to the prosecution has been removed <e>", "<cs> the prohibition on the reporting of matters in our courts is a truly exceptional provision <e> <s> there are justifications for it in proper cases but nevertheless it is a situation which raises many difficult and complex questions <e> <s> as indeed the noble lord lord campbell of alloway and the noble and learned lord lord denning have pointed out it is <e>", "<cs> in the light of that generous undertaking there is no question of pressing the amendment <e> <s> we are grateful to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for his undertaking <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that we on these benches appreciate the problems that are caused in this situation of a balance between the rights of anglers on the one hand and the demands of conservation on the other <e> <s> does he stand by the undertaking given by his noble friend lord avon on st october last year that legislation would be brought in to bring about the substitution of lead shot with a reasonable alternative if there is demand for that <e> <s> does he accept that it appears that none of the three main pieces of legislation in this field the cruelty to animals act the protection of animals act and the animal health act has any sanction whatever and that fresh legislation will be necessary <e> <s> will he consider further as an alternative the possibility of having non-fishing zones where although it might be impracticable to try to corral swans completely to such areas it might well achieve the main purpose of the objective <e>", "<cs> my lords does that mean that the phasing out which the nature conservancy council recommended by the end of and which the government have undertaken to bring about therefore cannot be brought about before the end of because the government will not be in a position to estimate how may anglers have adopted the alternative product <e>", "<cs> we on these benches regard the argument that has been put forward as being not only a strong but also an irrefutable argument for applying the same circumstances with regard to lay observers to licensed conveyancers as indeed to solicitors <e> <s> much has been said today about the need for confirming the status of licensed conveyancers as professionals <e> <s> it is by the building of bulwarks such as this that some contribution will be made in that direction <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the minister two questions <e> <s> first what is the best estimate currently held by the government of the number of people in england and wales now using lsd <e> <s> secondly as regards the contention that the figures for addiction seem to compare well with a point in time about years ago do those figures take into account the fact that for thousands of people lsd appears to be a bridge between cannabis heroin and cocaine and is used for perhaps half a dozen to trips and that addiction is not a particular feature of the use of this very dangerous drug <e>", "<cs> my lords i formally move this amendment on behalf of my noble friend lord mishcon <e> <s> i do not propose to address the house on this matter <e> <s> i was not present at the debate last night <e> <s> i apologise for that <e> <s> i also apologise for the absence of my noble friend lord mishcon and my noble and learned friend lord silkin who are both away from the house on different engagements and are sorry for their absence <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of those on these benches i associate myself fully with the words of the noble lord lord wigoder in the well-deserved tribute he has paid to the noble baroness lady vickers <e>", "<cs> my lords on that particular matter i wonder whether the minister can say whether or not there is any machinery for maintaining a constant contact between the requisite branch of the civil service and universities technical colleges and education authorities with a view to recruiting persons of the highest calibre from ethnic minorities

but i read with very great interest the speech of the noble and <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord has already alluded to this matter will he also kindly bear in mind that it was only by the juries act that the right of peremptory challenge in respect of seven jurors was reduced to three <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree that it seems that one important part of the problem is that only a small minority of the victims of rape make complaint <e> <s> some responsible authorities put it as low as per cent <e> <s> will he give the house an assurance that at divisional and indeed sub-divisional level there are always officers who are trained to take statements from complainants sympathetically and indeed that there should be women police officers if that should be the choice of the individual complainant <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness not agree that in the long term there is a very strong case for a deep concept of collective security in this realm in that any act of terrorism should be seen as an attack not just upon the victim country but upon all the law-abiding and peace-abiding countries of the world <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl agree that when the ill-fated bill was brought to this house in the last session of parliament the government gave the clear undertaking that it should conform with the ruling of the european court <e> <s> is the resolution of the government now any weaker than it was in the last session of parliament <e> <s> if it is not any weaker will the noble earl kindly give an assurance that a bill will be proposed to deal with this all-important matter in this session <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not agree that despite very high standards set by magistrates throughout the country as rightly mentioned by the noble baroness lady macleod the range of divergence in a sample of over petty sessional divisions from per cent <e> <s> of young males sent to custody at the lowest to per cent <e> <s> at the highest is such as to cause some disquiet <e> <s> has the home office applied its mind to the reasons why two localities roughly comparable in socio-economic terms should have such a wide divergence <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the house and the noble lord will forgive me if i do not follow him in the path that he had taken and in the arguments that he has articulated <e> <s> all i will say at this stage is that i personally regret very much that a person of his distinguished standing in the realm of local government should have chosen to make so fiercely partisan a speech on this subject <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e> <s> will he accept that in so far as part of that expenditure was spent on a campaign to seek to preserve the life of the glc and that indeed must have been the major part of it it does not place the glc in a situation any different from rutland county council the isle of wight county council and the county council of fife in the early s who did exactly the same thing <e>", "<cs> my lords this debate cuts completely through every party boundary <e> <s> the value the inestimable value of law centres has been long acknowledged not only by the labour party but by the alliance parties and indeed in a fairly recent publication by the society of conservative lawyers it was firmly enunciated that the establishment of law centres and the part which they play in the life of the community at large is something which accords completely with the conservative philosophy <e> <s> therefore there is no theological difference in terms of politics between anybody in relation to this matter <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness lady faithfull has done the committee a great service in pointing out that voluntary organisations are greatly jeopardised by the wording of clause <e> <s> the main reason for that lies in subsection of clause <e> <s> subsection reads <e>", "<cs> before the minister sits down i should be very grateful if he could deal with one matter which causes a great deal of worry to us on these benches <e> <s> it is purely a matter of legal interpretation and it is something which is part and parcel of amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> but since we have not yet come to amendment no <e> <s> is the minister saying that it is the view of the government that an attack upon a political party is not to be regarded as something which falls within the scope of the now amended clause <e> <s> if that is so then it may well be i cannot speak for my noble friend lord underhill that this amendment can be looked at in a different light for as the minister has said there will be occasions when what has to be attacked is not merely an idea but the body or organisation propagating that idea for example the national front <e>", "<cs> the general arguments in favour of this amendment have been put with great clarity by many noble lords including the mover of the amendment my noble friend lady david <e> <s> however there is one particular point which i would wish to raise which exercised my mind at second reading and which indeed i have already mentioned today in an intervention <e> <s> it turns on the word denigration in the amendment <e> <s> i think that that is a significant word because i believe that there still remains one massive matter in clause upon which the committee has still not had the advice of the government as to its exact meaning that is the meaning of the words in clause <e>", "<cs> the agenda or the reports that go with the agenda might be couched in such language that they comprised not agenda or reports but documents that were passed to the public and so the mischief of the bill would apply <e> <s> will the mischief of the bill apply to that kind of document or will such documents be saved by reason of the fact that they are agenda or reports <e>", "<cs> it is on that note on the part of the noble and learned lord lord denning that i from these benches should like to endorse what has <e>", "<cs> i totally accept that it was never the intention of her majestys government to issue this as a code <e> <s> if i gave that impression i withdraw it completely <e> <s> i am saying that this is if you like a students example of what a code should not be and an example of the danger of mixing the legislative provisions which are in clause with the provisions which are extra-legislative and intended to be in the code <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord kindly give way <e> <s> i think he must have misunderstood me and if so i am sure the fault is mine <e> <s> i was saying that clause is the regulation that is the legislative prohibition <e> <s> the code legislatively does not take the matter beyond that <e> <s> i was arguing that rather than having a non-legislative code why not do what widdicombe suggested which is to have self-regulation <e> <s> it is a different argument <e>", "<cs> it was <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i too may thank the noble lord lord benson for initiating this debate and congratulate him on the clarity and vigour with which he presented his case <e> <s> as the noble and learned lord lord rawlinson has said the noble lord lord benson has added very considerably to the debt which the legal profession already owes him <e>", "<cs> i am sure that no member of the committee would disagree in relation to criminal legislation about three fundamental precepts <e> <s> first one should never define a criminal prohibition wider than the circumstances properly demand secondly one should never define a criminal offence in such a way as to make thousands and thousands of persons criminals but in circumstances where the police have not the slightest hope of exercising a proper sanction against them and thirdly one should never define a criminal offence in such a way that it is flagrantly and blatantly inconsistent with other provisions either in the same statute or in similar legislation <e>", "<cs> i combine with my noble and learned friends and other noble lords in welcoming this provision <e> <s> we should be less than human were we not to chastise mildly the noble earl for introducing the provision in perhaps not the most obvious legislation <e> <s> i have been the victim of ministerial pronouncements from my own party and from the party opposite over the years here and in another place about raising a vehicular defence <e> <s> so that i am tempted to use the point against ministers <e> <s> this is a necessary measure <e> <s> i greatly welcome it but i want to raise one point <e>", "<cs> with great respect to the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter i think that on this occasion he misconstrues the meaning of the word discretion <e> <s> a local authority is basically a creature of statute <e> <s> it is there to carry out statutory obligations laid upon it by parliament <e> <s> the obligation with which we are concerned here is the obligation to house people who are in need <e> <s> parliament could of course have laid down detailed rules so that there would be iron-bound regularity as to what each local authority in england wales and scotland did <e> <s> it has not done that <e> <s> it has declared the general principle <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may deal with this one matter very briefly <e> <s> the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter has been the object of my admiration for a very long time <e> <s> he is a very experienced and skilled parliamentarian and a very brilliant debater <e> <s> but he knows as well as every other member of this committee that the argument he has put forward on this occasion is a specious one <e> <s> of course one cannot define a matter in such a way that it will have exactly the same meaning in thousands of different situations in every local authority in england scotland and wales <e> <s> but when parliament says that need has to be met full stop that does not mean that it is lawful to exclude persons between and <e> <s> if parliament had intended that to be the situation it would have said so <e>", "<cs> i am sure that every member of your lordships committee would accept that the contribution made by the party opposite in relation to defining and protecting the rights of council-house tenants is an honourable one and a substantial one <e> <s> i have no doubt that the schedule that was moved by amendment no <e> <s> last tuesday and i am sorry that i was not present on that occasion but i read the debate carefully has that general motive in mind <e>", "<cs> i am not aware that the words have been culled from any specific statute <e> <s> if it be that the noble lord opposite fails to identify their parentage i doubt whether any other member of the committee will be able to do so <e>", "<cs> i tender my humblest apologies to the committee for being unable to pick out at an instant the origin of the phrases used in the amendment <e> <s> in mitigation of my sin i am sure that the committee will accept from someone who normally practices in the criminal courts that one regards housing legislation as a frightening terror incognito <e> <s> i would however ask the government to accept that a position of considerable danger has been created by the decision in the <e>", "<cs> i invite the committee to accept the arguments of the noble lord <e> <s> i believe that they are utterly unanswerable <e> <s> i am sure that it was never the intention of her majestys government that there should be any catching of a phrase or a sentence or even a speech in a play without looking at the play as a whole <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl replies perhaps i may urge him as a person who is a monument of good sense and patience to consider two arguments one which has already been put forward with some force by the noble lord lord hutchinson and by my noble friend lord mishcon <e> <s> a play is a comprehensive totality in a way in which the situations under clauses and are not <e> <s> secondly if the clause remains in its present form the result in law as i apprehend it will be that under the theatres act section which deals with an obscene publication will enjoin a court to look at the <e>", "<cs> if the noble earl the minister is really concerned as i suspect he is with situations of ad libbing i venture to suggest to him that where one has to choose between two evils that is between an innocent director innocent in the sense that he has no knowledge that the words are going to be used or the other evil that substantial racial hatred would be engendered and i prefer that word to the term stirring up i should have thought the lesser evil would be to make the director responsible <e> <s> but of course in such a situation any court would regard that as a massively substantial factor in mitigation <e> <s> i am not sure whether that is what the minister had in mind but if he had a different situation in mind i should be very grateful if he would spell out to us exactly what he had in mind <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will give way on that matter before he moves to the next point perhaps i may say that surely the protection in practice for a director in that situation is in clause one which of course requires the consent of the attorney-general before a prosecution can be embarked upon <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge as always puts his arguments in a most attractive and forceful way <e> <s> while i have every sympathy with his general proposition that sentences should be kept to the minimum that is necessary i do not think it follows in any way that that should affect the maximum term for a specific offence <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord broxbourne is a person of immense distinction in this and other fields and brings the great weight of his massive experience in this connection to bear on two matters upon which he has advised the house <e> <s> the advice that the noble lord gives concerns first sub-paragraph which reads <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much hope that the minister will give the matter further consideration <e> <s> the amendment is put forward very much in the light of the governments anticipated decision in relation to paragraph which means that even if the local authority has broken all the rules stipulated it does not affect the validity of the transfer to the purchaser of that particular estate <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we on this side of the house appreciate totally the ministers obvious sincerity with regard to this matter <e> <s> we also accept that there may well be difficulties with the form of words set out in the amendment <e> <s> before the house agrees completely with what the minister says it is right that the house should remind itself of the words which exist in ground of schedule to the housing act <e> <s> as the house will remember that is the schedule which sets out the eight deadly sins which a tenant can commit and thus make himself liable to lose his secure tenancy <e> <s> ground reads as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house may i deal with one point which is whether the amendment is contrary in any way to what is contained in ground <e> <s> i am sure that my noble friends can deal with the wider question of whether there has been consultation with the bodies involved <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that is so <e> <s> the person who stands to lose his tenancy under schedule must of course be the secure tenant <e> <s> as i understand it that is the position under the amendment in other words the only person who may transgress both under the amendment and under ground is the tenant <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may follow the sentiments expressed so lucidly and powerfully by the noble viscount lord colville of culross <e> <s> this matter touches upon a number of most delicate and fundamental legal issues <e> <s> i agree with the noble viscount that this matter should be studied deeply and carefully by the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor and by the law officers before the government come to a final decision <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> that too was my understanding and i believe the position to be that that avenue is totally exhausted but i have seen a document today which referred to an extant petition to this house <e> <s> it is out of an abundance of caution in case in some way or another that appeal has been revived that i mention it <e> <s> however if i am wrong and that avenue has been exhausted all the other arguments remain about looking at the situation in the light now of the decision of the court of appeal <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord replies to the noble viscount lord colville of culross perhaps i may put this point to him <e> <s> his argument is that this is a loophole founded upon a mistake <e> <s> i am sure that he has read carefully the debates both in another place and in this house in <e> <s> i should like to ask him courteously whether there is any passage in that debate to which he cares to point to suggest that parliament had an intention different from the conclusion to which the court of appeal came in the <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord lord denning with his usual force and charm exhorts the house to disregard the fact that the civic government scotland act happens to create appellate systems north of the tweed <e> <s> he suggests and of course he is totally correct in this that there are quirks of scottish law which lend charm and enchantment to that system but which need not necessarily be followed in the law of england and wales <e> <s> but with the greatest respect and i have the profoundest respect for the noble and learned lord as have all members of this house this is not the sort of situation which has developed from the mists of scottish antiquity going back to the middle ages something evolving out of scottish land tenure or such like <e> <s> it is an issue of human rights <e> <s> the right to involve oneself in a procession under section and the right to assemble publicly under clause are important fundamental human rights <e> <s> they are no more and no less important whether one is north or south of the tweed <e>", "<cs> my lords i join other noble lords in making one last appeal to the minister to reconsider his position <e> <s> as the noble lord lord hutchinson of lullington said it is a matter of crime prevention <e> <s> local authorities have had imposed upon them for about years the obligation of removing or abating nuisances in certain circumstances <e> <s> the amendment is therefore well within that well-established tradition <e>", "<cs> my lords i venture to suggest that for once the noble lord lord hutchinson <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure we are grateful to the noble lord the minister for the assurances that he has given yet again in this connection <e> <s> what intrigues a number of us on this side of the house is exactly what is meant by the survey into the question of any change of policy on the part of local authorities in this connection <e> <s> with great respect it is not really a change of policy <e> <s> the question really is the difference between the interpretation which local authorities placed upon the wording of the housing homeless persons act previous to the <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like first to deal with the remarks of the noble lord lord coleraine <e> <s> i argued on the last occasion that this was no loophole in the sense that parliament had misconceived the position completely and had passed legislation to an effect wholly different from what it had intended <e> <s> with the greatest respect to the noble lord who has put his case with great fairness and with his usual charm i still hold to that view <e> <s> indeed with great respect that was the attitude of the learned lord justice fox and the other judges in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept totally that whenever parliament changes a law there are going to be people who are disappointed <e> <s> there are people who will say that the dividing line has been drawn <e> <s> one cannot pass an act of parliament without there being a dividing line <e> <s> there will be some people who are inches this side of the line and others who will have the good fortune to be inches away from it <e> <s> but the difference between the situation put by the noble lord and the situation with which i am dealing is this <e> <s> when the leasehold reform act and the act of were being considered there was ample publicity in respect of the intention of parliament to change the law <e> <s> i do not believe that any freeholder in the united kingdom could not have known what was likely to happen <e> <s> i do not cavil for a moment at the great publicity that was properly given to the anticipated decision of parliament in that connection <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord before he sits down finally will kindly give way <e> <s> if he is correct in his contention that to change property rights whether created or years ago is wrong and therefore retrospective it would mean would it not <e> <s> that we should still be stuck with the statute of mortmain <e> <s> none of the legislation would have been passed and the dead hand of previous centuries would still be upon our land <e> <s> that surely is a proposition which even for a debater as skilful and brilliant as the noble lord is an impossibility <e>"]
