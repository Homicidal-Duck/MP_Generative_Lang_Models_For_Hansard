["<cs> my lords it is a real pleasure for me to congratulate the noble lord lord flowers on a truly distinguished and model maiden speech drawing on depths of learning and expertise but putting that to the service of the house in a brief and non-contro-versial manner <e> <s> if i may say so without impertinence i hope that he will often come to our debates and show that he <e>", "<cs> my lords i hate to interrupt my noble friend but surely he would agree that there are many subjects not specifically mentioned in the treaty on which any proposal of the commission may have an influence in one way or the other <e> <s> if every subject which impinged upon an activity of the community had to be listed in the treaty that he reads every night it would be as long as the combined telephone directories of the united kingdom and the rest of the community <e> <s> surely the point that he must take on board is whether his remarks mean that the community cannot take account of the effects on other spheres of what it is legally entitled to do under the treaty <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that so many of your lordships have come to hear about the bill of rights and i welcome the interest which this house continues to take in this important subject <e> <s> may we now return from rhodesia to strasbourg <e> <s> i returned from strasbourg leaving at oclock this morning in order to take part in this debate so i hope your lordships will excuse some of the incoherence of my remarks <e> <s> i should like to sympathise very much with the noble baroness lady gaitskell <e> <s> i too came with various proposed speeches all of which i have now abandoned because the deeper principles which those of us on the committee who agreed that this bill should be incorporated into domestic british law share have all been dealt with in particular in two remarkable speeches by the noble lord <e> <s> lord redcliffe-maud and the noble and learned lord lord scarman <e>", "<cs> my lords i followed the noble lords analysis and i agree with his conclusion <e> <s> may i ask about one step in the logic <e> <s> is the case that he is putting forward dependent upon the british refund being in this years budget or in next years budget <e> <s> my understanding is that because the budgetry years of the united kingdom and the eec differ it is most likely to be in next years <e>", "<cs> my lords when i was elected to the european parliament i had to learn quickly and with humility how to cope with the wide variety of more intimidating and less intimidating public and private meetings which an elected representative is called upon to carry out <e> <s> it has been a very valuable part of my education <e> <s> very soon after i was elected i was asked to speak at a school for exchange students between different countries <e> <s> after making a short address and dealing with questions i talked to some of the pupils who had not made a comment during the meeting itself <e> <s> a -year-old girl came up to me and said i am from poland <e> <s> why was the turn-out in the european elections so low <e> <s> it was a humbling moment first of all that in devon there should be a girl from poland learning english who spoke beautiful english <e> <s> secondly that she as a pole knew more about the european elections and the european community than any other child or adult at that meeting <e>", "<cs> my lords i have great faith in the powers of the british government to exercise persuasion over all the other governments and i have even greater faith in my noble friend the foreign secretary <e> <s> what i am really doing is taking this as an example that we must translate aspirations into effective action because while greater efficiency in the machinery of political co-operation which has the merit of being outside the treaty as my noble friend said and therefore easier to implement has merits which are self-evident to anyone who wants to see a concerted and effective foreign policy for the west as a whole nevertheless it is policies within the community which are going to secure prosperity and make the community more acceptable to the individual citizens in each member state <e> <s> co-ordinated foreign policy is fine as a contribution towards world peace and co-ordinated action on afghanistan rather better co-ordinated i suspect my noble friend lord bethell and i would wish to see certainly <e> <s> but what we need to see is an extension of some of the things that commissioner davignan has been doing a community policy for textile industries that are in depression and a community policy for steel industries that are in recession because just as th century liberal economic policies are no longer fully suitable for a complex modern state so the original liberal economic policies dreamed up when the community was founded in are no longer fully applicable in in the throes of a world recession <e> <s> the community can and does evolve <e> <s> the basis of its economic theory ought to develop as the world challenge develops and in order to deal with the threat from japan and newly industrialised countries we must evolve community strategies and community policies to increase employment and maintain prosperity <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has been very kind to me and i shall try to return that in good measure <e> <s> i do not quite follow though why he blames <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt but the noble lord made some very strong declarations <e> <s> may i put this in the form of a question to him <e> <s> does the noble and learned lord wish to speak <e>", "<cs> my lords it is late <e> <s> scotland and selkirk call <e> <s> however thanks are due not only to those noble lords who have spoken i should thank in particular those who have been kind enough to say agreeable things about the fact that have brought this motion before your lordships house but also to those who have listened particularly those from my constituency in devon <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to hear the noble lord is still sufficiently mentally alert to come back with that devastating piece of repartee and i congratulate him on it <e> <s> what the noble lord said was only minus <e> <s> he had nothing to put in place of the european community <e> <s> he had no alternative future for britain or for our citizens who depend on the trade we get from our membership of the community <e> <s> i thank noble lords for joining in todays debate <e> <s> i am sorry to have spoken so long <e> <s> i am going back to brussels tomorrow morning and my wits are getting very stirred <e> <s> i thank noble lords for listening to me <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the motion <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the minister aware that he is concealing the likely truth from the house not i am sure on purpose and is the minister aware as he must be that it is most unlikely that the european parliament will come to a view on the whole range of these matters with any degree of unanimity before the next european elections <e> <s> is it not therefore the case that in denying them the right to vote in european elections her majestys government are condemning british citizens not merely to an anomaly but to an injustice <e>", "<cs> my lords i too would like to thank the government in the person of my noble and <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that even the national executive committee of the labour party in their latest document about the consequences of withdrawal in the agricultural sector recognise that considerable unemployment would arise in agriculture and that our own exports of agricultural commodities which are now a great success within the community would be diminished <e> <s> would my noble friend therefore consider lending a copy of this document to the noble lord lord bruce of donington to assist in a more calm discussion of this subject <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank all noble lords who have taken part in this debate and particularly my noble friend lord cockfield who was kind enough to describe me as thoughtful <e> <s> when i was at university a person who was described as thoughtful was said to have some pretentions to intelligence but to be fundamentally wrong <e> <s> i am sure he will take it kindly from me when i say that i deeply admire the eloquent and elegant way in which he evaded many of the most important questions in dealing with the subject under debate tonight <e> <s> many of us will forgive him because of the position he is in and because of the time of year and the approaching budget <e> <s> we will forgive him today but not forever <e> <s> i thank your lordships very much <e> <s> my lords i beg leave to withdraw my motion <e>", "<cs> my lords before we turned to uncensored films the house was discussing the question of unemployment <e> <s> whatever else is uncertain there is no doubt that were this country to leave the european community the prospects of decreasing unemployment would move over the horizon and the chances of the to million jobs which depend directly on our membership of the community continuing would be in jeopardy <e> <s> thus while much of this interesting discussion tonight centres round the nature of our national interest and the way in which it can be protected within the community there is no question but that it is a major british interest to remain in the european community <e> <s> what the house is debating tonight is how that interest is best to be defined how it is to be protected and how the overall interest of the community itself is to be encompassed and developed at the same time <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend has no more to say on the nature of the statistics as opposed to the area which they cover may i ask him whether i am to understand that his argument rests solely on the view that her majestys government should retain control within the united kingdom as to which regions are to be given aid <e> <s> does my noble friend consider the statistics method for assessing regional deprivation is good and that we need to retain the right to choose <e>", "<cs> my lords i have flown from rome today to take part in this debate and my noble friend the chief whip has rewarded me by putting me eighteenth in the batting order <e> <s> of course it is not his fault i blame it entirely on the new deputy chief whip <e> <s> i have shredded most of my more general observations but there is one topic on which i wish to dwell before remarking more specifically on some of the proposals included and some of those not included in the gracious speech that is the topic to which the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones and the noble lord lord mishcon devoted a considerable part of their remarks namely youth unemployment <e>", "<cs> my lords is that all that my noble friend has to say on the topic <e> <s> he has not answered the point which i made <e> <s> there will be no uniform electoral procedure for elections to the european parliament before the next european elections <e> <s> in those circumstances are her majestys government still willing to disfranchise british citizens living in other member states of the community <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend agree that the exchange of statistics across the chamber on this matter is extremely difficult for everyone in the house to follow with precision <e> <s> notwithstanding what my noble friend lord vaizey said will the minister use his best endeavours to ensure that the house has an opportunity to debate these matters more fully in depth rather than at question time by means of question and answer so that we can have an authoritative statement on the governments position on unemployment benefit in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord compare those figures with the normal voting figures on devon county council taking into account the fact that the alliance have recently become the majority party <e> <s> will he compare the figures he has just given with the normal voting pattern on devon county council <e> <s> otherwise he may have given a misleading impression to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords is it in order for the noble lord to attack a member of another place who is seriously ill at the moment and not able to answer <e>", "<cs> my lords the honourable member was not present in that debate because he was then seriously ill as he is now <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that all members of your lordships house who intend to vote against the bill put forward by the government have travelled along the proposed southern route <e> <s> this bill provides the best answer to an impossible question how to organise a bypass round okehampton <e> <s> i respect the sincerity of all those who think or as it seems to them know that the southern route is wrong <e> <s> in particular i pay the greatest possible attention to the procedural and constitutional or quasi-constitutional points put forward by the noble lord lord henderson of brompton <e> <s> these must be examined so that the ghastly mess which we are discussing tonight never happens again <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend has not yet fully answered a question put earlier will he now reaffirm her majestys governments commitment to the european convention on human rights and say whether in fulfilling that commitment it would not be simpler if we incorporated the european convention into british domestic law so that these embarrassing cases arose at home and not abroad and were decided by british judges and not by judges elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend not agree that the figures in brussels show that this country is creating jobs at a faster rate than any other member state of the european community <e>", "<cs> is the noble lord saying that he wishes to repeal the european communities act and that this country should immediately leave the european community <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the noble lord <e> <s> lord stoddart in one comment which he has made <e> <s> of course this house while the country does not have a written constitution or an elected upper chamber is the place which should discuss all matters which affect its constitution <e> <s> i think we owe a debt to the noble lord lord bruce and to his colleagues for putting down these amendments which provide us with an opportunity to discuss what is by any standards an important constitutional step for the country and the community <e> <s> i would certainly not add my voice to those which are alleged to have been raised in calling for these amendments to be struck from the record <e> <s> they provide an opportunity for us to see at first hand the shallow and shabby nature of the case which the noble lord lord stoddart has just advanced <e>", "<cs> i shall not be tempted down all the highways and byways to which that intervention might lead me <e> <s> i shall say to the noble lord only that my experience of british ministers representing governments of the party of which i am a member is that they consult very fully with their colleagues and members on their side of the house before going into negotiations in the council of ministers for the simple reason that they need to maintain a majority to defend the decisions they take in council when they return to the house <e> <s> perhaps under the administration of the noble lords party things did not proceed in that manner <e> <s> however in the danish <e>", "<cs> i can intervene only once on this point and it is a central point <e> <s> the noble lord is not addressing himself to the intervention made by my noble friend lady elles <e> <s> the noble lord discounts the possibility that those aspects of democratic control which were inevitably removed from the purview of national parliaments at the time of the formation of the community or the adhesion of new members have therefore gone into orbit and are now to some extent outside the total control of national parliaments <e> <s> if that is to be the case is it not better that the democratic deficit be remedied by the european parliament assuming those aspects of parliamentary control which have already been lost by national parliaments and would if not taken up by the european parliament be permanently lost to the people of the community <e> <s> will he address himself to that point <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mccarthy began by complaining about the brevity of the ministers speech <e> <s> however he proceeded to remedy that defect by speaking for a long time himself <e> <s> he then went on to say that he was surprised that the minister here agreed with the secretary of state in another place and that they had said the same thing <e> <s> i do not think the minister here would last very long if he said a different thing <e>", "<cs> my lords for a long time i subscribed to the idea of incorporating the european convention on human rights into british domestic law <e> <s> i was a member of the select committee here in when all the conservative members voted in favour of that proposal and all the labour members voted against it <e> <s> therefore i maintain my position <e> <s> i welcome the recent conversion of the labour party to having a small version of the european convention on human rights incorporated into british law <e> <s> i wish they would go the whole way <e> <s> i am not talking about human rights in the sense of fundamental liberties but of the role of the state or of the european community in employment issues more generally <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted that the noble lord has confirmed that the real reason for the labour partys change of views on the closed shop has nothing whatever to do with the social charter <e> <s> they wanted to do so anyway and the social charter issue was an alibi
