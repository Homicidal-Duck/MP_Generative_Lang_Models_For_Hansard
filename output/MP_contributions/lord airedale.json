["<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged but is not fifty years rather a long delay for bringing into force an act of parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that this motion should not be agreed to without it being pointed out that the members of the joint committee from this house were appointed on th june and that would have enabled the usual weekly meetings of this busy joint committee to have taken place both last week and this week <e> <s> but as it is the first meeting of the joint committee cannot take place as the noble lord the leader of the house has said until next tuesday <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the noise certification order it is not so much the second report of the joint committee in this session which is of interest but rather the fifteenth report of the joint committee in the last session because at that time the order which came before the joint committee was merely an enabling order which only said that the authority may issue a noise certificate even although the applicant has fulfilled all the requirements <e> <s> it seemed to the joint committee that it was impossible to envisage circumstances in which the applicant had fulfilled all the requirements demanded of him and yet the authority would still be justified in withholding a certificate <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble lord but is not this rather cold comfort for the people who live in these houses <e> <s> if a householder is prepared to pay very much more out of his own resources towards for instance double glazing in the living room provided he can have a grant to start him off is that not very well spent <e>", "<cs> my lords if the argument being relied on is that not all the grants available are being taken up for loft insulation may i ask the noble lord if this is not an argument in favour of widening the scheme slightly so as to enable other people to have other forms of approved insulation grant-aided <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin as the noble lord lord kings norton began with the need for conciseness saving of course the attractive double emphasis of archbishop cranmer <e> <s> the way i had stated this in my notes was abbreviate whenever you possibly can only yesterday i was reading an article about our liability for defective products which is pertinent to one of our debates next week which begins <e>", "<cs> my lords we are indeed grateful to the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale for having introduced us to this interesting difficult technical and thorny subject which i imagine will give rise to a very interesting debate <e> <s> we are also grateful to him for the attractive manner in which he introduced the topic <e> <s> i suppose that at first sight at any rate the concept of strict liability of the producer of a defective product is an attractive proposition <e> <s> probably the sort of picture one has in mind when this topic arises is for example an explosion of the gas main underneath the pavement as a result of which someone is injured or a defective car manufactured by an international corporation which crashes and injures or kills the driver or passengers <e> <s> the thought goes through ones mind these producers can afford to compensate those unfortunate victims without even noticing the financial burden on them of doing so <e> <s> but how far down the scale does one go <e> <s> at the other end of the scale one may have the village smallholder who sells a christmas turkey to the stockbroker who lives in the manor house the smallholder has taken all reasonable precautions known to him but unknown to him the turkey contains injurious bacteria and the stockbroker and his family suffer food poisoning in consequence <e> <s> in that case it is less obviously just that the smallholder should be strictly liable to compensate the stockbroker and his family <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to trouble the noble lord on such a busy afternoon with two rather small general points <e> <s> however i gave him notice that i wished to raise them and he may possibly have prepared answers <e> <s> therefore it may be that he would be more angry if i did not raise them than if i do so <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say that i am not asking that the stationery office should stock british standards <e> <s> i am only asking that it should stock those which are specifically referred to by statutory instruments since a statutory instrument is not really complete without the british standard to which it refers <e>", "<cs> i have one very small point <e> <s> the noble lord lord renton mentioned interpreters <e> <s> i should have thought that the tape recorder was of double value in the case of interpreters because interpreters misunderstand and sometimes get it wrong and if the suspect says i am afraid the interpreter got it wrong or did not understand the whole thing will be down on the tape and it can be checked <e>", "<cs> my lords should not the government at least urge the parties to a dispute to come together and themselves issue an agreed prepared statement on the dispute <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that what is required as a result of this discussion is that subsection which for some reason creates a defence only for the holder of the licence should also be a defence in the case of the employee because the words at the end of subsection are very much the words which the minister used when he said that if the employee did that then he would not be liable <e> <s> so why not make subsection apply to the employee as well <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to take this occasion to mention briefly that i think we have here an instance of a defect in our own procedures <e> <s> not by any means is this a unique instance but it is an instance <e> <s> at the conclusion of his magnificent speech if i may be permitted so to refer to it the noble lord lord mishcon referred to the report of the joint committee on statutory instruments <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged for that answer <e> <s> is it the case that cigarette smoking is on the increase among women <e> <s> if so is the campaign such as it is being directed particularly towards women <e>", "<cs> my lords if it is the case as i think the noble lord is saying that those who do smoke are smoking more is it a fact that although they are smoking cigarettes of a lower tar yield they are smoking more of them in order to get back to their accustomed daily intake of nicotine <e> <s> if that is so is anything being achieved by the lower tar yield <e>", "<cs> if i may pour a little oil on troubled waters although the storm seems to have subsided somewhat i have great sympathy with the object of the amendment but i noticed that the minister in standing committee in the other place did not favour an amendment of this kind <e> <s> i think what went through her mind was that a code of practice was <e>", "<cs> as we have now reached the last clause under the heading of control of anti-competitive practices i should like briefly to mention to your lordships an example of what i believe to be a practice which this bill is about <e> <s> the electricity boards send out quarterly bills to their customers and between them they have access to just about every household in the united kingdom <e> <s> i have no doubt they assess their bills at a figure which passes on the cost of postage to the consumer <e> <s> some boards take the opportunity to enclose with their bills leaflets advertising the electrical appliances which they have for sale <e> <s> they go further <e> <s> i have in my hand a typical electricity bill and at the foot of it is written in capital letters <e>", "<cs> i am always deeply depressed by being told that something which we all agree is nonsense must be perpetuated because this mistake was made in the past therefore it must go on being perpetuated forever <e> <s> perhaps the answer to the ministers problem is to be found in his amendment no <e> <s> which we have not yet dealt with <e>", "<cs> of course i will respond to that generous offer by the minister <e> <s> i feel sure that he will be able to accommodate me seeing that his amendment no <e> <s> is an amendment to a definition in the act <e> <s> but for the present i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment <e> <s> it seems to me to be fairly clear that people making complaints about prices will complain to the director because the director will be the person who holds the investigation if there is to be one <e> <s> so in practice the director will receive the complaint look at it and decide whether an investigation is desirable <e> <s> he will then write to the secretary of state and say i think this investigation is desirable <e> <s> would you care to direct me to make one because i cannot make one under the act as it now stands unless you direct me to do so <e> <s> the secretary of state having faith in his director general of fair trading will almost automatically say yes if you having looked at it think an investigation should be made you go ahead and make one and i formally direct you to do so <e>", "<cs> i have the greatest respect for the minister but i am really sorry to hear him speak as he has just been speaking <e> <s> we had a debate on codes of practice <e> <s> i mentioned for the benefit of noble lords that it so happened that i had an amendment down to a much later clause which was an alternative solution to the problem facing the noble lord lord jacques but i carefully did not use that occasion to develop any argument at all regarding this amendment we are now discussing <e> <s> neither government spokesman answering the noble lord lord jacques referred at all to this amendment <e> <s> not one word do i remember being addressed to this amendment on that occasion <e> <s> it is not good enough to say that this matter has been fully discussed <e> <s> it has not <e>", "<cs> then we shall have to take time with me explaining to the noble lord what he did not gather from the speech of my noble friend lady seear who just now was at great pains to point out that a code of practice was something which was probably comprehensive but an <e>", "<cs> in a moment but i am going to finish the sentence <e>", "<cs> very well i do not think we have seen the last of this one <e> <s> we shall be coming back to this on report <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very pleased that the noble lord lord trevethin and oaksey has so eloquently emphasised the credit side of this matter we are discussing because of course when there is a pretty serious debit side it is only right that the other half of the picture should be eloquently presented and the noble lord has done that so well <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the noble duke really understood what i was saying <e> <s> i was talking about lack of vigilance <e> <s> there is no question at all of the tote board itself having any knowledge of dishonest practices just as there is no question of the food canners board of directors having any dishonest knowledge at all <e> <s> i am talking about lack of vigilance <e> <s> i am saying that if the food canner in the private enterprise sector is to be prosecuted for lack of vigilance in a case like that what is to be done with the totalisator board <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord harris of greenwich briefly referred to me perhaps he would answer a question <e> <s> he asks why the commotion continues <e> <s> has he studied the decision of the house of lords in <e>", "<cs> my lords as in committee i just point out for the convenience of the house that i have tabled amendment no <e> <s> to clause as being an alternative route to achieving the same objective as the noble lord lord jacques is now seeking to achieve <e> <s> i think it would be better if we were to discuss amendment no <e> <s> not now but when we come to it <e> <s> i only say this now because i hope that on this occasion i shall not be told as i was in committee when i moved my similar amendment that the whole thing had been discussed on this amendment <e> <s> i hope we shall have a separate discussion on amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i am only too willing to take whatever course the house thinks best and if the minister would like to discuss my amendment at the same time and if we may treat what he has just said as an interruption so that i can continue speaking i will outline my case on amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> from time to time it must happen to all of us that we hear of a complaint against someone and at first sight it looks a very serious complaint <e> <s> but we learn by experience not to decide flatters without hearing both sides of the case <e> <s> sometimes when we hear the version of the person complained against we emerge with a very different picture of the seriousness of the matter complained about <e> <s> what happens to all of us from time to time is also likely to happen to the director from time to time <e> <s> it might be rather unwise for the director ever to launch out into an investigation without giving the person complained about on opportunity to make representations <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord wallace of coslany has made an important point <e> <s> if it is the case as the noble lord says it is that in some other act with rather similar objectives it is written in that the director shall receive representations and if that is left out of this bill distinctions will be drawn and it will be said that if parliament had intended the director under this measure to receive representations parliament would have said so in the same way that parliament said so in the other act <e> <s> it is important to have consistency to prevent lawyers from finding discre <e>", "<cs> my lords i was taking up a point which the noble lord lord wallace of coslany made when he said that in some other act did he say the fair trading act <e> <s> these words were included <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the noble lord for that reply my lords <e> <s> i should have thought that a variation or revocation of a direction was itself a direction <e> <s> but the noble lord said other things which i shall have to read in <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister is quite right he has not convinced me at all <e> <s> it could do no possible harm to insert this signpost <e> <s> but i have always made an undertaking with myself that i will not divide the house on a purely drafting matter so i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is one out <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the minister for having taken a great deal of trouble over this <e> <s> i shall have great pleasure in studying in <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble lord but was not that circumstance known to parliament in <e> <s> what is the advantage of retaining easter as a movable feast which was not apparent to parliament in <e>", "<cs> has there not been time already for consultation with the industry with a view to putting the time limit in the bill <e> <s> the disadvantage of doing it by ministerial regulation is that parliament can only either agree to the regulation or else throw it out and require the government to come forward again with some other regulation giving some other time limit and the matter cannot be freely debated in parliament whereas if these important matters are put not in regulations but in the bill then in committee stage in both houses of parliament the matter can be properly debated <e> <s> a time limit can be arrived at of which parliament approves <e>", "<cs> my lords can we be assured that the sweeping economies which the bbc is having to pursue such as the disbanding of orchestras are in no way due to any financial strain on the bbc resulting from having to maintain their external services <e>", "<cs> i have a small drafting point to make <e> <s> it will take only a moment <e> <s> subsection says <e>", "<cs> clause is about annual reports to parliament <e> <s> in both of his speeches the noble earl made appeals to the minister for more comprehensive and fuller annual preports because the noble earl said that it was difficult to gain much valuable information from the annual reports which are now being submitted <e> <s> i feel that it would be very much in the interests of the home office itself to prepare more comprehensive and informative annual reports <e> <s> if annual reports are not informative suspicion will be aroused in the public mind that perhaps they are not more informative because there is something to hide <e> <s> i do not suppose that there is anything to hide <e> <s> in that case let us have these more comprehensive and understandable annual reports <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord foot has been trying very hard to get in a supplementary question <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged <e> <s> however if the bank of england were empowered to refuse to take back untidy banknotes upon which cashiers had been doing their sums would this not very quickly put an end to this untidy habit <e>", "<cs> this clause is the last clause in chapter of part i it is curious that whereas chapter of part i and the rest of this bill and most of most bills have cross-headings above groups of sections we find that chapter goes all the way through from the beginning of clause to the end of clause without a single italicised sub-heading <e> <s> i know that italicised sub-headings are not part of the bill but they are very helpful and i should have thought that the draftsmen might have been able to assist readers by setting out these first clauses in the customary way with some italicised cross-headings <e>", "<cs> does the minister not agree that in the way that the clause is drafted it is almost an invitation to the court to allow alteration <e> <s> because it is phrased in the affirmative <e>", "<cs> while the minister is in this receptive mood may i suggest to him that if he wants to rely upon that <e>", "<cs> the minister has been rather severely criticising two of my noble friends amendments without my noble friend i shall not say without his having had a chance to move them but without his having in fact moved them <e> <s> it may very well have been convenient for these three amendments to be discussed together but if that is going to be done i think one ought at the outset to have an agreement that the three shall be moved together so that the noble lord w ho is moving them has at least an opportunity to point out the merits of his amendments before the government have a chance to come in with such rather strong criticisms <e>", "<cs> yes but the whole purpose of moving amendments is surely that people have a chance to demonstrate their merits before the opposition or the government as the case may be have their chance to point out the demerits <e>", "<cs> my lords as one who instinctively leans against monopolies i very much welcome almost the last words in the statement that the letter monopoly is a privilege which the post office needs continually to justify through the quality of the service it provides <e>", "<cs> my lords can we be assured that the fair competition between the public and the private sector will also extend to advertising practices <e> <s> because bt will be in the position that the electricity boards are in at present namely of sending out bills four times a year to all their subscribers <e> <s> there will be temptation to yield to what some of the electricity boards are doing now that is to include leaflets with their bills advertising equipment which they have for sale <e> <s> that is very unfair competition because at present postage rates it would cost the private sector a fortune to indulge in direct mail advertising on this scale <e> <s> i hope that this point will be borne in mind when the proposed bill is prepared <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not highly desirable that the people of this country should be able to continue to remind themselves by switching on their radio as they can now that the bbc on their behalf is doing this wonderful service to the world by broadcasting the truth about what is happening in this troubled world <e>", "<cs> my lords is it known whether when the unions poured cold water on this scheme they were bearing in mind that a very large number of christmas cards are sold on behalf of charities who rely upon christmas cards for a very considerable proportion of their income <e>", "<cs> i doubt whether this is going to be strictly true <e> <s> i believe that a depression is going to be associated so closely with a hump that as the member for the isle of ely said in standing committee in another place why not use the material out of the depression with which to construct the hump alongside <e> <s> i join with my noble friend in supporting the amendment <e> <s> i join with him both in his general observations and in particular with regard to the depressions <e> <s> as for the general point i am quite certain that the minister never wanted to be put into the unenviable position of saying to this house if you dare to amend the bill it will be lost <e> <s> that is a message which this house hates to hear <e>", "<cs> i readily appreciate that there might be differences according to different circumstances but i should have thought that one could arrive at a minimum distance and say that in no case would it be reasonable to have a sign less than a minimum distance before the hazard that the sign was warning about <e> <s> however that may be i do not propose to press the amendment <e> <s> while we are discussing signs perhaps i could be told at some stage whether there is an international sign for road humps and if so <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord underhill has said that there are many factors that need to be taken into consideration and indeed there are <e> <s> if we fail to incorporate into the bill something like the amendment we shall be in danger that parliament will be using the ministerial regulations as a comfortable cushion on which to sit back <e> <s> it will be saying let us not concern ourselves with these tiresome factors <e> <s> leave it all to the minister to make the regulations <e> <s> he will be sensible <e> <s> he will understand <e> <s> he will produce sensible regulations <e>", "<cs> the amendment appears to envisage the possibility of a road hump being used on a road where not even a speed limit is imposed which brings us back to the example given by the noble lord lord monson of a narrow country road used by ponies on which vehicles were travelling much too fast and not even a speed limit was imposed <e> <s> the noble lord perhaps naturally thought that that might be a suitable case for a road hump <e> <s> i suggest we need an assurance whether we can have it now from the minister i do not know that in no case where the highway authority has either attempted to get permission for a speed limit and has failed or has not even gone to the length of putting up a speed limit <e>", "<cs> i agree absolutely but i am saying that the motorist must be given a chance to obey a speed limit before being confronted with a road hump <e> <s> the first thing for the highway authority to do before contemplating erecting a road hump is to get a speed limit sign put up <e>", "<cs> may i at some time have an answer to my question is it contemplated ever to have a road hump on a stretch of road that has no speed restriction <e>", "<cs> i can say to the noble earl that i am advised by learned counsel that the wording of my amendment is just as much standard form as the words in the bill <e> <s> there is more than one standard form for these things <e> <s> from the speech of the noble earl i feel quite sure that if we were in normal times this amendment would be accepted but because of the oddities of our procedures i have to accept his assurance and i do so <e> <s> it is always better to have it in the bill but things being as they are i have to accept the noble earls assurance and i do <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged for that reply so far as it goes <e> <s> but as the advertising of cigarettes is under a partial ban does it not follow that such advertising as is permitted ought to show a good deal more restraint than is the case in this example <e>", "<cs> my lords leaving aside the question of which noble earl is the pilot and which the navigator i really am too old a hand to be scared by being told that my amendment is defective in its drafting <e> <s> i am sure that over the last years the vast majority of the amendments that i have moved in your lordships house have been defective in their drafting <e> <s> of course that can be an advantage because it is quite clear that all that needs to be done with this amendment in order to cure the defect is to insert the words miles an hour <e> <s> therefore on third reading on friday i shall be able to come back with the amended amendment with the benefit of knowing what your lordships think about the merits of this amendment <e> <s> i shall hope to take advantage of that opportunity on friday <e>", "<cs> my lords what i am saying is how does the noble earl know <e> <s> the experiments have been conducted within mile an hour limit areas and nowhere else <e> <s> the department does not know what would be the effect of road humps outside those areas <e> <s> that is why i am saying that in this bill the road humps should be confined within the mile an hour speed limit areas <e> <s> if the department decided eventually to try to move outside those speed limit areas they could perfectly well come before parliament with another quite short bill to enable them to do this <e> <s> it would be highly controversial and the government know that it would be highly controversial and they probably would not get away with it <e> <s> so they do not want to do that they want to get it into this bill <e> <s> and i am suggesting as calmly as i can that this is really quite wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords may we hear from the minister <e> <s> because before the noble earl replies to his motion i should like to say something but i thought that perhaps the minister was going to intervene <e> <s> if the minister is not going to intervene may i say that something has happened here that is almost beyond my comprehension <e> <s> i would not dare to change the business of the house of lords without consulting the people and the noble lords whom i knew to be deeply concerned in the business <e> <s> i have spoken to most of the noble lords who have taken part in the earlier stages of this bill and have not found anybody who was consulted about moving the third reading from last friday until today <e> <s> was nobody consulted <e> <s> was the minister consulted <e> <s> perhaps we shall be told <e> <s> i simply would not expect to <e>", "<cs> my lords this bill did not arrive here late <e> <s> we had the second reading in july <e>", "<cs> my lords just to resolve the complexity of the noble earl <e>", "<cs> my lords i echo what the noble lord lord lucas has just said about there being no question at all of any distrust of the minister in making these regulations but i think one ought to consider the position of the representative organisations who are going to be consulted <e> <s> having been consulted they are not going to know what form the regulations are going to take <e> <s> the regulations will be published and then surely the representative bodies will wish to have a target date for when the regulations are to be debated in parliament so that they can go through their usual procedure of writing to the members of both houses commenting on the regula <e>", "<cs> my lords the joint committee has no authority to make recommendations about the merits of a statutory instrument <e>", "<cs> my lords we are indeed grateful to the noble and learned lord lord fraser of tullybelton for giving us the opportunity to discuss this interesting report and for having given us his advice upon it <e> <s> it is a subject which bristles with difficulties to several of which the noble and learned lord has already referred <e> <s> he referred to but did not criticise the -year cut-off period <e> <s> this is one of the overwhelming difficulties that seems to me to present itself <e> <s> how a -year cut-off period can apply to an aircraft a tin of beans and every other product under the sun seems to me quite incomprehensible <e> <s> that is one of the extraordinary difficulties with which this topic is beset <e> <s> however that is by the way and i had better go back to the beginning of what i had proposed to say <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i should like to raise one matter regarding west germany <e> <s> the minister told another place at column of the <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble and learned lord is leaving the subject of the state of the art defence can he say whether the government will consider establishing a public fund for the limited purpose of compensating the victims whose claims fail purely on a successful plea of the state of the art defence <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to create any discord in this harmonous debate but i would just point out what may be an ambiguity in paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords we are indeed very grateful to the noble and learned lord for giving us this opportunity to discuss this very interesting question <e> <s> the noble lord lord strabolgi has given me the opportunity to mention something which was going to be my last point in our last debate about english which the noble lord lord kings norton initiated but time prevented me from doing so on that occasion <e> <s> i was going to relate to your lordships a conversation that i had with the noble lord lord raglan about the use of the word unique and how one cannot say very unique <e> <s> the noble lord lord raglan said well no two apples in this world are identical <e> <s> such is the miraculous power of the almightly no two apples are made identical <e> <s> therefore in a sense you can say that every apple is unique <e> <s> but if you came upon an apple in the shape of hampton court <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the attention of the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor has been drawn to a recent northern ireland order the social security contributions northern ireland order where i believe there was a delay of days between the making of the order and its publication which would seem to me a glaring example of the kind of thing that the noble earl is complaining about <e>", "<cs> if my noble friend is being told that the amendment is teaching the secretary of state how to do his job then i would say that that argument could be used against any section of any act of parliament which provides that the secretary of state before taking action shall have regard to various matters which are usually set out <e> <s> such a provision is very common in a clause in a bill and it is not really a question of teaching the secretary of state how to do his job <e>", "<cs> may i intervene for one moment on a very small drafting point <e> <s> i do not understand the phrase <e>", "<cs> my lords besides the voluntary organisations to which the noble baroness lady sharpies has referred are the boy scouts and girl guides associations <e> <s> i believe that they prepare jam under proper supervision in their huts for sale from time to time not for private profit but at produce stalls and so on in aid of their own funds <e> <s> they never supposed just as the other voluntary organisations did not suppose that section of the act held any terrors for them but if it does and if an umbrella is being erected to protect the other voluntary organisations the boy scouts and girl guides wish to come under that umbrella if they can <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government satisfied that a most disgraceful affair actually took place and if so have sheffield university apologised and expressed their regret and distress that the incident took place <e>", "<cs> my lords might it not be a good idea to send round someone to whom the airline does not owe money and see whether he can collect evidence similar to the evidence that the noble baroness is speaking of <e> <s> that might advance the matter a stage further <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness lady burton of coventry has drawn attention to a widespread abuse which is to be deplored in any civilised society and particularly i should have thought when it involves breaching the terms of international agreements entered into between governments <e> <s> anything which interferes ever so slightly with the comity of nations is to be deeply deplored <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord lord cross of chelsea who was the chairman of the select committee generously said that it was a rewarding experience for him to go through this task with four working peers <e> <s> as the first of them to speak in this debate i think i can safely say on behalf of the other three noble lords that it was an equally rewarding experience for us to be guided through this marathon by the noble and learned lord who throughout guided us with skill patience and good humour <e> <s> i called it a marathon while the chairman of committees described it as a herculean task <e> <s> hercules did many great things but i do not think he ever ran in a marathon so i must not mix metaphors <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that reply <e> <s> is it not generally accepted that british industry has not only a responsibility to its workpeople and its shareholders but also a social responsibility which is not being met by propping up sleazy magazines <e>", "<cs> my lords if the regulations do not come into operation until next december it does not seem to me to be absolutely essential and urgent that this motion should be agreed to this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that easter monday can occur as late as april th which is within a week of may day and might it not therefore be a good idea to implement the easter act and fix easter early in april <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble lord <e> <s> nevertheless has not the may day holiday created a new situation so that this year with easter day on th april we had four public holidays crammed into seven and a half weeks and only one public holiday between the beginning of june and december <e> <s> is it not about time that we recognised the wisdom and far-sightedness of our fathers by implementing the act which they passed in and holding easter during the first half of april <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble lord lord drumalbyn rightly says that the strict liability concept does not help very much here may i ask him whether that is not because that concept is of the strict liability of a supplier of a defective product <e> <s> even if one presupposes that most road accidents are caused by defective vehicles which probably is not true anyway the plaintiff still has the formidable task of proving that it was a defect in a vehicle which caused the accident <e>", "<cs> it is

identification he only has to produce it <e> <s> i should have thought it would be enough if a window cleaner only had to produce his licence and not exhibit it <e>", "<cs> i cannot see in the clause who is to be the licensing authority or how much the licence is to cost or on what terms the licence is to be issued <e> <s> do you have to show that you are a skilled window cleaner to get a licence <e> <s> do you have to show that you have no criminal record <e> <s> is the licence issued at the whim of the licensing authority whoever it may <e>", "<cs> is the answer that if you are in a street you are in a public place and it does not matter whether you are inside a car a taxi or where you are you are in a street and you are caught <e> <s> but a bus or a train may not be in a street and therefore it is made itself a public place for the purpose of the clause <e>", "<cs> i am much obliged <e> <s> i shall report to my noble friend that there are hopes of ultimate success and in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we all admire the tireless efforts of the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby on behalf of animal welfare and i trust that we shall give his bill its second reading as we did on the former occasion <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord for not having forestalled my little joke that with a name like mine i ought to be concerned with the welfare of pet animals <e> <s> however i am only speaking at rather short notice in place of my noble friend lord beaumont of whitley who spoke in the second reading debate on the former occasion and i feared that if i hurriedly tried to cobble together a speech it would only result in what the late lord montgomery of alamein would have called appropriately a dogs breakfast <e> <s> therefore since this topic is a narrow one and has been so well gone into and since no doubt your lordships have all read the second reading speeches on the former occasion i shall content myself with making just one point which may not have been emphasised quite so much as some of the others <e>", "<cs> my lords how many times has the noble lord in his own experience come to a firm decision after hearing the first half of a story only to come to a completely different decision upon hearing the other half of the story <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down is he not going to remind the house that housman wrote the whole of his poem in monosyllables which was a shining example to anyone who ever has to write anything in the english language <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord agree that not only must the organisers be clear in their own minds as to what kind of fund they are establishing but they must at the outset make it clear to the public whether they are asking for a fund a whip-round to benefit particular people or on the other hand a charitable fund to relieve distress so that if there is a surplus after the relief of distress it will be given to the appropriate charity such as the rnli in this case <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that this amendment speaks for itself in the way that the noble baroness would have us believe <e> <s> it says that the name has to be visible at night by pedestrians <e> <s> that surely means that the street name or the road name has to be illuminated throughout the hours of darkness <e> <s> to do that with every road name would surely be prohibitively expensive <e> <s> i believe that the intention of this amendment is to say that where there is street lighting every endeavour shall be made to make the street name visible by the light of the existing street lighting while the street lighting is on <e> <s> but that is very different from saying that every road name must be visible to a pedestrian throughout the hours of drakness on every day of the year <e>", "<cs> my lords is the scale of the licence fees being charged by the licensee a consideration that can be taken into account by the civil aviation authority in deciding whether or not to renew the licence <e>", "<cs> i should like very strongly to support the amendment moved by the noble earl and i think that the qualms of the noble baroness are not really necessary since as the noble lord lord underhill has just pointed out in criticism the clause is only permissive and if the local authorities concerned which have not been consulted do not like it they do not have to adopt it <e> <s> that probably explains why there might not have been the consultation that the noble baroness would have liked to see <e>", "<cs> i do not understand this at all <e> <s> how does the ministers argument overcome the fact that the issue of the licence by the local authority is mandatory under subsection <e> <s> that subsection says that the local authority on application shall register the applicant <e> <s> they cannot say your particular medical field does not practise acupuncture and therefore we are not going to issue you a licence <e> <s> he will say to them under subsection you have to it is mandatory upon you <e> <s> i do not understand the ministers argument at all <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i beg leave to ask the

noble earl lord halsbury and i on the other never really got on to the same wave length we were never talking on the same point and the same thing has happened today <e> <s> what the minister does not face up to is that whether or not he thinks it is good that a physiotherapist should practise acupuncture the clause cannot prevent a physiotherapist from performing acupuncture <e> <s> he must be registered if he applies and the only question which arises is whether he is clean in his person whether <e>", "<cs> the place where i looked for the definition of controlling interest was clause which is the interpretation clause for this part of the bill <e> <s> the clause defines a business and i should have thought it worth considering whether it would be advisable to include in the clause a definition of controlling interest since i think that is where people would look in order to find it <e>", "<cs> on the question of uniformity if the words on the same basis in the amendment are not appropriate for some technical reasons perhaps uniformly would be the appropriate word to use <e>", "<cs> if a single noble lord indicates that he does not agree with giving leave for the withdrawal of an amendment the amendment cannot be withdrawn and the question has to be put <e>", "<cs> would the minister say that again <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask the opposite question <e> <s> who has

careful to decide that any old breathalyser that a police force chose to use would not do it had to be a very special device properly approved centrally <e> <s> with the bill as it stands a policeman could use his ingenuity as the noble lord lord lucas has suggested by chaining a car to a lamp post for instance which might be very enterprising of him but it would hardly be the type of conduct which parliament had intended <e>", "<cs> everybody is having their say in this debate <e> <s> i shall try to be not more than seconds <e> <s> if you said to an intelligent small child if you came

illegal position and go away and if five minutes later the owner is going to return and attempt to remove his car from this illegal spot and is unable to do so the intelligent child will tell you that you have now achieved a situation which is the exact opposite of that which you were trying to achieve and parliament really ought to be able to do better than that <e>", "<cs> i am thankful that my noble friend had his tongue in his cheek in seeking to put on to the statute book the hideous slang term bike <e> <s> a bike has to be a bicycle and whether or not the ancient greeks had bicycles a bicycle must be a two-wheeled <e>", "<cs> i dare say that we shall be told that the argument against the necessity for rear seat belts is that the main purpose of the seat belt is to prevent the person sitting in the front from hitting his head on the windscreen and that this hazard does not apply so much in the case of person sitting in the back <e> <s> but there are those grand chauffeur-driven cars which have a glass screen between the driver and the people sitting in the back <e> <s> i should have thought that it was worth considering that it might be advisable to make seat belt wearing compulsory in those few instances <e>", "<cs> in the course of this short debate we have heard the two sides of this argument and we have <e>", "<cs> when a clause like this links speed limits to the provision of street lighting it is rather important that the street lighting should be working properly <e> <s> this enables me to mention briefly an experience of mine which i feel sure is shared by other noble lords <e> <s> i regularly travel on a certain route and i can be fairly certain that on a given evening one or other section of the street lighting will not be

opposite direction the next morning the chances are that that particular section of street lighting will be ablaze competing with the bright sunlight <e>", "<cs> one thing that the minister may have in mind is do we need to use the word builders <e> <s> there are skips which are run by people who organise what i believe are called bottle banks for collecting non-returnable bottles and their skips ought to be covered by the amendment <e> <s> that can be done by not insisting on the word builders <e>", "<cs> the word intended is often ambiguous <e> <s> in this amendment does it mean intended by the manufacturer or intended by the motor-cyclist <e> <s> it might be worth considering making it clear in the amendment who is intended <e>", "<cs> my lords do the government think that it is fair competition for a public utility like british telecom or particularly an electricity board which has free postal access to every household in the country because of course it passes on the postage charge to the customer to include with the bill a leaflet advertising appliances for sale when it would cost the private sector of the industry a fortune in postage charges to do direct mail advertising on that scale <e>", "<cs> my lords can we be assured that with the onset of the fierce new competition the act which safeguards the continuance of telephones in remote areas will also

go to their doctor and he is satisfied that this experience really happened to them and if he is satisfied with the advice of a psychiatrist if he thinks it is necessary then i hope that on medical grounds these people will be exempt and will not have to go on fastening themselves into cars after having had this terrible experience in the past <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for his kind reference to me <e> <s> i should like to support the words of the noble lord lord underhill who was saying what a worthwhile committee stage we had had on this part of the bill because

point in relation to statutory instruments <e> <s> the joint committee on statutory instruments in paragraph of their th report for the session / mentioned that some statutory instruments are drafted

more serious impression upon the minds of the jury <e>", "<cs> the minister may be quite right in saying that in the majority of cases the time of arrest and time of arrival at the police station are not very different <e> <s> but what about those other cases where the time may be very different <e> <s> suppose there is a disturbance and the police start arresting people and putting them in the police vehicle and then the police have to remain at the place of the disturbance until they can quell it <e> <s> some of those people may be in that vehicle for a considerable time <e> <s> then there is the journey to the police station and those two times are sometimes going to be some considerable distance apart <e> <s> what we are dealing with here is a general principle that a person shall not

to patronise the particular supplier <e> <s> in the course of that procedure tremendous wrangles will go on about trying to get money refunded for spectacles that are <e>", "<cs> i should like to

area where he is wanted in the knowledge that the clock will not begin to run until they do deliver him to the police area where the matter is being investigated <e> <s> what is the sanction requiring the arresting police not to behave in a leisurely manner <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged for that answer

can we really trust the whole of the media always to respect this right to privacy <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be that sooner or later someone will say that with my name i ought to be taking an interest in this subject and i therefore thought that i might as well say it myself and get it out of the way <e> <s> i think it is my only qualification really for taking part in this debate and i see on the list of speakers who are to follow me the names of distinguished scientists so i will confine myself to just a very few points that have occurred to me in reading the white paper <e>",

infliction of pain upon animals in certain circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords when i became a member of your lordships house just over years ago it never occurred to me in my wildest dreams that the

committee but on the joint committee on consolidation bills i offer my congratulations to him not only with humility but with the greatest enthusiasm <e> <s> i think it has taken him just over two years to come to his maiden speech <e> <s> we very much hope that it will not be another two years before we hear from him again <e>", "<cs> if you take the case that the noble lord lord mishcon puts forward where the prosecution is perfectly properly brought upon the evidence available to the prosecution before the case began and then the prosecution witnesses are torn to pieces in the course of the trial and it becomes obvious that the prosecution case has collapsed is it not rather unfair that the order for costs should be said to be against the prosecution <e> <s> it is reported in the local paper and everyone supposes that the prosecution must have been at fault <e> <s> but it was not at fault at all <e> <s> is it not much more sensible in such a case that the magistrates should be able to say that the costs shall come out of central funds <e>", "<cs> i see that in clause it says <e>", "<cs> that was the speech which it was on the tip of my tongue to deliver <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether my noble friend will think that impractical is nearer in meaning to lacking in usefulness than to impossible and whether he might consider at the next stage of the bill if he thinks that impractical is a more elegant word swapping impractical for lacking in usefulness rather than swapping it for impossible <e>", "<cs> in that case i beg leave to withdraw the amendment but i shall be lurking in the shadows until we come to amendment no <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that when we are considering a matter of this kind we really ought to ask ourselves what would the founders of this charity think about what we are here proposing to do to interfere with something which they ordained probably many years ago <e> <s> the trustees establishing a charity are very often extremely concerned with two points <e> <s> one is the good charitable work that they hope is going to be done <e> <s> the other very often is preserving they think for eternity the memory of some local citizen

the money to establish the trust and found the charity <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down as a member of the select committee i do not think he has been quite fair to the committee <e> <s> we were confronted with a great deal of evidence from people who we regarded very highly and who were very expert who were extremely anxious that the endowment figure should be very low indeed <e> <s> i think that the report of the committee only reflects the committees decision based upon serious evidence given to us by a great many people whose wisdom and knowledge we respected very highly indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that we do not want so much to emphasise <e>", "<cs> what the chief whip has said is i am sure quite accurate and if we had been on report i dare say the rule would have been strictly adhered to but when we are in committee it is more informal <e> <s> the noble lord lord mishcon is very busy and if he made the mistake of being a second or two late can this not be overlooked <e> <s> it would be useful to have a point raised on clause <e> <s> the noble lord says it is only a small one <e> <s> i will stop talking and i hope that your lordships will hear the noble lord lord mishcon <e>", "<cs> my lords i follow very much what the noble lord has just said <e> <s> i want to be brief because i am conscious of having spoken very much on this point both in committee and at second reading <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it would be a great pity if the proposed government amendment was not forthcoming before the bill leaves this house <e> <s> noble lords have expressed themselves as particularly interested in this matter and if the government amendment is introduced in another place the debate there might go along different lines <e> <s> i am sure your lordships would like to see the government amendment before the bill leaves here <e>", "<cs> my lords with great respect i sympathise with that view <e> <s> let us suppose that there is a test case as regards a supplier of dangerous goods who is supplying them all over the country <e> <s> he has to be prosecuted somewhere <e> <s> a local authority is selected <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just ask this question <e> <s> if the defendant wants the case to go on in order to clear his name does the case really go on and does the prosecution call the doubtful witness about whom it is uncertain or does the prosecution simply offer no further evidence <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect i entirely agree with those remarks <e> <s> what would happen in practice would surely be that the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor would say i do not concur with the rule which you propose but if you care to modify it and return it to me i might concur with that <e> <s> then the desired result would be achieved <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the debate so far has shown that the great trouble that we are now facing is that the law on this topic to date has been a piecemeal approach and we need something very much more comprehensive <e> <s> surely what we need in a sophisticated society is an extension of national insurance to provide fair compensation for everybody who suffers physical injury through no fault of their own however it is caused perhaps leaving aside for the present the question of what to do about people who bring disaster upon themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords if the suggestion of the noble lord lord campbell of croy does not find favour and if the government are bearing in mind that easter monday under present arrangements can be as late as th april which means that one could have bank holidays falling on successive mondays does that not produce a good reason for implementing the easter act <e> <s> that act fixes easter within the first half of april

smoking is only personal or very nearly only personal <e> <s> i know that that is what people like the noble lord think but the unhappy truth is that a person who lays himself open to getting hooked on cigarettes lays himself open also to being cut off not when he already has one foot in the grave but probably when he is the head of a family at his maximum earning capacity making his maximum contribution to society and very deeply affecting the lives of other people who hold him in the greatest affection and are probably financially dependent upon him <e> <s> it behoves people who smoke to think a great deal more about other people <e> <s> smoking is not only personal or even very nearly only personal or anything like it <e>", "<cs> the words in the subsection no doubt deal with the difficulties in the ministers mind but this is a subsection which lays down what is or is not to constitute an offence <e> <s> where we are dealing in this way with the criminal law parliament always endeavours to be absolutely precise <e> <s> to say that it is not an offence if it is done to avert a danger is clear enough <e> <s> but if one introduces a phrase such as for reasons which include that is wide open to definition in different ways by different courts <e> <s> it is worthwhile coming back on report if we cannot have this now to make this subsection clear and precise because it will become part of the criminal law <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> those of us who think that the time for corporal punishment in schools in this country is now over and that anyway our friends in europe quite soon will drag corporal punishment out of our schools should like to see the general rule that in the meantime there shall not be corporal punishment in schools

there is a simple rule that the childs name does not go on the register unless you have in your possession a letter from the parents saying i agree to having my child subjected to corporal <e>", "<cs> my lords whatever the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor may have said upon some other occasion is the minister really telling the house this afternoon that vaccination against an infectious disease is not a protection for the community even though it also protects the child <e>", "<cs> does the minister not agree that the late sir winston churchill would probably have insisted on the words of or off which he has just got <e>", "<cs> surely our difficulty is that this serious matter has been tucked away into a private members bill <e> <s> too few members of the committee have been alerted to the need to read and consider the reasoning behind the recommendations of the report <e>", "<cs> i do not think that i have ever had such a comprehensive answer to any amendment i have moved <e> <s> i am deeply grateful for the great industry that has gone into the preparation of it <e> <s> i was raising a purely general point and i was using this clause simply as a peg on which to hang it <e> <s> i commend to the minister for light reading over the week-end our debates upon statutory provisions versus guidelines during the passage of the police and criminal evidence bill a short time ago <e> <s> with those few words i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment <e> <s> i think that we really ought to try to reflect the richness and elegance of the english language in our statutes if we can and i do not find much elegance in this part of the bill as drafted <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that it is clear that the last two lines of paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may very briefly give my reason for agreeing that clause does not belong in the bill <e> <s> when there is to be a very serious change in the

speaking as if he was forgetting that we have our criminal law which has been in existence for centuries <e> <s> parliament ought to be reluctant to extend the scope of the criminal law unless there

concerned about the proposed new subsection <e>", "<cs> it is true that we discussed this amendment with the earlier amendment but i should like to say a word at this stage having had time to consider the ministers reply to the concern <e>", "<cs> i am very sorry <e> <s> i expressed disquiet that hip-flasks were being put outside the scope of the bill because they were not returnable containers <e> <s> in reply the minister said yes but that the position seemed to be covered because it was also an offence to be in possession of intoxicating liquor <e> <s> i have in mind the hooligan who smuggles in a hip-flask containing neat whisky which he then consumes <e> <s> he becomes unruly and attracts the attention of the police <e> <s> he is no longer in possession of intoxicating liquor because the intoxicating liquor inside him is no longer in his possession within the meaning of the act <e> <s> the police say no you have a whisky flask in your possession <e> <s> he says yes but you havent read subsection of the section <e> <s> it is not a returnable container <e> <s> you cant catch me for that <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that if the whisky is still in the flask a person can be caught under subsection for being in possession of the alcohol but in that event he is not in a frame of mind to use the empty flask as a weapon if there is a disturbance <e>", "<cs> my lords what the noble lord has just said is quite true but we must not forget that we already have the criminal law <e> <s> disturbances of one kind or another of various degrees of seriousness are happening every day at

perfectly capable of coping with the situation <e> <s> good gracious <e> <s> we have been coping with riots of all kinds under the criminal law for hundreds of years before this bill was ever thought of <e> <s> there is no need for this panic idea of extending it to other sports now <e>", "<cs> my lords supposing that in a civil case diplomatic immunity is not waived could not consideration be given to compensating the person concerned out of public funds provided he can satisfy the appropriate tribunal that but for the diplomatic immunity he would have a valid claim <e>", "<cs> my lords may i add that the brilliant chairman who piloted the committee through this formidable piece of consolidation was of course the noble and learned lord lord brightman <e>", "<cs> my lords am ito

when he is considering the amendment which he intends to introduce i hope he will not think it satisfactory to say for instance that a supply establishment can obtain an animal provided that it has no reason to suppose it is a stolen pet <e> <s> i hope that the amendment if it is upon those lines will go further and say that no such animal shall be accepted by a supply establishment unless the establishment is certain in so far as certainty can apply in any human affairs that this animal has not come from a source which could mean that it was someones stolen pet <e> <s> the noble lord lord melchett has spoken eloquently about the terrible anxieties of elderly and lonely people whose only friend or whose closest friend is their pet animal <e> <s> they have these terrible fears and nightmares when their pets go astray believing that they have ended up in laboratories <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say a few words about the proposed subsection in this amendment <e> <s> this is one of that class of amendments which have come to be colloquially known as trigger clauses that is to say clauses which make codes of practice where they are relevant admissible in evidence in civil criminal proceedings <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree about this amendment <e> <s> surely a police constable finding himself in an animal laboratory is as much out of his depth if that is the right epithet as a bull in a china shop <e>", "<cs> my lords rather like the chancellor in his budget speech the noble lord kept me in some suspense until toward the end of his speech <e> <s> however he then said some very reassuring words which enable me to withdraw this amendment notwithstanding that every other noble lord who has spoken has come down on my side in this issue <e> <s> of course the key word is relevant and the judge will look at the codes and will take notice of them only to the extent that they are relevant <e> <s> if the noble lord the minister is right in saying that in most cases they will not be relevant then the judge will not need to trouble himself with them <e> <s> however i am much obliged for what the noble lord the minister has said and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> again i am very much obliged and i am very willing to ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord the minister cares to do a little tidying up at some stage i would merely suggest that in the last but one line of amendment no <e> <s> the phrase <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps a single sentence should be uttered from these benches <e> <s> i am sure that we owed it to the laboratory animals to do something more for them than was done by the act of <e> <s> it has taken us a very long time to get down to this task and but for the energy and thrust of the noble lord lord houghton i do not believe that even yet we should be undertaking it <e> <s> but at last thank goodness we seem to be achieving something <e> <s> i wish the bill well <e>", "<cs> my lords if we exploit north sea oil too rapidly what is going to happen to the employment situation about which the minister is so concerned when the oil is exhausted <e>", "<cs> i echo the hope of the noble lord lord beloff that the minister may be able to enlighten us <e> <s> i have a feeling that the committee finds itself in considerable darkness with regard to the matter <e> <s> it was some time ago that the minister intervened in the speech of the noble lord lord campbell of alloway to express reservations whether the recent judgment of the noble and learned lord lord brightman was of any assistance to the debate <e> <s> i am bound to say that i share the ministers misgivings <e> <s> as i read the judgment the noble and learned lord lord brightman was saying that he put aside the code of practice not because of any general principle about it but simply because as the noble lord said it did not add anything to the statute relative to the solution of the problem before the court <e>", "<cs> i think the peg upon which i hung my amendment is about to be taken away and i shall not be able to move it but i am quite satisfied <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord underhill has pointed out how the draftsman has gone to town with the word different in subsection <e> <s> the word different occurs five times in three lines of print <e> <s> if when we get to report we can leave out the first word of subsection which is different i am sure that that will make matters much easier for the noble lord lord underhill <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that answer but does the noble baroness not agree that however you look at them these figures demonstrate the need to extend the television advertising ban so as to prohibit cigarette brand advertisements at televised sporting events which draw enormous audiences of young people <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down may i ask whether he does not agree that the covenant system is not entirely appropriate for a sudden crisis such as a famine in ethiopia <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps we can have this matter looked into <e> <s> i do not think it is a satisfactory situation <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the fundamental question arise how do i find out somebodys post code if i do not already have a letter from him with it printed on it <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord also withdraw what he said about the withering of the acorns on the vine <e>", "<cs> my lords i trust that the noble lord lord houghton will forgive me if i do not follow him in his debate about god save the queen versus land of hope and glory if that is what he was getting at because it seemed to me not to be strictly relevant to the measure before us and i lack that seniority which enables the noble lord lord houghton to range so delightfully far and wide beyond the terms of the bill which we are discussing <e> <s> however i join with the noble lord in thanking my noble friend for introducing so attractively this measure which in his own words he describes as not a major safeguard <e> <s> no doubt he is right about that but it gives us great food for thought <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged for that answer <e> <s> has the minister not detected instances where the public monopolies seem to think that they can treat a customer any way they like without fear of losing his custom unlike private retailers in competition with others <e>", "<cs> my lords i have the permission of my noble friend lord winstanley to quote him by saying that whereas with a few exceptions we cannot hope to stop people smoking we can try to stop them starting to smoke <e> <s> however recently we have not been very successful at that and that no doubt is the reason for the introduction of this modest bill <e> <s> we are grateful to the noble lord lord pitt for introducing it and for explaining it so lucidly <e>", "<cs> my lords what about their friends and relations and the people who are dependent upon them and the people who love them and who do not want to see them die before their time <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble baroness for introducing this bill to us and for explaining it so lucidly <e> <s> she put into our minds the question why should a private members bill modest in scope like this have to occupy clauses two schedules and be destined to occupy pages of the statute book <e> <s> is this because the parliamentary draftsman is unduly verbose and ought to be taught to express himself more concisely <e>", "<cs> i do not claim that my amendment is perfect but what i seek to achieve is that if the accused person is to be given days notice by act of parliament that notice shall begin from the date upon which the recorded delivery letter is received because that date can so easily be discovered <e> <s> i am suggesting that it is quite wrong ever to rely on some notional earlier date presumed in a section of an act of parliament earlier than the date upon which he actually received the letter <e> <s> the only date when the days should begin to run is the date upon which the accused person received the information <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> i made an appeal to the minister to have a look at this <e> <s> we have to have a report stage <e> <s> surely this can be looked at again <e>", "<cs> i am very much obliged and i am pleased that the noble and learned lord will take another look at the matter <e> <s> in those circumstances i am of course pleased to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble and learned lord the lord advocate for this small crumb of comfort arising out of the fuss i made about subsection when we were in committee <e> <s> i am also very grateful that he has agreed to have another more general look at this subsection <e> <s> it has not really been cured yet by this small amendment <e> <s> the difficulty is what we were told by the noble and learned lord the lord advocate in committee <e> <s> noble lords may think this is a surprising proposition <e> <s> i quote his words <e>", "<cs> my lords in amplification of what has been said by the noble baroness does the minister not appreciate that easter monday can occur as late as th april <e> <s> if we keep the may day holiday where it is that will bring those two holidays much too close together <e> <s> surely that provides a good reason for implementing the easter act which has been on the statute book since and which confines easter to the first half of april <e>", "<cs> my lords this will not do <e> <s> surely one cannot leave out with when one says consultation with somebody but one does not have to consult with somebody <e> <s> one can consult somebody <e> <s> i am quite sure that the noble lord lord diamond is right <e> <s> if we want to get good english into our statutes this is an example of where a subsection should be amended and an unnecessary word cut out <e>", "<cs> my lords did we not waste our time on the energy act the long title of which includes the words <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble viscount care to pay tribute to the parliamentary draftsmen also for the enormous amount of work they have put in on the consolidation of the statutes cutting out the dead wood in the statutes of years gone by <e> <s> this is an enormous task for them and it does an enormous amount of good <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged for that answer but is the minister saying that the fate of that magnificent building on that splendid site in the heart of the capital city is not a matter of national interest and concern and therefore of concern to the government on behalf of the people <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not know that the government chief whip was going to invite me to take part in this debate <e> <s> however i should not like to refuse his kind invitation <e> <s> in the circumstances i shall not trespass long upon your lordships time <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend lady burton for saying that she hoped that we would discuss this matter not upon party lines but always bearing in mind the consumers interest <e> <s> i take comfort from that <e> <s> it makes it easier for me to make the few remarks upon which i now propose to embark <e>", "<cs> my lords is part of the answer to this problem an extension of the cashless society through the phonecard system which is being urged upon us by british telecom and in which no coins are involved <e>", "<cs> is the noble lord not being a bit hard <e> <s> what about the case of the mother who abandons her infant and when it is found and she is tackled about it denies that it is her child <e> <s> what about that case <e>", "<cs> i believe the competition was called spot the ball was it not <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that reply so far as it goes <e> <s> however the question asked for an assurance that the present number of minutes of advertising in every hour should not be exceeded <e> <s> i did not gather that i had answer from the noble earl <e>", "<cs> my lords do her majestys government accept that it is not for the iba but rather for the government to take a sounding to discover how much advertising is acceptable to people and to see that rules are drawn up in accordance with what people find acceptable <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord has put his eldest son to the law he ought to be arguing in favour of this amendment <e>", "<cs> both noble lords have referred to what the injured person has to prove <e> <s> supposing that the injured person dies and is in no position to prove anything does the burden of proof automatically pass to his personal representative or is it necessary to have an amendment in the bill to say the injured person or in the event of his death his personal representative <e>", "<cs> on that undertaking i am very pleased to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i have a rather less technical and difficult matter to raise on the questions whether <e>", "<cs> i still think it is bad luck on the reader who if he wants to know what damage means in part i has to dig it out of clause against the side-note meaning of defect and out of clause whose side-note is damages recoverable under part i <e> <s> that is pretty hard luck on the reader but there it is <e>", "<cs> i was pleased to hear the noble and learned lord lord denning say that there is an argument on the other side <e> <s> indeed there is <e> <s> this bill imposes no maximum limit on liability and it is impossible to obtain unlimited insurance <e> <s> i made that point in my second reading speech <e> <s> i particularly urged the government if it were necessary to commission an underwriting broker to go round lloyds to see whether he could find anywhere unlimited liability insurance <e> <s> it is impossible <e> <s> no underwriter whether in lloyds or in an insurance company will subject his principal to unlimited liability <e> <s> to do so would be bad business <e>", "<cs> one practical point occurs to me <e> <s> if you take a drug which is in fairly common demand in <e>", "<cs> i thought i was going to score a goal that time <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should have said that i was hoping we would take amendments nos <e> <s> and together <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw amendment no <e> <s> and i will not be moving amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw this amendment <e> <s> i should also have said that i shall not be moving amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i think i was probably wrong about this matter <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my only course is to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> i keep getting into the penalty area but i never score a goal <e> <s> nevertheless i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i think that we are slightly at cross-purposes <e> <s> the amendment does not say at the beginning of c <e> <s> in my copy of the marshalled list it reads <e>", "<cs> i agree that this is a matter of emphasis <e> <s> does one not emphasise a particular matter <e> <s> i am glad that the government have considered this matter and i accept the answer i have been given <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> that was a very learned reply about the rules of evidence <e> <s> i cannot pretend to follow it <e> <s> i shall be interested to read about it in <e>", "<cs> i am in no position to argue about what complies with the directive and so i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i shall think about that reply but in the meantime i shall withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my surmise was correct and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i have received a good explanation <e> <s> however when our representatives were discussing these matters with their friends in europe one wonders how much effort was made to put forward the importance of having regard to our excellent official british standards and to make the point that compliance with them was about as good as one could get in this connection <e>", "<cs> i do not know the difference between brief and succinct <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord is pausing for a moment may i put to him this point concerning <e>", "<cs> as the amendment has been opposed strongly in every single quarter of the committee i think i should be unwise to press it to a division <e> <s> i am gratified that noble lords have taken so much interest in this matter <e> <s> some of the criticisms have been slightly nit-picking <e> <s> for instance the noble <e>", "<cs> i should have said that i deliberately did not spell out the requirements of this part of this act because i am dealing with a general principle and i did not want to clutter the marshalled list with a lot of detailed matter which in any case probably would not have been right <e> <s> i am dealing with the general principle <e>", "<cs> again i am grateful to members of the committee who have taken part in this discussion and who have shown an interest <e> <s> this is another matter on which i am not going to win on a division <e>", "<cs> i appreciate that if the person who suffers the damage is the person who entered the contract to buy the set there is a cause of action in contract <e> <s> i appreciate also that if negligence can be proved against the producer there is an action in negligence <e> <s> however if neither of those circumstances is present is it not anomalous that just because one is talking about the product itself this part of the bill is not available to come to the rescue of the person who suffers the damage <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will allow me to intervene if he would like to take amendment no <e> <s> with the other two then perhaps it would be helpful if i were to speak to amendment no <e> <s> and explain what i find difficult <e>", "<cs> i am always grateful when so much trouble is taken to deal with the amendments which are put forward <e> <s> i am very grateful for the amount of trouble that has gone into the reply to these amendments <e> <s> i should like to thank the noble lord lord kilbracken for his support <e> <s> i would say to him that i think that the committee must always be very careful not to get trapped into trying to redraft clauses in committee across the floor of the chamber <e> <s> that way lies disaster nearly every time <e>", "<cs> my lords i have the honour to be another member of that select committee on two private members bills which sat under the very able chairmanship of the noble and learned lord lord brightman <e> <s> our deliberations led to the introduction of the bill which became the charities act of that year <e> <s> we took evidence from the charity commissioners and it is quite clear that one thing that made a deep impression upon our minds was the difficulties of the commissioners as expressed to us in evidence <e>", "<cs> that sounds a very good answer and i am persuaded not to press the amendment <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the distinction has been well made between the two categories of learners on the one hand the child of english-speaking parents learning english almost painlessly at its mothers knee and on the other hand the foreign student learning english as his second language <e> <s> he i fear poor fellow has a very much harder slog <e> <s> as to the first category the child i will only say that the quality of the instruction given does of course vary from case to case <e> <s> there was the london mother with her family on a long journey by bus <e> <s> one of the children became restive and said mum aint we ever going to get off this bloody bus <e> <s> and mum said now then how many times have i told you not to say aint <e>", "<cs> my lords despite the fact that i have the support of the noble and learned lord lord denning i do not want to divide the house on what is a drafting matter <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very pleased to reciprocate all the gratitude that is being showered upon me <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think there is anything between myself and the government the difference is between myself and the noble baroness <e> <s> therefore perhaps it would be better if i withdrew the amendment and tabled it again at third reading leaving out the word reasonable and simply leaving in the word ascertainable <e> <s> i might then have the support of the noble baroness and perhaps win the day <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have said that i was speaking also to amendment no <e> <s> which is in identical terms <e> <s> the governments reply seems to be that doing includes refraining from doing <e> <s> i do not agree with that <e> <s> i do not think that the average reader of an act of parliament would agree either <e> <s> adding those few words would make it clearer to the reader that refraining from doing things the donts are just as important and may be more so than the dos <e> <s> since i have the support of the official opposition front bench i think we should test this matter by a division <e>", "<cs> my lords i too had difficulty with this subsection and i managed to send a note to the minister last week explaining my difficulty <e> <s> my difficulty is with the last words of the subsection which refers to a product <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree entirely with the noble lord lord morton <e> <s> it is unfortunate when the whole point of part i is to get rid of the need for an action for liability in tort then to read that <e>", "<cs> my lords i have great pleasure in supporting this amendment <e> <s> i agree entirely with the noble lord that neither of our formulations necessarily produces exactly what is required <e> <s> however what our amendments indicate quite clearly is the nature of the problem <e> <s> it would be the greatest disaster if the bill were to leave this house without the narrow factual issue being agreed on all sides whether or not underwriters will assume unlimited liability <e> <s> either they will or they will not <e> <s> we must be agreed about this because it is only on a basis of agreement about that fact that we can proceed <e> <s> heaven knows i did my best both on second reading and in committee to urge the government to face this narrow issue and to give their answer <e> <s> i have not had that answer so far but there is yet time and i hope that it will be forthcoming this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords since we have also discussed my amendment no <e> <s> perhaps i am entitled to say a word in reply <e> <s> we have at last had agreement from the government front bench that unlimited liability insurance is not available <e> <s> the noble lord went on to say that in a case of negligence the producer does not get unlimited liability and he has to stand any amount of liability beyond what he can insure for <e> <s> i thought i said in my speech at any rate i implied it that if it is a question of the negligent producer paying or the innocent injured person paying it is right that the negligent producer should pay <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government prepared to leave benches of magistrates permanently in jeopardy of having to try a case brought by a zealous local authority against a cathedral book shop for selling a bible on a sunday <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of what the noble and learned lord the lord advocate has just said i quite accept that for the sake of consistency it is not worthwhile my moving this amendment <e> <s> i shall therefore not move amendment no <e>", "<cs> my lords i should not like to be left out of the felicitations that have been exchanged this afternoon but i must say a few words about the unsatisfactory nature of part i of the bill as it leaves this house <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord withdraws the amendment is it not a curiosity of this bill that the penalty is so absolutely rigid <e> <s> it must be or such other sum as the secretary of state states by statutory instrument <e> <s> he is not allowed to say that there are some mitigating circumstances and that he will not exact but will make it <e> <s> i am surprised at the absolute rigidity of the penalty in this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely unhappy with the argument put forward by the minister <e> <s> it seems to go like this <e> <s> this is a maximum penalty and not a fixed penalty but we are not going to say so in the act of parliament because we want the carriers to suppose that it will be every time <e> <s> i do not believe that that is a strictly honest way to draft an act of parliament <e> <s> if this is a maximum penalty which we now know it is the act of parliament ought to say so <e>", "<cs> my lords i am now being encouraged to think the other way <e> <s> very well i cannot prevent noble lords taking this matter to a division if they so choose <e> <s> that being so i think perhaps we had better test it in a division <e>", "<cs> my lords did i hear the minister say that the government have redrafted the directive <e> <s> if he said that did he strictly mean it <e> <s> surely even the english language version of the directive is under the control of the community <e> <s> if member states are to be allowed to redraft their language version of a directive at the end of that road we shall arrive at chaos <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not rather a curiosity that in describing two working days this being a definition the words are used as they are <e> <s> would it not be easier to say that two working days means so and so instead of saying <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not intended to speak in this debate but i was a member of the select committee <e> <s> perhaps i may say a few words to try further to explain paragraph which concerns the need for fencing <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down may i ask him this <e> <s> if he thinks that short <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very much obliged for that informative answer <e> <s> if this suggestion is not welcome when may we be told what the governments proposals will be to avoid the bunching of bank holidays which they themselves so much deplore <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the act merely says that the churches are to be consulted <e> <s> is it supposed that all the churches would ever agree about anything <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the gist of this matter that one would expect mid-summer and midwinter to fall in the middle of the period of british summer time and greenwich mean time respectively <e> <s> however they do not <e> <s> the position has become lopsided and needs to be adjusted <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that it would be a pity if this debate came and went without reference being made to some famous words of the late lord esher although i think that the noble earl lord longford paraphrased them <e> <s> the late lord esher said that we should hesitate long before tinkering with an institution which we would never have had the intelligence to create for ourselves <e>", "<cs> my lords of course the noble lord is absolutely right as he is nearly every time but the british people will not understand his point <e> <s> they will not understand the refinements pertaining to a question having originated in one house rather than the other <e> <s> the public will be mystified and surprised that on their television screens they do not see and hear what the house of lords has to say about the matter which interests them deeply <e> <s> i hope that that provides an answer <e>", "<cs> i think my lords that i had better continue and come to the matter of noble lords who have to leave early before the end of a debate <e> <s> on this subject i think that i have detected a disagreement between two parts of the report <e> <s> paragraph c says <e>", "<cs> i should like to interpose a few words at this point <e> <s> i have tabled two amendments one of which amendment no <e> <s> is very much on the lines of the present amendment <e> <s> my second amendment amendment no <e> <s> simply suggests that the opening hours of the betting offices should be the same as those of the racecourses and perhaps i may now speak to that amendment also <e> <s> i should make it clear that i am speaking only about horseracing <e>", "<cs> do we not have to entertain the possibility that sunday racing will catch on and that there will be a clamour from racecourses all over the country to have their meetings on sunday <e> <s> we cannot tell how popular it will become <e>", "<cs> i think it follows from most of the speeches which we have had from the noble lord lord wyatt that the committee would be a good deal happier if it had two bills one dealing with horseracing and possibly greyhound racing and betting shops and a separate bill dealing with other sports on sundays with which betting and betting shops are not normally associated <e>", "<cs> i think it is pertinent to this amendment to remind the committee of something said by the noble lord lord mishcon on the second reading of this bill <e> <s> he said that if the bill goes through as drafted the high street is going to be rather a strange place on a sunday afternoon <e> <s> the only shops open will be the betting shops and if you want to buy a loaf of bread at the supermarket next door you will not be allowed to <e>", "<cs> my lords if any noble lord present was hoping at this moment to hear from the noble and learned lord lord denning i sympathise with him if he feels constrained to remain in his place to listen to me <e> <s> it is also rather intimidating to follow the noble lord lord renton whose name is so indelibly associated with the subject we are discussing <e>", "<cs> surely we can have an amendment in this chamber with the government doing their best <e> <s> if they do not get it absolutely perfect they have a chance in the other house to amend their amendment <e> <s> that often happens in the other direction <e> <s> i am sure that noble lords in this chamber want this matter dealt with in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords having listened to a most interesting general debate i have to remind your lordships and i shall be corrected from the woolsack if i am wrong about this that the question still before the house is my amendment to substitute two oclock for noon <e> <s> i have to decide what to ask the house to do about that <e> <s> my impression is that at this moment noble lords are not anxious to wrestle with the nicety of the question <e> <s> your lordships wish to come to a decision on the main amendment in the name of the noble lord lord wyatt <e> <s> my wisest course at this moment is to ask your lordships leave to withdraw my amendment but giving notice that if the noble lord lord wyatt succeeds with his amendment i shall be back at third reading to urge not noon but two oclock in the afternoon <e> <s> subject to that i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> as mahler went on for rather a long time <e> <s> he might have found himself at home in this committee stage <e>", "<cs> have the government considered the amount by which it would add to the cost of a passengers ticket if copyright fees had to be paid for providing entertainment on ships and aircraft which supply copyright entertainment material to their passengers <e>", "<cs> the noble lord uses the argument of putting our carriers at a disadvantage with our competitors <e> <s> if the calculation i am asking for turns out to be that by paying these copyright fees the cost per passenger ticket would be practically nil then that disposes of the argument about unfairness to us in competition with other foreign carriers does it not <e>", "<cs> clause is a definition clause <e> <s> it says among other things that <e>", "<cs> if you substitute likely to promote homosexuality for intended to promote homosexuality you substitute the judgment of the court for the opinion of the local authority <e> <s> perhaps that is a safer way of dealing with the matter <e>", "<cs> although this amendment was spoken to earlier and although the minister was kind enough to be sympathetic to a suggestion i made a short time ago i ask him whether he really thinks that this amendment is necessary <e> <s> it states <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble lord i would only say that i think that you fill lacunae <e> <s> subject to that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall

to support the amendment <e> <s> i promise not to go on for hour after hour <e> <s> surely the acceptability of homosexuality gives the impression of a subject for a debate on whether homosexuality is acceptable <e> <s> i do not think that that is the intention <e> <s> the intention is to prohibit teaching the acceptance of homosexuality <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down i do not think he has explained whether in this place the word pretended means claimed which we are told is what lawyers mean by pretended or pretended in the sense of lets pretend as used by children as the noble lord lord henderson said <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the most apt comment on this point made in committee came from the noble lord lord hughes when he asked whether without this subsection the court would not be allowed to draw such inferences as it thought fit <e> <s> i do not think that judges need to be told by an act of parliament that they may draw such inferences as they think fit <e> <s> i think we owe a duty to the statute book not to fill it up with unnecessary clauses such as this <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say a word in support of this amendment <e> <s> when we were discussing this matter in committee i thought that the governments reply implied though it was not intended perhaps to imply that what followed from their answer was that this country had to keep its end up in the matter of international trade and if other countries were not prepared to do what was morally right then perhaps this country could not afford to do what was morally right because we had to keep our end up in international trade <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for inserting myself at this point but i promise to be extremely brief <e> <s> i hope that a parents request for an act of worship and a parents request for christian religious education will be treated quite separately and distinctly as i believe that in this country we have many non-christian parents who would be perfectly satisfied that their children should be brought up in their own religious beliefs and who indeed would be deeply unhappy if it were to be otherwise <e>", "<cs> my lords frequently street lights of all kinds burn brightly in the midday sun and not in the midnight darkness <e> <s> does the minister not consider that it would be a contribution to road safety if local authorities were liable to be prosecuted in the same way as motorists for not having their lights on after dark <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the minister <e> <s> i should like to say to the noble viscount lord massereene that if he wishes to know what is reasonable he must ask the gentleman on the clapham omnibus because what he thinks is reasonable is reasonable <e>", "<cs> my lords does that mean that the post office is entitled to hide behind a rule about day-to-day operations in the course of publishing a statement of general policy with which most people do not agree <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord suppose that the post office talks to its friends at the national giro before it publishes such an advertisement <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that after derby day epsom downs looks as though it has been hit by a snowstorm whereas no comparable litter problem arises in the park at longchamp after the prix de arc de triomphe <e> <s> is that not another example of how far we must go in order to catch up with other civilised countries <e>", "<cs> a completely different situation may arise with squatters <e> <s> the occupier has no intention of giving any kind of notice <e> <s> he goes abroad for six months <e> <s> squatters break in in the winter months <e> <s> they use a large quantity of water <e> <s> the weather improves and

for the water that the squatters used for the period that he was away <e>", "<cs> does the minister think that that is a fair arrangement or ought better arrangements to be made while we have the opportunity <e>", "<cs> i do not join with the noble lord lord renton in finding any difficulty with regular testing <e> <s> i should have thought that regular testing merely means that you have to test the meter at the end of the time when experience shows that an inspection is necessary <e> <s> no piece of machinery can be <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble lord for that encouraging reply <e> <s> are we not under the difficulty that boards of trustees cannot bind their successors and without the authority of parliament behind them trustees will not be able to give the absolute assurance which a prospective donor may demand that a picture will never be sold <e> <s> in consequence we might find that some gifts which the trustees would dearly love to have will not be forthcoming <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add a few words to the extensive coverage of this matter by my noble friend <e> <s> i thought that the noble lord lord auckland was about to give the house his experience of what happens in russia <e> <s> however i misheard him because he was talking about the rush hour <e> <s> i am slightly concerned by clause which is not mandatory upon the ticket collector <e> <s> his duty is not cut and dried it is discretionary <e> <s> i say that because of the words <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that answer which was rather what i expected <e> <s> is the minister aware that people generally regard easter as the first outdoor holiday of the year <e> <s> even allowing for the vagaries of the british climate is there not a better chance of good weather in april than in march <e> <s> however with the fairly recent introduction <e>", "<cs> my lords what is the difference between a near miss and a near hit <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble and learned lord not agree that no-claim personal injury ought to be a fair claim upon the taxpayer generally under the welfare state <e> <s> it would not cost each taxpayer very many pennies per annum <e> <s> surely the taxpayer would be happy to pay as an extension of the welfare state <e>", "<cs> my lords i am conscious of being less well qualified not only than those who have already spoken but also than most of those who are about to speak in this debate <e> <s> however i promise not to detain your lordships for very long <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister have another look at the easter act to find out whether it says that the churches must agree or whether it says that the churches must be consulted which are two very different things <e>", "<cs> my lords i have always understood the longest platform in the country to be at cambridge but the noble lord lord sefton of garston claims that manchester has the longest <e> <s> i was thinking of having a bet with him but i had better not <e> <s> i nearly always lose <e>", "<cs> i have never understood why ministers tend to resist affirmative resolutions and do not welcome them <e> <s> in a case like this where the home secretary is likely to become extremely unpopular with members of the public over whatever he decides to put into his statutory instrument would it not be a matter of strength for him to be able to say dont put all the blame on me <e> <s> this is not entirely my work <e> <s> i had to get parliaments affirmative approval for this <e> <s> if you do not like it dont blame <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged for that answer <e> <s> i am sure that the noble earl understands that the act does not say that the churches must be in agreement but that they must be consulted <e>", "<cs> my lords if there is an issue of hybridity here as i believe we have been told by the noble lord lord renton that issue needs to be faced up to and not disposed of by taking one purely procedural course rather than another <e> <s> i hope that we shall hear more about hybridity if that is an issue and how it will be disposed of <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the government need to look again at subsection <e> <s> the last two lines deal with attempting to commit an offence <e> <s> i do not know why it is necessary to refer to that in the subsection because i understand that attempting to commit an offence is itself an offence under the general law and should not presumably have to be specifically mentioned in statute <e>", "<cs> my lords in the absence of a sanction referred to by the noble lord lord renton it is not in my recollection that when a statute says that an application form is to be in the following form it is thought necessary to spell out a sanction in the event of the form not being in that form <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards precedence it is not a matter of searching the law books to find a case in which three days notice is valid and say that is a precedent and it shall apply to this case which is entirely different from the other <e> <s> surely the doctrine of precedence does not have the enormous importance which the minister is trying to give it <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall look forward to hearing the ministers reply to the very pertinent questions that have been put by the last two speakers <e>", "<cs> the noble lord said that he opposed the charge <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl takes so much trouble and does his homework so well that i am astonished by that reply <e> <s> he is miles away from the point <e> <s> if a person goes in as a carpenter to do some work in the morning he is obviously entering lawfully <e> <s> there must then come a time the football <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate that but in my illustration a person having refused point blank to leave is turned out by the police <e> <s> they have to come and turn him out <e> <s> he has been doing his absolute damnedest if that is a parliamentary expression to remain and watch the match <e> <s> that is his attempt he does not succeeed and because he does not succeed he does not commit the offence of remaining inside <e> <s> however he commits or would commit the offence if it were an offence of attempting to remain in <e> <s> if he were trying to get in unlawfully from outside he would be caught as attempting to get in under the provisions of the subsection <e> <s> that is the position <e> <s> however i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble lord for those remarks but is he not disappointed with his own answer <e> <s> was he not looking for a continued steep fall in the use of tobacco <e> <s> in any event will he convey to his right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer that if there is a campaign to discourage the use of a dangerous drug such as nicotine it may be a good idea to make sure that it does not become available more cheaply <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may intervene at this point to say but a few words about the wording of this question which refers to proposals to restructure <e> <s> i wonder where the word restructure comes from and why we need it <e> <s> we have been building and rebuilding ever since the anglo-saxons taught us that word <e> <s> there are those who prefer latin derivations such as construct and reconstruct therefore why do we need to restructure <e> <s> it is a word <e>", "<cs> my lords this is the second day running that an amendment tabled by a noble lord who is not a member of the government has been spoken to in advance by a minister in the course of moving one of his earlier amendments <e> <s> it caused confusion yesterday and it has caused a little confusion today <e> <s> surely it is also undesirable that a noble lords amendment should be anticipated before he has had a chance to move it <e> <s> i hope we can establish a firm rule that ministers will not speak in advance of amendments tabled by other noble lords before those noble lords have had a chance to move their amendments <e>", "<cs> it occurs to my rusty legal mind that a good case can nearly always be made for the legislator not telling the judiciary what the judiciary <e>", "<cs> the words which the minister has just used do not appear in the bill <e> <s> if she is not prepared to insert the word relevant which the amendment requires is she prepared to insert in the bill the words which she has just used in attempting to demonstrate that the word relevant is unnecessary <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord lord mottistone for his support in principle and i am also grateful to the minister for his very sympathetic reply <e> <s> it seems that something will happen in this connection although it will not happen this evening <e> <s> in the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the minister will turn his attention to the spring term <e> <s> with the tendency of school holidays to wrap themselves around easter and with easter leaping about the calendar like a gazelle does this not play havoc with the arrangements for the spring term <e>", "<cs> i wish to support the amendment <e> <s> it seems to necessitate that in a large firm one person must supervise all the transactions for one individual <e> <s> however that may mean too great a work load for one person <e> <s> in a large firm there may well be several partners with equal supervising skills who could divide up the work between them <e> <s> one partner could supervise certain transactions while another partner could supervise others <e> <s> if the amendment is accepted all the transactions will be supervised by one individual but in a large firm that person does not necessarily have to be the same individual as such a step may involve too much work for him <e> <s> therefore i believe the amendment is an improvement on what is stated in the bill <e>", "<cs> i am much obliged to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for his comments <e> <s> i understood the words each transaction to apply to every transaction <e> <s> i believe others may read it in that way <e> <s> if the clause can be considered and made easier to understand that should be a great help <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that on nd january when the house rose at oclock in the afternoon i awoke in the television room four hours later went to the library to collect my briefcase and found the library deserted but all the overhead lights were blazing in all four rooms and most of the table lamps as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we are all grateful to the noble lord for introducing this subject this afternoon a subject on which he speaks with so much authority and expertise <e> <s> he mentioned the commonwealth conference on delegated legislation last november <e> <s> i suppose that modesty prevented him from mentioning that he fascinated the conference with an address about henry viii clauses <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish that i too could welcome this order <e> <s> it first appeared in the minutes on th february that this motion was to be moved this evening <e> <s> reference was specifically made in the minutes on th february to the th report of the joint committee on statutory instruments as is required <e> <s> that reference to the th report has been repeated every day in the minutes since th february <e> <s> the report of the joint committee was ordered to be printed on th february <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down i am much obliged to her but does she really believe that on a matter concerning the country and country people one days notice is sufficient for noble lords to grasp the matter and take part in the debate one day later <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that easter monday can occur so late as to fall only one week before the may day holiday <e> <s> is that a satisfactory situation <e>", "<cs> my lords no doubt my noble friend lord evans would be pleased to learn that the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor had moved an identical amendment to his on report <e> <s> therefore in that case i am happy to beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i understand that we are to discuss my amendments nos <e> <s> and together with this amendment <e> <s> perhaps therefore it is timely for me to speak now to my amendments <e> <s> they simply take the whole scheme the order out of the negative procedure and put it into the affirmative procedure <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged for that information but is the noble earl proud of a per cent <e> <s> interest rate in these times when general interest rates have risen spectacularly <e> <s> is there some inverse ratio operating between these two rates <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged for that very full reply <e> <s> do the government accept that easter is commonly regarded as the first outdoor holiday of the year <e> <s> do they also accept that easter in march is not popular because the weather is too unreliable but that a later easter in april runs up against the may day holiday <e> <s> therefore did not our elders and betters in parliament in get it about right <e>", "<cs> my lords is there any hope of persuading manufacturers not to expunge the health warning from the packets of tobacco which they export to the third world <e>", "<cs> my lords can we be assured that the contract-arranged charges are in relation to the ordinary rate of charges so that the bulk mail is not being subsidised by those who pay the ordinary rate <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon told us how few children had been killed <e> <s> he did not say how many had been injured <e> <s> helmets will protect children from injuries as well as death <e>", "<cs> if the owner were to be in india as has been suggested he would be outside the jurisdiction and would be quite safe <e>", "<cs> boys include girls

appearance it may well be true <e> <s> he allows the boy to ride without protective headgear <e>", "<cs> i thought that i had drawn a successful parallel and that if a statutory defence is allowed in one case it would be fair to allow it in another <e> <s> however i do not wish to take the matter to a division <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the principles which decide whether an order shall be affirmative or negative appear to be most odd <e> <s> recently we dealt with an affirmative order about mushroom growing <e> <s> that was quickly followed by the student loans regulations which were highly controversial and which were dealt with under the negative procedure <e> <s> is there a principle which decides such issues <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister accept as lord justice mustill put the matter in the case in question that things that can be sold on sunday are <e>", "<cs> my lords in supporting the amendment i begin by saying to the noble viscount lord mountgarret that the question of reasonableness comes before the courts every day <e> <s> courts are always having to determine whether somebody acted reasonably it is the commonest occurrence in the world <e> <s> i should like to think that we could establish a rule that no private members bill would ever create an offence involving strict liability <e> <s> that is to say that the person charged has no defence at all provided that the facts stated in the legislation are proved by the prosecution <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount lord mountgarret does not want anyone to ride on the road without wearing protective headgear whatever age <e> <s> most noble lords would agree with that proposition <e> <s> if the noble viscount had put down an amendment to that effect it might have been carried <e> <s> i am sure that the noble baroness does not want anyone to ride on the road without wearing a helmet <e> <s> does the noble viscount want to say something <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness lady nicol is not in favour of the amendment <e> <s> she produced the familiar argument that if the bill has to go back to the commons and be amended it may be lost <e> <s> however i understand that it must go back to the commons because i gather that the noble baroness lady masham of ilton will shortly move an amendment which i expect she hopes will be carried <e> <s> the bill will then have to go back to another place and be considered again <e>", "<cs> my lords the allegation in the question is that a private bank account was investigated <e> <s> has there been an investigation as to whether that allegation is true of false <e>", "<cs> it may be that one radio station cannot afford to employ live musicians just as one local newspaper cannot afford its own foreign correspondent in china <e> <s> however in the same way as newspapers share foreign correspondents surely radio stations can share live musicians and overcome the problem in that way <e>",

be placed in the library so that the rest of us may be made aware of the position <e>", "<cs> i believe my noble friend lord mcnair suggested that the government had already <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may draw attention to the word purported in this subsection <e> <s> immunity appears to be granted to an enforcement officer for anything done in the purported exercise of any of his the powers conferred upon him <e>", "<cs> in answer to the argument addressed to me by the noble earl perhaps one may consider paragraph g on page <e> <s> it states that the official can use reasonable force if necessary not in the purported exercise of his powers but in exercising his powers <e> <s> we shall have to return to this word purported when we come to report because i believe that it is mischievous in the
