["<cs> my lords as in committee i just point out for the convenience of the house that i have tabled amendment no <e> <s> to clause as being an alternative route to achieving the same objective as the noble lord lord jacques is now seeking to achieve <e> <s> i think it would be better if we were to discuss amendment no <e> <s> not now but when we come to it <e> <s> i only say this now because i hope that on this occasion i shall not be told as i was in committee when i moved my similar amendment that the whole thing had been discussed on this amendment <e> <s> i hope we shall have a separate discussion on amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i am only too willing to take whatever course the house thinks best and if the minister would like to discuss my amendment at the same time and if we may treat what he has just said as an interruption so that i can continue speaking i will outline my case on amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> from time to time it must happen to all of us that we hear of a complaint against someone and at first sight it looks a very serious complaint <e> <s> but we learn by experience not to decide flatters without hearing both sides of the case <e> <s> sometimes when we hear the version of the person complained against we emerge with a very different picture of the seriousness of the matter complained about <e> <s> what happens to all of us from time to time is also likely to happen to the director from time to time <e> <s> it might be rather unwise for the director ever to launch out into an investigation without giving the person complained about on opportunity to make representations <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord wallace of coslany has made an important point <e> <s> if it is the case as the noble lord says it is that in some other act with rather similar objectives it is written in that the director shall receive representations and if that is left out of this bill distinctions will be drawn and it will be said that if parliament had intended the director under this measure to receive representations parliament would have said so in the same way that parliament said so in the other act <e> <s> it is important to have consistency to prevent lawyers from finding discre <e>", "<cs> my lords i was taking up a point which the noble lord lord wallace of coslany made when he said that in some other act did he say the fair trading act <e> <s> these words were included <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the noble lord for that reply my lords <e> <s> i should have thought that a variation or revocation of a direction was itself a direction <e> <s> but the noble lord said other things which i shall have to read in <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister is quite right he has not convinced me at all <e> <s> it could do no possible harm to insert this signpost <e> <s> but i have always made an undertaking with myself that i will not divide the house on a purely drafting matter so i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>"]
