["<cs> my lords in common with others i express my gratitude to the <e>", "<cs> my lords in my last years of government service which ended just over years ago nothing was more intractable more perplexing and seemingly insoluble than the question of rhodesia and things do not seem to have changed <e> <s> but there has been one big change in my view in zimbabwe we have really passed a <e>", "<cs> my lords many noble lords taking part in this debate must have the feeling of having been here before because we have discussed this subject so frequently over the years <e> <s> however there are two differences at least on this occasion <e> <s> the first as the noble lord lord annan and the noble viscount lord amory rightly pointed out is that the needs for reduction in public expenditure are very strong and far more stringent now than perhaps previously <e> <s> secondly i must recognise that many of us i included expressed fears on previous occasions which do not seem to have been completely fulfilled in practice <e> <s> but i must say that there is a big difference on this occasion in that the plans proposed suggest such a staggering increase as to amount almost to a difference in kind rather than in degree particularly because as has been said by other speakers the incidence on individual institutions is far more disastrous than on some others because of the application of a rigid mathematical formula <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to intervene in this discussion but i listened carefully to the words of the noble lord and to those of my noble friend and previous colleague lord alport <e> <s> i thought he put the matter so extremely well that there was very little else to say <e> <s> with respect to the noble baroness lady gaitskell i thought that he had his own reservations and doubts as all of us had because we are discussing this bill at a moment of twilight when none of us quite knows what the dawn will bring <e> <s> each of us can have his hopes and his fears and we have heard both expressed this evening <e> <s> but it is futile at this stage to indulge our fancies certainly dangerous to prophesy and quite otiose on my part to attempt to offer any advice <e> <s> so rather than deal with the present doubts and difficulties i prefer to take a rather broader perspective <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a distinguished if somewhat lengthy debate including incidentally speeches from no fewer than three of my former secretaries of state and three of my former diplomatic service colleagues <e> <s> there is not much left to say and it will be my ambition this evening to make at least the shortest speech so far <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry i accept that <e> <s> but my thought is still the same that really it had ceased to be valid even by that the united states and britain alone could run the world <e> <s> i think that this was mentioned before <e> <s> i agree entirely with the many speeches which touched on this that we should give full support to the united states stand in this matter <e> <s> i think that the government response to that has been entirely full of praise <e> <s> i totally agree with the noble lord lord chalfont in his ideas of what should be our attitudes towards the relationship with the united states and the spirit in which we should approach them <e> <s> but i agree also with the noble lord lord chelwood that europe must clearly come into this picture and we are part of europe <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government satisfied that canadian ministers are sufficiently alive to the embarrassment which might be caused to this parliament if proposals which were controversial inside canada were to be put forward <e>", "<cs> my lords at the outset perhaps i should declare an interest because i happen to be chairman of the governing body of one of the independent schools which has been invited to participate in the scheme <e> <s> the school has been independent since and since the point has been raised we see no particular benefit from our own purely selfish point of view in participating in the scheme and i shall have no axe to grind on behalf of the school in what i say this afternoon <e> <s> i merely want to make two points about the regulations under the scheme <e> <s> first independent schools are being put on the spot for reasons which i shall mention by being invited to participate secondly if these regulations are approved and the scheme comes about i hope that it may be only the beginning and that it will be developed in ways that will make it more generally acceptable <e>", "<cs> my lords may i remind the house that british subjects and commonwealth citizens were interchangeable for a number of years without any obvious embarrassment <e>", "<cs> my lords as one of only three members of your lordships house who have had the honour of serving as british high commissioner in canada the others being the late lord amory and the present high commissioner the noble lord lord moran i am happy to be associated in this debate and particularly to pay my tribute to the two canadian maiden speakers the noble lords lord shaughnessy and lord rodney <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords i welcome the initiative taken by the noble lord lord oram this evening and i am very happy to give his thesis my general support <e> <s> as the noble lord lord pitt of hamspstead said so eloquently at the beginning of his remarks the gap between rich and poor is ever-widening and means that the world is heading for a very dangerous future <e> <s> the facts are not in despute <e> <s> every study brandt included demonstrates this <e> <s> the question is what we can do and there are no doubt a number of things we could and should do <e>", "<cs> my lords in spite of the exigency of the timetable i am sure that it will be the wish of the whole house that i congratulate the right reverend prelate the bishop of coventry on a very remarkable and extremely vigorous maiden speech <e> <s> in a sense this is for me also a maiden speech as it is the first time that it has fallen to my lot ever to speak immediately after a maiden speaker <e> <s> i am particularly happy that i am able to do so on this occasion and to thank the right reverend prelate for giving us such a broad and firm picture of the scene as he sees it and for expressing so vigorously his hopes as regards what the government announcement may lead to in the future <e> <s> the remarks that i shall make will be very much in line with those thoughts <e>"]
