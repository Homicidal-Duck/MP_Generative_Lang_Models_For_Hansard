["<cs> my lords while wishing to thank the noble lord lord winstanley for initiating this interesting and wide-ranging debate this evening i must apologise to him and indeed to the speakers from both front benches and to the maiden speakers for not being in my seat during their speeches <e> <s> i should like to be able to say that i was unavoidably detained in my national health service practice seeing my national health service patients but regrettably i am now getting far too old to deal with the vast numbers of patients many of my colleagues have to see under the national health service <e> <s> however i hope perhaps to say a few words about that tomorrow night in our debate on flouridation <e>", "<cs> my lords i too welcome the introduction of this debate today by my noble friend lord campbell of croy <e> <s> i agree it is high time something was done about this subject <e> <s> we have heard some interesting speeches and i should like to include my contratulations on the maiden speech of the noble earl lord yarborough although i did not really agree with anything he said <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite correct <e> <s> the fluoride in the water certainly has a beneficial effect on the formation of teeth <e> <s> but it is quite possible and research is still going on that the existence of fluoride may well have some kind of inhibitive reaction on the bacteria which actually cause decay <e> <s> so that i would not necessarily agree with the noble lords statement <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the late hour i intend to be very brief on this subject <e> <s> before i commence my remarks i feel that i must express some admiration for my noble friend lord ferrier for his persistent championing of the needs to integrate chiropractic or as i would probably rather see it some form of physical medicine into the national health service or to make it more generally available to the public <e> <s> figures from the working party report are quite astounding <e> <s> i must repeat the figure quoted by the noble lord lord wells-pestell per cent <e> <s> of all adults in a fortnightly period <e> <s> that is quite fantastic <e> <s> my intervention tonight is because the figures are far worse for the members of my own dental profession <e> <s> thirty per cent <e> <s> of us suffer from some sort of muscular skeletal disorder from our working position and i am one of them <e> <s> because of the size of the problem it seems to me to be economically sensible to take steps to get the sufferers back on their feet and back to work <e> <s> at present the resources of the national health service are inadequate to deal with this problem and many more trained personnel are needed <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> i am very much aware of the financial problems of the national health service and also of the directives from the treasury <e> <s> i am also aware that the dental profession has been <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness replies i feel i should say a few words on behalf of the minority profession the dentists <e> <s> i must declare two interests one is that i am a practising dental surgeon and secondly i do speak english although perhaps it is usually a one-sided conversation on most occasions <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful for and very interested in the remarks of the noble lord lord hunter of newington this afternoon <e> <s> i found myself also in agreement with most of the comments of my noble friend lord elton with the exception of the implication that more funds are being allocated to all parts of the national health service <e> <s> i do not think that is so for the general dental services but i will return to that in a moment or two <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord lloyd of hampstead for initiating this debate this afternoon and for bringing the consultative document to our attention <e> <s> at the risk of boring your lordships i also wish to confine my remarks to the problems of the record industry <e> <s> in doing so i must declare an interest in that i am a member of the musicians union and i have a group of musicians who have made records and intend to make many more <e> <s> having personally financed the making of one lp i am only too well aware of the way in which the collective skills in manufacturing records can be cheaply copied by members of the public who then enjoy the product without contributing any cost to the production whatsoever <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord and i am sure that between us we are pretty near to the actual figure <e> <s> the evidence that vast sale losses are occurring is undeniable <e> <s> it is estimated that over million lps are copied every year and that between million and million of those copies <e>", "<cs> my lords may i too thank my noble friend lord trefgarne for his clear and lucid explanation of the bill <e> <s> i also thank the noble lord lord winstanley for making his points <e> <s> my problem in replying to them is that the profession as a whole is so pleased with the bill as it stands that we do not want to get too involved with the more contentious issues now <e> <s> we shall be happy to see the bill go through quickly and perhaps deal with the other matters later <e>", "<cs> may i briefly say that i am grateful for the change that the government propose in this amendment <e> <s> as the minister said it seems sensible to have more elected members of the disciplinary committee <e> <s> when disciplinary matters are discussed i feel sure that any dentist who is up before the committee however unfortunate he may be will be pleased to know that at least two members of it are practising dentists and have first hand knowledge of the problem <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for his explanation and assurances and i therefore beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to make one brief comment on the amendment tabled by my noble friend <e> <s> i believe that my amendment no <e> <s> covers the matter a little more fully <e> <s> i should like to point out that the problem with my noble friends amendment is that it puts an unwelcome responsibility on the general dental council if they have to adjudicate individually on titles or descriptions used by dentists <e>", "<cs> moved amendment no <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for his reply <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> may i briefly say that on the whole i think the profession welcome this new amendment and feel that it will work well <e> <s> it has obviously been brought in by the government in view of the recent unfortunate disasters in dental practice <e> <s> i should like to put the matter straight and make it plain that only a few dentists misbehave and cast a shadow on their colleagues who practise normally <e> <s> the disciplinary committee deal with only about cases a year and only about one or two dentists have their names erased so this new power is unlikely to be used at all often <e>", "<cs> i am under the impression that the matter raised in the amendment is covered by government amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i also believe my noble friends proposal is too restrictive and i look forward to hearing what the minister has to say in reply <e>", "<cs> may i welcome this amendment similarly <e> <s> it is precisely what was wanted by the profession and i feel that it will also go a long way to remove the reluctance of some practitioners to bring the health problems of their colleagues to the attention of the committee <e>", "<cs> moved amendment no <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for that answer <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> moved amendment no <e>", "<cs> i cannot admit that i understood what the minister said <e> <s> however i shall take advice from the general dental council and at this stage beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords before we finish with this may i say that in supporting this amendment which deals with section of the act i am still trying to sort out a way in which dentists who qualify in other parts of the world might be able to use their qualifications here <e> <s> we have had a long argument about the title doctor and i am not wishing to bring that up again i have accepted the ministers arguments on that point <e> <s> but i am being lobbied heavily by one or two american dental societies and wonder if there is any way in which we can persuade the government or maybe the general dental council that the qualifications of overseas dentists could be registrable and then in some way at the same time not allow such dentists to use the title doctor <e> <s> i wonder whether my noble friend the minister can signify his thoughts on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i was going to say briefly that the minister was very impressive in his explanation and if i may i shall look at it in <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may i should like very briefly to offer my thanks to the government for finding time in this session to deal with this bill <e> <s> also i join my noble friend lady gardner who i know cannot be here this evening because she is abroad in thanking the minister for the way in which he has dealt with the bill in the house and also at other meetings which we have had in other places <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very pleased to be able to take part in the debate this evening <e> <s> i have to say that owing to having had rather too many patients this afternoon i must apologise to the noble lord lord hunter of newington for not hearing his introductory speech and also for missing the speech of the noble lord lord wells-pestell whose opinions i highly respect but do not necessarily agree with <e> <s> i have not been able to read the entire publication having managed to obtain my copy only on monday and i must apologise for perhaps using my notes a little more often than i usually do <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just detain your lordships for seconds on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> in my understanding this amendment relates directly to the recent problems within the profession concerning the administration of anaesthesia and anaesthetics <e> <s> i appreciate the concern of the government and the concern of the honourable member for lichfield and tamworth mr heddle whose representations which i believe to be misguided and founded on reaction to the popular press rather than to scientific facts have pressurised the general dental council via the department of health and social security into producing guidelines for the profession as to the use and administration of anaesthetic drugs <e>", "<cs> my lords i must also make an apology for not being present for the earlier speeches as i was detained in my surgery <e>", "<cs> my lords although not so directly connected with those regulations perhaps i may take seconds to remind my noble friend that the most vital safety factor for pedal cyclists and here i declare an interest in that i am a regular user of a bicycle and of the house of lords bike sheds is the ever-increasing need for new and more comprehensive cycle routes in our big cities and more careful maintenance of roads <e> <s> there must be particular emphasis on that vital area for cyclists the four or five feet out from the pavement or edge of the road <e> <s> cycling over many areas of london i can confirm that there are many sections of many roads where the condition of this vital part of the road makes it virtually unusable thus causing most cyclists to use a more central and more dangerous route <e> <s> in view of the increasing use of pedal cycles i welcome these regulations but would ask my noble friend the minister to confirm that the government will have the interests of cyclists as a primary consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise for missing some of the opening speeches of our debate this afternoon particularly to my noble friend the minister and noble lords on the front benches opposite <e> <s> however i think it is unlikely that anything that i am going to say will have been said before <e> <s> as a practising dentist who spent years working within the national health service i strongly support the governments plan in this bill to give family practitioner committees responsibility for their own administrative arrangements <e> <s> those practitioners working within the family practitioner services are independent and it seems to me wholly appropriate that there should be health authorities specifically for this sector of the health service where such a different approach to planning and management is needed <e>", "<cs> my lords i put my name down to speak this evening thinking that cycling members of your lordships house might be a little thin on the ground at this time of the evening <e> <s> however with such an eminent member of the all-party cycling group with us and contributing i mean the noble lord <e> <s> lord beaumont of whitley whose remarks were very relevant i am not sure that i can contribute too much <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for my noble friends reply <e> <s> this is a subject that has been brought up many times in the last few months by the british dental association and myself <e> <s> i shall read carefully what he has said this evening and hope that his assurances that careful consideration has been given to this subject are justified <e> <s> if so i shall be very happy to look at it and <e>", "<cs> my lords as a fellow cyclist i must congratulate the noble lord lord rea on the clear way he introduced our debate this evening and also on <e>", "<cs> edta is ethylene-diamine tetra acetic acid <e> <s> it is a good long word <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble baroness opposite for again bringing this important subject to our attention i must apologise to her for missing her introductory speech and indeed the speeches of my noble friend the minister and some of the earlier speakers <e> <s> when i put my name down to speak today i re-read the debate initiated by the noble lord lord molloy on th november <e> <s> the list of speakers then was remarkably similar to our list today and the content of some of the speeches i have heard even more so <e>", "<cs> my lords in fact it has now been decided that these clinics are not to be closed so the noble lords anxieties are unfounded <e> <s> the british dental association certainly put many questions to the dhss but these clinics are not now to be closed <e>", "<cs> my lords i have been boring my friends relatives patients and members of your lordships house for many years on the subject introduced by my noble friend lord massereene and ferrard this afternoon <e> <s> now i have a splendid opportunity to address a captive audience however small who probably will not interrupt me on a subject which has radically changed my personal and professional life over the last five years or six years <e>", "<cs> my lords at this stage of the debate we are about equally divided for and against in our arguments on the motion of the noble lord lord ennals this evening <e> <s> it is my intention to support the government and i have to admit that i have not so far heard any argument which could make me change my mind <e> <s> much has been said about the greenfield report <e> <s> in their evidence to the greenfield committee the dhss expressed concern for individual doctors having to take account of a patients financial circumstances when deciding whether to continue treatment with drugs not on the limited list <e> <s> those are very admirable sentiments but they are not consistent for we are discussing this limitation within one week of a government announcement raising prescription charges to and continued persecution for that is what it is of the dental profession by the increase again of charges for dental treatment <e> <s> i am tempted tonight to digress on this subject which i hope we shall be able to discuss in the very near future <e>", "<cs> my lords as you can imagine i would have much to say on this subject but owing to the lateness of the hour i have rejected many of my notes and i have put aside the arguments about cancer the cumulative poisoning effects of fluoride the inhibitive effects on the enzymes about kidney disease the risk to the elderly the under-nourished and the unborn and the problems of hydrogen bonding <e> <s> however before i go on i must declare an interest as a dental surgeon and also as a vice-president of the fluoridation society <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord kilmarnock for giving us this opportunity to discuss these regulations and at the same time welcome my noble friend lady trumpington to her new position on the front bench <e> <s> both my noble friend lady gardner of parkes and i are away from our practices this afternoon which i assure your lordships must mean that we and our profession are taking this matter very seriously <e> <s> i have spoken many times now on the question of dental charges and the harm that the rising charges are doing to dental health <e> <s> i wish it were not necessary for me to do it again but i should like to consider what has been happening <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now read a second time <e> <s> i ask your support this evening for the hospital complaints procedure bill which was taken through all its stages in the other place on nd february by the honourable member for newbury mr mcnair wilson <e> <s> it arose basically from his experiences as a patient within the national health service and consequent development of a patients charter and is designed to establish better contact between patients and their relatives with staff and administrators within the hospital services <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to all the noble lords and the noble baroness who have spoken in support of the bill <e> <s> i hope we shall be able to speed its progress through the next stages <e> <s> i am also grateful for the help i have been given by my noble friend lord caithness in the further explanation he has given <e> <s> i was also pleased for once to agree with everything that the noble lord lord ennals said from the front bench opposite <e> <s> my noble friend if i may call him that lord winstanley brought his usual logical medical experience to bear and i confirm that i intend to move an amendment to ensure that the bill is effective in england and wales and in scotland <e> <s> i shall look forward to further helpful contributions from the noble baroness lady masham and from the noble lord lord dean of beswick at the committee stage <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether my noble friend could also clear up one point for me <e> <s> i am not quite clear what happens if a water authority is supplying fluoridated water for more than one district health authority and as in the case in yorkshire after where all the area health authorities agreed positively to accept fluoridation except barnsley which was on the end of the line one veto can effectively negative the fluoridation of an area <e> <s> i am not quite sure whether under this part of the act a fluoridation decision can be adjusted as decisions are made by the water authority <e>", "<cs> i am horrified to hear what the noble lord lord energlyn has been saying <e> <s> as a very distinguished doctor and man of science to hear him say such things to this committee is utterly misleading <e> <s> there is no question of these substances doing anything that he says <e> <s> one might as well talk about the hydrogen ion and the chlorine ion in hydrochloric acid being just as harmful <e> <s> it is just not true <e> <s> i must stress that the fluoride ion becomes dissociated throughout the water and is harmless <e> <s> really i cannot let the noble lord go on misleading the committee in this way <e>", "<cs> i believe we are going wide of the amendment <e> <s> these amendments are designed to protect the water workers themselves <e> <s> the water authorities already have considerable experience of dealing with such chemicals <e> <s> it is advisable to observe a few simple precautions <e> <s> when fluoride in bulk is handled rubber gloves and simple respirators are worn and staff are instructed in their use and maintenance <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether my noble friend lord sandys or the noble lord lord energlyn can help me because i do not understand this <e> <s> i am aware that hydrofluoric acid is probably the strongest acid that we know of at the moment <e> <s> it will dissolve anything including glass and gold <e> <s> i am also aware that hydrochloric acid is very strong <e> <s> hydrofluoric acid consists of a hydrogen ion and a fluoride ion <e> <s> hydrochloric acid consists of a hydrogen ion and a chloride ion <e> <s> we have chlorine in our water which <e>", "<cs> i am pleased to hear that hydrofluoric acid does not touch organic matter <e>", "<cs> may i briefly say that there has been expensive research on this subject that we are discussing of the possible connection between fluoridation and arthritis <e> <s> some years ago ansell and lawrence took a comparative study of the incidence of rheumatism in leigh and watford which are among the united kingdom fluoride study areas and they found no difference in the amount of rheumatoid athritis osteo-arthritis spondylitis gout or disc degeneration between the two towns <e> <s> in fact there were significantly fewer complaints of rheumatism and less incapacity due to rheumatism in watford which is fluoridated than leigh <e> <s> but the authors were cautious in attributing this to fluoride <e> <s> there is no evidence <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i do agree with my noble friend the minister that this amendment has the very best of intentions and is quite rightly aimed at preventing possible victimisation of patients after a complaint has been made <e> <s> however i must agree with him in not being able to accept the amendment first because i do not think that this wording is suitable for the legislation i am proposing and secondly because i would hope that when the bill eventually becomes law the inevitable extensive consultations with health authorities and hospital staff will without any doubt come up with a complaints procedure which will prevent the very problem that my noble friend lady masham and the noble lord lord ennals are rightly concerned about <e> <s> with this assurance i hope that my noble friend will withdraw her amendment <e>", "<cs> i feel sure that i can say to my noble friend lady masham that the consultations will cover this point very adequately <e> <s> i can assure her that if at any stage i feel they do not we shall see what we can do about it <e> <s> with that assurance i would ask her to withdraw her amendment at this stage and we shall watch to see how it goes <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now read a third time <e>", "<cs> my lords i hate to go over old ground again and again but the house must remember that in the royal college of physicians undertook a major review of all the available publications on fluoridation <e> <s> the committee consisted of eminent specialists in the areas of general medicine paediatrics community medicine toxicology epidemiology and genetics <e> <s> they met over a period of <e>", "<cs> my lords despite the possibility of a grant from the eec i cannot accept fluoridated milk as a reasonable alternative to fluoridation of the water supply for three main reasons <e> <s> the first is the logistics of the matter <e> <s> secondly this alternative has been inadequately researched <e> <s> thirdly it is still far more expensive <e>", "<cs> my lords if provided in schools where children start their education at about four or five years of age the benefit would not be available for the formation of the deciduous dentition and most of the important and crucial period of permanent tooth development <e> <s> it is known that permanent teeth develop some six years before they appear in the mouth <e>", "<cs> my lords so far the research has embraced only short-term trials and it has never progressed to medium-term or long-term trials <e> <s> trials have not therefore been able to indicate whether the method or agent gives true primary prevention or merely delays the onset of the disease by a few years <e>", "<cs> it is my lords <e> <s> for the cost-effectiveness of school milk to break even with water fluoridation the former method would need to be five times more effective but that is impossible <e> <s> a method only twice as effective as water fluoridation would eliminate all caries throughout life an impossible task for fluoridated school milk <e>", "<cs> my lords althouth i am clutching a handful of notes you will be relieved to hear that at this late hour i have rejected most of them <e> <s> having personally been involved with the arguments about fluoridation for over years i am delighted to be here this evening to set the seal on this enabling legislation <e> <s> i too congratulate my noble friends lady trumpington and lord caithness for the way in which they have handled this very sensitive subject <e>", "<cs> my lords i ask myself why has there been such recurring popular resistance to a simple health care measure of proven benefit to everyones teeth <e> <s> more than scientific studies have shown that adding one part per million of fluoride to water will safely and effectively inhibit tooth decay particularly if fluoride is consumed during the first nine years of a persons life <e> <s> i must stress again that the addition of fluoride at one part per million not only gives benefit to children whose teeth are developing but is also of benefit throughout life owing to the continuous availability of the fluoride ion <e> <s> the fluoride content of dental enamel doubles <e>", "<cs> from the benches behind the minister i should like to say that i support what has been said by the mover of this amendment <e> <s> i feel that the minister must look into this and have an answer when it comes back at the next stage if not this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords i can see the look on your faces thank heavens hes the last one in <e> <s> and probably i am the least qualified to speak in our debate this evening never having been to south africa although i have plans to visit there next year to see my brother and his family <e> <s> he is a housemaster at the diocesan college in capetown and was responsible for some part of the education of the noble lord lord st john to whom i am grateful for initiating our debate this evening <e> <s> my brothers enthusiam and belief in the future of south africa are quite remarkable and it is under pressure from him that i have been persuaded to make a few comments this evening <e> <s> i promise to be brief <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a pleasure to follow my noble friend the right reverend prelate <e> <s> i agree with most of his remarks this evening <e> <s> he was widely quoted during a debate in the other place and i am sure he will be quoted again after our debate this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we are all grateful to the noble lord lord bottomley on two counts this afternoon first for initiating our debate and secondly for his long interest in the national <e>", "<cs> my lords before making the few brief remarks i intend to make this evening i must apologise to the noble lord lord hacking for missing some of his opening remarks but i was held up by a patient who i feel sure would have pressed a very expensive claim for negligence had i left him in the chair with the work undone <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord winstanley for giving me the opportunity to say something about the whooping cough vaccine <e> <s> he told me earlier that i would agree with every word of his speech and i concur with that thought because i do <e> <s> i only saw his unstarred question in the minutes this morning and i am sorry that more eminent medical peers are not present and able to speak <e> <s> however as my youngest daughter suffered very badly after her vaccination i hope not permanently i felt it important to make some comments this evening <e> <s> your lordships will also be aware of my interest in complementary medicine and the way it has affected my own professional life and my attitude to my patients <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble lord lord stallard for missing the beginning of his speech <e> <s> i am grateful for the clear and concise way in which he explained the bill <e> <s> i am sure that the minister will agree that it is very important that the information specified is made available <e> <s> to that extent i support the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords some of you will be aware that i find the subject of our debate totally fascinating so before i start to compress my -minute speech into eight minutes i must declare an interest in that as a dental surgeon i use some of the complementary natural therapies and i am also chairman of the natural medicine society <e>", "<cs> my lords as a dental surgeon perhaps i may say that generally i welcome the statement made this afternoon <e> <s> however i am disappointed to see that yet again the government intend to look to the general ophthalmic and dental services to generate additional resources for the important developments in the primary care field <e>", "<cs> my lords i am both delighted and disappointed to be taking part in the debate this evening <e> <s> i am delighted that so many noble lords have taken part i am disappointed that because there are so many speakers i shall have such a short time to speak about a subject of primary concern to our health <e> <s> it has been a factor in the past and will remain a major influence on the nations health in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i support my noble friend in what he has advanced <e> <s> i am hesitant to become involved in the legal intricacies of the amendment but as a semi-professional musician a member of the musicians union for over year and a regular employer of musicians it seems illogical to have the making of an illegal copy of a work an infringement of the law but legally to allow broadcasting of the copy <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already sent my apologies to my noble friend on the front bench and to the noble lord lord ennals for my late arrival this afternoon and also for the fact that owing to a longstanding previous engagement i shall have to leave at about seven oclock <e> <s> however i shall read with great interest in <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that informative reply <e> <s> while assuring him that the majority of my profession is in favour of the initiative by the dhss may i ask him whether he has received any representations from the british dental association particularly in relation to the timing of the distribution of this video and of the press release which seem to have become reversed <e> <s> secondly can he explain why the video sent to every national health practice in the country should show a technique which is not available under the national health service <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend lord haig for the opportunity to have a short debate this evening on the creative and performing arts <e> <s> i add my congratulations to the noble marquess on his excellent and interesting maiden speech <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems that apologies are in order this afternoon <e> <s> mine are that i missed the first part of the ministers speech <e> <s> however i assure him that i shall stay to the end although i shall slip out for a sandwich having missed my lunch <e>", "<cs> my lords i had intended this afternoon to make some comments on dental research <e> <s> however when i tried to think of something to say i discovered that despite trying to keep up with current theories on dental disease and materials i was a little further out of touch with the very latest research than i had realised <e> <s> in the regrettable absence of a brief on any aspect of current dental research i have decided to confine my few short remarks to another vital aspect of health <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful for the support that i have received from the noble lords lord ennals and lord winstanley and his supporter <e> <s> the noble lord lord ennals stressed the point i made <e>", "<cs> i also do not wish to prolong the debate too much <e> <s> however i wish to support my noble friend lady gardner of parkes <e> <s> although i do not presently work within the national health service i have over years experience of the practice of dentistry and about years experience of dentistry in the national health service <e>", "<cs> my lords i must agree with my noble friend the minister <e> <s> i do not think that we have ever heard so much agreement while we have been discussing health matters since i have been a member of this house <e> <s> also i very much welcome the amendment <e> <s> i believe that it will meet the requirement of allowing better targeting of resources in the national health service and at the same time will prevent regional health authorities from making inappropriate economies in their community dental services for the sake of financial expediency <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to admit that i had intended to put down an amendment insisting on our amendments <e> <s> however it was made quite clear to me by the public bill office that that would not be in order <e>", "<cs> my lords before making the few brief remarks that i had intended to make this evening i promise to be brief at this late hour i must apologise to my noble friend the minister for <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord cledwyn for introducing this debate this afternoon <e> <s> i must admit that i have spoken on this subject on previous occasions <e> <s> however i can promise the noble lord lord winstanley that my remarks although perhaps having the same basic underlying message offer some new thoughts for the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend and colleague lady gardner for the clear and understanding way in which she introduced the bill <e> <s> i look forward to hearing the comments of noble lords who are to speak particularly my noble friend lord massereene and ferrard <e> <s> i was pleased to see his name listed below mine because i am sure that we shall be commenting on the same aspect of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel sure that we are all very grateful to the noble earl lord <e> <s> listowel for bringing this subject to our attention this evening <e> <s> despite the very late hour i feel he has raised a subject that needs discussion a subject on which many of us have strong views <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not intended to be tempted to get to my feet and say anything about this provision as i do not think it is a good idea at this stage of the evening yet again to get into a fluoridation debate <e> <s> with the greatest respect to the noble lord who has moved the amendment i feel that it would try the patience of the house if i as a vice-president of the fluoridation society were to reiterate the arguments in favour of fluoridation <e>", "<cs> the debate on this amendment has turned into a debate on whether clause remains part of the bill <e> <s> at the risk of not being able to speak later i should like to say a few words from a slightly different approach that of the medical defence organisations <e> <s> i must declare an interest as a member of the medical protection society and a director of its dental protection division <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for not having put my name down to speak earlier <e> <s> i was away yesterday and noticed the unstarred question which the noble lord lord hunter had put down on the order paper only when i arrived at the house this evening <e> <s> i also happened to bump into my noble friend the minister who implied that he might omit the planned reference to the dental services in the s if there were no dental representative on the list of speakers <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a great pleasure to follow the noble lord lord porritt <e> <s> despite his opening remarks i hope that we shall all have the opportunity of hearing him for many more years <e>", "<cs> before the minister replies many existing herbal mineral vitamin and other food supplements have medicinal health claims and effects which are known and universally accepted <e> <s> i believe that the amendment is unnecessary as medicinal claims are fully covered by existing medicines legislation and food claims by existing food legislation <e> <s> the words proposed would cause further problems for the much beleaguered food manufacturers and i hope that they will be rejected <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to prolong the debate but i feel strongly on this point <e> <s> only a small number of pesticides cause the greatest hazard to health <e> <s> although i may not be up to date with current regulations i know it has been suggested that the three petrochemical compounds the herbicide linuron and the insecticides chlorodineform and permethrin should be banned <e> <s> the problem at present is that one cannot tell whether the product contains an excessive quanity of pesticide without this clear labelling obligation <e>", "<cs> i am sure that that is a cogent point <e> <s> if for example one is an asthmatic and sensitive to sulphur dioxide which is e commonly used in wines beer and cider as a preservative one has no way of telling whether it is present or how much there is <e> <s> people with other allergies cannot tell whether a drink contains something that they do not like <e> <s> it is almost impossible for an analyst without great expense to see that such products contain only <e>", "<cs> there have been regulations governing meat products since july and there is a list of the parts of the carcass which may not be used in uncooked meat products <e> <s> but the unacceptable uncooked bits are permitted in cooked meat products <e> <s> i shall not list the bits as that may put members of the committee off ever eating a pre-cooked meat pie again <e>", "<cs> my lords it had also been my intention to speak on food irradiation during the discussion on amendment no <e> <s> of the food safety bill which was before your lordships house on th january <e> <s> however following the intervention of the noble earl lord halsbury and the noble and learned lord lord hailsham i was persuaded to postpone my remarks until the full debate on the findings of the select committee <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment <e> <s> as we have heard from the noble earl lord baldwin students studying courses that are supplementary to medicine are playing an ever increasing role in the maintenance of our health today <e> <s> it is important that this role is recognised and clarified in this clause of the bill <e>", "<cs> i have some sympathy with this amendment which covers in a much broader sense my own amendment no <e> <s> which we shall discuss next monday <e> <s> it is much more important to me to hear what my noble friend the minister has to say this evening rather than rehearse any arguments that i shall use for my amendment which is concerned with loans for the longer courses for health care practitioners <e> <s> i hope that the noble earl will be able to give some encouragement to students about to embark on four five or six-year courses <e> <s> i look forward to returning to the matter in more detail next monday <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the support that i have had this evening from all members of the committee who have spoken <e> <s> despite the late hour there is obviously strong feeling about this matter <e> <s> i shall look forward to reading what my noble friend the minister said with a view to taking advice on it <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment <e> <s> the provision of continuing care following a period in hospital should be one of the primary functions of a district health authority <e> <s> of critical concern are the elderly and people with mental illness who often have a need for continued nursing and medical care for extensive periods of time <e> <s> at present local authorities do not have nor is it their primary function to have the requisite nursing and medical staff to provide such care <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to all noble lords who have taken part in this short debate and also for the comments of my noble friend the minister <e> <s> the desire for natural medicine is a worldwide phenomenon <e> <s> its practice is growing steadily <e> <s> it cannot be long before it is better established and recognised by the government of this country if we accept that the complementary therapies are intrinsically safe from most conditions currently afflicting the human race and that there is clear evidence that therapy is becoming more popular <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to congratulate the noble earl lord baldwin of bewdley on the comprehensive way in which he introduced our debate this afternoon <e> <s> i must declare some interests i am president of the natural medicine society i am a patron of the blackie foundation and with the noble lord lord ennals i am joint president of the parliamentary all-party committee on alternative and complementary medicine <e> <s> finally i try to steer my patients towards complementary therapies whenever possible <e>", "<cs> my lords the debate is continuing rather longer than i had anticipated <e> <s> although i cannot plead a previous engagement i can plead another dental analogy and the fact that i have to have a steady hand tomorrow morning <e> <s> i apologise to my noble friend the minister if i have to leave before his winding-up speech <e> <s> however i hope that i shall be able to stay and we have speeded up in the last couple of hours <e> <s> i have not thrown away any of my speech but i hope to get through it quickly <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may also support this amendment and say how pleased and encouraged i am to hear the support that we are getting this evening from all sides of the house <e> <s> as the noble earl lord baldwin has said we are moving the amendment again in the hope that the government will have had time to reflect upon the arguments and to agree to this very small change in the bill which would be welcomed by all practitioners of the complementary or natural therapies <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to congratulate the minister on the way in which she has dealt with the bill in all of its stages and use this opportunity to remind the house how close the noble earl lord baldwin the noble lord lord ennals and i were to making it possible for fund-holding medical practitioners to utilise the services of complementary therapists <e> <s> there is no doubt that had we wished to search the house for supporters we could have easily won the vote <e> <s> however i did not feel that that was the correct way to press a point that will without doubt eventually become possible by public demand <e> <s> i am sure that my noble friend will be pleased when the bill is passed but i ask her to carefully consider our arguments in favour of complementary medicine when she deals with health matters in the future <e>", "<cs> can my noble friend say whether his earlier remarks show that the intention behind the amendment is covered elsewhere in the bill or in future amendments <e> <s> the government have stressed the importance of quality threshold and positive programming requirements <e> <s> they have also declared their intention of allowing exceptional quality to take preference over the highest cash bid <e> <s> t he intention is that the itc will judge the programme and business plans to determine whether they can in reality be delivered <e> <s> in the uncertain competitive market that will greet the franchise winners the itc has been given power to ensure that licence conditions are met and maintained <e> <s> that power must surely include an assessment of each channel companys performance against its promises <e> <s> the amendment makes that possible through the itc annual report and seems to me worthy of support <e>", "<cs> i should like briefly to support my noble friend lord bessborough <e> <s> if accepted this amendment will seriously damage britains position as europes leading centre for satellite broadcasting <e> <s> i understand that it would also drive satellite television services to other european countries such as luxembourg where no such inhibitions exist <e> <s> were that to occur the services could still be received in the united kingdom under the terms of the european broadcasting directive but jobs would be lost to the british economy <e>", "<cs> i am aware that the minister has already spoken to the amendment on a previous occasion <e> <s> however as my name is connected with it i should like to say a few words of support from these benches <e> <s> there is no doubt i have many letters as examples that many composers who are commissioned to write music for television programmes are being coerced into granting rights in the music that they write to publishing companies owned by the television production companies even if the composer is already under exclusive contract to an independent publisher <e>", "<cs> i feel that the time is now right to speak to my amendments amendments nos <e> <s> b a a and b on the broad theme of community radio <e> <s> the amendments are part of a general theme that i see as important to ensure that the kind of radio system the bill delivers is one characterised by a variety of programme formats and where opportunities for market entry are not such that they deter the small operator or minority appeal programmer <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to members of the committee who have taken part in the debate <e> <s> i thought that the opening remarks of my noble friend the minister were most encouraging but he then proceeded to explain why the government would not support such a fund <e> <s> i should like to study what has <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for those encouraging words from my noble friend <e> <s> of course i am delighted to withdraw my amendment and at a later date i look forward to hearing what he has in mind <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say a few words in support of my noble friend the minister <e> <s> the noble baroness lady birk mentioned jazz fm <e> <s> i am a director of that company <e> <s> it is our policy to use live music wherever possible <e> <s> however it is expensive <e> <s> it is not cheap to record at live venues <e> <s> it is more expensive than playing records <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend the minister replies i wish to say a few words in support of his earlier reply <e> <s> the government must be satisfied that they exercise their duty to co-operate in the suppression of these unauthorised broadcasts in accordance with international law <e> <s> i have received over letters from supporters of radio caroline all of whom were concerned that the new powers in this bill are excessive <e> <s> however powers are needed to enable enforcement of the law <e> <s> i do not believe that the powers in this bill are any more excessive than is necessary for effective enforcement <e>", "<cs> i understand that those taken out of the large grouping for this initial discussion apply only to the dubbing aspects of the clause <e> <s> the matter will become evident as we proceed <e>", "<cs> as it currently stands clause does not take account of the fact that broadcasters need to be able to pre-record their programmes and retain them for repeats archive use and programme sales in other words dubbing rights <e> <s> there is a serious risk that unless clause deals on the same footing with the collective exercise of dubbing rights as with the collective exercise of broadcasting rights the record industry could either reimpose needletime restrictions as a condition in dubbing licences or use the threat of injunction proceedings as a bargaining weapon to impose excessive prices for dubbing licences <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to all noble lords who have contributed to this short debate <e> <s> i regard the answer as unsatisfactory as to the requirements i have made <e> <s> i shall take away what has been said and possibly come back to it at a later stage in the bill <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to all noble lords who have taken part in the debate particularly to my noble friend the minister whose words were encouraging <e> <s> it is far too complicated a matter for me to comment on at this stage <e> <s> i shall have to read what he said and i look forward to seeing the amendments which he proposes <e>", "<cs> i am almost hesitant to become involved with another amendment on copyright having earlier been put severely in my place by the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran <e> <s> however i added my name to the amendment to support and urge other members of the committee to support everything that the noble lord lord willis said <e>", "<cs> that is obviously a disappointing reply in view of the care and trouble that we took with the amendment <e> <s> i know that it is strongly held by many television companies <e> <s> at the moment there is meant to be voluntary agreement among television companies on coverage of news and news access <e> <s> however i gather that these voluntary agreements do not always work <e> <s> this amendment might stimulate discussion and sort the matter out <e> <s> however at this stage i have no intention of pressing it <e> <s> i should like to read what my noble friend the minister said and take further advice with a view possibly to coming back at the next stage of the bill <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may briefly from this side of the committee support the amendments in the name of the noble lord lord lloyd of hampstead <e> <s> in view of the lateness of the hour i shall not give the little speech that i had planned except to say it is important that the amendment is expanded to cover channels and and domestic satellite services <e> <s> the government have already recognised the need for the bfi to operate a national television archive to provide for the proper preservation and availability as a matter of public record of our most important medium of communication <e> <s> the agreement will appear in this legislation as well as in the copyright act of <e> <s> the amendment ensures that the bfi is given the proper scope to provide such a vital service <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend replies i have the distinct impression that this item may not come up again in its proper place when amendment no <e> <s> is considered <e> <s> i am also aware that the dti issued a statement on th october that there would be no reference of rights in tv programmes and music to the monopolies and mergers commission <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems to me that the government are right and correct to draw a distinction between the ownership policies that should apply to itv and bsb and those which should apply to the new world of broadcasting using international channels <e> <s> where there were four channels there are now english language channels and a dozen others available in german italian and french <e> <s> without a doubt this will increase giving us as the english language capital of the world tremendous opportunities in europe and further afield <e> <s> the amendments introduced this afternoon and this evening ask the same old questions who owns satellite tv and who controls satellite tv <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that the noble baroness lady masham is not a patient of mine because i have not been at my practice very much in the past few days owing to the time we have had to spend considering this bill <e> <s> as a practising dental surgeon it would be inconsistent of me not to support these amendments that were to be introduced by the noble baroness lady masham and that have now been clearly explained by the noble lord lord rea <e>", "<cs> my lords i speak as a director of jazz fm the radio jazz station in london and as perhaps a rather ageing musician who still plays a little rock and roll <e> <s> jazz music is becoming much more popular <e> <s> it does occasionally go thump thump thump and is certainly recognised at times by strong rhythmic elements and reliance on electronic amplification but i should like the minister to confirm that jazz will not be prevented from making a bid for one of the new national radio franchises <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the minister and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i was under the impression that my amendment did not apply to existing franchise holders or existing licence holders who were being granted renewal <e> <s> however i shall read with great care what my noble friend the minister said <e> <s> at this stage i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords although i am improving rapidly i do not pretend to be an expert on the subject <e> <s> i am grateful for what my noble friend has said <e> <s> i should like to put his comments before the shadow radio authority for its further advice and in the meantime beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords in committee my noble friend agreed to look at the matter <e> <s> i am happy with the words that he has tabled at this stage and i support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i spoke on this point at second reading and intended to support the noble lord lord mcgregor at committee stage which regrettably i missed due to a misunderstanding over timings <e> <s> i am not sure that there is much i can usefully add to the speech of the noble lord lord boston <e> <s> however i promise to speak for only seconds <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful for all that my noble friend the minister has said <e> <s> however before i begin i must declare an interest as i am a non-executive director of jazz fm <e> <s> i look forward to reading my noble friends remarks in <e>", "<cs> my lords the preservation and public accessibility of what has become the most important record of british life should be placed on a secure footing by putting a statutory obligation on the itc to ensure that the correct voluntary arrangements which are working well are continued and expanded to cover new services <e> <s> the current agreements between the british film institute the independent television <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am most grateful to my noble friend the minister and to his department for all the help that has been given to me during the bills passage <e> <s> that help culminated this afternoon in my noble friend moving my amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i had become so used to the various stages of the bill going on long into the night that i had a quick break for a cup of tea and as a result of the rapid progress of our business missed being able to move the amendment <e> <s> i am most grateful to my noble friend for doing that for me and regret missing the opportunity of having a back-bench amendment accepted <e>"]
