["<cs> my lords i too apologise for joining in this debate after not having put down my name <e> <s> the question refers to the next months <e> <s> i was encouraged to join in because the noble lords lord tanlaw and lord strabolgi looked rather further and i just want to say a brief word on that <e> <s> everybody knows that the world is running into an extremely serious position about energy and that the steps being taken at present are far from adequate <e> <s> in general you can deal with problems of this kind in only two ways either by using the market mechanism or by some form of planning which in this case would be rationing <e> <s> as it is an international problem it seems to me that an individual country which is willing to use rationing is likely to lose unless other countries are doing the same thing <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a subject which we in your lordships house have often discussed usually in connection with more general economic problems <e> <s> but because we have often <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by associating myself with the tributes paid particularly to our chairman <e> <s> most of us i suppose have had a good deal of committee experience and all are aware how essential it is that the chairman should have a thorough grasp of the agenda <e> <s> in the case of sub-committee a of which i have the honour to be a member the subject matter is extremely complex and difficult as anyone who cares to read this report will see <e> <s> this is only a sample of the kind of thing we have to deal with and the fact that we are steered so well with that sense of timing the ability to say snap <e> <s> which is so important to a committee and which requires this complete understanding is a great tribute to the ability with which our chairman has had to do his very excessive homework <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much agree with the noble viscount <e> <s> i am not trying to underestimate the difficulty of the task <e> <s> i have sat down but i cannot resist quoting another example which was part of the ems negotiations <e> <s> the french stuck out and wanted to have the monetary compensation amounts eliminated <e> <s> the germans did not want that but said we will agree to eliminate them so long as you agree that the amount received by the farmers will never be any less <e> <s> it is a difficult problem <e> <s> if we want to carry this country with us and stay in the common market we must face that there are good arguments now against being in the community arguments of a kind that you could refute at one time but you cannot refute so easily today <e>", "<cs> my lords i read that <e> <s> the assembled farmers of them unanimously disagreed with him <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister not agree that the white paper which has formed the basis of our attempts at full employment calls for particular attention to the necessity for collaboration in the reduction of restrictive practices but that in spite of all efforts the problem has got worse rather than better <e> <s> will he not also agree that that accounts for the gradual decline in the rate of growth of the gnp <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that a very large number of people who would be prepared to let their houses or part of their houses are afraid to do so because of the restrictions of the rent acts <e> <s> if those acts could be modified in such a way that at least some of this property could come on to the market it would very much reduce the speculation to which the noble lord lord janner referred <e>", "<cs> my lords the debate has already gone on rather a long time and i hope to be brief although one always finds on rising to ones feet that <e>", "<cs> my lords i like the noble lord lord shinwell have had the privilege of serving on one of the sub-committees of the european communities committee <e> <s> from the picture which the noble lord gave to us i did not recognise what goes on in those sub-committees <e> <s> my own feeling and experience is that both the select committee representing your lordships house and the members of the european parliament are trying to make something work and that it is enormously helpful to both sides to be able to put some colour into what otherwise are rather difficult and stodgy documents <e> <s> i have not the slightest doubt that we and therefore to the extent that we serve your lordships house your lordships house have benefited a great deal from these contacts <e> <s> a good many members of this house were members of the european parliament though unfortunately there are not so many of them now <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> my lords while congratulating the government on these very modest steps announced today may i ask whether the minister would not agree that the most urgent task for the whole of western industrial society is to get the maximum economies in the use of oil and the maximum pressure for the development of substitutes for it <e> <s> from that point of view the faster the oil prices rise the better and the more hope we have of surviving the crisis and the more we shall be doing for our successors <e> <s> there is one more point <e> <s> there is no need for these things to give a twist to the infllationary spiral because government receipts that go up because of increases in the price of oil will reduce the other financial requirements of the government and if you do not want to affect the cost of living you could reduce other indirect taxation exactly <e>", "<cs> my lords i was at one time economic adviser to the <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much agree with what the noble lord is saying about incomes policy but it would help if he could explain how this government could carry it through when the tuc turned it down as regards the last government <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i am right in saying that i am the first speaker who is not actually a member of the committee and therefore i feel freer than the previous speakers have been perhaps to say what a very good set of reports has been produced <e> <s> they are very substantial though i cannot say i have read every word of them and indeed i think that the summary and conclusions are very helpful to anybody who knows even only a small amount about the subject <e> <s> i think the house ought to be grateful to both lord walston and his committee for all the hard work that they have obviously done <e> <s> i sit on another sub-committee and there i feel that we ought to be very grateful for the great trouble that all the witnesses take <e> <s> they are all willing to come and to answer questions and it is quite clear that these reports from your lordships house are documents which are very highly considered and authoritative if not in this country then in community circles <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether this is the best way to do it but i hope the government will look very sympathetically at the problem raised by the noble baroness <e> <s> the figures which have been referred to several times of the amounts not taken up from the various kinds of social security available make it absolutely clear that there is a real difficulty here which ought i think to be attended to <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the tremendous amount of time and effort involved not only of the members of your lordships house but of civil servants and all the bodies which give evidence to us may i ask whether the government think that that time and effort which is being put in on the whole company law programme is justified <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say what is likely to be the united kingdom contribution to the common fund <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to associate myself with everything that has been said about the noble lord lord ohagan <e> <s> it was most refreshing and most interesting to hear directly from someone who is a member of the european parliament and although this is very far from being a maiden speech perhaps i could use the time-honoured formula used for such speeches and say that i hope we shall hear a great deal from the noble lord on some other occasions <e> <s> it was most interesting <e>", "<cs> i know very little about new towns <e> <s> i had the impression that the government put up the money for them <e> <s> i must say that what we have heard so far is very disquieting and i hope that the minister will give us something of the background <e> <s> as your lordships know i am an economist and one of the first lessons you learn when you get on to the subject of taxation is that one of the canons of taxation is certainty that everybody should know what they have to pay <e> <s> on the face of it this looks as if the secretary of state could just make up his mind what he is going to levy <e> <s> i see that in subsection some of it can be treated as repayment but i take it that since the minister has to get these powers now the new towns are something more than just a creature of his from whom he can recover anything he likes <e> <s> that is all <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not something of a contradiction in the governments anti-inflation policy that monopoly industries should be allowed <e>", "<cs> my lords i spoke and voted against the government on this amendment <e> <s> my point was a much more general one <e> <s> i took it that since the bill has to give these powers to the secretary of state the relationship between him and the new commissions is <e>", "<cs> my lords may i <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by associating myself with the tributes paid to our two maiden speakers <e> <s> we are very fortunate that what i think is turning out to be a most interesting debate is adorned by two such distinguished speeches <e> <s> when the gracious speech discussed home affairs it began with the statement that the central aim of the government was the control of inflation <e> <s> i want to speak mainly about that <e> <s> several speakers especially the noble lord lord thorneycroft reminded your lordships of the great variety of views among economists <e> <s> when he spoke it struck me that if he had a little more time for reading he could always laugh because there are always opposed sides on every question <e> <s> so one set must be standing on their heads all the time <e>", "<cs> i too should like to give some support to the noble lord lord spens <e> <s> i do not know anything about the technicalities involved but i think that a government which says that it wants to encourage small businessmen and is very anxious to do things for them ought to look at the bearing of the exemption limits <e> <s> of course it is much more noticeable with vat where i think the lower exemption limit is quite ridiculously small <e> <s> it seems extraordinary that with inflation going on so fast the lower limit has moved up only by on <e> <s> i do not know whether the noble lord lord spens intends to press this amendment to a division but the point i want to make is that there is a strong feeling among small businessmen that there is a disparity between what the <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just add one word of welcome for the statement made by the minister <e> <s> in particular i think we should welcome the mark of confidence in the industrial future of this country which is so badly needed at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords i must begin by apologising to the house for having to leave before the end of the debate and i apologise especially to the noble earl lord ferrers <e> <s> my difficulty arises because i was misinformed about the enthusiasm that was likely to be generated by the matrimonial homes family protection scotland bill <e>", "<cs> my lords that is most kind of the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i was hoping to support the amendment <e> <s> i am very much in favour of it <e> <s> however our attention has been called by the noble lord lord gisborough to the dangers which are in the word existing <e> <s> if to include the word existing is taken to mean that the whole pattern that exists at any moment is frozen then there may be something in the feeling that this condition would prevent the good management of the woodlands <e> <s> i wonder whether the government will accept the suggestion which has already been made that some other word such as equivalent may be substituted keeping the meaning <e> <s> however if it is the case that the word existing is too restrictive and would freeze the pattern then perhaps this matter could be looked at <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to congratulate the noble lord lord constantine of stanmore on his maiden speech <e> <s> it ought to be a lesson to us all although i am afraid it will not be followed <e> <s> to be able to make a real point in a three-minute speech seems to me a magnificent performance <e> <s> i feel a little like a maiden speaker myself at the moment because this is the first time that i have addressed your lordships house as a member of a political party <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not agree that the supplementary benefit scheme was designed for conditions quite different from those which obtain today <e> <s> when it was arranged it was extremely likely that anybody out of work could get a job but nobody can say that the million who are unemployed can get jobs <e> <s> is not that the difference in the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i too welcome the initiative taken by the noble lord lord spens in discussing various aspects of the most important economic subject of today that of unemployment <e> <s> i very much agree with several of his suggestions which i think one could describe as making the labour market rather more free and the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter has made the same point <e> <s> there is no doubt that the labour market is now far too cluttered up with all sorts of difficulties and regulations which are helping to make the whole economy more paralysed than it ought to be at a time when we are moving into a period when we need to be as flexible as we can possibly be <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am grateful to the noble lord lord ohagan for giving us this opportunity to discuss this very important subject which as we have been reminded several times in this debate has been before your lordships on several other occasions the most recent one was the one that lord banks and lord soames referred to the debate introduced by lord soames himself <e> <s> at that time while i was in favour of joining the ems i had some hesitations because of the timing <e> <s> it seemed to me then that there were difficulties about our own position which made it rather risky to join just then <e> <s> since then i have become a wholehearted supporter not only of our joining but of doing it as soon as possible <e> <s> all the speakers who have spoken so far have been enthusiastic supporters and i am left with very little to say on the subject but i will perhaps try to add a few words <e>", "<cs> i rise to support the amendment now proposed by the noble lord lord spens <e> <s> he set out in the second reading debate the case that he has just been elaborating <e> <s> i have always thought that was a most extraordinary feature of the tax system for the reasons he has given <e> <s> the stamp contribution that the self-employed person makes is a benefit and it is reasonable that you should pay for benefits out of your income <e> <s> but the other part is a pure cost on any definition i cannot remember the ones one gets in connection with ones personal income of wholly necessary and so on but clearly this falls under that very strict one <e> <s> the self-employed person has to pay this tax and he gets no benefit from it at all <e> <s> yet he is not allowed to charge it as a cost <e> <s> it is quite illogical <e> <s> i remember when a labour government i think actually introduced this and i was attacking the noble lord lord wells-pestell about it <e> <s> all he could say at the end was well we need the money <e> <s> and that is what happens <e> <s> but for a conservative government who go round the country saying what great things are going to be done for the self-employed person and that they are looking to the activities of the self-employed person to persist in this is something that i cannot understand <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister satisfied that the present rate of defence capacity will remain at full efficiency which certainly was not the case for some years under the old arrangement <e>", "<cs> my lords i must join every other speaker in welcoming the opportunity given to us by the noble lord lord oram to discuss this very important subject <e> <s> he put down so many things to which he wanted to call attention that one has to be a bit selective <e> <s> by far the most important in my view is the reference to population and i entirely agree with the noble lord lord robbins about that <e> <s> we are heading inevitably for a most disastrous situation and it is very depressing when you think about the troubles of developing countries to see how often all we are doing is stopping two people from dying so that four people can die in the next generation <e> <s> that is the simplest way of putting the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as i followed the noble lord i think that my argument would support what he has said <e>", "<cs> my lords i join the noble lord lord mottistone in welcoming the initiative of the noble lord lord spens in introducing the bill and even if your lordships do not give it a second reading i think we should nevertheless be very glad of an opportunity to discuss this subject because i believe that the whole attitude represented by the wages councils needs looking at again <e> <s> i should make it clear that i am speaking only for myself <e> <s> the social democratic party has not i think reached so precise a view as the noble baroness lady seear seems to have done <e> <s> as your lordships will know the sdp is committed to an incomes policy when it comes to power and it will then have to decide whether or not it will need something like wages councils <e> <s> but in my view it is quite certain that a new incomes policy will be one in which in all wage bargaining the public interest is much more closely represented than it is at present <e> <s> so even if there are wages councils they will be different from what they are today <e> <s> but as i say i am not able to use the term we on these benches <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way for a moment <e> <s> i made it perfectly clear that i was speaking for myself and not for the social democratic party <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the minister agree that the balance of payments tends to be much better the more depressed the economy becomes just as it tends to get much worse when the economy is over-stimulated <e> <s> would he not agree that although this is a very splendid performance in a depressed world it is to some extent the other side of a coin that is not so attractive <e>", "<cs> my lords i begin by associating myself with all those who welcome the opportunity given to us by my noble friend lord kilmarnock to discuss this very important subject which is part of the whole question of what is to happen to the next generation <e> <s> but i feel some diffidence in addressing your lordships on this subject because unlike all the previous speakers i have had practically no direct experience of youth unemployment <e> <s> the first part of my life was spent in the university world and even in those days a university degree was very nearly a passport to employment <e> <s> in the second part of my life when i was in public service i spent a great deal of my time in advising the government about problems of full employment <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps we can now return to another much longer-term problem <e> <s> the house is indebted to the noble lord lord vaizey for being given the opportunity to discuss this important matter <e> <s> let me begin by adding my congratulations to those of the noble lord lord robbins to the noble lord lord coleraine he will hardly believe me when i say that i hung on every word that he said <e> <s> i am afraid that this may sound very fulsome but the <e>", "<cs> my lords i must begin as other speakers have by congratulating the noble lord lord gormley on his magnificent maiden speech <e> <s> i hope we shall hear from him again shortly <e> <s> your lordships are probably sorry at having to listen to three economists in succession <e> <s> i will not follow i cannot call them my noble friends but they are certainly my old friends the noble lords lord kaldor and lord vaizey in their interesting contributions <e> <s> i have always felt on hearing an economic argument that i would rather read it before saying much about it <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that that is right and if i said that we have the highest level i stand corrected <e>", "<cs> my lords i must confess that when the committee whose report we are discussing was first established i was rather doubtful about the wisdom of your lordships in setting up a committee to deal with such a complicated and such a political subject as unemployment where there is a sharp division between the political parties <e> <s> i thought there was a real danger that either the report would consist of a series of disagreed recommendations which is the only way in which your lordships can have a minority report or would comprise a lot of unexceptionable platitudes <e> <s> i must apologise for those sceptical or uncharitable thoughts because the report that we have before us is i believe a great credit to your lordships house to the committee itself and in particular to the noble baroness <e> <s> we all knew that she was a formidable character but i think that we were underestimating her abilities <e> <s> to produce a report that is agreed which says so many good things and which covers the ground so well is a great achievement and i congratulate your lordships the committee and the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has done as well as could be expected in the unfortunate situation in which we are but the problem is that of the world recession which is making this sort of trouble happen in most industries and in most parts of the world <e> <s> what is needed is some concerted attempt to get the world out of this recession <e> <s> it has been said that we should have a debate in this house about the future of the steel industry <e> <s> it would however be a very unhelpful debate as we have no idea at present what the outlook will be <e> <s> the minister said at the end of the statement that <e>", "<cs> my lords i have rather more sympathy with the government than the two previous speakers <e> <s> on the last occasion when we discussed this subject the noble lord lord obrien who probably knows more about it than anyone else in your lordships house said how impossible it is to make a correct judgment and i think that the combination of this and amersham shows how right he was <e> <s> the government had advice from six merchant banks and they could hardly have gone any further than that <e> <s> they also had the good sense to have it underwritten <e> <s> so i do not think it was such an unfortunate affair as all that <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg your lordships pardon <e> <s> there is one question that i want to ask <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble lord the minister could tell us if the proceeds of this operation will go to reduce the public sector borrowing requirement and if not what will they go for <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mottistone in his admirable opening speech began by saying that this was a very important debate and i should like to begin by stressing that we are debating something that is much more important than the position of agriculture and things such as prices <e> <s> the position of the cap has very wide repercussions indeed and those repercussions will continue to be felt so it is important for your lordships to be able to discuss them <e> <s> i am not a member of sub-committee d and therefore i do not think it is out of place for me to say what admirable reports they produce on this subject <e> <s> this years report is perhaps a little more technical than usual and it assumes a general knowledge of the background but both in its analysis and its recommendations i think it strikes an admirable balance <e> <s> we are very indebted to the sub-committee for the hard work they do and especially under timetable pressure as they were this year <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble lord lord soames for giving us the opportunity to debate this important subject <e> <s> he has spoken about it a number of times in your lordships house and we on the alliance benches agree with almost everything he said today <e> <s> we wish him well and we hope that he will continue to say it although i am afraid that so far he has not received much change from his noble friends or at any rate from his front bench <e>", "<cs> my lords i also am a member of sub-committee a which was responsible for this report but i do not feel any misgivings in endorsing what the noble lord lord sherfield has said about the excellence of the report itself <e> <s> your lordships house is much more indebted than it sometimes realises to the scrutiny committee which looks at all the relevant activities of the eec and it is well-known that the reports of that committee of which this is an example have a very considerable reputation in community circles <e> <s> having had a long experience in my life of reports of this kind i have no hesitation in saying that that high reputation will be maintained by this report <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise only to support what the noble lord the minister and the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran have already said <e> <s> subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords docs the ministers reply to the previous supplementary question mean that the government are indifferent to the effect of the exchange rate on competitiveness <e>", "<cs> my lords i sympathise so much with what the noble lord lord ezra said at the beginning of his remarks that it was a bold man who was going to speak at all in a debate which was begun by two past chief secretaries <e> <s> of course i remember very well working with the noble and learned lord <e> <s> lord simon but i do not feel quite so much afraid of him because he pointed out as i would do that his memory is a little vague <e> <s> i thought that when he got on to the consolidated fund he was going to defend the present practice but during the progress of his speech he got more and more on to the fundamental question that of using the seed corn <e>", "<cs> my lords in a debate of this nature where we are discussing a report it is difficult to think of something to say which has not been said already <e> <s> i was very much struck by a remark of the noble lord lord cockfield that some of the things which are happening now are happening in a way which is decreasing the stability of the community <e> <s> that remark ought to be borne in mind when we consider all the problems <e> <s> largely with that in mind may i say a few words about each of the problems <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all grateful to the noble lord lord wilson of rievaulx for introducing a debate on the crucial economic problems of our time <e> <s> as your lordships will know only too well we have talked about this subject already a great deal and no doubt today we shall mainly repeat arguments that we have put forward in the past <e> <s> but i do not think that that is any criticism of the noble lord <e> <s> it is the most important problem <e> <s> nothing is being done about it and unless the people who are critical about the level of unemployment keep on being critical about it we are in danger of letting it be overlooked altogether which i think would delight the benches opposite <e>", "<cs> my lords i would still maintain my point of view <e> <s> we have heard from the noble lord lord kaldor and from the noble earl lord longford something about the origin of the present position <e> <s> neither noble lord is in his place so will not have to listen to me going over it again but i would say to the rest of your lordships those who have been good enough to remain that as they pointed out the policy of high and stable employment was the agreed policy of the coalition government in the white paper <e> <s> as they also pointed out that was the policy of all governments from the end of the war until about or when as the conservatives are fond of reminding us mr healey was forced largely by the imf to become a sort of weak monetarist <e> <s> i myself do not think that it ought to be any comfort to the benches opposite that mr healey started this <e> <s> it was important at the time as i am going to say but nobody would suppose that mr healey would drive it to the present position <e> <s> because one or two doses of medicine are good for you it does not mean that the more <e>", "<cs> my lords my argument is that if you can only get this sort of situation by having a great deal of unemployment we are bound to have high unemployment for a very long time and i am asking whether we cannot do better than that <e> <s> what this government are doing is to have a half-hearted sort of incomes policy <e> <s> they have not thrown it to the winds <e> <s> they are trying to impose on their own employees much lower rates than are being accepted anywhere else <e> <s> i think all previous history shows that a disparity in wage rates which is set up in this way produces a very unstable position and i do not think it will be very long before the workers in the national health service in the schools and the civil service in the whole of the welfare state apparatus drop so far behind that they cannot stand it any longer and then if we have nothing else we shall get leapfrogging again <e> <s> so i think there is that distortion in the system <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord the minister not agree that the general trade pattern is one of multilateralism and that you cannot deduce very much from attempting to look at bilateral balances <e>", "<cs> my lords all the speakers tonight except one have been very highly privileged in being allowed to speak in the debate which has contained the maiden speech of that one remaining person <e> <s> like a good maiden speaker he succeeded in being non-controversial <e> <s> however he ventured to remind your lordships that when he was prime minister this country enjoyed both the lowest inflation and the lowest unemployment <e> <s> at that time i was fortunate in being economic adviser to the government so i saw quite a lot of mr macmillan as he then was when he was chancellor <e> <s> but during my -year period of office he was the only prime minister who was interested in <e>", "<cs> my lords during the fourth day of the debate on the address almost all the speakers spoke about unemployment and the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos has put down his name for another general debate on th december <e> <s> i think that we must get used to this <e> <s> i think it is right that we should go on talking about unemployment even if we have to say the same things over and over again simply because it is the major problem at the moment <e> <s> but i was glad to read the motion put down by the noble lord lord balfour of inchrye because he was concentrating on a particular aspect of the subject and i think that when there are between million and million unemployed it is very good for us to have to think sometimes about particular people because we <e>", "<cs> my lords if the minister will allow me to intervene those figures are very encouraging but do they all apply to the people in the category we are discussing tonight <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister able to tell us whether the increase between this year and the next few years will be in real terms <e> <s> in other words will there be more or will it merely be keeping up with inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to ask the minister just one question <e> <s> in view of the competition involved am i right in thinking that these are contracts which will not be subject to reference to the review board on government contracts <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we must recognise the tremendous importance of the subject that has been opened up today and all that is in the green paper will no doubt be very widely discussed <e> <s> i should like to congratulate the government on grasping this nettle at last in a way which is so full of promise <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by saying how much i agree with one of the early points made by the noble lord lord henderson and made earlier still in almost exactly the same words by the noble lord lord foot which is how very fortunate it is that the ministry of transport did not make up its mind a long time ago to respect the views about the national park <e> <s> if it had taken that course the bypass would have been built long ago and we would not be having the troubles that we are having now <e>", "<cs> my lords like all the other speakers we have heard so far i think we should welcome the initiative of the noble lord lord jacques in introducing another debate on unemployment <e> <s> we have had a good many and we shall have a good many more <e> <s> that is because it is the most important and difficult subject that we have before us <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the minister agree that the whole problem of forestry especially for european countries has become much more difficult and important in the past few years because of the rapid destruction of the great forests in other parts of the world <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree that the most serious aspect of this matter is the drain to the united states where the salaries and conditions are so much better than they are in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords are we to take it now that since the government cannot identify money they have lost all control over the monetary system <e>"]
