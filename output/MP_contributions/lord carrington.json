["<cs> my lords in answer to both the noble lord lord gladwyn and the noble lord lord goronwy-roberts i was greatly encouraged by the statement made by mr mugabes broadcast on the one-oclock news <e> <s> it seems to me that if that is the policy which mr mugabe intends to follow that does lead to the reconciliation which is so very necessary in rhodesia at the present time and certainly it will be the object of the government as i said in the statement to help in the transition period <e>", "<cs> my lords i would like if i may to echo what my noble friend has said about the leader of the house <e> <s> he was sniped at and <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to general walls i am afraid i do not know whether mr mugabe has asked him to stay on but i do know what a very constructive and sensible part general walls has played in very difficult circumstances during the whole of the lancaster house conference and the campaign <e> <s> with regard to the noble lords first question i think congratulations are due only when we see that the outcome of all this has been a free and fair multiracial society operating in peaceful conditions <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> as i said earlier i think that what mr mugabe said both during the election campaign and what he said at one oclock is a good augury for the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord lord peart but as i said earlier i do not think that success will have been achieved until we see what happens in the new zimbabwe <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not agree with the noble lord lord paget of northampton that what happened at lancaster house led inevitably to the defeat of bishop muzorewa at the election <e> <s> i do not agree with that <e> <s> one must remember that all the parties <e>", "<cs> my lords aid and future policy towards zimbabwe must of course wait for future discussion with mr mugabe <e> <s> however there are certain matters to which we are committed for example land resettlement <e> <s> however we must think of all these matters in the context of our own position here at home <e> <s> i shall certainly look at what the noble lord has said <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is particularly generous because not only do i think that he does not much admire her majestys government but i do not think that he much admires me either <e> <s> so i am particularly grateful to him for his generous words <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the noble lords first question i think that the result of the election does reflect very fairly or as fairly as it can in a situation like this what the people of rhodesia/zimbabwe want <e> <s> it is now up to those who have the power to use it justly in the interests of everyone <e> <s> i shall if i may look into the last question <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that i had made it fairly plain in the answers i had given that so far the election had been free and fair and that it would be successful only if the new government uses the powers that it has for the benefit of all the people of the country and justly and wisely in a multiracial society <e> <s> i have made that clear <e> <s> i entirely agree with what the noble lord says <e> <s> as a matter of fact i think that the noble lord is wrong about mr mugabes russian connections <e> <s> in point of fact it was very largely from the chinese that mr mugabe derived his weapons and it was mr nkomo who got them from the russians <e>"]
