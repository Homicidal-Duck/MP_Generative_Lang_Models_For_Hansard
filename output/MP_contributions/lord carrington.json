["<cs> my lords it is undeniable that the result of this matter was not unwelcome but there is only a certain amount of money to go round and i think it better if we use the money to help the poor in the underdeveloped countries <e>", "<cs> not to my knowledge my lords but perhaps that supplementary question would be better addressed to members of the noble lords own party <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as i know it was without it <e>", "<cs> yes my lords the noble lord is absolutely right <e> <s> that is exactly what i have said and of course we give large amounts of aid to tanzania for the purposes of development and of relieving poverty <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have already said we are helping tanzania in the development of its economy and in aiding the poor in the underdeveloped

governments position clear and i think that that is where we stand <e>", "<cs> my lords this is for me an agreeable occasion because it is the first time for over five years that i have addressed your lordships from this side of the house and although over these past five years we have become accustomed to seeing the labour party on this side of the house and have come to regard most of them with affection and respect i must confess that i have even more affection and respect for them when they sit on the other side of the house <e> <s> of course there is an added advantage after far too long a period of deprivation we on this side of the house can see as well as hear noble lords on the liberal benches <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord will forgive me for intervening on a matter of the habits of the house not the merits of what he is saying <e> <s> i believe that as a general rule we never refer to conversations which we have with other noble lords outside the house <e> <s> if it were to be a general practice that what we said in the corridors outside were repeated on the floor of the house it would make our civilised communication very difficult indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord lord hatch of lusby in common with all of us in this house hopes to see a peaceful settlement of the rhodesia problem <e> <s> there are very delicate consultations taking place this week <e> <s> my noble friend lord harlech went yesterday to speak to the front-line presidents and mr derek day is already in salisbury speaking to bishop muzorewa <e>

report <e>", "<cs> my lords there are some who think that and others who do not <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord would like to put down a question on that i will seek to answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords not without notice <e>", "<cs> my lords i have noticed what the president said in what was a judicial determination <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord also read the entire statement that the president made because he also said that he thought the elections were reasonably and fairly conducted and that there has been great progress made in rhodesia <e> <s> equally i have had conversations in the last few weeks with mr vance and i have no doubt that the american administration is supporting the proposals and the action that her majestys government are now taking <e>", "<cs> my lords her majestys government hope for a settlement which has the widest possible international recognition <e>", "<cs> my lords there was a difference in the test of acceptability <e> <s> one was an election and the other was not <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord lord hatch of lusby has read the <e>", "<cs> my lords the figures that i have been given show that over the past two years the average family income in hongkong has increased <e>", "<cs> my lords the whole house will agree with what the noble lord lord goronwy-roberts has said in the latter part of his supplementary question <e> <s> it is compounded by the fact that there is an equal number of illegal chinese immigrants coming into hong kong so the position of the government of hong kong is very difficult indeed <e> <s> the fact is that every year they are providing housing for between and people <e> <s> one should congratulate the hong kong government on what they have done in very difficult circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords that is true as i understand it in the private housing sector <e> <s> there is nothing very much that anybody can do if a landlord and a tenant agree to disregard the rent control <e> <s> there is not very much that a government can do about that <e> <s> the fact still remains that the whole of government housing and per cent <e> <s> of the private sector is rent-controlled <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i shall be visiting hong kong <e>", "<cs> my lords the government accept the gleneagles agreement which was an agreement made between commonwealth heads of government <e>", "<cs> my lords all these

reasons why we should get on with this as quickly as possible <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord brockway <e> <s> i would however say this about the national assembly what-ever we may feel about

five as the noble lord lord goronwy-roberts knows very well were accepted by swapo by the frontline states by the south african government <e> <s> what we now have to face is that subsequently there has been an interpretation of one part of that agreement with which the south africans do not agree <e> <s> the purpose of my conversation with the south african foreign minister was to start a dialogue going again on those points with which the south african government do not agree <e>", "<cs> my lords i think all these proposals have to be discussed and if the noble lord with his fertile mind has any other ideas about how this can be resolved they will be gratefully received <e>", "<cs> my lords unfortunately no <e>", "<cs> my lords i am at the moment reviewing the whole question of our policy in regard to spain and gibraltar and of course this will figure very largely in the review <e> <s> i am sure that there must be very early efforts to settle the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i must frankly tell the noble lord that in the seven or eight weeks since the government were elected we have not made much advance in this direction <e> <s> as i told my noble friend we are reviewing the whole matter <e> <s> of course our relations with spain and gibraltar must be viewed in the context of our relations as a whole <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the first part of my noble friends

whole of the responsibility for what is happening <e> <s> of course the government who were instrumental in calling the conference wish to make it a success and we are discussing what more we can do <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know yet whether the vietnamese government have accepted or not <e>", "<cs> yes my lords if i may answer the last question first i think that perhaps the right thing to do is to make a statement to the house after the conference has taken place on th july when we shall have more of an idea of what other people have been doing to help and what other countries can do to help <e> <s> perhaps i can then say more than i am able to say this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the last question is yes <e> <s> i agree with what the noble lord said <e> <s> sometimes i am appalled at the double standards that people have about these matters <e> <s> i wonder what would have happened if we in this country had pushed off into the north sea half a million of the people who were not ethnically our own <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i could not say that without notice <e> <s> i believe that about or countries have been asked <e> <s> this is within the compass of the secretary-generals arrangements and it is not for her majestys government to decide who is asked <e> <s> i think that the soviet union have been asked and speaking without notes i have an idea that they have refused to come <e> <s> i am not sure about china <e>", "<cs> my lords the conference is very largely directed to the humanitarian aspects of the problem and not to the political aspects though i think it is inevitable and indeed right that during the conference it will be made abundantly plain at any rate by her majestys government where they think that the blame lies but it is predominently humanitarian <e> <s> all the aspects about which the noble lord is speaking will be taken into consideration <e> <s> there have been suggestions about various places being used as temporary locations where the refugees can go <e> <s> but i do not think any of them has been processed very far so far <e>", "<cs> my lords resolutions calling for sanctions against rhodesia

first supplementary question <e> <s> as regards the second i have no <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness is quite right about the zambians using transport through rhodesia and getting food from south africa <e> <s> it is badly needed there because the zambian economy is not in a good way <e> <s> there would not be anybody in your lordships house who in the circumstances would do other than try to help the zambians <e>", "<cs> my lords that also is a fact <e>", "<cs> no my lords no embargoed oil is allowed to be sent <e>", "<cs> no my lords there has been a specific undertaking by bp that the oil will not go to rhodesia <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i do not know the answer to the second part of the question <e> <s> in answer to the first part of the question we look forward to working with the newly-elected and democratically-elected president of ghana <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for what he has said and i think the whole house will share in his wishes <e> <s> it is interesting to note that after the representations made by the high commissioner and by the eec in accra flight lieutenant rawlings in a broadcast on th june said that ghana would not abandon her traditional respect for the rule of law and the principles of justice and human rights <e> <s> i think that was a clear indication that there would be no further incidents <e>", "<cs> my lords i could not on behalf of any other government anywhere give any promises about anything <e>", "<cs> my lords no agreement has been reached <e> <s> her majestys government will continue to pursue a negotiated settlement <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is of course quite right about the united nations and in common with noble lords opposite we all of us want to see a settlement here

there is going to be an election in belize in the not very distant future <e> <s> perhaps we shall have a better idea after that about what the situation is likely to be <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much regret that i could not without notice but i will write to the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords for what they have said and i think they echo the sentiments of the whole house over this matter <e> <s> both asked about the vietnamese government <e> <s> the vietnamese government have been asked and are going to attend the conference <e> <s> consequently they will be able to hear for themselves what is said <e> <s> of course the conference is predominantly a humanitarian conference but certainly i cannot believe as the noble lord lord goronwy-roberts said that one can divorce this matter into two the source of the problem is the vietnamese government and it is right that we should say so and bring home to them the enormity of what is happening <e>

kong or malaysia <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the chinese will be represented but i am not quite sure about the soviet government <e> <s> certainly my impression has been that the soviet government and the countries of eastern europe do not recognise that there is a problem <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a real problem and indeed there have been considerable difficulties facing british shipowners as a result of it <e> <s> i hope very much that the geneva conference may be able to do something to help in this particular regard <e> <s> i will look into the other flatter that the noble lord raises <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know of any different views about the responsibility for what has happened but i entirely agree with the noble lord that the conference is a humanitarian conference and must come up with some solutions which are on a scale to deal with the problem <e> <s> certainly her majestys governments intention is precisely that as was shown in my statement <e> <s> i think it very important that there should be an adequate follow-up <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the voluntary organisations ought to take heart from the fact that almost everyone who has asked questions has paid tribute to them and i do not know that it would be possible to deal with this matter were it not for them <e>", "<cs> my lords we have an embassy representation in vietnam and obviously we receive from them a good account of what is happening <e> <s> regarding the noble lords second question of course one must have regard to the causes of problems and the history of a country but i believe that in any other situation noble lords opposite and noble lords on this side of the house would say that this was a blatant exhibition of racialism <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right that there have been press reports and rumours from time to time about the soviet union importing chrome <e> <s> but the government have no firm evidence that that is so <e> <s> however if it were so it would be iniquitous <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of that evidence <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords it was not my question <e>", "<cs> my lords in the case of rhodesia the question is not one of recognition but of the granting of legal independence to a country for which britain has a constitutional responsibility <e> <s> our intention is to bring rhodesia to independence with the widest possible international acceptance <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend will remember that we had quite a long debate on the rhodesia problem last week <e> <s> much as i would like to add to what i had to say on that occasion i really do not think that i can <e>", "<cs> my lords just off the top of my head so to speak i would say kenya <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in the original answer there is a difference between recognising a government and giving independence <e> <s> there are certain criteria for recognising governments which though they are in some degree applicable to giving independence to a country are not always wholly the same <e>", "<cs> my lords the people of this country were shocked by the political trials and executions in iran

statement with the nine <e> <s> we are somewhat encouraged by the <e>", "<cs> my lords as a matter of fact we have protested on several occasions to the iranian government <e> <s> i had not heard what the noble lord has told me and i will of course consider what else we can do <e> <s> one does have to remember that sometimes if one goes on protesting it is counter-productive <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord that there is an urgency about this matter and i am very glad that sir james murray is taking over as the envoy of the five at any rate for the time being and that he will soon be going to pretoria <e> <s> i think that he will canvass with the south african government all the possible solutions to the difficulties <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that is a different question <e>", "<cs> my lords he is the envoy of the five with powers naturally <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments policy in relation to rhodesia was set out in my speech of th july <e> <s> the commonwealth heads of government meeting at lusaka will provide an opportunity for the government to carry forward our consultations <e> <s> when they have been completed it will be the governments intention to put forward proposals designed to bring rhodesia to legal independence with wide international acceptance <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments policies and intentions remain as they were in my speech on th july <e>", "<cs> my lords i noticed what happened at monrovia <e>", "<cs> my lords i was asked a question as to what our policy was in respect of the zimbabwe-rhodesia issue and i have said that our policy before we meet at lusaka next week was set out in my speech of th july and i really do not think i want to go any further at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware that there are those who think that <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i could honestly disagree with much of what the noble lord has said <e> <s> the difficulty is that if the government are seeking to restrain public expenditure cuts will have to be made probably almost everywhere and we must seek to minimise whatever damage might be done by the cuts <e> <s> there will be cuts in plans for increased expenditure not in the actuality but any cuts in the bbcs external services will be very carefully negotiated and discussions will take place with the bbc itself <e>", "<cs> i think that that would be rather a drastic way of putting it my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i am well aware of the feeling that exists about the external services of the bbc and my noble friend is quite right to remind me of it <e> <s> but of course everybody can always make out a very good case as to why their particular areas of interest should not be cut or have proposed increases restrained and the government have to take an overall view of these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords i will of course bear all these considerations in mind and they will be the reasons for the discussions we shall have with the bbc <e> <s> but i would remind the noble baroness that of course the previous governments plans were to cut the bbc external services <e> <s> yes in the white paper that they produced there were plans to cut the vernacular services of the bbc <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i am sure that is true <e>", "<cs> my lords i would hope that that would be the priority not to reduce <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for reminding me of that <e>", "<cs> my lords as an ex-secretary of state for defence i would hesitate to run down the sword <e>", "<cs> we must be very careful clearly my lords where cuts are made <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the truth of the matter is that there will have to be reductions in public expenditure everywhere <e>", "<cs> i did not say that my lords <e> <s> i said we had to make sure that the cuts were not damaging <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think the noble lord knows what the cuts will be so he is not in a position to say how damaging they would be or whether they would be damaging at all <e>", "<cs> my lords the difficulty of that of course is that this is a particular part of the bbc <e> <s> the bbc external services are financed wholly by the government and i think it would be very difficult to do what my noble friend suggests <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say how grateful i am both to the noble lord lord goronwy-roberts and to the noble lord lord gladwyn for their kind remarks and for <e>", "<cs> my lords the objective of the british government at the lancaster house conference is to end the war and that is what we are seeking to do <e> <s> unfortunately since my appeal for a cease-fire was not accepted by the patriotic front although it was accepted by bishop muzorewa one is likely to get this sort of action however regrettable that may be until such time as we can get a cease-fire <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the question of pensions that point is in the constitution and is guaranteed <e> <s> as to the noble lords second question i think these are matters for discussion at lancaster house and i would not care to elaborate on them at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am never slow or loath to join in congratulating and admiring the noble lord opposite <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a very nice tribute <e> <s> i think the noble lord had better wait to see how it all turns out <e> <s> i only wish his appreciation of my chairmanship was shared by all the participants <e>", "<cs> my lords i answered that question when my noble friend lord barnby asked it <e> <s> i said that these obviously are matters for discussion the exact way one does these things is a matter for discussion at lancaster house <e> <s> i do not think that at this particular moment your lordships house is the right place to discuss these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is of course quite right <e> <s> the governor must have a staff when he goes out and these matters are under consideration at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble and learned lord <e> <s> of course i will have a copy put in the library <e> <s> i only hope that it stands up to the noble lords birthday gaze <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords for their approach to the statement that i have made <e> <s> the white paper on the constitution which we have laid for convenience in the printed paper office has of course been available in the library for about a month so i think that any of your lordships who would have cared to could have read it in that time <e> <s> but i thought it would be convenient if it was put in the printed paper office in case any of your lordships had not seen it <e>", "<cs> my lords if there is to be an agreement between all the parties at the conference between the patriotic front and the salisbury delegation it is essential that there should be a ceasefire because if there are to be elections in which everybody takes part

circumstances too short but we are not unfortunately in ideal conditions <e> <s> we have to take into consideration the problems <e> <s> there will be the problem of what i am afraid will necessarily be a fragile ceasefire and there will also be the problems that the british governor will have to face in managing affairs during that period <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord wigg speaks as if it were a foregone conclusion that the rebellion is at an end <e> <s> and the noble lord lord gladwyn was optimistic <e> <s> i must tell your lordships that the patriotic front has not yet accepted

to an end by the good sense and statesmanship of all concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord says that i am doing a balancing act <e> <s> it is about the best description that could possibly be used <e> <s> if you lengthen the period of the election too much you fall off one way <e> <s> if you shorten it too much you fall off the other way <e> <s> the only thing which any of us can do in

free and fair election <e> <s> i think that we have got it right though no doubt there will be arguments both ways <e> <s> but since i am balancing and am still on the tightrope i hope that your lordships will support me <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that settlements are better than representations <e>", "<cs> my lords as soon as there is a settlement in rhodesia none of these things will happen <e> <s> the bill before your lordships this afternoon is designed to aid and to help that situation and i hope that both the noble lord lord hatch of lusby and my noble friend behind me will do their best to expedite the proceedings <e>", "<cs> my lords if the bill which your lordships are being asked to pass this afternoon becomes law and a governor goes to rhodesia then the matter becomes a british responsibility and of course this will stop <e>", "<cs> my lords i have it in command from the queen to acquaint the house that her majesty having been informed of the purport of the southern rhodesia bill has consented to place her prerogative and interest so far as they are affected by the bill at the disposal of parliament for the purposes of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> the effect of this amendment would be to make it impossible for the government to make provision for an independence constitution for zimbabwe except with the consent of all the parties represented at the constitutional conference at lancaster house <e> <s> i believe that this would be an extraordinary provision to incorporate in a statute and it would be wrong for the government to accept this amendment <e>", "<cs> may i just finish my sentence <e> <s> if i may also say so and i should be happy to be corrected i have heard nobody on the opposite side of the committee who has acknowledged the concessions and compromises and the very difficult decisions that the salisbury delegation have taken

the amendment will be <e>", "<cs> i think if i may say so that this is a perfectly reasonable question and amendment and i hope i can answer it without getting the boot put in as the noble and learned lord so elegantly put it <e> <s> the steps leading to independence are normally taken under a constitution previously granted by the united kingdom for internal self-government <e> <s> that is not possible in the case of rhodesia <e> <s> the constitution has been set aside <e> <s> it is therefore necessary to introduce parts of the independence constitution before independence so that the elections can be held for a parliament and government to be formed under the provisions of that constitution <e> <s> i can assure the committee and the noble lord opposite that the government have no intention to use the power to modify those parts of the constitution which are implemented before independence in any sweeping way <e> <s> but the fact of the matter is that in certain important respects the proposals which the government have made for the pre-independence period will require some departure from what will subsequently be the normal constitutional practice <e>", "<cs> i think that amendments nos <e> <s> and really all have the same object which is to require the government to maintain sanctions either by adding un sanctions orders made under section of the act the orders to be saved and continued or by deleting references to powers to deal with the consequences of the expiry of sanctions <e> <s> i wonder whether with your lordships permission because we have so to speak gone round this buoy a number of times already this afternoon i might make an answer in advance of anything that might be said on amendments nos <e> <s> and which i hope if it does not satisfy noble lords opposite will at least serve as an answer <e>", "<cs> if i may make a general statement which i hope will satisfy the noble and learned lord the governments decision on sanctions and the renewal of section of the southern rhodesia act was set out in my statement in the house on th november <e> <s> the government considered their decision against the background of the changes which have taken place in rhodesia in recent months and of the progress which has been made at the constitutional conference <e>", "<cs> without wishing to be discourteous to the noble lord we have discussed this matter through the whole of the afternoon and evening and with very great regret i do not think i can shed much more light on it <e>", "<cs> my lords i tried before this conference started to get all parties to agree to a cease-fire and they did not do so although the rhodesian authorities were prepared to do so <e> <s> when i presented the paper on the cease-fire having agreed the constitutional arrangements and the transitional arrangements i said to the parties concerned that i thought the only way in which we could go forward was to get a cease-fire as quickly as possible otherwise incidents were bound to occur and it would put at risk the whole of this conference <e> <s> and my lords the only conclusion one can draw from what has happened over the past two days is that all parties must address themselves at once to agreeing to a cease-fire <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot express to the house at this <e>", "<cs> my lords everybody in the house deplores any action which increases tension or which causes loss of life and i made it abundantly plain in my first answer what i intend to do this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i had thought that my statement both noble lords have a copy of it was rather more hopeful than they have given me credit for <e> <s> i am meeting the patriotic front and the salisbury delegation fairly shortly in a plenary at lancaster house and i am extremely hopeful that there will be an agreement <e> <s> when there is an agreement as i hope there will be this afternoon i say to your lordships as i said in the statement that only details will then remain to be discussed which i think can be disposed of in two or three days <e> <s> that i think disposes of most of the questions which i have been asked <e> <s> however

agreement was in sight <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank both noble lords for what they have said <e> <s> it is very important <e> <s> my noble friend lord home of the hirsel is clearly right that we should understand the sense of urgency that there must be in this matter if as i hope we get an agreement on the cease-fire this afternoon because if there is no urgency and if everything is allowed

three days with goodwill on both sides there is no reason why they should not be <e> <s> that is what i mean when i say it should be settled in two or three days <e> <s> then i hope that the governor will be there <e> <s> with regard to the question asked by the noble lord lord harris of greenwich i do not envisage british troops going there except when the cease-fire is agreed because there will be no cease-fire to monitor unless there is a cease-fire <e>", "<cs> yes my lords and i hope that is going to happen <e> <s> that is exactly what i have said <e> <s> i would just say this about the fears of the patriotic front i think that they have real fears but i think that the salisbury delegation also have real fears <e> <s> they have real fears of the scale of infiltration which has been taking place from mozambique and from zambia over these last few weeks <e> <s> consequently it is all the more important that the sense of urgency which i have been talking about should be realised by all the parties concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no question of south african units being in rhodesia when there is a british governor and of course the rhodesian air bases will be monitored <e> <s> that is what the monitors are for <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the first thing i should like to do is to thank both noble lords for what they have said about my noble friend lord soames <e>

the noble lord is very kind but we have some difficult times to go through <e> <s> with i hope the help and the determination of every member of your lordships house we shall get through them and come

that there is going to be a cease-fire <e> <s> until such time as there is a cease-fire it will be up to the governor to decide what to do <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is of course quite right <e> <s> there is an enormous amount of distrust on both sides and somewhat naturally if one considers the history of the situation <e> <s> what will happen under the cease-fire proposals is that the rhodesian forces will be asked to disengage first and will go close to the vicinity of their bases <e> <s> after that the patriotic front will be asked to assemble in a number of places with their arms and under their own commanders <e> <s> there are a number of areas to which they will go where they will keep their arms where they will be under their own commanders and where there will be monitors <e> <s> in exactly the same measure this will happen to the rhodesian forces though of course there may be more bases for the rhodesian forces because there are in fact more rhodesians <e> <s> but of course all this depends upon what actually happens during the cease-fire and during the assembly itself <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that that is something which will be in everybodys mind and it will be up not only to the governor but to the observers who will be there <e> <s> i imagine that the world press will be there and then the monitoring forces will be there <e> <s> i cannot believe that rhodesia in these next few weeks is going to be a lonely place <e> <s> i think that there are going to be a great many people there and i hope they will be able to see that intimidation

government had not been prepared to take any risks we should not have got as far as we have <e>", "<cs> my lords it is certainly the intention of her majestys government to seek to resolve this problem and this problem can be resolved only having regard to the british pledge to respect the wishes of the people of gibraltar <e>", "<cs> my lords that perhaps seems to be a rather extravagant way of putting what is no doubt a problem that will arise <e>", "<cs> my lords her majestys government deeply regret this incident which came at the end of the first and very successful visit by a north yemen prime minister <e> <s> however i am glad to inform the house that the aircraft left for sanaa on th january <e> <s> i hope that our two countries can now begin to draw benefit from the

happened but i think it is in the interests both of the west and of the warsaw pact countries to seek to get arms limitation which is advantageous to both sides <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall shortly be making a statement on afghanistan which i fear will be much too long but in answer to my noble friends question i do not think that so far there is any inclination on the part of most members of nato to increase the geographical area for which nato is responsible <e>", "<cs> my lords with your lordships permission i should like to make a statement on afghanistan <e> <s> i apologise for its length <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to both noble lords for what they have said and for the specific assurance by the noble lord lord goronwy-roberts that the sentiments expressed in the

nuclear programme they are undertaking is for peaceful purposes <e> <s> i think that it is the wish of all of us and i am sure that it is the wish of everybody in this house on all sides that no country in the sub-continent would build nuclear weapons <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord referring to the arab-israeli conflict <e>", "<cs> my lords i think perhaps the global situation is a little more complicated at the present time than a geneva conference would settle for the time being <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly <e> <s> i have said that if there is need for a debate then i am

noble lords have referred to the resolution of the security council <e> <s> i must say that i find it ironic that her majestys government who are trying in the most difficult circumstances to hold free and fair elections in rhodesia should be lectured upon whether those elections <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords analysis of the governments policy is totally wrong <e> <s> what the government sought in their rhodesian policy was to bring the war to an end to allow free and fair elections to have them conducted in a peaceful scene and for those who are fair-minded to accept them <e> <s> i

ordinance or by speaking to the leaders of the political parties before the election which is now only a week ahead is to achieve what he can within the limits of his power to do away with that intimidation <e>", "<cs> my lords with your lordships permission i should like to make a statement on overseas aid <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful i think to the noble baroness for her gentle reproach i should like to put it like that <e> <s> i agree with her and i think that the whole house would agree that the more aid we can afford to give to those who are badly off through no fault of their own we should give <e> <s> we should all like to do that and we should all like to see in present circumstances that we get something in return because we have a considerable economic problem here at home <e> <s> but the reality is that we must cut the money that we give to overseas countries according to the resources that we have <e> <s> what we must do is to put our economy in order

cannot afford to pretend that at the moment we are a rich country <e> <s> i do not think that there is anything incompatible in using aid to further your foreign policy <e> <s> i happen to think that our foreign policy is a thoroughly good foreign policy and it is in the interests of the peace of the world that our foreign policy is conducted <e> <s> i believe that to tie our aid to those interests and to use it for developing countries in a way beneficial to them and to us is not discreditable but wholly sensible <e>", "<cs> may i just finish answering one of his questions before the noble lord lord gladwyn has another go <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i will certainly bear in mind what my noble friend has said <e>", "<cs> my lords the exact figures will be published in the white paper

it has i am surprised that her majestys government are trying to cut down on public expenditure <e> <s> it is a well known fact which i draw to the noble lords attention as a result of the tone of his question that if you spend more money than you have you go bankrupt <e>", "<cs> my lords i know of no other country which gives aid and which does not take political consequences into account <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not suggesting that we switched from multilateral into bilateral aid <e> <s> i was trying to redress the balance <e> <s> there are certain areas of multilateral aid where there is no question of our cutting in particular our commitment to the lom convention <e> <s> we have to keep a balance between bilateral and multilateral aid <e>", "<cs> my lords what we are embarked upon is a programme to put the economy of this country right <e> <s> when we have put the economy of this country right we shall then be able to afford to do all those things which the noble lord and i agree are very desirable <e>", "<cs> my lords that is carrying the question rather wider than the statement that i have made <e>", "<cs> my lords since all prohibited immigrants on the list are being allowed in during the very brief period of the governors administration of rhodesia i think it seemed more sensible to allow all immigrants to go in than to revise the list <e> <s> the list consists of prohibited immigrants who are included for other than political reasons <e> <s> the governor made it clear that lord hatch and bishop lamont would be allowed in <e> <s> i understand lady hatch was designated a prohibited immigrant by the previous administration only because under the relevant law it was mandatory for the wife of a prohibited immigrant to be so designated herself <e> <s> the foreign office made the position perfectly plain to bishop lamont before he returned <e> <s> so far as i know there was no misunderstanding <e>", "<cs> my lords as i made clear in my earlier statement the pre-independence period did not seem to the governor or to anyone else the time to interfere with existing regulations <e> <s> it will be for the independence government to determine future immigration procedures <e> <s> as i said to the noble lord lord brockway persons have been placed on the list for a variety of reasons <e> <s> those who have been placed there for what one might call resistance to the former rgime are only one category on the list <e> <s> since nobody has been forbidden to enter rhodesia and the governor has made it plain that both lord hatch and bishop lamont can come in i really think that a great deal of fuss is being caused which is quite unnecessary <e> <s> if i could just finish my reply with regard to the noble lord lord hatch i will of course look at the question of privilege hut if anybody is suggesting that the governor is biased about the noble lord lord hatch i would remind noble lords opposite that in a news conference in lusaka on th january lord hatch said that the governor was too closely associated with the conservative party it was this partys policy to recognise the muzorewa/smith clique and that the elections would not be free and fair <e> <s> this was said on th january almost before the elections started <e> <s> in spite of this somewhat unhelpful observation the governor allowed lord hatch in <e>", "<cs> my lords i do hope that the noble lord is not going to get too ruffled <e> <s> i suggested to the noble lord opposite that nobody has prevented either lord hatch lady hatch or bishop lamont from entering rhodesia <e> <s> they have permits to do so <e> <s> they are free to remain in rhodesia <e> <s> they were put on the list by the previous rgime <e> <s> the governor has decided that in the very short interim period he will leave things alone leave it for the next government to decide on their immigration policy and in the meantime he will let them all in <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot go on explaining this again and again <e> <s> nobody has prevented lord hatch lady hatch or bishop lamont from going into the country or from staying there <e> <s> i will certainly look at the question of parliamentary privilege <e>", "<cs> no my lords it means precisely the opposite <e> <s> it means he was let in <e>", "<cs> my lords all i can say is that if the noble baroness is disappointed when the governor allows prohibited immigrants to come in and remain during the election without any let or hindrance goodness knows what she would have been disappointed with in the past <e>", "<cs> my lords what the governor has done is to rescind those rhodesian legislative acts which make it impossible to have a free and fair election <e> <s> the rest he has left alone until the independence government takes over <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to both the noble lord lord gladwyn and the noble lord lord goronwy-roberts i was greatly encouraged by the statement made by mr mugabes broadcast on the one-oclock news <e> <s> it seems to me that if that is the policy which mr mugabe intends to follow that does lead to the reconciliation which is so very necessary in rhodesia at the present time and certainly it will be the object of the government as i said in the statement to help in the transition period <e>", "<cs> my lords i would like if i may to echo what my noble friend has said about the leader of the house <e> <s> he was sniped at and <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to general walls i am afraid i do not know whether mr mugabe has asked him to stay on but i do know what a very constructive and sensible part general walls has played in very difficult circumstances during the whole of the lancaster house conference and the campaign <e> <s> with regard to the noble lords first question i think congratulations are due only when we see that the outcome of all this has been a free and fair multiracial society operating in peaceful conditions <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> as i said earlier i think that what mr mugabe said both during the election campaign and what he said at one oclock is a good augury for the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord lord peart but as i said earlier i do not think that success will have been achieved until we see what happens in the new zimbabwe <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not agree with the noble lord lord paget of northampton

lords aid and future policy towards zimbabwe must of course wait for future discussion with mr mugabe <e> <s> however there are certain matters to which we are committed for example land resettlement <e> <s> however we must think of all these matters in the context of our own position here at home <e> <s> i shall certainly look at what the noble lord has said <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is particularly generous because not only do i think that he does not much admire her majestys government but i do not think that he much admires me either <e> <s> so i am particularly grateful to him for his generous words <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the noble lords first question i think that the result of the election does reflect very fairly or as fairly as it can in a situation like this what the people of rhodesia/zimbabwe want <e> <s> it is now up to those who have the power to use it justly in the interests of everyone <e> <s> i shall if i may look into the last question <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that i had made it fairly plain in the answers i had given that so far the election had been free and fair and that it would be successful only if the new government uses the powers that it has for the benefit of all the people of the country and justly and wisely in a multiracial society <e> <s> i have made that clear <e> <s> i entirely agree with what the noble lord says <e> <s> as a matter of fact i think that the noble lord is wrong about mr mugabes russian connections <e> <s> in point of fact it was very largely from the chinese that mr mugabe derived his weapons and it was mr nkomo who got them from the russians <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that some progress was made but as the noble lord knows her majestys government were not directly involved in the consultations which were confidential and i think that we had better wait to hear what dr waldheim has to say <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that it must be rather easier to be governor of rhodesia than to be leader of your lordships house <e> <s> my noble friend has not had to deal with the unilateral declaration of independence which your lordships declared last week <e> <s> with regard to the supplementary question that the noble lord has asked me i think that one must recognise that events in rhodesia need a little time to be assimilated in south africa and i believe that it would be as well if both countries in africa and in the united nations showed a little patience about events in namibia <e>", "<cs> my lords her majestys government do not recognise swapos claim to he the sole representative of the namibian people that is for the people of namibia to decide and no one else <e> <s> the contact group of five has in my judgment as well as in the judgment of the previous administration and that of this administration proved a very useful way in which to seek and attain peace in namibia <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble lord <e> <s> no i was not aware of what the noble lord has said nor do i agree with it <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord that it is very necessary that there should be a settlement in namibia and we have gone some way along the way towards finding one <e> <s> what i was saying to the noble lord lord goronwy-roberts and also in answer to the question asked by the noble lord lord hatch of lusby is that i think the events in rhodesia of the last few weeks have made it necessary for the time being at any rate to exercise a little patience <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that my noble friend who has to go to the dentists would were he in the position at the moment of being the active leader of the house forgive the noble lord for being outside the rules of order and thank him warmly <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that any progress in middle east peace efforts is possible without an acceptance and a recognition by the palestinians and therefore by the plo as well of the state of israel as a state <e> <s> that is absolutely essential <e> <s> equally i do not think it is possible to get peace in the middle east without some recognition on the part of israel of the rights of the palestinians <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe and i repeat this that peace is possible in the middle east until such time as the palestinians and the plo recognise the state of israel nor do i believe it is possible until the israelis recognise the rights of the palestinians <e> <s> simply do not believe that one can ignore the plo in this question <e> <s> i would only say about the speeches to which the noble lord referred that if one looks objectively at what has been said on both sides about this issue in the middle east one sees that there have been some incautious remarks on both sides <e>", "<cs> my lords if the intention of the plo is the destruction of the state of israel i condemn that also <e>", "<cs> no my lords i do not think that the plo as such is a terrorist organisation <e> <s> there are some elements of the plo which in the past have been associated with the terrorists but it would be a great mistake to assume that it is possible to get a settlement in the area without taking into account the plo <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of that <e> <s> if that is the object of the plo then i comdemn it <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that her majestys government are keeping a balanced view on this subject <e> <s> certainly what i have sought to say this afternoon is that i believe that both sides with good will and with good sense could settle this <e> <s> i do not pretend that this will be easy but it seems to me that if the palestinians will recognise the state of israel and if israelis will recognise that the palestinians have rights too then there is in that equation the possibility of a settlement <e>", "<cs> my lords we seem to be crossing a few bridges before we come to them <e>", "<cs> my lords i confess to being rather surprised that the noble lord should want to welcome an incautious and undiplomatic reply to this question <e> <s> what he says i do not agree with i do not think the differences are worse than they were <e> <s> i believe that

is quite right <e> <s> the draft which we have seen would certainly cause the government several difficulties <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord opposite is jumping to conclusions <e>

interview that he is speaking of there are some considerable doubts as to its authenticity <e> <s> it has been described by yasser arafat himself as a complete fabrication <e> <s> but as i say the fact remains that the plo have to accept and recognise the state of israel if we are to get a settlement <e> <s> with regard to the second part of the noble lords question i deplore these acts of terrorism and indeed i also deplore the incursion by israel into lebanon <e>", "<cs> my lords with your lordships permission i should like to make a statement on gibraltar <e> <s> i am pleased to report that the spanish foreign minister and i reached agreement on th april on the re-establishment of direct communications between spain and gibraltar <e> <s> it is envisaged that the practical preparations will be completed not later than st june which will then allow the agreement to be speedily implemented <e> <s> i have had a copy of the joint anglo-spanish statement placed in your lordships library <e>", "<cs> my lords it is so hypothetical that i do not think i should care to answer it <e> <s> it seems to me that the negotiations will naturally consist of anything that anybody wants to talk about <e> <s> but it is all subject to that very important qualification and proviso which i made to your lordships in the last sentence of the statement <e> <s> i am grateful to both noble lords for the way in which they have received the statement <e> <s> i think it is an important step that the spanish government should be prepared to lift the restrictions and i hope very much that as a result of this we shall see some practical co-operation between gibraltar and spain <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i think that that is a good idea <e> <s> i would also say that in the two meetings that i had with senor oreja he certainly <e>", "<cs> yes indeed my lords <e> <s> any negotiations will include representatives of gibraltar <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords that is very nice of the noble lord but we have taken only one very short step along what i think will be a very long road <e>", "<cs> my lords with your lordships permission and with the connivance of the noble and learned lord on the woolsack i should like to make a statement about iran which the prime minister has made in another place <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not surprised that the two noble lords who have spoken broadly agree with the government and with each other about our attitude to this problem <e> <s> i certainly agree with the noble lord lord goronwy-roberts when he speaks of the patience the forbearance and the firmness of the americans <e> <s> i think that they have been more forbearing than one could have expected in the situation in which they find themselves the treatment of the hostages is not only horrifying but totally illegal and against international law <e> <s> i am sure and know that the only object of the president of the united states administration is to secure the release of the hostages and that is why they are proposing these measures <e>", "<cs> my lords nobody would disagree with the noble lord about the need for the unity of the west <e> <s> that is why we believe it is right that we should consult with our allies in europe <e> <s> the position of her majestys government at that meeting will be to seek agreement by the allies for an adequate response to the request of the united states which will lead to the release of the hostages <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for what he said about the interview and the ultimatum <e> <s> i think that those of your lordships who saw the programme will agree with him i myself did not see it <e> <s> although i read the transcript <e> <s> with regard to the editing of the interview i do not know exactly what took place and i am happy to say that i am not responsible for what the bbc does but no doubt the authorities will take note of what my noble friend has said <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble baroness that her majestys government and indeed the opposition and the liberal party as evidenced by what they have said this afternoon are by no means cool towards president carter <e> <s> indeed it seems to me that the reverse is true and it is president carter who sensibly has been very cool during the whole of this episode <e>", "<cs> my lords i think what probably would happen depending of course on what decisions are reached on monday or tuesday in brussels is that the government must come to a decision about what it is right they should do with their allies and then report to parliament and have a debate if necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no doubt that these are the considerations which will be discussed not only in brussels but with our other allies <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that what i have sought to say during this short discussion is that her majestys government will not only stand solidly behind president carter but will i seek ways and means of helping the united states to secure the release of the hostages <e>", "<cs> my lords i should not have thought that anybody who had listened to anything i have said this afternoon could have drawn that conclusion <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i think that these again are the sort of considerations which both the united states and her allies have to take into account <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords for the remarks they have made <e> <s> perhaps i should have said in the statement that of course both the other parties in this i-louse will be represented at the independence celebrations <e> <s> i am not quite sure whether it is mr callaghan or mr <e> <s> shore who will be going from the party opposite and mr steel will be going for the liberals <e> <s> so it will be an all-party delegation to the independence celebrations <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i will certainly remember that <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord has torpedoed me <e> <s> i am afraid i do not know the answer <e>", "<cs> my lords it was not intended that this sum of aid should be used for that purpose because as my noble friend knows the pension rights of public servants are fully guaranteed under the zimbabwe constitution and mr mugabe has made specific commitments to respect its provisions <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not say that it was <e> <s> i do not quite follow my noble friends question <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure my noble friend is right when he says that money should be spent on productive enterprise which employs the people of zimbabwe <e> <s> i think on the whole smaller schemes probably do more than big ones but i think it would be a mistake to exclude all big schemes from the programme <e>", "<cs> my lords her majestys government have already addressed an appeal to all countries that are likely to give aid <e> <s> as i said in a previous answer there has already been an extremely generous response and i do not think that we have heard from everyone yet <e> <s> so i think that what the noble lord wants has to a very large extent already happened <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged to the noble lord and i must only apologise to your lordships for having deprived your lordships of your leader for four months <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords for what they have said <e> <s> i think it reflects generally speaking the mood on all sides of the house and i am particularly grateful to the noble lord opposite for what he said about helping the necessary legislation through the house which will be very welcome to the government <e> <s> i have of course already been doing what the noble lord suggested about informing other members of nato and also japan because he is of course quite right in saying that the measures will be that much more effective if all the industrialised countries take them <e> <s> the japanese foreign minister was in luxembourg and i had the opportunity to talk to him over a period on this subject <e> <s> i feel that he is very well aware of the circumstances in which this action is being taken <e> <s> i also very much agree with the noble lord about the sacrifice that we are making <e> <s> i think the <e>", "<cs> my lords i think there are great dangers in any action you take on this subject and you have to weigh up the disadvantages and the advantages of any course which is open to her majestys government <e> <s> i believe that we have weighed up the advantages and the disadvantages correctly <e>", "<cs> my lords that of course is a situation which it is the object of all of us who are concerned to avoid <e> <s> i would only point out that i do not believe that the best way of avoiding a war is to see your ally humiliated in world opinion and not to support them when they are in trouble <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not say that everything was perfect but i would have thought that the community demonstrated yesterday that the community and the united states were not in disarray and in competition or disagreement with each other <e>", "<cs> my lords i think these are difficult matters of judgment and i think that one can very well argue the way the noble lord has argued <e> <s> i would only say this that when one talks about patience and diplomatic activity i think all of us have got to remember that the hostages have now been held in iran for six months and that the united states have show n unparalleled patience in dealing with this situation <e> <s> certainly they have decided that patience and diplomacy is not going to release the hostages and they in their judgment have decided that they have to go one step further and apply diplomatic sanctions <e> <s> i think all of us are very acutely conscious of the dangers which there are in the situation both in iran and in afghanistan but i can only repeat what i said to my noble friend behind me <e> <s> having seen the difficulties having looked at the difficulties and having examined the situation i believe we have come to the right decision and it has been a difficult decision <e> <s> with regard to the first part of the noble lords question i would only say that he is far too kind <e> <s> i am getting rather worried <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the intention of her majestys government <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot add very much to what the noble baroness has said because she has said everything that i know <e> <s> the only comment that i might make is that i think that possibly the iranian government if they are relying upon the soviet union as trading partners in substitution for the west will find it a lot more difficult to get hard currency from them <e>", "<cs> my lords the resolution on sanctions which was vetoed by the soviet union and approved by everyone else did not in fact include oil <e> <s> there is no prohibition on the purchase of oil from iran <e> <s> all that has happened is that the united states have asked us and others not to purchase iranian oil at a price sharply different from that ruling in the rest of the world <e> <s> it follows from that that the report in the newspaper is not accurate <e> <s> but it may well be that oil will be cut off in the end <e> <s> i do not know <e> <s> should that happen there is an agreement in the iea which triggers off below a certain percentage of shortfall a sharing system with which all countries who belong to the iea have agreed <e> <s> short of that if there is still a shortfall but not sufficient to trigger off the iea action there is an agreement in the community that we shall consult with each other <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish that the noble lord came in more often <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble baroness is quite right <e> <s> on the other hand i am not sure that fundamental mohammedism is very likely to find much attractive in soviet communism <e> <s> equally i think it would be a little unlikely that the iranians would be able to substitute entirely at any rate russian trade for western trade <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for that remark <e>", "<cs> my lords i readily give the assurance that the noble lord lord goronwy-roberts asked me to give <e> <s> of course we shall continue to do that and i agree very much with what he said in the latter part of his remarks <e> <s> i agree too with the noble lord who has just spoken from the liberal benches <e> <s> i hope that on the whole the less said the soonest mended because we have made our position abundantly plain to the saudi arabian government <e> <s> with regard to the second question which he raised i think that in the light of what has happened and in the light of the previous examples which the noble lord has quoted it might be as well for those who are producing these programmes to have a good look at the consequences of what they are doing <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no doubt that what the noble lord says is true that if lord reith had been there it would not have happened but my imagination does not go so far as to think of lord reith as chairman of a commercial television station <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we have got to be very careful in what we do about the freedom of expression in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i am confident that television producers read the newspapers <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think it is the business of her majestys government to decide what should be done in other countries <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so that seems to be a nicely balanced supplementary with which we can all go along <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord goronwy-roberts for his remarks and indeed for the remarks that the noble lord lord gladwyn made about the international aspects of this statement <e> <s> one of the most heartening things that has happened in the last hours it was not all heartening was the identity of view about international affairs of all the nine countries <e> <s> this was very marked and very striking and i think it is something which we should find very satisfactory <e>", "<cs> my lords as to where we go from here i hope the noble lord lord gladwyn is not feeling bruised but i wholeheartedly agree with him that we want to get a settlement on this matter <e> <s> indeed i think all of us want to get a settlement <e> <s> what we must do is to get more movement <e> <s> we got quite a lot of movement yesterday and the day before and both the french and the germans made a genuine effort to compromise <e> <s> we compromised too and we must all make another effort to get this matter settled because it is bedevilling the whole problem of europe <e> <s> nobody is more anxious than i am to get a settlement but i hope that on reflection the noble lord will agree that the government are right not to accept this particular compromise <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think anybody in the house could possibly disagree with the noble lord lord shinwell about the gravity of the situation <e> <s> i do not confine it to iran <e> <s> i think that the situation in afghanistan and in the middle east generally including the arab/israeli situation is very serious indeed <e> <s> so i would go further than the noble lord and of course he will understand that we are trying to do everything we can and we are thinking of ways and means of helping <e> <s> certainly i will consider what he has said <e>", "<cs> i do not know much about that my lords <e> <s> yes the agricultural prices that the other eight partners wanted represented an increase of per cent <e> <s> and of course the noble lord is perfectly right in saying that probably the commission proposal was an increase of an average of per cent <e> <s> and it is obvious that if the farmers because of inflation receive no increase they will come very badly out of it <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord knows as well as i do the problem of our budget is basically that we do not get back in receipts anything comparable to the figure which other countries do and this is very largely as a result of the preponderance on the community budget of agriculture which is now per cent <e> <s> when we joined the community we had the expectation that the proportion of the budget spent on agriculture would be reduced while in point of fact it has risen <e> <s> this is basically the problem which faces us <e> <s> it really will be necessary sooner or later because the community will come up against the per cent <e> <s> vat ceiling to obtain a restructuring of the budget <e> <s> that really will be necessary quite regardless of the british problem consequently that will have to be done and will take care of our problem in future years <e> <s> in the meantime we have to devise a system whereby we are treated fairly <e> <s> the community yesterday agreed on the two methods by which we should get reimbursed <e> <s> one is by the financial mechanism agreed in dublin in and the suspension of some of its provisions which would probably give us in a year something like million units of account <e> <s> the rest would be in the form of community projects agreed by everybody which we want in this country under article of the treaty of rome <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer is the first alternative the agriculture council can meet and if they can agree they can come to a new set of proposals upon which all nine could agree <e> <s> but my noble friend has been a minister of agriculture and he knows what they are like <e>", "<cs> my lords first i ought to apologise to your lordships for not having been present in the house during the passage of the legislation last week <e> <s> during the last eight days i have spent only three hours in this country and it was not possible for those three hours to be at the same time as when the legislation was being dealt with <e> <s> i must apologise but i have an idea of what went on <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the nine countries represented at the meeting in naples yesterday at which i was present are all intending to do and to carry out the policies which were decided yesterday and i have no doubt whatever about that <e> <s> as to whether they are successful time alone will tell but i think there are two important factors which have to be borne in mind and i have said this to the noble lord before <e> <s> one is that we are part of an alliance and when our friends are in trouble and they ask us to do something and we are concerned about the future of that alliance we do not disregard our friends when they are in trouble <e> <s> the second thing is that there is no doubt whatever about it that the very fact that the nine leading european countries have decided to take this action will be noted in iran as evidence of the disapproval by the nine of the action which the iranian government has taken and continues to take <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i will do that <e> <s> i think that there is at the moment in a sense a disturbing lack of progress over afghanistan <e> <s> but last week there was an opportunity particularly in vienna for an exchange of views which i think was very useful <e> <s> i had an opportunity to meet mr muskie and the french and german foreign ministers together and we had a discussion and i also had an opportunity to meet mr gromyko <e> <s> nothing else as far as i was concerned but afghanistan was discussed with mr gromyko <e> <s> i cannot say that i was enormously encouraged in the sense that there is obviously still a very wide difference between the positions of the soviet union and britain but i still think that if there is <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord goronwy-roberts for the non-partisan way in which he has approached this matter <e> <s> i share of course the concern of the noble lord lord gladwyn and the noble lord opposite about the effect that this decision might have upon the united states <e> <s> i think that it is important that our allies should realise the situation in which the government found themselves <e> <s> i am quite sure that senator muskie who is a congressman a senator of some considerable standing will understand the situation of a government which rely on parliament for their support <e> <s> i am equally sure that he will understand that it does not in any way mean that anyone in this country is backing away from the support that we have given to the united states about iran and the hostages and our determination to do what we can to help in the way of sanctions <e>", "<cs> well my lords i do not think that i shall just yet if the noble lord will forgive me <e> <s> i do not think that it would have met with the approval of parliament the house or even the back-benchers of the labour party in this house i suppose i must exclude the noble lord if we had removed the passports of those who wished to compete in the olympic games <e> <s> i happen to disagree very much with the decision taken by the british olympic committee but they have a perfect right to take it and this is still a free country <e> <s> i am surprised at the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that this is where the misunderstanding arises because the noble lord is perfectly right in saying that that assurance was given for the new legislation which was going through the house <e> <s> but it was explained i think here but certainly in another place that there was legislation already on the statute book which it was possible to use in order to prevent the carriage and the despatch of goods the export of goods to iran and that this power was in reserve <e> <s> it was this power that would have been used in the context of the contracts between th november and today <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know that but <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the two noble lords though it will come as no surprise that i prefer lord gladwyns intervention to that of the noble lord lord goronwy-roberts <e> <s> lord goronwy-roberts is always so courteous that i will measure my words and speak as gently as possible <e> <s> i will say one thing to him a year ago when this government came into office our predecessors had failed so dismally in understanding or putting over the problems which faced britain that in strasbourg last june the prime minister was not able to persuade the heads of government that there was a problem <e> <s> in one year we have not only persuaded the heads of government that there was a problem which the previous government never succeeded in doing but we have a solution which is satisfactory as far as it goes <e> <s> i really do not think that it lies in the mouths of noble lords opposite to complain about this settlement <e>", "<cs> the noble lord can come in later but i think i really would like to finish what i was saying <e> <s> my noble friend will speak about sheep-meat but perhaps i may speak in advance of him <e> <s> i think this is an exceedingly advantageous deal for the country and for the housewife <e> <s> as regards the per cent <e> <s> increase in agricultural prices would the noble lord please remember that throughout europe there has been an inflation rate this year of between and per cent <e> <s> and in this country of about per cent <e> <s> what we are asking our farmers to do is to accept per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will know that renegotiation is a pejorative word in the community <e> <s> this was i think a fairly satisfactory readjustment <e> <s> with regard to his second point i agree very much with what he said about the political entity of europe <e> <s> now that we have got this <e>", "<cs> my lords the convention on the crime of genocide was adopted by the general assembly on th december <e> <s> it was aimed not at individual acts of terrorism but to cope with the question of genocide in the aftermath of the second world war <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the genocide convention applies to the acts of terrorism to which the noble lord draws attention <e>", "<cs> my lords if that question was addressed to me perhaps i might answer it by saying that in the original answer to the question i said that the government deplored all acts of terrorism <e>", "<cs> my lords both the noble lord lord goronwy-roberts and the noble lord lord mcnair asked me when the royal marine commando company would arrive <e> <s> i think they will arrive on saturday <e> <s> the french gendarmerie will arrive today on vila <e> <s> both noble lords also asked me about the date of independence <e> <s> it is the intention of her majestys government and of the french government to adhere to the date of th july but obviously this must depend upon the circumstances that goes without saying <e> <s> but i very much hope that the circumstances will enable us to go ahead and that by that time the situation in the condominium will be such that we can stick to the original intentions <e>", "<cs> my lords i must beg the pardon of the noble lord for not having answered that question <e> <s> i hope that negotiations will shortly take place between the head of the new hebrides government father lini ourselves and mr stevens <e> <s> i hope it may be possible as a result of those negotiations to get further talks going <e> <s> the precondition of that naturally would be the return to legality of the island of santo in which case the blockade obviously would be removed <e> <s> i do not think that in other circumstances it is very likely to happen <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that they are coming from this country <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite right <e> <s> the agreement provides for consultation between the two governments over use of facility in other than normal circumstances <e>", "<cs> no my lords this is a decision taken by the united states <e>", "<cs> my lords the decision was taken by the united states <e> <s> i hope that the nato allies will support it <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> this was done with the agreement of the british government <e>", "<cs> my lords with your lordships permission i shall make a statement on the new hebrides <e> <s> on th june following the shooting of a prominent opposition deputy during a demonstration on the island of tanna the new hebrides government asked the two resident commissioners to recommend to their governments the despatch of british and french forces to the new hebrides <e> <s> this request was made during the course of a cabinet meeting and both resident commissioners agreed to make such a recommendation to their respective governments <e>", "<cs> my lords condominium is a very odd form of government <e> <s> any of your lordships who have been to the new hebrides as i have been will realise what difficulties it imposes and places upon those who live in the new hebrides and those who are trying to govern <e> <s> there have inevitably been difficulties over the past years because <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the prime minister did discuss this matter briefly with the french president and they agreed that they would remain in the closest touch over the handling of the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a problem about that it is that my french opposite number is not responsible for this problem <e> <s> m dijoud is the minister concerned <e> <s> as i understand it he works in the home department so my opposite number is not concerned with the problem <e> <s> therefore i do not think that there is much point in my meeting him <e> <s> and i do not frankly think that there would be much point in my right honourable friend the home secretary meeting his opposite number in the home department in france <e> <s> for the time being at any rate i think it would be better if mr maker and m dijoud continued to meet <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said earlier in response to a question i think from the noble lord lord goronwy-roberts m dijoud when i saw him in london last week specifically said that the french government accepted the outcome of the elections <e>", "<cs> my lords although i confess that i have been rather puzzled by some of the things that have happened in these last two or three days i have no reason to suppose that the french government would not agree entirely with what the noble lord opposite has said <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the legal position because of this condominium is a little obscure <e> <s> but i myself can conceive of no circumstances in which there was need to maintain order or to safeguard the welfare of the population in which the french should not agree to the use of our troops <e>", "<cs> my lords there appear to have been some misunderstand <e>", "<cs> with your lordships permission i shall make a statement on the european council <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much agree with what the noble lord lord goronwy-roberts said about the problem of oil <e> <s> there is no doubt that the continual increase in the price of oil leads to almost impossible problems for the developing countries of the world <e> <s> it is open to question whether the right forum in which to solve these problems is a meeting between the european countries and opec <e> <s> i do not think that there is any point in having a meeting just for the sake of a meeting <e> <s> when one has a meeting one wants to be sure that it will lead to some kind of useful end <e> <s> but nobody in any sense disputes the importance which the noble lord attaches to that particular aspect <e>", "<cs> my lords nobody deplores that language more than i and it is totally unacceptable when it refers to the destruction of israel <e> <s> however the principles of the declaration of the nine make that abundantly plain <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already said that if the plo is to be associated with any talks on a settlement it will have to acccept the principles that the nine set out i hope that the noble lord will read the statement <e> <s> i have said that what al fatah has said is totally unacceptable as regards the destruction of israel <e> <s> if the noble lord really imagines that just because one does not like something one can ignore it then he is not living in the real world <e>", "<cs> my lords no negotiations are taking place at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will allow me to finish before he interrupts me he might be the wiser <e> <s> i was saying that no negotiations are taking place at the moment <e> <s> the nine are proposing that there should be contact soundings if you like between all the parties concerned to see whether we can get any further forward <e> <s> those soundings will take place on the basis of the principles which have been enunciated in the communiqu <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say it seems so to me too and i am most grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> before the noble lord lord shinwell jumps up in passing i would only say that i have spent a good deal of the last months sitting down with either terrorists or past terrorists <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i disagree with the noble lord lord shinwell in almost every respect particularly when he says that he thinks that the european initiative will make things worse and lead to war <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble lord lord shinwell has any idea what is happening on the west bank at this particular moment and whether or not he has any understanding of how the palestinians on the west bank are feeling at the moment in circumstances which are not due to the plo but due to the israeli government in the settlements they have created there <e> <s> the situation there is extremely grave <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble lord lord shinwell has any idea about what the <e>", "<cs> my lords that is precisely what the nine were saying and i am grateful to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords it was discussed not at great length but at some length <e> <s> it will of course be discussed at greater length at the venice summit this weekend <e> <s> in the meantime the british governments view is being set out clearly today by my right honourable friend the lord privy seal and my right honourable friend the minister for overseas development in two major speeches in another place and i wonder whether the noble lord would be content to read them tomorrow morning <e>", "<cs> my lords not specifically but the agreement reached in brussels on th and th may was accepted by the heads of government and the noble lord is perfectly right in explaining the methods by which the repayment to this country will be made <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the first part of the noble lords question is no and so the second part

have been certain developments recently in the situation which have been not entirely unpromising <e> <s> we have seen the third world unite almost unanimously against this invasion and recently we have seen the islamic conference condemning it yet again and calling for the withdrawal of soviet troops from afghanistan <e> <s> nevertheless i think we would be overoptimistic if we thought that that was going to happen in the near future <e> <s> but we must press on and we must not allow this situation to become irreversible <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that there would be anybody in the house who would disagree with the noble lord about the paramount need to ensure the safety of this country and the credibility of nato <e> <s> i agree with him entirely <e>", "<cs> no my lords i have no firm evidence of that <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the government are only too well aware of what the noble lord said in the first part of his supplementary question <e> <s> the governments position is that there can be no unilateral solution to the problem of jerusalem and of course we should be prepared to look at any solution which met with the approval of the parties <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that all of us know the feelings that the jewish people and the israeli people have about jerusalem <e> <s> the view of her majestys government is that if we are to find a solution to the middle east problem the arab-israel conflict it is necessary that there should be agreement about the future of jerusalem not just by the israelis but also by the arabs <e> <s> all of us hope that such an agreement is possible and that it can be arrived at in friendship <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the right reverend prelate since he expresses quite clearly what is the object of government policy <e> <s> it is not to take sides with one or the other it is to bring about reconciliation <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord opposite expresses exactly what i was trying to say to his noble friend behind him <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend will have seen the declaration issued by the community at venice some weeks ago <e> <s> the purpose of that declaration <e>", "<cs> my lords we have recently announced special help for cambodia somalia and uganda all of which are areas which the director-general mentioned <e> <s> we already contribute to the world food programme <e> <s> we expect our food aid obligations this year both direct and through the european community to cost over million <e> <s> as my honourable friend stressed recently in another place we very much want to see developing countries give greater priority to agricultural and food production in their investment plans <e> <s> we shall continue to do what we can in answer to their requests and shall encourage international agencies to follow suit <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the facts which the noble lord has stated are broadly speaking correct <e> <s> i suspect that probably there is not so much a shortage of food in the world <e> <s> indeed the fao are now forecasting a per cent <e> <s> increase in world cereals after this harvest <e> <s> the difficulty is very largely in distribution and we must all do what we can <e> <s> in my original answer i pointed out that this year the government will be contributing something like million in food aid <e>", "<cs> perhaps i ought to know that my lords but i wonder whether i may write to the noble lord or tell him later <e> <s> i am afraid i cannot give him the exact answer to that now <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the facility on diego garcia contributes considerably to the maintenance of stability and security in the indian ocean and that is to the benefit of the states in the area <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will of course know that discussion is going on at the moment in the united nations <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree wholly with what the noble lord has said <e> <s> i think that most of your lordships would accept as do the government and welcome the united states proposals that lend strength and stability to the area <e>", "<cs> my lords in so far as this matter is concerned they have minded their own business <e> <s> we have had no representations <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the government must always as their first priority think of our own defence and the defence of the west <e>", "<cs> my lords the agreement which was published is still in force <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that all of us are glad that this episode is now over and that the new hebrides will move to independence on th july <e> <s> what happens after independence will of course depend upon the wishes of the prime minister of the newly independent country but i think the noble lord opposite can rest assured that both the french government and we ourselves will do what we can to help <e> <s> i confirm what the noble lord lord gladwyn has said <e> <s> the rebellion is at an end and santo is part of the country of the new hebrides <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much hope that the american government will be able to provide more help to zimbabwe <e> <s> i hope too that there will be an agreement on zimbabwes accession to the lom convention and i believe that that will be possible <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i do not think that one could possibly disagree with the noble lord in that supplementary question <e> <s> i think that there will be quite a lot more aid forthcoming from the world bank and from the european community and there is to be a donors conference at the beginning of next year in zimbabwe which we shall do our very best to help <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that that was the problem <e> <s> the problem was the terms which were offered to zimbabwe for membership of the lom convention and in particular there was the question of sugar quotas which were a difficulty <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that what is suggested in the first supplementary question of the noble lord necessarily follows <e> <s> it depends entirely what the figure of million to million dollars was based on and i am afraid that i do not know <e> <s> anyway it was over a very much <e>", "<cs> my lords frankly i believe that zimbabwe is a particular case <e> <s> in this case there has been a successful end to a war and this has given new hope in the disputes in southern africa <e> <s> i think that it becomes all of us to behave as generously as possible to see that the new country gets a good send-off <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that my noble friend will know that a very great deal of aid from the aid budget is already committed and it would be totally counter-productive to move it <e> <s> there are also a great number of other countries in africa and elsewhere that are deserving of the aid that we give <e> <s> at the present time we cannot increase our aid budget and i think that probably the <e>", "<cs> my lords the commission has a clear mandate and is indeed in the process of negotiating with the zimbabwe government <e> <s> i hope that there will be a settlement <e> <s> i think i should be misleading the house if i were to say that it was as sympathetic as i should have liked it to be <e>", "<cs> my lords in my discussions in new york with the secretary-general mr waldheim and other foreign ministers i urged the importance of swift action in the united nations and as your lordships know the passage of security council resolution calling on both parties to refrain immediately from any further use of force and to settle their dispute by peaceful means was secured <e> <s> since then we have been active with our friends and allies both in the area and elsewhere in trying to secure an early end to hostilities <e> <s> we have been particularly concerned to prevent the conflict spreading and affecting the vital gulf shipping routes <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a question rather than a statement <e> <s> there were an awful lot of supplementaries and i shall get them all wrong if i allow the noble lord to intervene <e> <s> i hope he will forgive me <e>", "<cs> my lords oil supplies have already dried up from iraq and iran there is no oil coming from either country <e> <s> this means that there is a shortfall of production of about million barrels a day <e> <s> there was however an overproduction of million barrels a day and it may very well be that that shortfall between million and million will be made up by the increase in production of the other opec countries <e> <s> in any event i think that all the industrialised countries have stocks of over days so i do not think at the moment that there is very much danger of a shortage of oil <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but i suspect that that is more due to the increase in the price of oil than to the shortage of oil and that really is a slightly different question <e> <s> but i think it is true to say that the developing countries probably could not afford to have such big stocks and therefore i think it will be necessary for us to look very carefully at what steps will have to be taken to help them <e>", "<cs> not so far as i know my lords <e>", "<cs> i am sorry my lords i missed the first part of the noble lords question <e> <s> possibly yes my lords possibly no <e> <s> it was certainly my view at the time when there was a withdrawal from the gulf that this was a mistake <e> <s> i think it would be difficult to peer into a crystal ball and to say whether if we had been there this situation would have been any different <e> <s> i think that probably the reasons for the iraq-iran war would not have been affected much by a british presence or by no british presence <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the second question i have no evidence of that <e> <s> so far as the first question is concerned the noble lord is of course quite right there is a passage in fact it is the most used passage through oman waters but i am afraid i have no knowledge of whether anybody has plans to disrupt that <e> <s> but of course as the noble lord will be aware there have been conversations among a number of countries interested in maintaining the freedom of passage through the strait and peace in the gulf as to what action might be taken if that were to happen <e> <s> i think this is very unlikely but i think it is always as well to be sure that you have some idea what you would do if the worst happened <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it very important that we should not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries <e> <s> if any of us start to do so it may be that some others will <e> <s> the sort of visit which i paid to hungary and poland and that my honourable friend the minister of state for foreign affairs is paying to germany in itself has an effect in influencing creating and developing understanding between countries of different political philosophies <e> <s> there is certainly no treaty which prevents that <e>", "<cs> my lords it was not only warmly welcomed i was invited there <e> <s> i do not think that i should have been invited if i had not been welcome <e>", "<cs> my lords having sat in this house now for a great number of years with the noble lord and not having yet been indoctrinated by him i can assure him that it will take more than four days in hungary and poland to change my views about certain matters <e> <s> the political issues which were discussed between poland and ourselves and hungary and ourselves were of course the obvious matters of east-west relations dtente and disarmament which the noble lord lord brockway mentioned earlier today <e> <s> though it would be perhaps an exaggeration to say that we were agreed about these matters although there were some points of agreement there is no doubt that the very fact that one talks frankly about these things leads to a greater understanding of other peoples positions <e> <s> i do not think that one ought to underestimate the usefulness which visits of this kind have <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord is asking me whether i let our allies know what happened indeed i did <e> <s> yesterday i was in luxembourg at a meeting of the foreign ministers of the ten because the greeks were also there <e> <s> i told them of course what went on <e>", "<cs> no my lords it has not been rejected by the south african government and i hope the meeting will take place <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for those remarks <e> <s> of course there have been difficulties about this there have been difficulties for the last four years but i hope we are now on the road to getting a solution <e> <s> let us not do anything to stop it <e>", "<cs> my lords for someone who has advocated a conference and a settlement on namibia over the months both the tone and content of the noble lords questions are hardly helpful <e> <s> it is not true that the south african government have rejected it and i very much hope they will accept <e>", "<cs> my lords the government believe that if the nine member states of the european community are to make a serious and consistent contribution in international affairs political co-operation must be strengthened <e> <s> i have suggested that the nine should re-examine their political commitment to co-operation in foreign policy and commit a greater part of their national diplomatic efforts to it that we should consider ways in which political co-operation could be supported by some kind of permanent staff and that there should be an improved procedure for convening meetings in an emergency <e> <s> the foreign ministers of the nine have agreed that the organisation of political co-operation should be examined and i expect this examination to cover the points mentioned in my noble friends question <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend about the importance of political co-operation and i hope we can improve it <e> <s> but i would not want it to be thought that there had not been political cooperation before there has been some good political co-operation and i only hope we can so improve matters that it becomes even better <e> <s> i hope that in the months to come we shall persuade everybody whether they be conservatives or members of the party opposite though that might he a little more difficult that membership of the community is greatly to the advantage of this country <e>", "<cs> my lords this is concerning political co-operation within the european community and defence does not come into it <e>", "<cs> my lords i had read the question but i thought we all knew what the situation was <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the first part of the noble lords supplementary but i do not want there to be any misunderstanding what i am suggesting is not a large number of people and i hope very much that it could to a large degree be serviced from the councils secretariat perhaps with one or two other experts <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think there has been any corporate action but certainly we have been in very close touch with the italian authorities and today i have already given authority for some more money to be sent in aid of the disaster and for the relief of those who have been badly hit <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether this is exactly the sort of case i have in mind <e> <s> i think there has been very close touch between all the community countries and italy <e> <s> they have only to ask their neighbours and i am sure their neighbours will give them what they need <e> <s> we have been asked and we have given <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend lord trefgarne told your lordships at the conclusion of last nights debate my honourable friend the minister of state has gone to the falkland islands <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure my noble friend that if there is anything to make a statement about it will be made <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of the undertaking and the pledge i gave in the original answer to the question i do not think the falkland islanders have any cause for alarm <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i give that undertaking <e> <s> i would only add that if my noble friend thinks that i have leaked it he must think that i enjoy being questioned in this house about it <e>", "<cs> my lords like it or not over a great many years the argentinians have claimed the falkland islands <e> <s> we of course do not admit that claim but the fact that there has been that claim has <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will know enough about international affairs to know that a lot of people claim things that do not belong to them <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that at this moment we had better take one thing at a time <e> <s> i have no idea at the moment what the views of the falkland islanders are but i should like to hear what my honourable friend the minister of state says when he comes back to england and then we can discuss it all <e> <s> but certainly there will be a lot of opportunity in your lordships house to discuss how we go if we go anywhere <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lords for generally welcoming this statement and also for the support they have given to the passage on poland <e> <s> i agree with them about the gravity of the situation <e> <s> it is obvious that if there were an intervention in poland certain things would inevitably follow and it would in effect as has been said on a number of occasions mean the end of dtente at any rate for a very long period of time <e>", "<cs> my lords i made some suggestions about a better mechanism for political co-operation in europe which are so to speak in the machine at the moment and have not come up for discussion by ministers <e> <s> there are various proposals in addition to that which are being considered <e> <s> but i can give the noble lord the undertaking that the delay which took place in consultation among the nine foreign ministers when the invasion of afghanistan took place on th december last year will certainly not take place again in any other eventuality <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that madrid is perhaps quite the right place for that but it has certainly been raised on a number of occasions by the previous government and also by the present government <e> <s> we shall certainly continue to do so <e> <s> i do not think that the presence of these cuban troops in africa helps the cause of world peace at all <e>", "<cs> my lords my recollection i may be at fault and i shall have to look it up is that the figures have not changed very much over the past months <e> <s> the noble lords recollection may be correct but i do not think it has changed very much <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the circumstances in which troops are in various countries vary from place to place <e> <s> i do not think one can necessarily say in all cases that this is a bad thing <e> <s> i am afraid i do not know of any case where south african troops are stationed outside south africa but if the noble lord has any instance of it i shall be very interested to know <e>", "<cs> yes my lords there are some in abyssinia and there are some soviet troops in ethiopia as well <e> <s> i think there are probably something like cubans in ethiopia <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i think i would agree with the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords her majestys government are profoundly concerned at the continuing detention of four british subjects in iran <e> <s> but direct representations from a foreign government to the ayatollah khomeini himself would in our judgment not be effective or indeed helpful <e> <s> we believe the best way to bring our concern to his attention is to continue our persistent representations to the iranian authorities and to senior iranian figures with help <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we all share my noble friends concern about this matter and anything which anybody can do to make possible the release of these british subjects should be done <e> <s> i think it really is up to the leaders of the christian churches themselves to decide whether a move of that kind would be helpful <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the right reverend prelate the iranian delegation which came over the other day with the intention of seeking our support in respect of the tran/iraq conflict was told by me in very specific terms of our anxiety at the fate of the four british subjects who had not been allowed consular access <e> <s> indeed we do not even know where they are and this is a state of affairs which is very far from satisfactory <e> <s> i made it plain that there could be no question of an improvement in relations between britain and iran until this matter had been settled <e> <s> the response that i received was that they were worried about our attitude and they would do what they could to sort this matter out legally as soon as possible <e> <s> we must wait and see but so far there has been no indication of any movement <e>", "<cs> my lords three of them are missionaries and one i think is a helicopter pilot <e> <s> there have been no charges levelled against these british subjects but there have been accusations that they have been engaged in espionage <e> <s> anybody who <e>", "<cs> my lords the red cross have visited them and we have had reports though of course necessarily second-hand through the red cross that all four british subjects are well <e> <s> i hope very much that they will continue to be visited <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord lord brockway for what he has said and i certainly should like to look at his suggestion <e> <s> there is no doubt that one of the factors which affected <e>", "<cs> my lords i am equally grateful to the noble lord lord goronwy-roberts <e> <s> what i think is absolutely essential because i accept what the noble lord lord brockway has said about the gravity of the breakdown of these negotiations is that we should continue to seek a settlement and do what we can to avert a complete breakdown <e> <s> consequently any suggestions which are made will be looked at most carefully by her majestys government <e>", "<cs> my lords the last part of the noble lords question is going a little fast <e> <s> what i said was that we would look and see whether there was anything that could be done on the lines of what the noble lords lord brockway and lord goronwy-roberts said <e> <s> with regard to his first supplementary question i must confess that i am afraid that i do not know <e>", "<cs> my lords the original resolution was passed by the general assembly and consequently a further resolution by the general assembly would have the effect of rescinding it <e>", "<cs> my lords whether or not the south african government are right or wrong about the partiality of the united nations before any united nations agreement comes into operation what we must make sure is that the united nations is impartial <e> <s> that is absolutely essential <e> <s> regarding the second part of the noble lords question i always prefer people who are on my side but on the other hand perhaps it is better for the people of namibia to make up their own minds <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has sprung this suggestion on me without any previous notice <e> <s> i think that i should like to consider it a little more before making so positive a statement <e> <s> but i will certainly examine it <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree wholeheartedly with the first part of my noble friends supplementary question <e> <s> i think it very important that we should have good relations with the canadian government <e> <s> as for the second part i have no doubt that the canadian government will read what he has said <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right and that is what the constitutional conference is about <e> <s> the opposition are being consulted <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> once again the noble lord opposite is quite right <e> <s> over the years the difficulty as regards the independence of belize has been the guatemalan claim to belizian territory <e> <s> it would obviously be better if we could reach an agreement with guatemala before independence and we are still seeking to do that <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord can be quite sure that whatever we do about the independence of belize we shall be very careful <e>", "<cs> my lords i join with all your lordships who have spoken to say that we are very grateful to my noble friend lord bethell for having put down this motion on the order paper and enabled us to have the debate that we have had this afternoon <e> <s> indeed i think that i would be hard put to it to say that i disagreed with much of what has been said in the debate <e> <s> the speeches from noble lords opposite seem to me in a way rather more like old boys day and old girls day if the noble baroness will forgive me than anything else <e> <s> i know that one of the old boys in the shape of the noble lord lord lee has had to leave to go to another meeting which may perhaps have a closer bearing on events opposite than my reply <e>", "<cs> my lords unilateral action by the united kingdom to patriate the canadian constitution would be contrary to the request and consent convention recited in the preamble to the statute of westminster <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the convention in parliament and outside that we never make comments on that kind of thing <e>", "<cs> my lords it means that they ask and they want it <e>", "<cs> my lords it means the federal government <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords who have spoken and i shall try to answer very briefly the questions they have raised <e> <s> some of the issues are very wide and it would be difficult to deal with them in question and answer <e> <s> i do not think that the noble lord opposite need worry about over-commitments i do not think that they were commitments <e> <s> nothing further was done in washington about which i think the house does not already know <e>", "<cs> my lords the object of such a force would be to contain soviet aggression <e> <s> if the force is set up and if we belong to it i cannot imagine a circumstance in which that force would be used against the wishes of a country <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that questions about american policy ought to be directed to the american government and not to me <e> <s> i have made clear on behalf of her majestys government that i deplore terrorism from whichever quarter it comes <e>", "<cs> my lords i sincerely hope that we never do that that would not be very sensible as the noble lord has said <e> <s> the only commitment that was made and it was not a commitment is what the prime minister said that if a rapid deployment force was set up in principle we would be prepared to take our share that is all <e> <s> with regard to the warning i never heard the prime minister warn the president at all <e> <s> i never heard anybody warn anybody of anything <e> <s> i have no doubt that with his usual assiduity the noble lord has been reading all the newspaper reports which may have translated a conversation into a warning <e>", "<cs> my lords from that point of view i think that the meeting was very useful <e> <s> i think that there had been perhaps not so much in the american administration but in some quarters in the united states a misunderstanding about the venice declaration <e> <s> the prime minister and i took the opportunity to explain both publicly and to the administration what the european community sought to achieve <e> <s> as i said in the statement we reiterated that we were not in the business to rival to compete or to undercut what the united states sought to do but rather that we sought to help in a complementary fashion <e> <s> i believe that this is much more clearly understood now than it was before our visit <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend because from looking at the situation in the world and at what has happened in the last few years he would be a very unwise man who did not understand what has happened in parts of africa in south-east asia and indeed in the middle east <e>", "<cs> my lords her majestys government do not believe that the right way to settle international disputes is by force and we have made that abundantly plain over a period of years <e> <s> the noble lord lord janner will perhaps recollect that in the venice declaration it was clearly set out that the arabs had to recognise the state of israel and the right of israel to live in security within its own boundaries <e> <s> until such time as that is recognised by the plo and by all the arab states i do not believe that it is possible to get a solution <e> <s> equally on the other side of the coin that is in the venice declaration there is a need for israel to recognise that the palestinians have rights <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to confirm that <e> <s> the rapid deployment force is a force to be deployed rapidly not in one particular direction but where it is needed <e> <s> may i follow up what my noble friend lord duncan-sandys said <e> <s> those of us who look at these things with care understanding experience and knowledge should welcome the fact that with the responsibilities of the united states as the leader of the free world and as the country with the most military power in the world such a country is giving a lead in trying to contain what i think is unacceptable soviet expansion <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the two noble lords for what they have said and for the congratulations that they have offered the government <e> <s> perhaps i should make it clear that my honourable friend mr ridley and those in the foreign office who have been working with him have been engaged on this matter for months or so <e> <s> it is to them as well as to the guatemalan government and the government of belize that the credit should go <e>", "<cs> no my lords after independence it will be for the belizeans to decide whether they wish to become members of the commonwealth and for the commonwealth to decide whether they will have them <e> <s> but would not anticipate too much difficulty <e>", "<cs> my lords if there is an agreement as i hope there will be and there are heads of agreement there will be no territorial claim by the guatemalans on belize so there would be nothing for the belizeans to fear <e> <s> i have been in close touch with the united states government who have been extremely helpful over the negotiations and i think that all parties ought to be satisfied <e>", "<cs> yes my lords after the agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no suggeston of that <e> <s> there is of course the suggestion or rather the practice on our part when a colony becomes independent of giving aid to that colony and during the constitutional conference we shall be negotiating aid to belize <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for what she has said <e> <s> as i have said i think it is too early to decide the future of the security forces in belize <e> <s> i wonder whether my noble friend is quite accurate in what she says <e> <s> perhaps i am out of date but from my days at the ministry of defence i seem to recollect that we also had service training in malaysia but perhaps that has now finished <e>", "<cs> sarawak <e> <s> well maybe i am out of date though it appears that i am not and i am very glad about that <e> <s> with regard to my noble friends second question i think that that is a matter for the government of belize but i shall certainly draw mr prices attention to what my noble friend has said <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord gladwyn says that this is not the way to run a railway <e> <s> but the fact is that this is the way at present the railway is run and if you are travelling on the railway you had better operate according to how it happens to be run <e> <s> i do not think that it is any good discussing that at the present time <e> <s> may i make it clear and i entirely agree with the noble lord lord goronwyroberts that there is no reason for any assertion that we have been intransigent about fisheries <e> <s> very far from it <e> <s> we have been very accommodating indeed about fisheries but there comes a time and the time has come when every country has to look after its basic industries and its basic interests <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord is mistaken if he thinks that there was not a very significant discussion about the economic situation <e> <s> this took up most of one of the days <e> <s> i also think that one should recollect that the idea of the european council was not to make decisions <e> <s> the idea which was originated by president giscard was that the heads of government in europe should meet twice or three times a year so that they could reflect upon the problems of the community and other problems outside the community and not take decisions and not to supersede the institutions of the community <e> <s> therefore i think it would be a mistake to think that decisions are going to come out of the european council and i do not think that that is what it is for <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the government have made plain what the noble lord has said that we understand very well the difficulty in which the fishing industry finds itself and there are certain essentials for it <e> <s> i do not want to go into what they <e>", "<cs> yes my lords that of course is very much in the mind of the government <e> <s> conservation is one of the issues which has very much been in the minds of all of us when we have been trying to negotiate this agreement <e> <s> i agree with my noble friend <e> <s> he will of course also accept that there are complications like historic rights which cannot be ignored <e>", "<cs> my lords not i am afraid without notice but the thrust of the noble lords question is clearly right that if two-thirds of the available resources of the community are employed on the common agricultural policy there is consequently less for anything else <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is clearly right that if there is nothing to quarrel about <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is understandable that the new american administration wish to review their negotiating position on theatre nuclear forces and indeed to review it as part of the wider consideration of salt and their general arms control policy <e> <s> it is only reasonable to expect a new administration to do that <e> <s> but the united states administration have already said that they intend to continue with the talks on arms limitation and theatre nuclear forces <e> <s> i do not think any date has yet been fixed but i hope it will not be too long delayed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble lord <e> <s> i do not think we should forget when talking about arms limitation talks and theatre nuclear forces that at the present time there is a very serious imbalance in favour of the soviet union <e> <s> therefore though we are very willing to discuss limitation it is necessary that the double decision taken by nato in december should be adhered to <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend knows that is a rather different set of negotiations <e> <s> that is concerned with mutual and balanced force reductions and not so much with the strategic arms limitation talks or indeed with the theatre nuclear forces talks <e> <s> but what the soviet union have said and have repeated to me in a message which the soviet ambassador delivered to me last week is that they would be prepared to go ahead with talks on theatre nuclear forces <e>", "<cs> my lords the european council recently agreed to confirm the <e>", "<cs> my lords being very well aware of my noble friends views on this subject i think it was very nice of him to thank me for the answer at all <e> <s> i do not think i could quarrel with the estimate that he has given of the expense of having these various locations <e> <s> but the subject of a single site or the subject of the parliaments activities including the committee meetings and the location of the secretariat was raised by the french last year and it became apparent and i am afraid that it is a very divisive issue in the community that it would not be easy to reach a generally accepted agreement <e> <s> the european council therefore agreed to maintain the <e>", "<cs> my lords having listened to the noble lord opposite over what seems to be a very great number of years his question does not surprise me <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope very much that the parliaments views will be put to the members of the council <e> <s> also i hope very much that the consequences which my noble friend predicts will not occur <e>", "<cs> my lords in so far as that bears on the question and indeed in so far as it does not i agree with the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords her majestys government could not expect foreign immigration authorities to accept expired united kingdom passports during the current industrial dispute over civil service pay unless the expired passports were appropriately endorsed <e> <s> as the dispute is affecting both the passport office and the immigration service it would be administratively impracticable to renew expired passports exceptionally in the present situation <e> <s> as far as possible we are trying to maintain the issue of passports in cases of urgency to personal applicants <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure that i understand the exact purpose of the noble lords question <e> <s> could he explain it a little more if he wants an intelligent answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that would be very difficult <e> <s> but what does happen is that citizens of the united kingdom and colonies wishing to make holiday visits to the european community to scandinavia and to other western european countries and canada can obtain british visitors passports while they wait at the main post offices in britain <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just explain what is happening <e> <s> next week the guatemalan government and ourselves and the belizian government are meeting in new york to put some flesh on the heads of agreement which were negotiated in london a few weeks ago <e> <s> i have no reason to suppose that it will not be possible to get an agreement on that because the heads of agreement have already been signed <e> <s> i very much hope it will be <e> <s> after that there will be a referendum and it is not yet decided and not at all clear exactly what mr price had in mind exactly what the question will be that is to be asked in the referendum <e> <s> of course on that question will depend whether or not independence will be granted <e>", "<cs> i am much obliged my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord but i think that far and away the best guarantee for the future of belize is an agreement with guatemala because it has always been the possible threat from guatemala that has led to the postponement of the independence of belize <e> <s> if we can negotiate as i believe we can an agreement with guatemala which is satisfactory both to guatemala and to belize then i do not think we have anything to worry about <e>", "<cs> my lords the agreement would lapse but then we would have to consider what to do next depending upon the question put to the people of belize <e>", "<cs> my lords if any external threat has been removed from belize i do not believe that it would be necessary to keep british troops there but certainly part of our arrangements with belize after independence would no doubt be the training of belize security forces <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know about what the result would be <e> <s> it would be an indication of whether or not the people of belize would be prepared to accept the treaty if that was asked of them <e> <s> but one thing is perfectly clear regardless of whether or not they accept it that her majestys government are committed to giving belize independence <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord would allow me to intervene <e> <s> i am not quite sure whether he is saying that the labour party are not committed to withdrawing from the community or whether they are because i was reading and i have in front of me a statement made by mr michael foot which actually says he believes that there should be a repeal of the european communities act <e>", "<cs> my lords the object of a nuclear deterrent is to deter war and i believe that the possession by britain of an independent nuclear deterrent makes war that much less likely <e> <s> with regard to my noble friends second point i am satisfied as i imagine all your lordships will be when they have heard the defence secretary tomorrow that the british contribution in conventional forces to the nato pact is not only adequate but as good as it can be given the amount of money we spend on defence which as we are constantly reminded by noble lords opposite is a greater proportion of our gnp than applies to any other country in europe <e> <s> thirdly i do not think i agree with my noble friend that our influence would be increased if we did not have an independent nuclear deterrent <e> <s> nor do i think that employment would be greatly affected since a very large part of the expenditure on the new trident programme will be spent on work in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord would not expect me to anticipate the statement which will be made tomorrow by the secretary of state for defence <e>", "<cs> my lords i am as always grateful to the liberal party <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not care to say where any campaign is coming from and there are certainly differences of opinion about whether or not it is a good thing for us to have an independent nuclear deterrent <e> <s> i happen to believe very strongly that it is and having over a period of years had something to do with the matter i am more than ever convinced it is a good thing and i believe that if we put the arguments clearly in front of your lordships house the vast majority would agree <e>", "<cs> that would be very nice my lords and no doubt we should all wish to see that happen and perhaps in the lifetime of some of your lordships we may see it but i am inclined to doubt it <e> <s> if i may say so i think it a great mistake for one to rely on public opinion polls in arguing whether or not there should be a nuclear deterrent <e> <s> it depends entirely on what question is asked and how informed those are who are asked the question <e> <s> i have no doubt that the noble lord whose opinions i both know and respect would perhaps not follow the results of a public opinion poll about the death penalty so readily <e>", "<cs> my lords in a sense the difficulty with all this is that it is a sort of circular argument <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord lord shinwell is absolutely right when he says that nobody can impose a settlement <e> <s> the only way in which you are going to get a settlement in the middle east is if the arabs and the israelis are prepared to have one <e> <s> i think that the noble lord is perfectly right in what he said so far as he went <e> <s> he very nearly repeated the venice declaration with one exception that the venice declaration has two parts first it suggests that one of the principles should be that the arabs should recognise the state of israel and its right to live in security in its own boundaries and the second principle is that the israelis should recognise the rights of the palestinians <e>", "<cs> yes indeed my lords that of course is one of the priorities of our presidency in europe <e> <s> all i can say is that i do not think that the events of the last month have made things any easier but we must do what we can <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that actually was the purpose of the question asked by my noble <e>", "<cs> nor my lords would it solve the cambodian refugee problem but if we could solve the arab-israeli problem it would be a great step forward <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i entirely agree with my noble friend <e> <s> the object of the european initiative is to get all men of moderation round a table to solve the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords any statement which is made by any leader of a country in the middle east which leads to a peaceful solution is to be welcomed <e> <s> the difficulty is that so many people in the area on both sides make such hawkish statements <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness lady llewelyn-davies of hastoe and to the noble lord lord gladwyn for what they <e>", "<cs> my lords i was just coming to that <e> <s> i do not find it at all odd that there should be a philosophical gulf between my right honourable friend the prime minister and president mitterrand <e> <s> indeed since one is a socialist and the other is a conservative as a conservative it would worry me considerably if there were not such a gulf <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord kennet for his opening remarks <e> <s> on disarmament that of course is a matter which is usually taken in nato and not at economic summits <e> <s> decisions have been taken in nato about arms limitation talks on the tnf <e> <s> i really do not think that there was very much more to be said at this summit but of course all of us are in favour of arms limitation provided that it is to the advantage of everybody and we hope very much that that will go forward later this year <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i have said on a number of occasions that it would not be reasonable to ask the israelis to sit down and negotiate with a body which is said to be set upon the destruction of the state of israel <e> <s> i do not think that that would be reasonable <e> <s> i hope therefore that and this is really repeating the venice declaration the arabs will recognise the state of israel and that israel will recognise the rights of the palestinians <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that perhaps some would say that the ems even without us has evened-out some of the fluctuations in european currencies <e> <s> i think that it has been our fear that sterling because it is rather volatile particularly because it is an oil currency is in rather a separate position <e> <s> i do not believe that the events of the last few weeks have made us change our mind about that <e> <s> but there is no doubt that we would want to join the ems as soon as we believed that we could <e>", "<cs> my lords on the noble lords first question the four areas in which i hope that during our presidency we can make some progress are insurance air fares banking and the recognition of professional qualifications <e> <s> i am of course as well aware as he is of what has happened <e> <s> i think that i would perhaps put it a different way and not so elegantly i would have said that it has got stuck and i think that we have to unstick it <e> <s> that will be the objective of the next six months we shall try to push it along <e> <s> whether or not we shall succeed i do not know but that is what we shall try to do <e>", "<cs> my lords my visit will be very short indeed <e> <s> i shall only be there on monday and will be returning monday night <e> <s> i think that it would be very unlikely that i should have time to do that <e> <s> in <e>", "<cs> my lords i really do not think that this is quite the right moment to go into president mitterrands policy which was fully set out in his election programme and which is well known to the noble lord <e> <s> equally the noble lord will know the prime ministers position if he reads her speeches <e> <s> i do not think that it would be particularly fruitful for me to embark on a prcis of their two economic policies <e> <s> i was trying to say that there was a general recognition that each country had its own problems which were particular to it and obviously each country has its own government <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the second question is yes <e> <s> i want to see just as everybody in your lordships house would want to see good relations with france <e> <s> on the first question it is certainly not the intention of the initiative agreed by the ten yesterday to cut across anything that the united nations is doing or will do <e> <s> indeed as the noble lord will know it is proposed that the secretary-general of the united nations or his representative should be a member of the conference <e> <s> so there is no question of cutting across the united nations <e> <s> indeed we told the secretary-general of the united nations about these proposals earlier on and he has welcomed the initiative <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that is travelling a good deal further down the road than the point we have reached at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble baroness <e> <s> i think the idea is all right the miracle may be a little bit later <e>", "<cs> no my lords the noble lord opposite is really wrong about this <e> <s> in the government announced cuts in the bbc external services amounting to about million annually to be carried on over the years <e> <s> those cuts were taken on the capital improvement programme <e> <s> since then in the two years which have intervened the income of the bbc external services has risen from million in to million in this current year <e> <s> if the suggestions which we are making to the bbc are accepted it will mean that there will be a capital expenditure of the bbc external services in the next nine years of well over million <e>", "<cs> my lords it is as i say a question of priorities you have to choose to make some savings <e> <s> i should not have thought myself that cutting off the broadcasts in maltese which happen for five minutes every day to an island in which almost everybody speaks english would be an unparalleled loss to the bbc <e>", "<cs> my lords i would rather doubt that and i do not agree with the first part of the noble lords question <e> <s> one only hears about cuts but it so happens that last year we increased broadcasting in russian by a considerable amount broadcasting in turkish by a considerable amount and introduced a new service in pushtu to afghanistan <e> <s> so it is not all that difficult <e>", "<cs> my lords of course we have done that and i think the noble lord should perhaps have given us the credit for having done it <e> <s> may i give him a few figures because i am well armed <e> <s> since st april the number of diplomatic service staff has declined by per cent <e> <s> posts have been closed eight reduced in staff and the largest posts have been reduced by per cent <e> <s> since over per cent <e> <s> of the consulates which we have had abroad have been closed <e> <s> remembering as i do the outcry that there was in this house about the closure of subordinate posts some years ago i think that your lordships would be wary to suppose that any further closures would be a very good idea <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a certain sympathy with what the noble lord says <e> <s> the last thing that in normal circumstances one would want to do would be to cut the bbc external services at all <e> <s> but the fact remains that we are committed to spend a very large sum of money extra on the bbc external services <e> <s> it is a question of trying to discover how we can live within our budget although it is a lot more money and make a decision as to which are the priorities and which are not <e> <s> i daresay that sometimes one gets it wrong but it is a genuine effort to try to decide which is the more important of the activities of the bbc external services <e> <s> these decisions do mean that there are certain cuts in the vernaculars but i think that the really important things are retained and what is more we shall be able to hear them <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that my noble friend if he still is <e> <s> can have listened to the answer to the first supplementary <e> <s> perhaps he would be kind enough to study it <e> <s> as for the will of parliament the will of parliament is renewable <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord also should beware of some of the figures with which he is provided because i do not know whether they take account of all the things which the government have to take account of <e> <s> i assure the noble lord that the figures which i have given are absolutely right <e> <s> i would agree with the noble lord that nobody likes these decisions but if one is faced with a decision to have to make rearrangements within the bbc external services it is really up to the government to make a <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i do not think that we can go on too long about this <e> <s> it may be that your lordships will want to put down a motion i do not know <e> <s> i would simply point out to your lordships that the decisions taken by the government will mean that very many millions more people will hear the bbc than can hear it now <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the noble lord can have heard any one of my answers <e>", "<cs> my lords i paid a short working visit to moscow for discussions with the soviet foreign minister on th july <e> <s> my principal purpose was to present to the soviet government the proposal adopted by the european council on th june for a two-stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the two speakers <e> <s> i am sure that it was right to try this proposal on behalf of the community and i am sure it is right to go on trying because the problem is not going to go away <e> <s> as the soviet government themselves admitted in a communiqu signed by mr gromyko and mr gierek after his visit to poland the first item in that communiqu was headed the problem of afghanistan <e> <s> so the soviet union recognise that there is a problem <e> <s> it is undeniably true and i think that the soviet union understand this that until such time as the problem is solved and there is a complete withdrawal of soviet <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right <e> <s> there are the strategic level of conferences the strategic arms limitation talks one aspect of which are the talks on theatre nuclear forces which the united states have said that they are prepared to start before the end of the year and which was part of the nato double decision on modernisation <e> <s> there are then the talks on mutual and balanced force reductions which have been going on in vienna ever since i can remember and which are not making very much progress but at which we are still trying to come to an agreement on the basis on the data on which decisions are taken <e> <s> then there is the european security conference in madrid which is discussing a french proposal for a disarmament conference in europe which is still being discussed in rather a positive way and it is possible that there may be a decision on that within a week or two if we can get agreement with the soviet union <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that was one of the elements which was put forward as a reason for the european proposals being unrealistic <e> <s> i would doubt whether a solution to that problem would necessarily tip the scales in the direction of an acceptance by the soviet union <e> <s> but all of us are quite prepared to look at the composition if it would be of any value <e>", "<cs> i think the visit was useful my lords <e> <s> there were those who said before i went that the soviet union and mr gromyko would not be prepared to discuss the problem of afghanistan <e> <s> in fact we discussed it and nothing else for two and a half hours and that in itself was useful <e> <s> as to the results i summed it up yesterday when i said that i was disappointed but not surprised <e>", "<cs> yes my lords my noble friend is absolutely right and that is the position which i explained to mr gromyko <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not realise the noble lord was so attached to moscow <e> <s> he is of course quite right in that we took preparatory action with all our friends and long before the proposal was revealed we had discussed it with the americans indians pakistanis iranians with all our friends and had got the go-ahead from and blessing of nearly all of them that the european council the european countries should present this plan <e> <s> that was right because we had international opinion behind us and i made that plain to mr gromyko yesterday <e> <s> the noble lord asked me whether i was happy with what happened <e> <s> i had hoped for more but i could have got less and that about sums it up <e> <s> as for the powerful deputation to which he referred i have a feeling that mr gromyko faced with european foreign <e>", "<cs> i think that is right my lords that it added to the weight of what we were doing in that important countries of europe supported it and indeed initiated it <e> <s> yes i shall be making a very long speech to another parliament tomorrow to which i hope my noble friend will be listening <e>", "<cs> i will certainly do the latter my lords <e> <s> but the trouble with the first part of the noble lords supplementary is that there really is a difference of opinion about the figures <e> <s> we in europe think the soviet union have in theatre nuclear force weapons that is nuclear weapons in europe a superiority in warheads of something like to and the soviet union think we have a superiority of to <e> <s> until such time as the parties can get round a table talk about it and get a base on which they are all agreed i really do not think it will be possible to get any solution to arms limitation in that particular sphere <e>", "<cs> not so much enlarge on it my lords as mr gromyko alleged outside intervention in afghanistan <e> <s> the object of the proposal put forward by the community was first of all a conference on international aspects which would cover any allegations which the soviet union might make and which of course would also cover the occupation <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that both noble lords who have spoken are under a total misapprehension about the object of these economic summits <e> <s> they were started some time ago with the purpose that the leaders of the seven largest industrialised countries in the world exchange views informally and get to know each other and also get to know their own opinions their own differences of view and their own problems <e> <s> it was never the intention that these summits should become an occasion when the industrialised countries issue a blueprint to solve all the economic problems of the world and they never have <e>", "<cs> my lords a number of matters were discussed i do not think that i can go into every matter that was discussed <e> <s> it may have been mentioned when the heads of government were present and the foreign secretaries were not but in the plenary session i did not hear it mentioned <e> <s> no doubt there were discussions about that <e> <s> chancellor schmidt may have put his point of view and no doubt president mitterrand put his point of view as did president reagan <e> <s> however i doubt whether that had much bearing on the relative passage about east-west relations which went much more widely than that and which was concerned with the total relationship between east and west <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the situation in the middle east is very worrying indeed <e> <s> this morning the representatives of the arab ambassadors asked to see me and i had a discussion with them <e> <s> at the same time i asked the israeli ambassador to come to see me and i pointed out to him the offer that has been made about the cease-fire and hoped that there would be some immediate response from the israeli government <e>", "<cs> my lords there was a discussion about the whole of the north-south and indeed about the cancun conference which will take place next week and at which i shall be attending the preliminary conference at cancun <e> <s> her majestys government subscribe to the words in the communiqu <e> <s> i very much hope that when our economic circumstances permit we shall be able to spend more money on aid <e> <s> i think that the noble lord lord hatch is quite mistaken if he is deriding the amount of money which we spend now <e> <s> we are spending over billion this year on aid <e> <s> i do not think that that is anything to be ashamed of <e>", "<cs> my lords not as such though of course this matter arose in the discussion of the problems of the least and lesser-developed countries <e> <s> these are the sort of issues which will arise at the cancun conference and of course if the global negotiations start again <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that one could deny that it would seem to be fairly obvious <e> <s> however there is of course another effort going on to get a cease-fire because the secretary-general of the united nations has been charged by the security council in a unanimous resolution to get a cease-fire and to report back within hours <e> <s> so there are two efforts being made to get a cease-fire <e> <s> i only hope that one or other of these efforts will succeed <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree per cent <e> <s> with the noble lord lord shinwell <e> <s> i think that before there is any prospect of taking any peace process in the middle east further or even getting it going it will be necessary to get a cease-fire in lebanon <e> <s> that is the pre-requisite of anything happening <e> <s> the noble lord is quite right because he repeats in essence the two principles of the venice declaration <e> <s> the venice declaration said that the arab states should recognise the state of israel and its right to live in security <e> <s> the second principle was that the state of israel should recognise the rights of the palestinians <e> <s> i find it extraordinarily difficult to understand why anybody should object to those two principles <e>", "<cs> my lords the israelis have agreed that mr habib should be allowed to negotiate with the lebanese government about a cease-fire <e> <s> the problem with that is that the lebanese government are not in control of what is happening in south lebanon <e> <s> as i always say some of your lordships do not always agree because you are faced with unpleasant facts and some of the facts are very unpleasant to israel it is no use pretending they do not exist because they are not going to go away <e>", "<cs> i think partly the trouble is that there is so much expectation and so much publicity about the summits that everybody thinks indeed i think the noble lords lord bruce and lord gladwyn were almost guilty of this that some magic formula is going to emerge from them <e> <s> the difficulty is that it does not <e> <s> the magic formula does not emerge because however much the seven leaders of the industrialised world would like it they do not have a magic wand to wave which is going to cure these ills <e>", "<cs> i am coming to that my lords <e> <s> i apologise to the noble lord i have not finished yet <e>", "<cs> does play <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble lord but i was actually looking at the noble lord lord swann <e>", "<cs> my lords actually that is precisely what i said <e> <s> i have said that mr haig and mr gromyko did meet and have decided to do precisely <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the ideal situation would be and this is repeating the venice declaration for both parties to recognise one another conditionally on the basis of a negotiated settlement <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the noble lord is quite right about the five principles <e> <s> the seventh principle says that all states in the area shall have the right to live in peace <e> <s> the israelis have understandably pointed out that since the saudis do not recognise israel it might very well be that israel is not considered a state <e> <s> but at a press conference which he gave in riyadh when i was there prince saud in answer to a question made it quite clear that he actually meant after a negotiated settlement the state of israel <e> <s> i think that that is a considerable move forward <e> <s> with regard to the last part of the noble lords supplementary question i tend to think and her majestys government tend to think that in the end there must be a negotiated settlement and there really will have to be conversations <e>", "<cs> that would be much the best my lords but i do not think that either side would have much to lose by saying i am prepared to recognise you if you recognise me <e>", "<cs> i could my lords but the trouble with the plo is that so often it makes a statement which sounds very moderate but then two or three days later it seems to contradict it by saying something which is immoderate <e> <s> the noble lord is of course quite right when he says that there is the state of israel which we recognise while the plo is an organisation and we do not recognise organisations <e> <s> her majestys government have always said that the plo represents a great many palestinians <e> <s> indeed there are some who think that there is no other recognised organisation which represents the palestinians and therefore it will have to be taken into account <e> <s> it seems to me that if that organisation was to say in effect that it would recognise the state of israel on condition that its own rights the palestinian rights were recognised that would be a step forward and something which the israelis ought to welcome <e>", "<cs> my lords that is precisely what we are seeking to get them to renounce <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think mr arafat the plo or anybody else can be under any misapprehension about her majestys governments policy <e> <s> we have made perfectly clear what we feel about the situation in the middle east and have set it out in a number of documents <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are committed to the negotiation of realistic equitable and verifiable arms control and disarmament agreements on nuclear and conventional weapons <e> <s> as president reagan made clear in his speech on th november no nato weapons conventional or nuclear will ever be used except in response to attack <e> <s> the government do not believe that a declaration of the kind proposed by the soviet union would be a serious contribution to genuine arms control and disarmament since it would not be a substitute for negotiated agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords the first object of western defence policy is to deter a war not to fight one and i am not at all sure that the proposal which the noble lord is making would have that effect <e> <s> it would seem to me that in a time of crisis it would really be of no use to rely upon the words of somebody having said that they would not use such-and-such a weapon first <e>", "<cs> my lords this is the sort of question which it is almost impossible to answer <e> <s> if there were circumstances in which the whole of the western world seemed to be overrun and we were in danger of complete annihilation as a society and as a civilisation i think one would have to think very carefully about what action one took <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i agree with my noble friend i found conventional warfare extremely disagreeable at first-hand <e> <s> i think that perhaps some of those who ask these sort of questions misunderstand the reasons why we have had peace in europe for the unprecedented period of years <e> <s> i believe that it has very largely been due to the deterrent policy of the nato alliance <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that would be a very good start to the negotiations <e> <s> the problem and the noble lord will know this is that in relation to the mutual and balanced force reduction agreements there is still argument going on after a number of years about what are the statistics and the facts <e> <s> i think that what is essential in the negotiation which starts in vienna on monday is that there should be a real will on the part of both parties to these negotiations to come to an agreement and to get some results and the first thing that they must do is to decide on the facts and what they are <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i thought i made clear in my supplementary answers exactly why i thought there was an objection <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that when the chips are down declarations really are not of much use <e> <s> it seems to me in circumstances of this kind that what one wants to do is to take an area of weapons as the united states and the soviet union have done and negotiate to see whether you can limit them down to nothing <e> <s> that seems to me the practical way of doing it because the real difficulty between east and west is a lack of trust and confidence <e> <s> so why do we not start by trying to get arms limitation talks which in the end will build up the confidence which i hope will bring down the levels of all arms <e>", "<cs> my lords i like the noble lords supplementary on this question better than his supplementary on the other one <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know what the rules are about that but i will certainly look at it <e> <s> the only thing i would say about the first part of the noble lords supplementary question is that i think we must be very careful as lord shinwell has said not to allow this country to be defenceless <e>", "<cs> indeed my lords and from the bench at the back <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord misunderstands the situation <e> <s> nobody is seeking to impose anything on anybody <e> <s> what the contact group are seeking to do is to get agreement among all the parties concerned on constitutional principles which will reassure those concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords the contact group and in particular the united states government have been in touch with the government of south africa over a period of time and all five of us are hopeful that there will be a settlement <e>", "<cs> my lords if all governments support good principles that is all to the good <e>", "<cs> my lords the front-line states and swapo have commented upon the contact groups proposals and have made one or two comments and suggestions upon them but broadly speaking i do not know whether there would be very much difficulty <e> <s> the south african government and the namibian internal parties have not yet replied <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend is suggesting the use of force he will recollect that international law and the united nations charter require disputes to be settled by peaceful means <e> <s> that is what we have been trying to do but there should be no misunderstanding by the people of the falkland islands about what we think of this occupation this presence on southern thule or of our pledge to the people of the falkland islands <e>", "<cs> my lords according to the argentines there are people on southern thule seven naval scientists and four civilians three of whom are radio technicians and one a meteorologist <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know what my noble friend wants to reassure the falkland islands about <e> <s> i thought i said in my answer to his original supplementary question that the falkland islanders should be in no doubt about the commitment of this country to them and the pledge that we have made to them on a number of occasions <e>", "<cs> my lords with your lordships permission i should like to make a statement about events in poland <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both the noble baroness and the noble lord and i agree entirely with what the noble baroness has said <e> <s> i did not mention the financial position although i think that all of us and it was certainly evident in the remarks made by the noble lord lord gladwyn recognise that the economic position of poland is extremely serious indeed <e> <s> i think we shall all have to think and wait and see what happens in poland before we make up our minds what it is desirable or possible to do <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to what the noble lord said and indeed to what the noble lord lord gladwyn said about hoping that solidarity will be able to come to some compromise with the government i think we would all hope that that were possible and that the gains that have been made over these last years are maintained <e> <s> with regard to the rescheduling of debts of course what happens is primarily for the commercial banks themselves but we do have very good liaison with them <e> <s> i think before we make any statement about that or give any indication of how we think private banks should proceed or give them any advice we had better wait and see what happens in poland <e>", "<cs> my lords it is extremely unfortunate and sad that the ambassador should have had a serious heart attack <e> <s> i am happy to say that he is getting better but he is in hospital and of course we are deprived of his judgment and his advice <e> <s> but i am glad to say too that there is a very efficient second-in-command there and he had an hours talk with the deputy foreign minister yesterday so i do not think there is any question of being deprived of access to the polish government <e>", "<cs> no my lords there has been no request <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is far too soon to say whether or not the restrictions have prevented <e>", "<cs> my lords i really do not think that this is the moment to do that <e> <s> i think we must wait and see what is going to happen <e>", "<cs> my lords to use the slang phrase the noble lord seems to have wrapped it up <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness misunderstands the position my lords <e> <s> the private banks have to make up their own minds but there is a lot of debt which is government debt which we have agreed to reschedule it has been agreed over a period of time to reschedule it <e> <s> i shall be meeting this evening the other foreign ministers of the community over dinner when we shall be discussing other matters but we shall be talking about this matter and will have an opportunity then to discuss all these things <e> <s> of course all this has been going on over a period of time and it is only a question whether we go on as we were going to go on or whether events in poland will make it difficult for us to do so <e>", "<cs> i shall be available my lords so long as the noble lord is available and the house is in session <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend for his congratulations but as he has pointed out in his supplementary we are now back to where we were two years ago <e> <s> still that is better than being further back than we were two years ago and so i think we ought to be grateful for that <e> <s> to reply to the noble lords question i think the answer is that it has been difficult in terms of domestic spanish politics <e>", "<cs> my lords the concluding draft document highlights the points on which we were agreed and the points on which agreement is still to be reached <e> <s> from that point of view i think it is useful and we must hope that it is possible to reach agreement <e> <s> but i would be less than candid if i did not say that the events in poland have made things in madrid that much more difficult <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall look at the first part of that to see whether what my noble friend suggests would be possible <e> <s> on the last part of my noble friends question it seems to me that since the csce conference flows from the final act at helsinki which specifically includes the problem of human rights which are now at risk in poland and for violations of which the polish government and we believe the soviet government are responsible i think that there will be an admirable opportunity when the conference resumes on th february for the west to make known to the soviet and polish governments what they feel about these matters <e> <s> for these reasons i think that it would be a mistake to call the conference off <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the last part of the question i think that i should like to look at the whole subject to see whether it is worth doing and whether the amount of trouble that would be involved is worth it <e> <s> i agree with the noble and learned lord as regards the first part of his question <e> <s> i think that th february would be an excellent opportunity for making plain the wests position <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that forever would be too long but a little longer would be right <e>", "<cs> my lords of course we are all in favour of human rights and we are in favour of dtente if it is made possible by those with whom we seek to get agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his compliment but it is the but that counts in the end <e> <s> i do not think that i agree with the noble lord <e> <s> i think he will find that in the helsinki final act it is fairly clearly written down what is meant by human rights and everybody subscribed to it <e> <s> there is no doubt whatever that there has been a violation of human rights in poland <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise if the noble lord opposite did not get the statement early <e> <s> it was actually handed in to the opposition whips office minutes before but i think we shall have to see why the noble lord did not get it <e> <s> if perhaps minutes is not enough or something went wrong i think the noble lord lord gladwyn got it then perhaps we shall look at it <e> <s> but i do apologise if the noble lord did not get it <e> <s> i apologise if it is my fault or my sides fault if it is his fault that will be different <e>", "<cs> my lords not on everything <e> <s> there were a number of issues on the guidelines which were not agreed <e> <s> for example the growth of the agricultural budget in relation to the rest of the budget <e> <s> there were reservations about how our refunds were going to be financed <e> <s> there were other things than degressivity which were not agreed but from the point of view of the government it is not possible for us to agree to a scheme in which we get less and less money every year regardless of whether our problem is solved <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that our unadjusted net contribution is speculative in some sense because of the world price of food which has an enormous effect on our contribution for the reasons which noble lords have stated <e> <s> i think our estimate would be that the situation would be rather worse if we had no adjusted contribution than it was at the time when we were having our negotiations in <e> <s> this makes it very important that we should get an adequate refund <e> <s> what we have been doing is exactly what the noble lord has suggested <e> <s> it is because agriculture is a small part of our economy that the imbalance in the budget exists <e> <s> the fear we have is that the guidelines which have been produced by the council which have not been agreed but which are agreed except generally speaking for us are very weak in that they will not mean that less money will be spent on agriculture and more money on other things <e> <s> consequently if that is so and we are right it means that the underlying british problem will not be solved which makes degressivity all the more unacceptable <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree entirely with my noble friend that these things hang together <e> <s> the guidelines on agriculture are of absolutely vital importance if we are to get an adequate solution to our problem <e> <s> the noble lord lord gladwyn asked what was so special about five years compared with four years <e> <s> the more often you have this dispute then the worse it is for the community and for the cohesion of the community and incidentally the worse it is for all of us who have to negotiate this over god knows how many hours and days <e> <s> i think that if we can get a solution which will last as long as possible it would be sensible for everybody <e>", "<cs> my lords the agricultural prices by and large never get settled until april and i hope we shall get this out of the way before april <e> <s> we have all got to do the best we can <e> <s> the super-levy which in my judgment is an excellent way of reducing the surplus on milk is one of the issues on which we are in a to minority <e>", "<cs> my lords there were so many parts to that question to some of which the answer was yes and to some of which the answer was no that perhaps the noble lord will accept from me the answer that we intend to get a good result <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may explain it is a little complicated the question of food aid to poland <e> <s> what was happening before th december was that the community was selling food at a discount of per cent <e> <s> to poland and the other per cent <e> <s> was a matter for the country concerned which was selling the food <e> <s> as the poles did not have any foreign exchange it was in fact an per cent <e> <s> credit from the country concerned <e> <s> therefore if we as a country had gone on as we were before th december last year we would actually have been giving the food free to poland per cent <e> <s> community money and per cent <e> <s> british taxpayers money <e> <s> what we have decided to do is to use the money which the community has set aside million ecu for humanitarian aid that is aid in the form of food to the non-government agencies in poland where we know it will get to the right people <e> <s> but we do not intend to give credit for food at the moment to the polish government at the expense of the british taxpayer <e>", "<cs> my lords the commission will produce the proposals in the normal time scale <e> <s> they will be discussed in the normal way by the agricultural council <e> <s> i have no evidence of it but i imagine that the commission will base their proposals on much of the guidelines on agriculture as has so far been agreed <e>", "<cs> my lords may i answer that question in some of my old capacities as well as my present one <e> <s> i am sorry if the foreign office is at fault <e> <s> these statements as the noble baroness knows are prepared at very short notice in a considerable hurry <e> <s> as we know they have to be looked at and passed by all those concerned <e> <s> sometimes it is impossible to get them to noble lords in time for noble lords to have a long period to look at them <e> <s> it is a courtesy to send them <e> <s> however what we ought to do is to give as much notice as we possibly can and i have in the past been in the same position myself and we will look to see what we can do <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that both noble lords who have responded to the statement are right in saying that diplomacy is the way to settle the problem <e> <s> after all that is why we have the foreigh office and diplomats so we must solve it in that way <e> <s> with regard to the specific questions of the noble lord lord shackleton i agree with him that the preservation of british interests is in the interest of peace in the area and as he knows the government support the antarctic treaty and i believe that has been useful in keeping the cold war out of that area <e>", "<cs> i take it that my noble friend is talking about the economic development of the falkland islands and the dependencies my lords <e> <s> that is obviously something which has been very much in the minds of successive governments <e> <s> the noble lord opposite was concerned with that aspect in the report he made about the falkland islands <e> <s> it is something we are always examining but my noble friend will recollect that at the moment public money is short <e>", "<cs> yes my lords the position in southern thule is the same as it has been for a number of years <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for those comments and i have no doubt that the argentine government as a result of these exchanges and no doubt what will take place in another place will be fully aware of that <e>", "<cs> i did not know the surface fleet had been condemned my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for making those points because he has deep knowledge of the area i was going to say unrivalled knowledge but the noble lord opposite has knowledge of the area they both have very specialised knowledge of that part of the world <e> <s> i am therefore grateful to my noble friend for the help he has <e>", "<cs> my lords my recollection is the same as that of the noble lord <e> <s> i did not know about more than one case but i will certainly look it up <e>", "<cs> the governor said that the argentine forces had attacked port stanley from both the landward and the seaward sides at approximately six in the morning yesterday local time <e> <s> the governor had attempted to inform the british government of the position before he was captured and had sent a last message to london <e> <s> however communications difficulties had meant that it did not get through <e> <s> the governor said that the atmosphere among the islanders was one of immense sadness at the turn of events and the alien presence with which they were now faced <e> <s> but their loyalty to britain remained undiminished <e> <s> there had been no civilian casualties <e> <s> the prime minister thanked the governor for all his efforts and through him the royal marines <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords we have been in touch this morning and the noble lord is wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords we have been in touch with south georgia this morning <e>", "<cs> my lords in common with others of your lordships who have spoken i also welcome the franks committee report and am grateful for the care the speed and the thoroughness with which they have tackled a difficult and complicated subject <e> <s> i am sure that the prime minister was right to set up the inquiry for the invasion of the falklands islands came as a great shock to the british people and it is proper that there should have been an investigation into its origins <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had an interesting debate <e> <s> i should be less than truthful if i told your lordships that after having listened to two speeches from the opposition front bench i knew where the labour party stood in this matter but of course if they divide against my motion it will be quite clear where they stand <e> <s> however there is one thing that all of us would agree about and that is that we have had quite enough oratory for one day <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships are lucky because we have speaking in this debate the noble lord lord armstrong who will be able to answer some of the questions which have been raised <e>", "<cs> my lords those of us who like the noble lord lord mayhew and myself saw and liberated a concentration camp during and can never conceivably forgive or forget what we saw <e> <s> the horror and the inhumanity are inexcusable <e> <s> yet i feel deep unease about the bill for reasons given in various speeches over the past three hours <e> <s> that is partly because i do not like retrospective legislation partly because i do not believe that it is possible to obtain a fair trial and partly because years later peoples memories are very odd indeed <e> <s> my noble friend has had recent experience of that on a similar subject <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will have particularly welcomed the robust and predictably sensible and humane speech of the most reverend primate <e> <s> the debate so far has been harmonious <e> <s> i hope that i shall do nothing to disturb that <e>"]
