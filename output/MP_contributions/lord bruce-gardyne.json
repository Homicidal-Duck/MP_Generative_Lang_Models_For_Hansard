["<cs> my lords it is almost years since i lost my virginity in another place <e> <s> i must confess that it seems to me that this is one of those experiences where familiarity does not yield assurance and therefore it is with at least as much trepidation as then that i crave your lordships indulgence this afternoon <e> <s> i think that a maiden speech in this house has at least one advantage over a maiden speech in the other place certainly at the time when i made mine in that in those days at any rate it was considered wise or prudent to devote at least one-third of ones speech to praising the beauties perceptiveness and intelligence first of ones constituents for sending one there and secondly of ones predecessor who by his death or other indisposition had made your journey possible <e> <s> as i understand it those problems do not arise in this house and so one can turn at once to the subject of the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords while joining in the thanks to my noble friend for the statement may i ask him whether he can confirm that if nissan was to choose to go to a special development area the total cost to the taxpayer of the project if it went through to phase would be in excess of million <e> <s> can he also say what would happen if having decided to proceed to phase of the project nissan found itself unable perhaps for good and sufficient reasons to achieve the per cent <e> <s> local content which has been suggested <e> <s> can my noble friend tell the house whether assurances have been obtained from the french government that these british nissan cars will be deemed to rank for free circulation <e> <s> my noble friend will have seen the comment of the chairman of renault on this matter in the past few days <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join with other noble lords who have thanked the noble lord lord ezra for introducing this debate this afternoon <e> <s> obviously the timing is admirable as we still have a few moments to look forward to the march summit <e> <s> certainly the debate has produced a number of varied and important comments for the government to take account of including those made in the admirable maiden speech of the noble lord lord fanshawe of richmond and if i may say so the particularly magisterial contribution from my noble friend lord soames <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely take my noble friends point <e> <s> all that i would say on the other side is that to our partners we as possessors of north sea oil an asset that they do not possess and hence running for the most part a substantial balance of payments surplus do not strike them as most obviously in need of special treatment <e> <s> that is the trouble <e>", "<cs> my lords i would only say to the noble lord for whom i have the greatest respect that he must know different finance ministers from those i know <e> <s> i believe that they have rather different priorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> i am not sure that i entirely follow his argument if he will forgive me <e> <s> if i understand him correctly he seems to be saying that of course we should exclude foodstuffs if they happen to come from france but at the same time we are mad to deny ourselves access to foodstuffs which come from third countries <e> <s> there seems to be a conflict there and i wonder whether he can resolve it <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether my noble friend can tell us a little more about the raising of the balance of the money that british aerospace were seeking <e> <s> are we to understand that there will be no question of a government guarantee for raising these funds <e> <s> if it is possible for british aerospace to raise million-odd for the airbus project in the city without government guarantees and presumably the government are themselves satisfied as to the prospects of a return on the project why cannot the whole of the sum which british airways have sought be raised in the same manner <e> <s> finally could my noble friend tell us whether it is the case that british aerospace have effectively written off million in the last two years on its civil aviation projects <e> <s> and is my noble friend satisfied that british aerospace can finance that part of the cost of the airbus project that it is expected to produce from its own return in profits without undue strain <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend sure that his reply to the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos is altogether wise <e> <s> is it not at least arguable that if this tour of south africa took place and as a result we were drummed out of international sport we might be saved a great deal of embarrassment from the visitations of the younger members of the english and scottish populations ripping up the towns of western europe whenever we play <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend explain to the house why in certain quarters it should apparently be deemed to be perfectly moral to use oil supplies for the purpose of revenue raising but not seemingly to use electricity supplies for the same purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say whether he is entirely satisfied with the workings of the compensation arrangements under the wildlife and countryside act <e> <s> are we not beginning to see that the warnings that were given by a number of noble lords including my noble friend lord onslow at the time of the passage of this act were correct <e> <s> those warnings were that if we made provision by which people were going to be compensated for doing things that it probably would not have occurred to them to do in the first place we would be liable to find a substantial rip-off of the treasury <e> <s> is that not now precisely what is happening <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord allow me to intervene <e> <s> i apologise for interrupting him but i have studied with great interest what is said in paragraph of the committees report and i wonder where the word budgetary occurred in the context of what were unacceptable situations <e> <s> i thought that the reference in the original text was to unacceptable situations <e> <s> where did the reference to budgetary situations come from <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join with other noble lords who have congratulated the noble lord lord obrien for introducing this subject today so lucidly and also for the admirable report of the committee which is the subject of our debate <e> <s> i should also like at once to offer my apologies to the noble lord lord ardwick and my noble friend lord cockfield because it is possible owing to a longstanding dinner engagement for tonight that i may not be able to stay until the end of our debate <e> <s> but i shall be very careful to read their remarks <e> <s> if i may refer briefly to what the noble lord lord seebohm has been saying about the ems i read carefully the previous report from your lordships committee recommending that we should take our place in the european monetary mechanism <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not be somewhat unwise for the cabinet to decide tomorrow to embark on a course of withholding which whether or not we like it would indisputably put us outwith the pale of community legality while negotiations were still continuing <e> <s> secondly is not the crucial issue not the matter of the budget but in the long term the control of agricultural surpluses <e> <s> could my noble friend explain what in fundamentals is the difference between what he calls strict financial guidelines in the agricultural sector and a character who was well known to the noble lord lord wilson of rievaulx and the noble lord lord cledwyn in the s and s called solomon binding who turned out to be a man of straw <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend confirm that there is surely some doubt about what the noble lord <e> <s> lord gladwyn has said <e> <s> is it not the case that any proposition for an increase in own resources has nothing to do with the luxembourg compromise and clearly requires the specific endorsement of each individual government and of each individual parliament <e> <s> can my noble friend at the same time confirm that there is no reason for us to be anxious that in the pursuit of the perhaps rather narrow issue of the budget share we should be deterred from achieving that real control of future community expenditure which seems to be threatened at the moment by expansion rather than contraction owing to the arguments over milk and the total failure to deal with the fundamental problem of grain prices <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that i have here in my hand a pair of glasses acquired without the benefit of the national health service acquired without the benefit of prescription and acquired from an unauthorised purveyor <e> <s> is she also aware that they cost me and that they suit me to a t <e> <s> is it not the case that by far and away the best thing we could do for the overwhelming majority of pensioners would be to allow them to acquire spectacles in exactly the same manner as i have acquired these <e>",

rise to support this clause <e> <s> i do so with trepidation not least because like my noble friend lord chelwood i can claim no experience of participating in local government except in the sense that i suspect he <e> <s> too <e> <s> shares of having from time to time participated in the process of seeking the election of candidates for local government <e> <s> that is rather a different proposition <e> <s> i rise with considerable trepidation also because i appreciate as i am sure do all your lordships the strength of feeling that part ii of the bill in particular has aroused <e> <s> i wish briefly however to put two propositions which i submit that it might be desirable for your lordships committee to consider before we come to a vote on the clause <e>", "<cs> i am bound to say to my noble friend that i do not see that your lordships are denied any say whatever <e> <s> as my noble friend has reminded your lordships committee under the affirmative resolution procedure this matter would come before this house and the other house for consideration <e>", "<cs> i share the noble baronesss wish not to delay your lordships but i should like to comment very briefly on her last point <e> <s> the fact is that all the voters pay taxes they may not pay direct taxes but they pay indirect taxes which account for a very substantial proportion of government revenues <e> <s> in the case of local government a substantial section of those who have the power to vote contribute in no way to the rating income <e> <s> on the other hand equally one has approaching per cent <e> <s> of the rating income collected from a section of ratepayers the business ratepayers who have no vote at all in the proceedings <e> <s> therefore i have to say again to the noble baroness that i do not see that she will improve in any way on that mismatch by having more frequent elections <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble friend for giving way <e> <s> i am afraid that i do not follow the argument that there is some distinction between voting down in this place a proposition for which the government have a clear and specific electoral mandate and giving the other place an opportunity for second thoughts about that proposi-tion because after all under any circumstances that is what voting down in this house is surely bound to mean <e>", "<cs> my lords just before the noble lord leaves that point i wonder whether he could explain to the house how one could achieve agreement with the trade union leadership if one did not make precisely the sort of concessions to which he is taking exception <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join with other noble lords in congratulating the noble lord lord wilson on raising this important topic this afternoon <e> <s> i do not know that he came up with any particularly specific <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i thought that was what the noble lord said and that was what i said he said <e> <s> if i could resume my remarks and try to keep them as brief as i may the point i was seeking to make was that if we look back over the record of directed investment by the state in this country it is hard to see that it has made a very tangible contribution to long-term employment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the first question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend for that information <e> <s> bearing in mind the advice of my right honourable friend the chancellor that over the medium term domestic inflation is determined by the performance of the monetary aggregates would my noble friend go so far as a treasury spokesman was quoted after the publication of these figures last week of saying that there was no evidence from the domestic monetary aggregates to suggest a need for action on interest rates <e>", "<cs> my lords may i press my noble friend on perhaps a rather less exotic indicator namely the remarkably exuberant progress of bank lending to the personal sector <e> <s> does that not in turn suggest that there may be something rather excessively expansive over current credit conditions in the economy <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> but should we not conceivably reckon that the department of industry should have had consultation with rolls-royce before this remarkable deal was struck bearing in mind that in the past two years this business has lost million or more of the taxpayers money <e> <s> is it not a matter of some concern that they should provide million dollars in loan and equity for a business that has not even started to lease from some maharishi gentleman an aircraft carrying the engines of their competitors <e> <s> does that not sound like a pretty loony deal for a company in this degree of trouble to undertake <e>", "<cs> my lords may i seek to reinforce what i detect to be my noble friends instinct for well-doing in the matter of the governments shareholding in british aerospace <e> <s> in view of the very substantial speculative element in the order book of this company on the civil aviation side and not least the airbus project is there not something to be said for the government seizing the opportunity if an offer is made for this company to unload some of their current shareholding and diminish their risk in the areas of high risk in which british aerospace is engaged <e>", "<cs> hear hear <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the pac report also demonstrate that the lions share of any employment created and still being created by this investment by the long-suffering british taxpayer has in fact occurred in colorado <e> <s> in view of that fact would it not be wise that we should be prepared to accept any offer to acquire the capital of this company which offers a respectable return on the investment which the taxpayer has made whether it comes from the united states or elsewhere <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord allow me to intervene <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend leaves that argument may i just get this clear because it is of relevance to the amendments that will follow <e> <s> is he therefore saying that the reason for retaining the obligation of prescription is not to prevent harm to adult eyes as he agrees that that cannot arise but in order to enable a test to be made for disease of the eye <e> <s> is that the proposition that he is advancing to the house <e>", "<cs> i bow to the enormous experience which the noble lord lord northfield has displayed in this area <e> <s> i must admit that in my involvement in politics it has not frequently been my experience to find myself as wholeheartedly in agreement with every word that the noble lord has expressed from the opposition benches as has been the case with what the noble lord has said tonight <e> <s> i would go further and make it clear that so far as i am concerned i would not for a moment quibble at his amendment which seems to me to fulfil admirably the purposes that the amendment which i have drafted seeks to achieve <e> <s> therefore i am only too happy to tag on behind the noble lords amendment tonight <e>", "<cs> what i am trying to say is that the argument that eye testing as at present conducted is a means of controlling preventing or checking eye disease is totally unsubstantiated and all the evidence points in the opposite direction <e> <s> i believe it is arrant nonsense to pretend that the sort of tests that are conducted as a means of obtaining a prescription for glasses are a means of identifying serious eye disease that is exposed as completely hollow <e> <s> this is the proposition that i am advancing to your lordships <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> i did not condemn the profession <e> <s> i did not utter a word of condemnation <e> <s> all i said was that there did not seem to be very clear evidence that sight testing was a very effective way of discovering serious eye disease <e> <s> would the noble baroness comment on the proposition from the opticians themselves that nearly people in this country are suffering from undetected glaucoma <e> <s> does not that suggest that the eye testing regime which we have at present is less than wholly effective if indeed there is any truth in the figures <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the first question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend for that information which i shall study with great care and interest <e> <s> will he elaborate on the statement issued by the bank of england last week which said that the present condition of monetary policies suggested that on domestic grounds there was no case for a rise in interest rates <e> <s> are we to deduce from that that although the government have no intention of using a rise in interest rates to restrain any tendency of the pound to fall against the dollar they would still take action on the interest rate front if they were satisfied that the growth of consumer credit in particular was too fast <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend agree that it really is a little breathtaking for the noble lord lord barnett to dismiss the significance of monetary aggregates since he played such a prominent and distinguished part in educating the then chancellor into their application in the middle s <e> <s> may i press my noble friend further on one point <e> <s> can he say whether it remains the policy of her majestys government that movements in the exchange rate are to be regarded as a possible indicator to domestic monetary conditions rather than as a pointer to the desirability of changes in interest rates <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend for that information <e> <s> would he be inclined to agree that after all the delays and disappointments which have occurred in this project and in particular its consistent failure to obtain certificates of airworthiness in the crucial united states market hope deferred is beginning to make the heart a bit sick and that this following on the de lorean project is entitled to make one wonder whether the ulster province is really altogether wise in relying so heavily on apparently thousand to one outsiders <e> <s> can my noble friend assure the house that there would be no question at all of any further funds being transmitted to lear fan at least until an american certificate of airworthiness has been obtained <e>", "<cs> my lords may i press my noble friend one stage further on what i think he said earlier <e> <s> i thought i understood him to say that her majestys government would be extremely cautious about committing more funds this side of the endlessly deferred satisfactory conclusion of the process of certification in the united states <e> <s> but surely all experience suggests that it would be the height of folly to commit any more funds over and above those that have already been committed at least until this certification has been achieved <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not nevertheless somewhat preoccupying if as i understand my noble friend to have said her majestys ministers have no standing in this matter <e> <s> apparently if the broads authority had not fortunately had belated second thoughts this worthy gentleman would have received his per acre over and above which as i understand it he could have received before that a grant for draining out from the ministry of agriculture <e> <s> then if there were no long-term arrangements for conservation at the end of the year for which this gentleman had been paid his per acre he could have received another grant from the ministry of agriculture for doing the same work all over again <e> <s> surely this reinforces the point made by my noble friend lord onslow that we must look again at these procedures before the treasury is ruined by them <e>", "<cs> i should very much like to support what the noble lord lord northfield has said <e> <s> i must say it is always a great joy and a pleasure to hear a socialist extolling the virtues of individual choice and customer satisfaction <e> <s> i hasten to acknowledge that the noble lord on this subject at least has always been entirely consistent and i do not remotely suggest that this is a deathbed repentence or anything <e>", "<cs> my lords is not it possible that if this strike is prolonged it might prove the most comfortable way in which to dispose of the dock labour scheme as trade would automatically shift to the ports which do not suffer the dead hand of this appalling incubus <e>", "<cs> my lords i intervene only briefly to express the hope that my noble friend will read very carefully the speech that he has just made to the house <e> <s> i think that when he does so he will see that it provides a very strong case for having accepted the earlier batch of amendments that we discussed a short while ago <e>", "<cs> my lords reverting to the matter of the finance bill i should like to start my remarks by echoing strongly the congratulations of the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby to my noble friend lord king <e> <s> of course i fully realise that any congratulations that i offer from my junior position in your lordships house cannot possibly carry a fraction of the weight of those offered to my noble friend by the noble lord lord houghton but i certainly felt that all our expectations which were high enough of the contribution which my noble friend would make to the debates of your lordships house based on his unrivalled experience in industry and in management were borne out by the splendid contribution that he made to us this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords may i intervene <e>", "<cs> my lords with reference to the inflation expectations is the noble lord not conceivably discounting the likely impact of the very striking weakness of commodity prices at the same time <e> <s> surely that will have a significant impact in holding down the inflation figure and are not some of the latest figures that are being bandied about inclined to overlook that factor in the equation <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend shed light on one aspect of the argument over the current years overspend <e> <s> is it the case that while we are seeking to bring the arrangements for financing this within the rules of the community the commission is apparently perfectly at liberty to add to the size of the overrun by unlimited disposals of for instance butter to the soviet union more or less of its own volition and without any ability on our part to control it <e> <s> is that really the position <e> <s> does it not suggest that the situation could get worse rather than better in that respect <e>", "<cs> i must say that listening to the noble lord lord bruce i could not help recalling the old canard about the gentleman who was detected unrolling loo paper out of the window of a train <e> <s> when accosted about the reason for his conduct he explained that it was to keep the elephants away <e> <s> when it was pointed out to him that there were no <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is entirely correct and i can only apologise to your lordships for such a lamentable slip of the tongue <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> the point that i was seeking to make perhaps not very coherently was that as i understand it as a result of this bill there will be provision by which we no longer find ourselves obliged to pay enormous sums often running into tens of millions of pounds and sometimes running into hundreds of millions of pounds to highly capital-intensive projects without any option or discretion and regardless of whether or not those projects would have come forward without assistance <e> <s> i do not think that the noble lord has said anything that disproves that point <e>", "<cs> i must say that i still find the prospect of the nissan company possibly drawing regional development grant years from today at a rate which will have disappeared for any domestic british company four or five years before the nissan company embarks on the second phase of its operations a fairly crazy way to proceed <e> <s> however in the light of the comments of my noble friend and the points that he makes about the drafting of this amendment which i accept i ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i want to make sure that i have understood what the noble lord has just said <e> <s> is the noble lord seriously contending that had we been members of the european monetary mechanism last month we should have been able to avoid the rise in interest rates that then occurred <e> <s> is not the truth of the matter that in order to maintain our place in the monetary grid we should have had to acquiesce to a much sharper swifter and earlier rise in interest rates <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened to what the noble lord lord hooson had to say about the need for investment <e> <s> i must honestly confess that i have sometimes felt that we have not suffered in this country so much from inadequate investment as inadequate return from the investment that we have made <e> <s> if one contemplates the record of state provision of investment from concorde right the way through to delorean one has to have considerable reservations about the ability of governments in this country to make wise and salubrious decisions in this area <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble baroness will forgive me i am just completing my remarks <e> <s> i do not wish to delay the house and i am sure that she will pick up that point when she comes to make her own speech towards the end of the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords as a congenital waiverer on this issue may i put a question to my noble friend <e> <s> does not past experience suggest that outside the exchange rate mechanism sterling tends to weaken less than the member currencies in the exchange rate mechanism when the dollar is strong and to strengthen less than the member currencies in the exchange rate mechanism when the dollar is weak <e> <s> might this not suggest given that so much of our own imports are actually denominated in dollars and given that if sterling were to strengthen substantially against the dollar this would assist in the abatement of inflation expectations the moment at which we might contemplate joining the exchange rate mechanism would be the moment at which we had concluded that the dollar was finally turning turtle as at some stage it will always supposing that we can identify that moment <e>", "<cs> my lords let me begin by apologising to the noble baroness lady burton for not having heard the beginning of her remarks <e> <s> i had been watching closely for the commencement of the debate but nevertheless i am afraid that i managed to miss the beginning thereof and i apologise to the noble baroness and to the house <e> <s> i should also like to join with all those who have complimented the noble baroness on raising this subject tonight and on her own great personal record in the promotion of the interests of the travelling consumer <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend allow me to intervene before he leaves that point <e> <s> surely as one understands there are many tens of thousands of supposedly valid tickets which are in issue and in circulation <e> <s> what happens about them <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> would he not agree that it is already apparent that that estimate is likely to be at least double the original cost <e> <s> is it not by now apparent that the original assurance that it would have no impact in squeezing the other programmes in the defence budget which we were given when this expensive purchase was embarked on is no longer sustainable <e> <s> is it not therefore desirable that we should review this purchase at the earliest possible date <e>", "<cs> my lords having listened carefully to my noble friends replies would he not agree that in two respects at least the equations have changed since the sums were originally announced <e> <s> first as the noble lord lord carver has pointed out is it not a fact that we have abandoned in my view <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that the main single reason why the yield from capital transfer tax has hitherto been lower than the yield from death duties which the party opposite replaced with ctt is that the former chancellor mr denis healey produced the surviving spouse concession <e> <s> is it not therefore somewhat illogical to complain at the result that that has produced <e>", "<cs> my lords early in his speech lord graham congratulated both the noble baroness lady birk and the noble baroness lady stedman <e> <s> as i understand it the noble baroness lady birk made it clear that she intended to pursue her amendment to a division and the noble baroness lady stedman made it clear that she and her colleagues had no intention of supporting it <e> <s> i cannot quite share the catholicity of endorsement which the noble lord lord graham expressed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for that further explanation <e> <s> i do not know whether one should declare an interest in this sort of debate as a ratepayer to the glc but as a ratepayer to the glc i entirely share the belief of my noble friend lord avon in the desire for all speed to see it on its way <e>", "<cs> my lords i understood the noble baroness to point out that the order could be reconsidered <e> <s> i still think that the whole tenor of her remarks and the purpose of this amendment must come close to tieing the governments hands in the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the first question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble friend for that answer <e> <s> will he bear in mind in considering the whole project that in the eyes of some of us sir denis rooke the chairman of the british gas corporation is an over-mighty subject who badly needs watching <e> <s> will my noble freind bear in mind that the last deal that the british gas corporation concluded on the frigg field resulted in forcing successive british governments to charge a tax rate on diesel and heavy oil fuels vastly out of comparison with that which is charged throughout the rest of the community <e> <s> is this not an example of the folly of allowing this corporation to go its own wild way <e> <s> will my noble friend not agree that so long as it becomes apparent to the markets that british gas is prepared to offer the norwegians p a therm for gas for which they are only prepared to pay p a therm on comparable terms to north sea gas licensees it must call into question the whole logic and sense of any such deal <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may press my noble friend to go one stage further on the matter of exports <e> <s> is not the fact of the matter that under existing rules british north sea licensees are obliged to land all gas from the north sea in the united kingdom and therefore it is totally uneconomic to export it to third customers and hence the british gas corporation which does this marvellous job as a monopoly purchaser for a commodity for which effectively by law there is no other customer <e> <s> therefore can my noble friend assure the house first that there is good news to the effect that this deal is on the point of abandonment and secondly that if by any chance it were to go through the restrictions obliging the north sea licensees to land their gas on the coast of the united kingdom would also be lifted <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend for that information <e> <s> nevertheless can he confirm that under the terms of that agreement the british taxpayers are still exposed to the tune of some million of taxpayers money for this new second gullwing northern ireland project that it still has not obtained and shows no sign of obtaining a united states certificate of airworthiness which is absolutely essential to its success and now that the operators have scaled down the level of employment that they expect the likely cost to the british taxpayer of every job created on this second gullwing project could amount to over a job <e> <s> is that money really well spent <e>", "<cs> my lords before we leave this subject may i suggest to my noble friend that all <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e> <s> may i point out that the last word of the question should be policy and not police <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend for that very reassuring answer <e> <s> does he agree that the rise in interest rates this week far from being a disaster in this context could be taken as a highly desirable move <e>", "<cs> my lords for the elimination of doubt can my noble friend confirm that the currency monetary aggregates were first introduced by the then chancellor mr healey when he was responsible for these matters and that the current target is from per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords is it true that the period of procurement for this weapons system has now been stretched from to years <e> <s> is there any hope that if that has already happened we could stretch it out to years years or even infinity <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of the question of the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon can my noble friend tell us which national institutions have gone into convulsions since mid-day yesterday <e> <s> and is it not the fact that the underlying situation today with very low external borrowings and a much lower rate of inflation is fundamentally different from previous so-called sterling crises of the past and that in view of the governments assurance that they are determined to persevere with the elimination of inflation there is very good reason to expect that sterling will re-establish its status fairly rapidly <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not intended to inflict myself on your lordships this afternoon since i did not really feel qualified to enter into the arguments about this terrifying problem <e> <s> however may i in passing just pick up a comment by the noble lord lord winstanley and one by the noble earl lord attlee <e> <s> i must say that i do agree with the noble lord lord winstanley that we could with advantage perhaps devote rather less of our resources to the pursuit of cannabis and relatively rather more of our resources to the pursuit of the hard drugs <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may briefly intervene since i was responsible when i was in a previous incarnation in the treasury for considering <e>", "<cs> my lords when one contemplates the consequences of the last deal the frigg field deal which british gas carried out which as my noble friend knows has always obliged us to maintain artificially high taxation on fuel oils are the government not greatly to be congratulated on finally deciding that it is wiser not to encourage the british gas corporation to make these kind of deals <e> <s> further <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble lord lord houghton i shall aim to be brief although for a somewhat different reason i think that i am probably infectious and i would rather limit your lordships exposure <e> <s> like my noble friend lord ferrers and the noble earl lord iddesleigh i must begin by declaring an interest as a director of the central trustee savings bank and perhaps also a secondary interest in that when i was a minister in the treasury i was very much involved in what

that i hope very much that this bill will be given a fair wind and a rapid course to the statute book and that i was a little disappointed by some of the responses from the other side <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure your lordships will all wish to congratulate the noble lord on raising this highly topical question tonight <e> <s> it might be said that if he had had one of his earlier dates for the subject it might have appeared even more topical but that was beyond his power to command <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> is the noble lord really sure that the signal which concerned the markets in the autumn was the revelation which as he knows very well is in any case statutorily imposed upon the chancellor of the so-called fiscal adjustment in the autumn statement rather than the indications which had been persisting for some time and which seemed to persist until early into the new year that the governments intention was that if sterling steadied at all they would be determined to bring down interest rates and that if sterling slid they were determined not to allow them to rise <e> <s> was that not more the message which the market did not like <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> can he assure your lordships when my right honourable friend the minister for industry told the commons the other day that honda have not asked for any grant in respect of this operation that we can draw the conclusion that if they were to ask for any grant they would not get it and above all that there would be no question in future finance bills of a honda clause to replicate the nissan clause in last years finance bill <e>", "<cs> my lords notwithstanding the welcome that one would certainly offer to incoming businesses of this kind is not the real issue the question of taxpayers support for such an operation <e> <s> since swindon is not in a development area will my noble friend confirm that if there were any question of selective assistance being given to this investment from the taxpayer over

interrupting the noble lord and i am most grateful to him but would he not concede that at the time of the argument over the future of the royal bank there was a most active and enthusiastic group in edinburgh who were actually promoting vigorously the acquisition of the <e>", "<cs> i have already declared my interest in this matter <e> <s> i hope that your lordships will resist the amendment moved by the noble lord lord taylor for the following fundamental reasons <e> <s> of course i accept what the noble lord lord jacques said about accountability and how under the amendment the board of the tsbs will be accountable to the trustees who are proposed to be established under the amendment <e> <s> i do not think that that is the objection to the amendment <e>", "<cs> as i argued on second reading if we went down this road we would have agonisingly difficult demarcation problems between those who had acquired deposits just in time and those who had abandoned their deposits before the relevant date <e> <s> i do not think that we could easily arrive at equity down that route <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the noble lord for interrupting but he posed a direct question to me <e> <s> my answer to his question is yes of course i am desirous of seeing the legitimate interests of depositors being taken care of in the best possible way <e> <s> my argument is that the depositors themselves would be far better satisfied and logically satisfied with a direct equity participation in their own names in the ownership of this business than the notional concept of some trustees holding a notional ownership on their behalf <e>", "<cs> in view of the challenge laid down to me by the noble lord lord houghton i think i should intervene <e> <s> i shall do so very briefly because we have covered this ground fairly extensively on earlier amendments <e> <s> i entirely stand by the response that i gave to the challenge that the noble lord threw to me on an earlier amendment <e> <s> i believe that the appropriate interests of the depositors and staff of the tsb are appropriately covered by the terms of the letter as to the intentions of the tsb at the time of flotation which sir john read addressed to the chancellor of the exchequer <e> <s> i do not want to go over that ground again <e> <s> my noble friend lord gowrie has already quoted this to your lordships <e>", "<cs> i should like to raise an issue which is somewhat peripheral to this particular amendment although it arises from what my noble friend lady elles said <e> <s> i do not know whether i can tempt my noble friend in his reply to trespass onto perhaps somewhat dangerous ground but i should like to do so if i can <e> <s> it seems to me that the issues raised in clauses and of this bill are perhaps not those on which this committee should take dramatic views <e> <s> if i had been a member of the other place i should have been inclined to take very considerable exception to a number of the changes suggested in clauses and <e> <s> but here as my noble friends have pointed out we are dealing with the methods of election to the european parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords i should again declare an interest as a director of the central trustee savings bank <e> <s> i listened with great care to the speech <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for interrupting the noble lord but i just wonder whether he is aware that the financial institutions based in edinburgh have always been celebrated as investors not in other parts and certainly not in scotland not even in other parts of the united kingdom but overseas and mainly in north and south america <e> <s> so there is no comparison with that situation <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend agree or not agree that if the primary purpose of government policies is the abatement of inflation by the application of monetary discipline at home then membership of the ems would be contra-indicated <e> <s> but if on the other hand the governments primary purpose has been the achievement of an exchange rate level whether disclosed or not then logically it would follow that membership of the ems would be indicated <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the answer to the point raised by the noble lord lord ezra about where the money is to come from that most of it is likely to come from money that otherwise would be invested in gilts and would therefore go to the treasury in any case <e> <s> however is my noble friend aware that some reservations about the wisdom of passing a monopoly into the private sector may not be held exclusively on the opposite side of the chamber <e> <s> am i not right in thinking that the government at the election promised the electorate that competition would be injected into the gas industry and that this was over and above the provisions of the oil and gas enterprise act <e> <s> what has happened about that commitment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> does he recall not so long ago according to sir denis rooke he was given a public rebuke by my

lords if i may bring my noble friend back to my original question for a moment does it not concern him a bit that sir denis rooke should have indicated over the weekend that he has not made up his mind what sort of regulatory agency he will be prepared to have to supervise his activities <e> <s> and does it not concern him a bit that sir denis rooke should be indicating his intention of seizing the earliest possible opportunity to cross-subsidise competition with the private sector out of the proceeds of his monopoly operations <e>", "<cs> my lords is it true that the nationalised industries

introducing this subject this afternoon <e> <s> personally i always find it rather alarming to speak in a debate initiated by my noble friend <e> <s> that <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept entirely that correction from my noble friend <e> <s> i should have said that the concept of a share-owning democracy was a rather later evolution of the same concept <e> <s> nevertheless i would argue that it has been a professed objective of successive tory governments since the late s to achieve wider share ownership <e> <s> in practice we have seen a steady contraction of the share of individual equity owners in the totality of equity ownership until that is this government arrived <e> <s> this government for the first time have actually begun to achieve on a major scale a reversal of that tide <e>

could conduct his strictures on the absence of the spread of share ownership without any reference to what has happened so far at any rate in the case of british telecom <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord not agree that the experience of some of the banks with their bad debt provisions might suggest that it is not only the managements of the manufacturing and commercial companies that need some scrutiny but the managements of the banks themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend not aware that the optical press is carrying letters from opticians advising other opticians how prescriptions can be drafted in order to ensure that they cannot be taken next door and the glasses supplied from another purveyor <e> <s> surely this is an inevitable result of the quite unnecessary stipulation that those who require reading <e>", "<cs> my lords i join in the thanks to my noble friend for repeating the statement <e> <s> was it <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to congratulate the noble lord lord grimond for raising what i entirely agree with him is a matter of great importance <e> <s> i am sure that all your lordships will agree with what he had to say about the achievements of the city of london over the years and the vital importance of the role that the city has played and should play in the future as an attractor of resources for this country <e> <s> i am sure therefore that all your lordships must be grateful to the noble lord for raising this matter and the governments white paper tonight <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for interrupting the noble lord but in what he has just been saying is he really allowing for the effect of british telecom privatisation <e> <s> the best estimates were that there were about million individual shareholders who took up shares in british telecom <e> <s> even if one accepts that there was an element of overlap with those who were already shareholders and that some may have gone in for stagging purposes the increase in the immediate shareholding population must have been very large in any case <e>", "<cs> surely it would be for the assistance of the committee if the noble lord could spell out precisely what he meant when he said that deregulation in the case of devon and norfolk had had a damaging effect a specifically damaging effect on the availability of transport in those areas <e>", "<cs> i have listened with great interest to what my noble friend lord de la warr has had to say in support of this amendment <e> <s> he accused the government of taking a leap in the dark <e> <s> i think we have to consider the alternative <e> <s> my noble friend expressed anxiety which is obviously shared by a large number of your lordships about the risk involved <e> <s> as he put it if this legislation is carried without an amendment of the type which your lordships are now discussing those in country areas will risk the prospect of their buses disappearing <e> <s> but what is the prospect that they face at present <e> <s> does not the whole trend of past experience with bus services if we extrapolate it suggest that those services will disappear if we continue in the way we are going <e> <s> i submit that the choice is not between what my noble friend describes as a leap in the dark and the prospect of clear and continuing services particularly for the rural areas <e> <s> it is more a choice between what the noble lord may wish to call a leap in the dark and a journey down a tunnel without any end and only darkness <e> <s> the prospect is that particularly in the rural areas the bus services will softly and silently steal away <e>", "<cs> on the second point my understanding is different <e> <s> there has been an increase admittedly a very small increase in the services in the rural areas around hereford city <e> <s> so far as norfolk is concerned again my understanding is that what was proposed by the eastern counties bus service before the trial area was introduced was that if the local authorities wished the existing services or anything like them to be maintained they would have to increase the scale of subsidy by million <e> <s> however virtually identical services to those which eastern counties offered before the trial service was introduced are now in existence but on a scale of subsidy of which is by any standards a very considerable saving <e>", "<cs> i have a nasty suspicion that we would not be able to devise a system of trial areas which was deemed to be complete to the satisfaction of those who have grave reservations about the whole concept of deregulation <e> <s> all i can say is that if one reads the evidence of the experience of the trial areas and listens to those who have operated within the trial areas and who have represented the interests of the trial areas they seem to have been a most remarkable success and that applies in particular in the case of hereford <e>", "<cs> i immediately humbly apologise to the noble lord for so inappropriately naming him <e> <s> i shall try not to make that mistake again <e> <s> he said that in the city of hereford fares had gone down but they had

obliged to set the record straight in one particular which referred to myself in view of what was said last week in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not conceivable that the moral of this

bill which is at present before your <e>", "<cs> my lords in all the years that the noble lord lord ross and i have sat on opposite sides of both chambers i do not think i can recall a single occasion

lord on that point <e> <s> the figure is million gross but million of that is earmarked for return to the profession so it is million net in public expenditure terms <e> <s> it was my understanding

judgment on that <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for interrupting my noble and learned friend but it would appear that he is leaving the question of appeal <e> <s> could he just clear up the point raised by my noble friend lord campbell <e> <s> is there any precedent for appeal running from one of these professionally dominated bodies to the adjacent hunts <e>", "<cs> my lords as a shareholder in british telecom may i ask my noble friend whether it is not appropriately the duty of the management of this business to charge the prices they believe their market will carry within the terms of their licence <e> <s> if there are any grounds for disquiet in this situation do they not arise exclusively from the degree of monopoly privilege which is left with british telecom <e> <s> does my noble friend draw from that the conclusion that we should ensure that british gas when they come on the market do not enjoy a similar degree of monopoly privilege <e>", "<cs> my lords i joined with the noble lord lord ross of marnock two or three nights ago to resist a proposition which to my mind would have enabled members of the pharmaceutical profession to control entry into that profession

similar privilege on existing bus operators <e> <s> unlike i suspect almost any others of your lordships house i confront regularly the propensity of existing buses to do curious things like mounting street corners when i am traversing london as i do day by day on my pedal bicycle <e> <s> so i am well aware of the sort of hazards to which the noble lord lord underhill referred in introducing this amendment and with which he sought to wring your lordships withers <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend tell us whether or not there are any plans in this connection for looking at the implications of mortgage interest relief in view of its impact on credit expansion and credit sales and also its indirect impact on monetary policy <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord beswick for introducing this topic this evening <e> <s> i shall be very interested to hear the reply from my noble friend at the end of the debate <e> <s> i confess that i personally

judgment <e> <s> it sounds rather like the kind of body that used to be presided over by the noble lord lord williams of elvel and i <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e> <s> i apologise for interrupting him <e> <s> however i was a little concerned by what he said about the inability of the government to influence the level of bank lending <e> <s> i should have thought that experience surely has suggested that this was not entirely the case but the ability of the government to influence bank lending and in effect to steer by the sterling m monetary aggregate also incidentally depends on the willingness of governments to allow short-term interest rates to fluctuate very substantially and the problem is of course that governments tend to be reluctant on that

at any given moment <e> <s> i very much agree with what my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter had to say about the other factors which could have a much more significant impact on the price that the government obtain for this asset when it comes to putting it into the private sector <e>", "<cs> i apologise for interrupting my noble friend but he made a rather important statement just now and i want to make sure that it is clear <e> <s> he said that the government would choose the flotation date on the basis that a fair price could be obtained against the prevailing market conditions or words to that effect <e> <s> does he mean that a fair price could be obtained in the estimation of the government in general terms or the price that could be obtained would be a fair one given the conditions in the market place <e> <s> there is a distinction there <e>", "<cs> i would sit down quickly if i were you <e>", "<cs> my lords with reference to that part of the statement which referred to civil aviation can my noble friend tell us whether he is satisfied that the commissioner in brussels responsible for transport has his heart in the deregulation of air fares or does he occasionally look over his shoulder at the sort of policies which the noble lord lord underhill told us reflected the views of the labour party in these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords i find myself in some small degree of dilemma over the amendment <e> <s> i put down an amendment in committee which is now amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it is also germane to this argument <e> <s> i hope that when my noble friend replies to the debate he will perhaps be able to deal with the point that was then raised to an extent that he could not do when we were discussing the matter in committee <e> <s> i go along with everything that my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter had to say about the inevitable conclusion that one would draw from the amendment that its intention is to deny the consumer the benefit of lower gas prices when the opposition parties insist that it is the consumers interests that they have in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of our past calamitous experience with incomes policies is not my noble friend and the government entirely right to insist that the proper means of controlling future inflation is by observing an effective control and discipline over monetary policy <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with everything that my noble friend lady gardner of parkes said in objecting to this amendment <e> <s> it seems to me that there is one relevant piece of evidence which we might have if possible and it is this <e> <s> the noble lord lord gallacher said that once british gas went into the private sector it would suddenly transform itself into a wicked free-booting

diamond for giving way <e> <s> i think he must have misheard what i said <e> <s> i said that i accepted that there was evidence of a considerable number of complaints about the conduct of british

noble friend for denying to him and particularly your lordships house the opportunity to discuss this interesting information in response a month ago <e> <s> may i ask him whether he is satisfied that if one looks at all the various indicators apart from mo which frankly has a rather limited fan club it does not begin to appear when one considers not only the broad aggregates but also bank lending

does this not possibly suggest an acceleration of inflation in <e>", "<cs> my lords i too want to speak very briefly before we leave this bill <e> <s> i must confess that i thought when it first came to us that it was in the words quoted by the noble baroness lady burton a waste of an historical opportunity <e> <s> i am bound to admit that i have not changed that view <e>", "<cs> i should like to

hacking <e> <s> i am afraid that i was looking at the wrong group of amendments <e> <s> i was looking at the social security legislation <e> <s> i accept entirely that the amendment about which i was talking is in a following group <e>", "<cs> i should like to apologise once again to the noble lord lord hacking for jumping the gun on this amendment owing to my misapprehension as to the nature of the grouping on the previous amendment moved by the noble lord lord williams <e> <s> since in effect i have already spoken to this amendment i do not intend to weary the committee by repeating my remarks <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend replies may i say that i am very grateful to him for the reassurance he has been able to give <e> <s> one will obviously want to study that carefully <e> <s>

noble friends amendment but i should like to raise one query about the stipulation that one party is to be a recognised bank or licensed institution <e> <s> i have the feeling that in the case of commercial transactions of the kind which are designed to be covered by the amendment industrial and other non-financial companies might well not normally have a bank or licensed institution within the meaning of the banking act as the opposite party in the transaction <e> <s> therefore even the amendment as it stands might be drawn too tightly to meet the needs of genuine commercial transactions <e>", "<cs> obviously i shall be anxious to listen carefully to my noble friends response to the debate on this group of amendments <e> <s> as regards amendment no <e> <s> we seem to be back to the whole question of what is signified by engaging in a business which we have discussed previously <e> <s> how occasional has the activity to be in order for the person to be described as

alacrity <e> <s> i am bound to admit that hope he understood the full import of his explanation of the amendments more clearly than i did <e> <s> i begin to wonder when i try to engage in rather feeble efforts to improve my own personal portfolio whether i shall not have to find an sro to shelter under <e>", "<cs> i admit that i am slightly mystified by what my noble and learned friend the lord advocate has said about the loophole that would be opened up by going below the per cent <e> <s> limit <e> <s> i referred to this in my intervention on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i do not want to labour the point further but it does not seem to answer the problem which i should have thought was a not wholly uncommon occurrence where a publicly quoted company might wish to take in the course of its business a significant minority share purchased from individual shareholders in a private company <e> <s> one needs only to think of examples usually in public companies though not always such as the whitbread umbrella <e> <s> i am not arguing whether that is a necessary or desirable arrangement <e> <s> but the important point is that it does not seem at all logical on the face of it that such arrangements should be invalidated as a sort of by-blow of this legislation <e> <s> i very much agree with the noble lord lord williams that this is another matter that i should have thought your lordships would need to consider with some care again as before <e>", "<cs> i should like to support my noble friend lord colville on this amendment <e> <s> i should declare an interest as a director of the trustee savings bank <e> <s> in common with the committee of london and scottish bankers the trustee savings bank strongly supports this amendment and the change which my noble friend has proposed i think for the reasons that he has explained <e>", "<cs> before we return to this matter on report i wonder whether my noble friend would ask his officials to work out what would be the likely additional cost to those who are using the services of banks as a result of the clause standing as it is <e> <s> i am sure that my noble friend lord boardman is entirely right that the additional cost could by miles outweigh any conceivable consequential benefit to the customers of the bank and that surely is the crucial consideration <e>", "<cs> i should like briefly to support what my noble friend lord colville has said <e> <s> i think this is a crucially important point <e> <s> i have declared on a previous occasion my interest in these matters as a director of the tsb <e>

been made <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for interrupting <e> <s> the noble lord will correct me if i am wrong <e> <s> my understanding is that the saving of million to which reference was made is

"<cs> my lords in the light of these questions and answers will my noble friend nevertheless agree that the crucial point is not whether the airbus is gaining orders there is no dispute that it is but

terms the needs of austin rover for capital injections in the future coupled with the cost of british aerospaces civil aircraft programme will leave horrendous burdens on the balance sheet of that business <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend assure the house that as his noble friend the secretary of state for trade and industry reminded us the pursuit of a competitive exchange rate can prove to be a will-o-the-wisp as happened in the s and s and that he will continue to give us that wise advice and will not allow himself to be nobbled by the parties opposite by the treasury or anyone else <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend tell us what proportion of the million of launch aid for the a has so far been spent on orders in taiwan and elsewhere on the pacific rim in the united states or in canada <e> <s> can he also say what proportion of the million for the a and a is likely to go in the same direction <e> <s> was that the governments original intention <e>", "<cs>

regularly <e> <s> would he care to comment on what seems a well authenticated estimate that last year alone the loss on intervention may have been in the region of billion <e> <s> surely a retrospective view of the cost of intervention over the previous year is not so much market sensitive as perhaps sensitive to the deduction that the prime minister may indeed have been right to point out that bucking the market is a bit of a mugs game <e>", "<cs> my lords with all possible deference and respect to the noble lord lord obrien perhaps i may dare to ask my noble friend to explain this <e> <s> how can the publication of accounts relating to a previous year possibly be market sensitive <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that information <e> <s> has he noted

not have gull wings <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of our past experiences in these matters could my noble friend assure us that this house and indeed another place would have an opportunity to look at any specific proposition for taxpayer subvention which might arise in these circumstances <e> <s> could he also at the same time confirm that over a great many years this shipyard has been invited by ministers to observe the obligation to become commercial and has so far shown a total inability to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend confirm in the light of his reply to the noble lord lord monson that legislation is to come before this house very shortly which will enable the government to correct the nonsense of requiring people to obtain a preliminary prescription before they can buy reading glasses <e> <s> can he assure the house that there will be an amendment to that effect now that the government have accepted the verdict of the european court that this is not a medical provision <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i shall have to disappoint the noble baroness because unfortunately i do not employ a gamekeeper and my garden is not as yet open to the public <e> <s>

good friend <e> <s> it is indeed tragic that he was unable to live to witness this evenings events as i am sure he would have wished to do because as a number of noble lords have pointed out he had promoted a bill analagous to this one on numerous occasions over a great many years <e> <s> i am sure that he would have wished to see the first occasion when this particular proposition got as far as it has <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> even if one accepts as i am sure that many of us do that reciprocity is a perfectly reasonable instrument to use to secure access for british firms to overseas financial markets is it not questionable in this instance whether it is entirely wise to make a monkey of the bank of englands regulatory role since

of this matter <e> <s> at the same time my honourable friend the economic secretary to the treasury is saying that in no circumstances will her majestys government tolerate european community rules for the application of reciprocity for access to financial markets <e> <s> surely there is a fundamental contradiction here which has to be resolved <e>", "<cs> my lords in addition to the many cogent arguments that my noble friend has advanced against a reference in this case is it not the fact that the monopolies commission in the past has indicated that it does not feel able to adjudicate over the issue of reciprocity of access to markets <e> <s> if we have rules on reciprocity of access to markets we have to do it as in the case of financial banking companies by government action and not

in mind that we were told consistently in the case of concorde that it was always best to put in further money rather than risk losing the investment that we had already made and that that always turned out to be untrue <e> <s> is that not a salutary warning for us in the case of airbus <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend inform your lordships of the last occasion on which the seasonally adjusted unemployment register fell by in nine months <e>", "<cs> my lords is the crucial point not the balance of trade in manufactured goods but the need to ensure that whatever the balance of trade generally may be in goods and services there is a countervailing inflow of capital and that interest rates are maintained at the level required to ensure that that countervailing inflow occurs <e>",

is quoting the evidence relating to front seat belt wearing but we are talking here about the wearing of rear seat belts <e> <s> what evidence do we have to demonstrate that what is relevant to the one is relevant to the other <e>", "<cs> it is in the hands of the noble lord lord monson but so far as i am concerned that would seem to be a sensible way of proceeding <e> <s> i was about to make that suggestion myself because it is a matter of argument as to where the precise words should appear in the bill <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the noble lord for interrupting him but perhaps i may ask him whether he has ever been involved in a school run where children are picked up and possibly deposited at different points because they do not always go to the same school <e> <s> has the noble lord really contemplated the practicality of having the adult in the car legally responsible regardless of the circumstances subject to legal pains and penalties if a child picked up at one point has not immediately attached the seat belt and if another child picked up at another point replacing a child which has perhaps been deposited at a different school on the way around has not done so <e>

not always receive the attention it deserves <e>", "<cs> i listened carefully to the response by my noble friend lord nugent <e> <s> it reminded me slightly of a story i heard many years ago from the

words in a recumbent position <e>", "<cs> i apologise for interrupting my noble friend but is he satisfied that the parent or driver of a car in which a child was so placed that <e>", "<cs> perhaps i

before the committee is no reason whatsoever why we should follow that had example <e>", "<cs> what i was saying to the noble lord was that i confidently believe that if it had not been for what in another place is known as the payroll vote and there had been a genuine free vote that legislation would not have been carried in another place <e> <s> i am unimpressed by the argument that we should reject the amendment because it is inconsistent with the principles written into the front seat belt legislation <e>", "<cs> that is a broader issue <e> <s> i agree with the noble earl that the relationship between the state and the individual is a complex one <e>", "<cs> i accept that the certificate must relate to the child <e> <s> there is no argument about that <e> <s> i should have thought that the wording of the amendment was logically to be preferred to the wording in the bill as it stands <e> <s> however if my noble friend is convinced that the present wording of the bill is appropriate i bow to his superior wisdom in the matter and am happy to withdraw the amendmnt <e>", "<cs> i have always understood that when referring to a child the correct pronoun was it <e> <s> i remain of that opinion but i should not dream of pressing this amendment if my noble friend prefers the grammatical usage in the bill as it stands <e> <s> i shall bow to his wisdom and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for his response <e> <s> that was certainly the message conveyed when i read the debates in another place <e> <s> however i confess that i am still quite unable to see precisely where in the bill as it stands the stipulation appears <e> <s> that is why i should have thought it desirable if only for the avoidance of doubt to write in the amendment we are now discussing <e> <s> that would leave the issue beyond peradventure of a doubt <e>", "<cs> i suppose that i must accept that assurance <e> <s> i find it bizarre that it was apparently necessary to amend the bill in another place to ensure that the affirmative resolution procedure applied and yet my noble friend refers back to the substantive act <e> <s> however on the assurance of my noble friend that the affirmative resolution procedure will assuredly apply to the bill <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i must confess that i am surprised that my noble friend on the front bench has not intervened on the amendment because as i pointed out it was a minister in this government who himself said that he could not imagine that we should be facing the legal obligation of the compulsory wearing of seat belts where there was no compulsory fitting <e> <s> it seems to me somewhat surprising that we should have a shift of position without an explanation of the ministerial thinking behind it <e> <s> as i said to my mind there was logic in what was said in which still applies today <e>", "<cs> i find the argument by the noble lord lord monson entirely persuasive <e> <s> it was agreed in another place that it was appropriate for the affirmative resolution procedure to apply <e> <s> we have been assured that that has been enacted

quite a long way wide of drafting <e> <s> i can even think of occasions when almost the same amendment has been introduced on third reading as had already <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment tabled by the noble lord lord monson which also stands in my name <e> <s> i am hound to say that i think it is rather an important amendment because i entirely agree with the noble lord

terrors of the earth <e>", "<cs> my lords in this instance i cannot support the amendment of the noble lord lord monson <e> <s> i was not wholly convinced by the arguments against it advanced by my noble friend lord nugent <e> <s> they seemed to amount to the proposition that one should not be paid compensation even if it can be demonstrated that something that is designed for ones good has done one injury <e> <s> i am not sure about that but i am deeply doubtful about the wisdom of spreading ever wider the scales of compensation for what i would call the happenstances of life of which i believe there are already far too many <e> <s> the generality of consumers are liable to suffer from the burden of meeting the costs which arise from such compensation claims satisfied in the courts <e> <s> therefore on those much wider grounds i cannot support the new clause put forward by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i confess that i share a good many of the anxieties of the noble lord lord monson <e> <s> i should like to congratulate my noble friend lord nugent on the skill the charm and the courtesy with which as all of us who know him would expect he has moved this measure through your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that answer although it does not carry the matter much further <e> <s> is it the intention of her majestys government that the applications from daiwa and nomura should be left pending unless and until additional seats are provided on the tokyo stock exchange for british finance houses <e> <s> if so are we sure that the exclusion of such major japanese players for an indeterminate length of time is compatible with our ambition to turn london into one of the three world pivotal financial markets <e> <s>

treasury our insistence on reciprocity access as regards our london financial market while at the same time apparently objecting implacably to any suggestion of european community rules on reciprocity of access to financial markets and also saying that we believe in the development of a single european market <e>", "<cs> my lords as one who used on various occasions to explain in another place that vat was a broadly-based tax does my noble friend agree that the real problem with our vat system is that it is not broadly-based enough and that it is riddled with far too many exemptions and zero

entrepreneurs in the province will he assure us that if we were to come to terms with the disposal of those yards to mr ravi tikkoo it would be on the basis that on this occasion there would be no
