awaiting the report of the royal commission on gambling and i gather from what the noble lord has <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord the minister what was the over-riding factor which caused his right honourable friend to keep the hospital open bearing in mind that this matter had already been gone into very carefully and two former secretaries of state the regional health authority and the area health authority decided that it should be closed in view of the fact that there are already far too many beds in that area <e> <s> now the hospital is to be maintained at a cost of million initial outlay with a yearly expenditure of million in an area where there is a shortage of money and i question whether this is the right thing to do <e>", "<cs> my lordswill the minister be good enough to ask his right honourable friend the secretary of state to ensure that in future the maintenance costs of the hospital which i understand will be about million will be found over and above what is allowed and allocated for the area as a whole <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot resist saying to the noble lord lord hankey that if the speakers who preceded him had taken as long

ago <e> <s> it was commissioned from professor brenner by a congressional committee chaired by the late hubert humphrey <e> <s> professor brenner looked at a per cent <e> <s> rise in american

evans said there are in liverpool unskilled unemployed persons for every one unskilled job that may be vacant whereas in the rest of the country i am still talking about unskilled jobs there are only people for every one unskilled vacancy <e>", "<cs> my lords we were aware of the problem to such an extent that we spent millions and millions of pounds on job creation schemes and on bolstering up as

understood the noble lord in his reply to me he said that it is up to the police complaints board to decide if it thinks fit to make a special report on these matters <e> <s> that rather suggests that

the noble lord the minister to accept the fact that i am satisfied that he acknowledges that this sort of thing does go on <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister said that million would have been the figure to be received by the government <e> <s> would he agree that it <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not my intention to take issue with my noble friend lord annan because i am not unmindful of the

commission reports and when the flowers working party set up by my noble friend lord annan also reports <e> <s> it may be that the noble lord felt that he ought to get in the first stone <e> <s> perhaps i ought to qualify my statement that i do <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether it is not a fact that as a result of the cut-backs in local authority services which will be brought about by the budget there is going to be serious unemployment caused in local government building resulting in increased unemployment generally <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think this is the first time that i have been down this particular road but the tradition of your lordships house makes me declare an interest in what we have been discussing this afternoon because if i live until rd

grateful to him for drawing our attention to this crucial matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with very considerable interest to what the noble earl lord kinnoull has said with regard to this bill which he is introducing because i want to say at the very outset that i hope the house will be able to persuade him to withdraw it <e> <s> i think there are very grave reservations as to whether people should be allowed to act as hypnotists at public-gatherings <e> <s> this is precisely what the act permits them to do and if i may say so i think the present bill does little more if anything than extend to clubs the provisions of the hypnotism act and increase the maximum fine for those found guilty of an offence from to <e> <s> i would suggest unless the noble earl can advise me that i am wrong that his present bill does little apart from adding those two things to the act <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl <e> <s> as i understand it the act controls demonstrations of hypnotism at places licensed for public entertainment <e> <s> where the local authority has the power to grant <e>", "<cs> my lords what i am getting at is that the onus is entirely on them they can do so if they wish <e> <s> while a local authority may decide that they will not allow a hypnotist to perform under certain circumstances and certain conditions all over the country hypnotists do in fact give exhibitions <e> <s> the noble earl is going to include clubs but from the fact that clubs are to be included it does not necessarily follow that hypnotists will be prevented from giving performances <e> <s> it only means that the hypnotist whoever he is must get authority from the local authority to put on his performance <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i wonder whether we can crystallise this <e> <s> is he saying that the government are of the opinion that the problem is not so serious as to require additional legislation <e> <s> because if so then i think we support the noble earl <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble lord the minister for repeating this statement <e> <s> if i begin by making a complaint i think the noble lord knows me well enough to know that it is not directed at him <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the minister for his statement relating to the three orders now before your lordships house <e> <s> i am not unmindful of the fact that this house has several more hours work before it nor do i forget that i have already made two comments about these very matters on previous occasions since the coming into office of the new government and so i do not propose to go over that ground today nor to ask the minister any questions <e> <s> however i am sure that he would be the first to recognise that i too would wish to take the opportunity to register our concern at certain features of the matters that he has mentioned <e> <s> obviously we welcome the up-rating but as i have said previously we are very disturbed that these and future increases are to be tied to prices not wages <e> <s> i know the governments arguments on these matters but i have in mind the effect of rising prices and the serious increase in inflation which many of us believe will take effect as soon as november of this year let alone in the succeeding months <e> <s> the noble lord mentioned an increase of inflation to per cent <e> <s> by november <e> <s> i hope that it is no more than that but we are fearful that it may well be and we feel that the government ought to have been a little more mindful than they seem to have been of that eventuality <e>", "<cs> my lords if there is any question at all of the building being disposed of by which i mean sold may i ask the noble lord to ask his right honourable friend to secure some of the money for the national health service <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for what has been a very clear and helpful description and if i may say so analysis of the events leading up to this order <e> <s> it is a wholly good measure and if there is any criticism at all it is one which we all bear that perhaps it ought to have reached this stage some years ago <e> <s> that has nothing to do with the government <e> <s> as i understand it and the minister has made this perfectly clear this particular scheme covers not only pneumoconiosis and byssinosis but six other slowly developing diseases all of which as i understand it are various forms of cancer <e>", "<cs> my lords once again we are grateful to the minister for setting out the provisions of the order so clearly <e> <s> it is a remarkable order in the sense that i found no difficulty understanding it a surprising thing for me <e> <s> it is an <e>", "<cs> my lords there is not much i want to say beyond thanking the noble lord the minister for giving such a detailed and fairly simple explanation of the position <e> <s> i do not find myself very much at variance with it because the principle involved is very much in keeping with the thinking of the last government and although the figures may differ a little what is proposed runs parallel with what we had in mind <e> <s> therefore i approve of the order and give it support <e>", "<cs> may i ask the minister whether i understood my noble friend lord longford to say that all the members of the tribunal were to be legally qualified <e> <s> if so that is a most unusual course <e> <s> normally in matters of this kind the chairman of the tribunal is legally qualified <e> <s> does the minister himself believe that all members of the tribunal should be legally qualified <e>", "<cs> if i may say so this is still a most unusual course to take <e> <s> bearing in mind what the noble lord has said i should have thought it was essential that the chairman should be legally qualified that he should be a qualified lawyer <e> <s> but in assessing these matters other considerations must be taken into account which do not require a legal point of view <e> <s> i should have thought that we would be creating a very bad precedent <e> <s> in a matter of compensation for injury there ought to be at least one lay person on the tribunal <e> <s> i am quite surprised that we should be considering a tribunal all the members of <e>", "<cs> i rather understood my noble friend to say that he was probably prepared to take back amendments nos <e> <s> and to look at <e> <s> i do not know whether it is his intention to do so but if he did and came back with a tribunal consisting of a chairman who was legally qualified and the other two who were not would the noble lord the minister then resist these amendments <e>", "<cs> although i have no axe to grind in this matter knowing how many tribunals there are in the country and the fact that few of the applicants have the right to legal aid i think the minister is right to say that this is likely to be a real stumbling block <e> <s> if this particular door were opened i think there must be because there already have been over the past few years many claims from people who have to refer certain matters to a tribunal where no provision is made for legal representation <e> <s> if legal aid were given in this particular case i believe it would result in a flood of applications coming which for various reasons could not be met <e> <s> i am wondering whether my noble friend feels this is a crucial matter at this time <e> <s> if he feels it is not absolutely crucial then in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to thank the noble lord the minister for putting the position so succinctly and so clearly <e> <s> obviously we on this side of the house welcome the additional p as a premium to lone parents but i think the noble lord will understand me when i say that it is really inadequate when one recognises what will be the inflation rate which i think is accepted by all people at the present moment and not least by his own government <e> <s> the p will be absorbed almost immediately it comes into effect as a result of the increase in the cost of living and when the noble lord says that they want to do a great deal for children and it is only a question of money that prevents it i would ask him not that i want a reply to this whether there can be <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord allow me to say that i believe that when this matter was before another place it was said that there was likely to be per cent <e> <s> inflation in the next months <e> <s> i can find no record of that being denied <e>", "<cs> my lords once again we are grateful to the noble lord for his explanation <e> <s> i am fairly familiar with this kind of situation <e> <s> however in the noble lords opening remarks he used the phrase <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that it is the view of the house that as we have had a debate lasting a good many hours it should not be prolonged much longer <e> <s> it is perfectly true that both sides have said all that they wanted to say but i shall ask the indulgence of noble lords for three or four minutes in order to make one or two comments on what the noble baroness lady young said in her summing up <e> <s> before doing so may i say that the noble baroness lady faithfull was in a very difficult position in having to support policies which she must know from her experience will have a devastating effect upon the family <e> <s> however she probably will not admit to this <e> <s> what surprised me about her contribution was the fact that i seem to remember not so very long ago she joined my noble friend lord parry in demanding from the labour government that more money and attention should be given to the care of the mentally and physically handicapped <e> <s> if i have understood her correctly now she is agreeing to those people being deprived <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble baroness has changed her mind because there has been a change of government <e> <s> in my view the whole basis of her argument resulted in a recommendation that family adversity is a virtue <e> <s> however it certainly is not a virtue for a family that is living in poverty <e> <s> it is no good saying that there must be changes that people must accept them and put up with them <e> <s> if you are living in poverty a few coppers makes all the difference <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord the minister whether the government will resign in order to get rid of the greatest restrictive practice <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble earl will allow me to interrupt him <e> <s> we on this side of the house quite frankly cannot hear him <e> <s> would it be possible for him to stand nearer a microphone <e> <s> i would not interrupt him but for the fact that we want to hear what he says <e>", "<cs> my lords there are a large number of social problems and we might use the word evil so far as some of them are concerned which do not attract a very wide audience or for that matter generate very much concern <e> <s> they are often sunk without trace <e> <s> this problem of alcoholism is one of them <e> <s> that is why the noble earl lord kimberley is to be congratulated on reminding us again of what is in fact taking place <e> <s> to understand the problem fully we need to know a great deal more about what is below and beneath the surface <e> <s> statistics by themselves do not give us much of an idea <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether he would ask his right honourable friend to have a look at the present range of frames which many of us feel could be considerably improved at really no extra cost <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether he will clarify one point <e> <s> is he in fact saying that the government will support the arab boycott of israel if it is in the financial interest of this country to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble lord lord cullen for moving these regulations and the order and particularly for being so brief and clear at this hour <e> <s> i do not imagine that there will be any problem over your lordships approving these regulations but because of the hour i am sorry that the noble lord lord banks and i did not meet beforehand to arrange some kind of division of labour <e> <s> i am proposing to deal with only one of them and i have a feeling that he will deal with the rest <e>", "<cs> my lords by the time we come to the end of this debate i have no doubt that many of your lordships will be glad that we had two maiden speeches this afternoon because at least they are required by the custom of the house not to speak too long and to be non-controversial <e> <s> i am sure i can say with the approval of the house how delighted we all are to have two maiden speakers in the noble earl lord erne and the noble baroness lady ryder of warsaw and how much we look forward to hearing them <e>", "<cs> it is not nonsense my lords because i happen <e>", "<cs> my lords if noble lords in the chamber say my doctor is sitting behind me there is nothing confidential about it <e> <s> in the five years when i was a minister in the labour government i was subjected by noble lords opposite to a good deal of criticism about the nhs and all i wish to say about the achievements of the last government is that capital spending did not suffer in any one year under us under labour the nhs did well out of the total public expenditure <e> <s> we managed to increase its share each year and in those five years there was a tremendous increase in medical staff

budgets before st march <e> <s> cuts of that magnitude cannot be imposed without affecting patient care and in a matter of a few minutes i shall enumerate the way in which this is being done <e> <s>

that there are only about half a dozen peers on the other side of the house who use private practice <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i say this the fact that i remained silent when he referred to what i had said with regard to the private sector must not be understood by him that i am in complete agreement <e> <s> it is merely that because of the hour i am exercising very great control <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the length of time that this unstarred question has taken i am sure it will be of interest and pleasure to your lordships to know that as i have to catch a particular train i shall not be speaking in this debate <e> <s> there are however just one or two comments that i want to make <e> <s> first i should like to congratulate the noble earl lord yarborough on his maiden speech and of course i hope that he will not wait the same number of years before he delivers his second speech <e> <s> speaking for myself it was rather a joy to hear my noble friend lord lovell-davis again and the noble lord lord colwyn and i hope that we shall hear them more often than we have heard them recently <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord the minister in relation to the first reply that he gave to the noble baroness whether an added responsibility is to be put on local authorities to see that there is a reduction in the number of child

money be made available for local authorities to do this <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord ferrier for introducing this question for i find it a pleasant relief not to be engaged in a matter involving political beliefs <e> <s> this is the first occasion for some considerable time that i have been at the dispatch box when i have not got to worry about political

were really suitable <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that your lordships will be as grateful as i am to the noble lord the minister for placing the order before us and explaining it <e> <s> i do not want in any way to argue about the amounts of increase <e> <s> i recognise that with increased benefits and so on it is necessary from time to time to increase contributions all the way round <e> <s>

approve the order <e>", "<cs> my lords again we on this side of the house are grateful to the noble earl for explaining albeit in some detail the purpose of this order <e> <s> i noted that the noble earl referred to the comments of the joint committee on statutory instruments in their twelfth report <e> <s> however i am not quite clear whether what the government are doing is to the advantage or disadvantage of those who have some entitlement to an award <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister is it not a fact that this is a matter which really ought to

intention of the house that an unstarred question should have so many speakers <e> <s> i really do feel that we need to look at some of our procedures <e> <s> i ask the minister whether he feels this could be done by the appropriate committee of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not think it would be very much better for the government to do this <e> <s> the minister has some idea as is shown by the answers he has given of the feeling of the house <e> <s> only a few years ago ten years ago an unstarred question was not limited as such but there were seldom more than six or

be an increased heating payment to take into account the second rise in and the new increases and whether the government will introduce a discount scheme that is applicable to all who are receiving supplementary benefit and pensions as well as rate and rent rebates and rent allowances <e> <s> we on this side of the house cannot and will not sit back quietly while the government continue to make a frightening and devastating attack on the less fortunate members of our society <e>", "<cs> governments have a responsibility to provide for those in need particularly the aged and the sooner this government wake up to the fact that there are enormous numbers of people who will be seriously affected by these colossal increases in gas and electricity prices and they do something about it the better it will be not only for this countrys name but for the people concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i will not keep your lordships for any length of time other than to say that we on this side feel that the public interest requires that persons should be able to get an efficient and competent service without being fleeced <e> <s> most of us are aware that there is widespread concern among people at the cost of spectacles these days <e> <s> i understand that it is difficult to get spectacles if they are outside the national health service range for under about <e> <s> i can remember that when

matter <e> <s> all i want to do is to remind your lordships that we are not seeking to reject the amendment on its merits but merely providing the commons with an opportunity to consider an unusual turn of events and in that way we support the motion and the government <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down will he allow me to make the following observation <e> <s> if he were to look at the tape in the hallway this afternoon he would see that it says that the retail price index has increased by per cent <e> <s> over the last months compared with a figure of per cent <e> <s> when the present government took over <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask whether the point of this particular case that we are talking about as i understand the question relates to a self-employed person

undertaken more expeditiously than it is at present <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to disagree with the noble lord for whose help i have been very grateful in the past <e> <s> however is it not a well-known fact that social workers know from personal experience when they are dealing with these people and helping them in their straitened circumstances that many of them indeed i would say the

minister whether he will take steps to see that when a person qualifies for a retirement pension that person will be told that a card establishing that he or she is a pensioner will be available <e>

distant future <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister this question is he saying in his reply to my noble friend that no voluntary organisation has yet suffered a cut in the grant that it has been receiving hitherto from any government department <e> <s> furthermore may i ask the noble lord whether he is aware that in view of the cuts greater responsibility particularly at the local level

serious matter <e> <s> the house should know whether this decision was taken at departmental level or whether it was taken in consultation with the law officers of the crown <e> <s> i ask the minister

year who will not now receive that <e> <s> am right in thinking that that is so <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the minister whether if the government are minded to give consideration to the

think that there is abundant medical evidence to show that it is responsible for many conditions of ill health and obesity <e> <s> at present we are suffering from a very serious problem of dental

speech and plays a full part in the work of this house <e> <s> we on this side i am sure will spend more time disagreeing with her than agreeing with her but that is the purpose of the whole thing

intervention <e> <s> whenever i speak the noble baroness finds some reason to try to intervene <e> <s> i would say to the noble countess lady loudoun that if the government when they came <e>", "<cs>

one of the founders of the national marriage guidance council in this country <e> <s> it is true to say that a good deal of the work done in schools in this field today is done under the aegis of the

know the mind of the noble earl and the noble viscount on this matter <e> <s> we met when i was a minister in the department and discussed various matters and there was a great deal of common ground between us <e> <s> however i am wondering whether the amendment will really deal with the situation <e> <s> it says <e>", "<cs> with your lordships permission i should like to correct one thing which the noble lord lord robbins saidi think he may have misunderstood me <e> <s> i was not suggesting that this matter be deferred or delayed until there had been an agreed syllabus <e> <s> this is going to take too long <e> <s> what i did suggest was that perhaps between now and report stage it might be possible to get from the noble baroness the minister some idea of whether the department would be prepared to consider setting up a committee that would deal with the matter quickly with a view to getting a form of agreed syllabus <e> <s> if the noble baroness says it cannot be done then my noble friends could put this amendment down at report stage <e>", "<cs> my lords it was not my intention to invervene in this second reading debate this afternoon because before your lordships considered the bill my noble and learned friend lord elwyn-jones and myself found ourselves in complete agreement with the noble and learned lord on the woolsack who said that this house was different in a number of ways from another place and that we would not want to follow the other place in having a detailed discussion of a large number of matters which to some of us perhaps did not come within the terms of this bill <e> <s> however i must confess that the way in which the noble lord lord wigoder introduced what he wished to say tempted me almost by his reference to the situation of the last government to say something about the events leading up to this situation <e> <s> however i shall resist that temptation because i do not think it would serve any useful purpose at all <e>", "<cs> my lords this is really a rehearsal of one scene from a many-act play which will take place in the not too distant future when the national health service bill comes before your lordships house at which time we shall have to deal with the matters before us this afternoon and the many matters which will be covered in that bill <e> <s> i think the best thing i can do is to try to answer some of the points that have been raised today as they affect the opposition <e> <s> because the noble lord lord hunt of fawley drew attention to a divide between the party opposite and my noble friends <e> <s> it would be idle for me to pretend that there is not a divide <e> <s> in fact there is a very great divide <e>", "<cs> my lords there seems to have crept into your lordships discussion tonight a certain degree of hilarity if i may say so <e> <s> i think we have got to face the fact that we are dealing with a very serious matter <e> <s> my noble friend lord houghton takes the view that we are tending to pontificate <e> <s> i think he is one who has often been guilty of that in your lordships house as we all have at some stage or other <e> <s> but this is part of the houses of parliament <e> <s> it is for us when we are considering a bill like this education bill to assume responsibility for the education of our young people <e> <s> are we going to say that education stops at a particular point and does not include other matters which will lead to a full and satisfactory life after one has left school <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not dealing with the wording of the amendment <e> <s> i am dealing with the general principle behind it <e> <s> i have said clearly that there are reservations in my mind <e> <s> but what i am concerned about if we reject this amendment or if the noble lords who have put it before the house decide to withdraw it is what is going to be put in its place because i believe that society has a duty and a responsibility to meet this need in the schools <e> <s> if parents do not do it one cannot say that the churches will do it because let us face it <e> <s> the churches have no control over or influence upon the vast majority of young people in this country and the right reverend prelates would be the first to agree <e>", "<cs> my lords it is with some diffidence that i enter the debate on this particular clause bearing in mind that there are still amendments before your lordships <e> <s> whether we shall get through by oclock tonight which i believe is the intention of the government supported if i may say so by the opposition remains to be seen <e> <s> so perhaps i had better be brief but i wanted to get that remark in because i think it is important that we should bear in mind the fact that we have another amendments before us <e>", "<cs> my lords with your lordships indulgence perhaps i might ask the acting leader of the house whether he can give any indication as to what we are going to do tonight <e> <s> as i understand it there are something like amendments remaining on the marshalled list <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding was that we would finish it but it was assumed that we would finish at somewhere around about oclock <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we must be reasonable about this <e> <s> there was only one division which was not proceeded with <e> <s> do not let us exaggerate let us keep to the truth <e> <s> this is a very important bill both from the governments point of view and from the oppositions point of view <e> <s> we made it abundantly clear at the very beginning that this was a bill which we would be contesting <e> <s> if the government have not allowed sufficient time so that we can do this in a reasonable period the opposition can hardly be blamed <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord the minister this i do not want to ask an embarrassing question and i shall understand if the noble lord feels that he cannot answer it is the delay in any way due to difficulties existing because of differences between the viewpoints of the various bodies concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness was perfectly right when she said that the bill is not only comprehensive but also complicated <e> <s> it is indeed a most complicated bill and to some extent it has been further complicated by the appearance within the past few days of the social security no <e> <s> bill which if i understand it correctly to some extent negates some of the effects of the present bill <e> <s> however we shall be dealing with this further bill in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i should like to ask him one question to which i do not require an answer this afternoon <e> <s> is he aware that when his noble friend referred to the fact that maternity benefit will in future be a non-contributory benefit no mention was made as regards age <e> <s> the word used was mother every year there are many girls of years of age who become mothers <e> <s> girls become mothers at the age of and upwards <e> <s> is the house to understand that it will be payable to them or will there be a starting age as it were which corresponds for example with marriage at the age of <e> <s> i think that this is an important matter and that the house will regard it as being very important indeed <e> <s> if no decision has been made i hope that before a decision is made the view of the house will be taken <e>", "<cs> my lords we on this side of the house are grateful to the noble lord lord byers for giving not only ourselves but the whole house an opportunity to remind the government of the consequences of the acts that they have undertaken recently in their proposals <e> <s> i do not presume for one moment and i never have to be able to speak for the man in the street any more than i can speak for the vast majority of people <e> <s> i only know what those around me and those whom i meet think at the present moment <e> <s> i sometimes wonder whether the government realise the deep feeling that is being generated against them among quite large sections of the community including the daily newspapers as to the outcome of their policies <e> <s> it was brought home to me most vividly last night while i was seeking to keep out of the heavy downpour of rain at one of <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to enter into a debate with the noble viscount <e>

closed <e> <s> there will come a time in the not i too distant future when there will not be <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble viscount give way for one moment <e> <s> i had better declare that i am a member of astms whom the noble viscount described as mr clive jenkinss union <e> <s> it is not <e> <s> it is astms <e> <s> he <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble baroness the minister for the arrangement of the clauses and schedules <e> <s> it is of great help to those who are taking part in the committee stage and of course is of help to the house generally <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble baroness because otherwise it would have meant my speaking for an almost interminable time on the first four amendments and that would not be good for me nor i am sure for your lordships <e>", "<cs> i realise that the noble baroness lady young did not use the expression wrecking amendment in an emotive way but this is a sincere attempt on our part to try to persuade the government to maintain the formula as it has been in recent years <e> <s> i do not think the minister will deny that if the last government had pursued the policy which this government are bent on pursuing the pensions of old people when the present government took over would have been something like a week less <e> <s> it was only because the previous government decided to increase pensions according to prices or earnings whichever was the higher that over the period of office of the last government pensioners received about a week more than they would have done if it had been confined to prices <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord lord drurnalbyn if he is saying that if the amount of the retirement pension is decided by either prices or earnings whichever is the greater the pensioner is no better off than if the pension is decided according just to prices <e>", "<cs> i am asking whether he would say so <e> <s> i understood him to say it does not matter what the yardstick is and that the pension is protected <e> <s> we are saying it is protected at a lower level than it would be if the present <e>", "<cs> i did not assume anything of the sort <e> <s> retirement pensions were in fact more than they would have been had there been only one point at which the calculation was made <e> <s> however i do not want to go over all that ground again <e> <s> i want to congratulate the noble baroness upon her honesty because if i understood correctly what she implied a few minutes ago was that it is not so much the position of the pensioners which is the first consideration but rather the fact that the government cannot afford to do what is suggested because they must save money <e> <s> i might be inclined to accept that <e>", "<cs> i very much dislike joining issue with the noble lord lord drumalbyn because when i was a junior minister i was on more than one occasion very grateful to him for coming to my rescue with his vast knowledge of this field but let us get the position quite clear <e> <s> what the noble lord has said quite correctly is that the present government have decided on a point at which they are going to raise pensions <e> <s> he then said again quite rightly that they are giving an undertaking that if the position is such that they can improve upon that they will do so but this must be a judgment and i do not altogether trust judgments of governments whoever those governments may be <e>", "<cs> may i ask the minister what is there to prevent it being up-rated on st of the month other than the fact that it will save something like million <e> <s> if it can be done and still not upset the normal procedures why <e>", "<cs> may i just say in the nicest possible way that i want to warn the noble baroness the minister that if she is really tempted during the discussions we are going to have for several hours to come to raise a number of sins of omission or commission on the part of labour governments we might be strongly tempted to remind her that this country would not be in the mess that it is now had it not given million by way of reduced taxation to people who did not need it <e> <s> i only mention that but i will trot out a few more if i am forced to do so <e> <s> but let us say that as regards sins of commission and omission perhaps we could agree that we are fairly equal now <e> <s> may i ask the noble baroness whether she would feel able to take this back and discuss it with her right honourable friends <e> <s> i realise that it is not her department but on the other hand i feel sure they will listen to her <e> <s> it may well be that she will come back at report stage and say nothing doing but this is a sticking point with us <e> <s> it may seem very little only a matter of three days but as my noble friend lord ross has said it means depriving a number of people of a few pounds and they can ill afford to be deprived of that amount <e> <s> i wonder whether she could meet us in that way i ask for no commitment <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble baroness whether it would be right for us on this side to assume that the government have already made up their mind that they are not going to <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask the noble baroness the minister a question <e> <s> if it is the intention of this government regardless of the circumstances to abolish the earnings rule during the lifetime of this government which can be as i understand it right up to and if that is a serious pledge on their part then why cannot the noble baroness the minister come back at report stage with an amendment of this kind properly worded which would meet all drafting regulations and include the date as <e> <s> it will then be on the statute book and the government would then have fulfilled a promise <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble baroness is in some difficulty which i believe we all recognise <e> <s> i do not want to act as either doctor or nurse but i wonder whether i could make a suggestion <e> <s> i put this forward very seriously and i do not know what my noble friend lord banks would feel about it <e> <s> this might be an occasion when the noble baroness could say that these two amendments one in the name of my noble friend lord banks and one in the name of my colleagues and myself are technically deficient she could undertake to look at the matter and and i say this with great respect take some advice from her right honourable friend the prime minister <e> <s> after all if we are to have a big sister in we were threatened by orwell with a big brother it might well be that at the report stage she could give some sort of definite undertaking which might be of assistance to everybody <e>", "<cs> all i want to say is that in the amendment before us there is a very marked degree of realism indeed much more realism than there is in the two amendments which we on these benches have put down in relation to this matter <e> <s> it is because there is such a marked degree of realism involving a little more than million that i would support the noble lords amendment in preference to our own amendments <e> <s> what we are asking for in our two amendments may well be the impossible so far as matters are concerned today <e> <s> what the noble lord is asking for is i believe the possible <e>", "<cs> i am glad to get the observations from the noble baroness the minister with regard to the governments attitude to this matter <e> <s> i accept what she has said <e> <s> i admitted at the beginning of what i said that this is really a matter for the

<e> <s> i should like to consider the implications of what she has said <e> <s> i should like to look at that very carefully <e> <s> meanwhile i beg leave to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> i am proposing to do so but i do so with very great reluctance because i feel strongly about this <e> <s> if there were something i could get <e>", "<cs> i am sure that we are all grateful to the noble baroness for going into this matter in so much detail <e> <s> i am aware as are my friends behind me of the concern which was expressed in another place when this matter came before them <e> <s> as far as i can tell although i would want to read very carefully in <e>", "<cs> i am much obliged to the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> i have listened with considerable interest to what the noble baroness the minister has said and i do not believe that the whole matter can be clouded by a series of statistics about what we are doing here there and somewhere else and about it costing this and that <e>

in a position to answer a question which is not important now because my mind is quite unchanged in regard to what should be done <e> <s> i am concerned that nothing has been said so far this is not a criticism as to what rights people in authority members of your lordships house members of the house of commons and others have got if they want to take up a complaint on behalf of for example a constituent <e> <s> with the supplementary benefits commission today they can do so in no uncertain manner but as far as i can see this will be a body so protected that one will not be able to

said <e> <s> he will understand me without being misunderstood if i say that by merely listening to him i have not been able to absorb it in the way i should like to do <e> <s> i should like to read through what he has said tomorrow <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether the government are aware that there is an increasing problem of alcoholism in the country at present and that a good deal of remedial work is being done by a number of outstanding voluntary organisations in the field of treatment <e> <s> as it is expected that a substantial sum of money will be put aside for both research and treatment are the government also aware that it is urgent that this fund should be wound up so that money may be released on a generous scale to help both projects <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether it is not a fact that i answered more than once on this particular matter and does that not indicate that really the time has come when a final decision should be made <e>", "<cs> on the face of it the reply by the noble lord on behalf of the government seems to be perfectly reasonable <e> <s> the noble lord has said that these cases will be in the regulations and that we can debate the regulations <e> <s> as i understand the situation if the committee takes exception to any part of those regulations i may be wrong about this and if i am i hope that someone will put me right then we have to decline to accept the regulations as a whole we cannot alter them <e> <s> this seems to me to be putting the cart before the horse <e>", "<cs> may i beg the noble lord and the noble baroness the minister to take the advice of two distinguished members of their side who have held distinguished office in this particular field <e> <s> together they are unbeatable when it comes to knowledge <e> <s> i should be happy not to press this amendment to a division if the government felt they could undertake this <e>", "<cs> i am grateful <e> <s> i have found it difficult to absorb hours i think of talking in another place in committee stage which took something like or days and it is quite clear that i did not pick up that particular example <e>",

<e>", "<cs> i do not feel disposed to do any such thing if i may say so very kindly because i do not think that the government and it may well be my fault have appreciated what the amendment seeks to do <e> <s> it refers to paragraph on page of the bill of schedule <e> <s> it seeks to amend paragraph in line <e> <s> it may well be that the government have not connected the two but i should have thought that the amendment was very very clear <e> <s> i gather that the intention of the amendment has not been appreciated and obviously the government must be satisfied that the amendment which i

unable to implement this particular section <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble baroness the minister what will be the position in <e> <s> in november of this year pensions are going up by per cent <e> <s> and for the greater part of this year alone inflation will be in the region of per cent <e> <s> it is in that area now in may <e> <s> that means that from november to november pensioners will lose a considerable sum of money and their standard of living must of necessity be depressed <e> <s> if we had a labour government today i am sure that they would be reminded in november of this year of the fact that pensioners had been existing on a pension which was considerably lower than the rate of inflation and if the increase was only per cent <e> <s> that labour government would be told in very precise terms that it was not sufficient to meet the financial needs of a large number of people who had already had their standard of living depressed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble baroness for her comments and observations but may i remind her that in her remarks a moment or two ago she said that a pension must be increased during the month in which it was

in that case if i were to advise my noble friend and i am not so sure that she will take the advice not to press this amendment at this stage there is always third reading will the noble lord undertake to let her have a reply not only to the question asked by the noble baroness lady seear but to the questions which my noble friend has put <e> <s> she asked two of them <e>", "<cs> my lords i am fast coming to the conclusion that there is not enough dynamite in this country to move noble lords on the government front bench and that one really is fighting a losing battle <e> <s> in the circumstances i have little alternative but to ask the leave of the house to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords there is something radically wrong with the thinking of the government <e> <s>

what the conservative party did for pensioners between and <e> <s> i remind the house what this government did less than a year ago when they came to office <e> <s> they gave times that amount of

i am grateful to the noble baroness for proposing what i was about to propose <e> <s> on the next amendment no <e> <s> i regret <e>", "<cs> my lords there is very little left for me to do seeing that the government have set their face against accepting a single amendment from either these benches or the benches of my noble friends on the liberal side <e> <s> the government have erected the thickest and highest and widest wall that i have ever encountered since i have been a member of your lordships house one can get neither over it nor under it nor round it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am

familiar with the renton report <e> <s> obviously it is unwise to write too much into a bill <e> <s> however i have been in your lordships house a good many years and i have been in the political field a good many years <e> <s> i know from experience as most noble lords in your lordships house know only too well the gaps that are found in almost every peice of legislation <e> <s> i can remember amendment bills being put before parliament one after another to fill up those gaps <e> <s> i am not convinced that sufficient time and thought has been given to the function of the advisory committee <e> <s> it is very easy to say that this is a new bill and that they have this and that to do and that they will not have time to do all this <e> <s> it may be that i have missed it but i never remember anyone saying how often the advisory committee will meet whether it will he a full-time occupation or a part-time occupation and if so i do not recall anyone defining what the part-time will be <e>", "<cs> my lords almost exactly three and a half years ago <e>", "<cs> my lords if we ever needed evidence that these short debates which we have from time to time in your lordships house are justified i think the short debate we are engaged upon this afternoon more than justifies them and i am grateful to my noble friend lady fisher for introducing this debate <e> <s> i think the fact that it has to be kept within a defined period makes each of us think very carefully about what we are going to say we say the important things and we cut out shall i say <e> <s> the supporting material <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that it would be wrong for me to hazard a guess because i have not thought in terms of capital expenditure that of course as my noble friend knows takes the money <e> <s> but if there were a few hundred more places i think that they could be provided with a comparitively small sum but i would hesitate to specify it <e> <s> if my noble friend presses me and asks what i mean by a comparatively small sum i should have thought that if something in the region of perhaps was made available almost immediately it would be helpful to start by providing alternatives so that parents who are looking after children in this condition could at least get some relief <e>", "<cs> my lords some minutes or so ago it was my intention not to speak at any great length in this debate <e> <s> one appreciates the fact that at second reading one can merely set out ones views <e> <s> if one wants to deal in detail with the bill and its various clauses one can do that only at the committee stage and so this afternoon it is not my intention to go very deeply into each of the clauses nor to say in detail what we on this side of the house feel about them <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i ask him to answer a question <e> <s> given that the government were elected to save money does he really believe that if it was included in the tory party manifesto that that would be done to some extent by cutting down certain social security benefits the conservative party would have been elected <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether it is a reasonable requirement and whether the government ought not to do something about it <e> <s> i suspect that it is many decades ago that those regulations were adopted by british rail and i think one must bear in mind and it should be pointed out to them that return rail fares can now amount to or or even more <e> <s> we are not dealing with just a few pence these days we are dealing with many pounds <e> <s> provided the return ticket can be sent to them unclipped i should have thought that that was as much evidence as they were entitled to ask for <e>", "<cs> that is a most unusual argument to say the least of it <e> <s> it is an understood thing in this country originally laid down in the act that certain benefits went up annually in line with prices and others went up in line with earnings <e> <s> one of the things this government have done has been to cut out increasing benefits in line with earnings and they have decided to increase them by prices <e> <s> to answer the noble baroness the government estimated after the budget that come november of this year the inflation rate would go up by per cent <e> <s> so that people in receipt of benefits would require an increase of per cent <e> <s> in order to break even <e> <s> many of us know that at the present moment inflation is running at per cent <e> <s> and no member of the government is prepared to say that it will fall to per cent <e> <s> this coming november <e> <s> pensions and other benefits are going to be increased only by per cent <e> <s> and certain benefits are going to be increased by only per cent <e> <s> if that is not reduction then nothing is reduction <e> <s> the government are reducing the value of those benefits by per cent <e> <s> i am glad the noble baroness intervened because we must clear these things up and i take no exception to that at all <e>", "<cs> it is an absolute disgrace <e>", "<cs> i feel very distressed as a result of the debate that we have had this afternoon and particularly distressed by the contributions made by the noble lord lord nugent of guildford and the noble lord lord drumalbyn both of whom i claim i think rightly to know very well indeed <e> <s> i have always enjoyed a good relationship with them and we shall go on enjoying the same relationship i hope but i think they both missed the point <e>", "<cs> if i remember aright it was defined by a number of bodies <e> <s> one was the supplementary benefits commission <e> <s> professor donnison said something about it recently <e> <s> the child poverty action group did a considerable amount of research into the matter and published a document on this matter only a few months ago <e> <s> there are several including professor townsend of exeter university <e>", "<cs> could we have this in good sound common english <e> <s> instead of talking about abatement of up-rate let us talk about stealing per cent <e> <s> from people <e>", "<cs> i do not want to keep the committee for any length of time <e> <s> my noble friend lord banks has put the position very clearly and succinctly and i do not think i can improve upon it in any way other than to say that all he has asked for and all we are asking for is fairness and justice in this matter <e>", "<cs> i have said before that i do not think there is anything between us and the government on the question of taxation of benefits <e> <s> many of us have held that view for some considerable time <e> <s> but i think it raises a very real moral question if not a legal question as to whether a government have the right to cut benefits which under the act should be increased year by year according to the level of prices <e> <s> this is what will happen this coming november with the exception of certain benefits <e> <s> i have pointed out to your lordships that we are dealing with insurance benefits benefits that people have paid for as a result of their national weekly insurance contributions <e> <s> if the government cannot see their way clear to tax benefits for another two years then in my submission they ought not to impose cuts of the nature and in the areas in which they are doing it <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble baroness would allow me to set an example of flexibility and say that having listened to what she has had to say i acknowledge that she has raised one matter of which i had not thought <e> <s> therefore i should like to read what she has said in <e>", "<cs> i should like to consider what the noble baroness the minister has said <e> <s> although she has made only a brief statement it seemed to be to the point and i should like to read <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether we could come to some agreement that all that the government are doing by the bill is trying to save money by hook or by crook or by fair means or foul <e> <s> i am getting a little tired because every reply that has been given so far has been well of course we are going to save that and we are going to

qualify for benefit <e>", "<cs> i have been opposite the noble baroness the minister many many times <e> <s> i have heard her say time and time again it is possible but not likely <e> <s> she cannot hope always to give that reply and get away with it <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> i confess that some of what the noble lord said i hope he will not misunderstand this did not readily make sense i still find myself confused as to the difference between the eight weeks and weeks and i cannot see any justification for it <e> <s> however i should like an opportunity to read in the <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord the minister for giving such a full explanation <e> <s> as was the case <e>", "<cs> i do not think the committee should take this rather lightly <e> <s> i do not think the government realise how deep is our concern that they should ever have considered introducing a bill of this kind <e> <s> we consider it one of the worst bills and clause goes a long way to illustrate our reasons for concern and discontent <e> <s> we accept that in parliament there will be various views <e> <s> we expect the government to introduce legislation which will not be acceptable to us the education bill the transport bill the housing bill the local government bill when it comes and recently the employment bill <e> <s> we have no quarrel if i may say so with bills

allowance are entitled to <e> <s> that is all we are concerned with <e>", "<cs> we have come to the end of this discussion and we wish to divide the committee <e> <s> surely we can do this before we hear the statements <e> <s> having reached the point where we wish to divide surely this is the right time to do it <e>", "<cs> the noble lord staggers me somewhat <e> <s> he said only per cent <e>

"<cs> let us get this quite clear <e> <s> the government cannot hide behind what really is not true <e> <s> you cannot say no one can say that this is due to the rigidity of the statutes <e> <s> we are not simple-minded people on this side of the committee <e>", "<cs> we really must not be treated as if we are simpleminded <e> <s> to hide behind a phrase that the real trouble is the rigidity of the statutes has nothing to do with what we are talking about and what we have talked about since oclock yesterday afternoon <e> <s> the trouble is that it is the rigidity of the government who are going to save money by fair means or foul whether legal or illegal whether it means appropriating money which should go to one source <e>", "<cs> well my limited understanding of the situation may well be that it is not illegal <e> <s> i hope that some group of people in the not too distant future will test this in the courts <e>", "<cs> it is the rigidity of the government <e> <s> they are going to save money by fair means or foul <e> <s> they have made that abundantly clear <e> <s> do not let us hide behind the statutes and say that it is the rigidity of the statutes <e> <s> we know the statutes are numerous there are too many of them <e> <s> they need to be looked at but it would not help us here <e> <s> from beginning to end this is a bill which has been designed from the first clause to the sixth clause to save money on a whole variety of things whether the amounts are small or whether the amounts are large <e> <s> i would have more sympathy with the government if they were honest enough to say the purpose of this bill is to save money we have looked at every possible field where we can save money and this is what we are doing it has nothing to do with statutes <e>",

understanding of the regulations of the department of employment is that a person has to register or sign on once a week to get his money <e> <s> if that is what he does then he signs on once a week to get work and if there is no work he gets his money <e> <s> the implication of what the noble lord said and i realise he was relying on a report suggests that money is paid out without that requirement being exacted because as i understand the situation they must register for work once a week <e> <s> the very fact that they sign on means that they sign on saying they want work <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord could at an early stage pursue the matter <e> <s> many of us would like to know how this percentage of people interviewed admitted what the noble lord described <e> <s> we should like to know of course what conditions they had to fulfil <e>", "<cs> i feel that that reply is a very unsatisfactory one <e> <s> no case has been made out at all as to why the matters affecting the working of the act should not be referred to them <e> <s> the noble lord says that there are a number of matters which will be non-controversial <e> <s> they may well be non-controversial from the governments point of view no doubt but i am not sure they are going to be non-controversial to people outside the government or to members on this side of the committee <e> <s> furthermore though the regulations will be dealt with by going through the affirmative resolution process it does not necessarily follow that we shall not miss something <e>", "<cs> i tried to point out that the refund of paye is money which a man has earned and which he has paid by way of taxation and therefore if he finds himself in the position of being locked out or on strike and gets that money back it is iniquitous that anybody should seek to take into account part of that money <e> <s> i do not know whether there is any point in raising the general principle behind this <e> <s> the government originally intended to deem that a man on strike would be receiving a week from his union <e> <s> but they discovered of course that union funds generally speaking would not permit payments of that kind so that at least the word deem seemed to have died a natural death and we have not heard about it <e> <s> but in its place we have legislation which is going to recover that

period between the committee stage and the report stage for putting down other amendments <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for giving me an opportunity of adding to what i have said <e> <s>

would be prepared to take it from me when i say that the funds in a large number of unions are such that they would not be able to do it <e> <s> we have the big four or the big five like the high street banks but there is an enormous number of unions that could not do it <e> <s> also it would necessitate a very careful inquiry into their means <e> <s> while that would not be difficult in the

wanted to ask the noble lord whether he would explore with the government through the appropriate department whether there is any possibility of asking bbc and bbc and itv the three television channels if they will give just a few seconds to draw attention to the fact that supplementary benefit is available to people <e> <s> i do not want to suggest the wording but i think it would be a very generous gesture on their part <e> <s> it would not cost them a great deal of money <e> <s> they would lose perhaps a few hundred pounds every time they showed it but they can well afford to make

amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness the minister sits down i wish to refer to the fact that she referred to the six principles which i understand have been enumerated by the

not be implemented until this bill gets on to the statute book <e> <s> can she say what is the present position <e>", "<cs> my lords first i wish to offer congratulations to the noble baroness lady mcfarlane of llandaff from everyone on this side of your lordships house <e> <s> the noble baroness would be entitled to think that it is a matter of form that we thank a maiden speaker for his or her particular speech but if i may say so one can detect from the words used by other noble lords and baronesses in this house that they really meant what they said <e> <s> i know that everyone will join me in hoping that the noble baroness will attend your lordships house regularly and will take part in our debates fearlessly if necessary without giving or asking any quarter <e> <s> it would be a very magnificent contribution if she would do so <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down there is something i must put to him by way of a question as i cannot comment <e> <s> i put it to him in the way of a question but i do not require a reply <e> <s> is he aware that the royal commission advocated or recommended that the health services board should continue <e> <s> as the function of the health services board was to phase <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble lord lord sandys for introducing this order in some detail <e> <s> we on this side of the house approve the

is the minister aware that my noble friend lord crook has a particular interest in this matter in that he was associated with this organisation for a great many years <e>", "<cs> my lords from time to time the government have relied upon this question of people not paying tax <e> <s> the noble baroness said only a few minutes ago like the pensioners do <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble baroness is in a position to say what percentage of pensioners in this country pay tax <e> <s> my understanding of the situation is that a very small percentage of them pay tax <e> <s> a good number of them though not as many as should be are in receipt of supplementary benefit <e> <s> it seems to be only a question of finding the right kind of phraseology <e>", "<cs> my lords i can speak only by leave of the house <e> <s> when i speak of pensioners i am thinking in terms of the million people or thereabouts who are in receipt of state retirement pensions <e> <s> that would include women over either in their own right or as a result of their husbands contributions and certainly men over <e> <s> i do not think that we ought to assume that because there may be members of your lordships house who are in receipt of a state retirement pension and pay tax this goes for a large number of the million <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble baroness the minister will tomorrow read carefully what she has said <e> <s> it is a pretty disgraceful statement to say that while it is not the governments intention to make any further cuts in three years time they must nevertheless have provision in

economies and so on i hardly describe this as an intellectual exercise but it is nothing more than an exercise a colossal waste of parliamentary time and peoples time <e>", "<cs> yes my lords as my noble friend reminds me it is a matter of humanity which is a far better way of expressing it <e> <s> it is on that basis that i ask your lordships to support this amendment because i think it is the right thing to do <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have very much to say <e> <s> i simply want to clear up one or two points <e> <s> i think that the noble lord lord sandys referred

this matter <e> <s> it is not at all unexpected <e> <s> i shall certainly look at what the noble baroness has said because i feel that there is a case here that merits special consideration and i

want to point out just one or two factors <e> <s> it seems to me that the noble baroness has overlooked one very important point and those who support her must also have overlooked it <e> <s> what is the position when a man goes on strike <e> <s> we know it is history and it is statistical that very few of them ever apply for supplementary benefit for their wives and families <e> <s> the bulk of them do not <e> <s> it is a very small minority but with those who do what is the position then <e> <s> the husband gets nothing at all not a penny only his wife and children <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house the noble lord has really asked me a question <e> <s> i shall try not to abuse the consideration of the house by taking up too much time but i would say this to the noble lord <e> <s> the government are bringing the government into the front line <e> <s> it is not a question of taking an action to take them out of it <e> <s> the very people whom we are talking about are taxpayers <e> <s> they are entitled to all the facilities amenities and benefits to which other people are entitled <e> <s> if the government are going to introduce a punitive measure and this is a punitive measure although the government will not admit it then believe me my lords far from removing them from the front line it is bringing the government into the front line and i only hope that none of us will live to regret it <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to get this quite clear <e> <s> is the minister really saying that a widow receiving a widows allowance is at the end of weeks going to be deprived of the earnings-related supplement to which she is entitled as a result of her late husbands contributions while it is going to be added to the widowed mothers allowance and the widows pension <e>", "<cs> clause is designed to undertake a fundamental reorganisation of the national health service and we on this side of your lordships committee have not put down any amendments

a management team but it is very substantial <e> <s> she says that at the very most there will be district health authorities and perhaps as few as but that around to management teams will go <e> <s>

grateful to the noble baroness <e> <s> it is comforting to hear her words <e> <s> this must be the first bill that has been introduced into the house of lords in the past months where somebody on the government side has said the object of saving money is not the purpose of this bill <e> <s> i cannot accept what has been said and i must test the committee on this particular amendment <e>", "<cs> the only thing i can say about this clause is that in my view it is a most unfortunate one in this particular bill <e> <s> i understand it by that i mean that i understand its inclusion because it follows and flows from the philosophy of the government <e> <s> the philosophy is that if you can get money in order to reduce expenditure then do so by all means <e>", "<cs> but we are talking about last november <e> <s> we are talking about last april <e>", "<cs> that was done by a labour government <e> <s> if the noble baroness will look at some of the election promises she will find that there

<e> <s> i wish to confine myself to one aspect of the clause relating to the governments intention to impose cash limits on health authorities <e> <s> if i understand the clause correctly not only will the government impose cash limits on health authorities but the limits will be legally binding <e> <s> this matter exercises my mind rather more than do some of the other aspects <e> <s> if the

what are the penalties <e> <s> i am not being facetious about this <e> <s> i really do not know how this situation is to be dealt with <e>", "<cs> i do not want to press the noble baroness the minister tonight i really want this for my own information <e> <s> as i understand it cash limits can be legally enforceable <e> <s> i merely asked in what way <e> <s> the noble baroness said that if they did it a second year then action could be taken <e> <s> i want to know what kind of action is possible under the clause <e> <s> in point of fact what would that action be and what would be the penalties <e> <s> i know this matter is very complicated and i will not press it tonight <e> <s> i do not know whether the noble baroness feels that i could get a specific answer to this by letter before the report stage but i should be quite happy about that <e>", "<cs> i will not trouble the noble baroness to write to me <e> <s> i should like to read this and perhaps raise the matter with her privately if necessary <e>", "<cs> yes leave out clause and insert the following new clause <e> <s> it is part of this amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord sandys for his contribution <e> <s> i am aware of what is in the bill and i am familiar with what the clause intends to do in relation to the secretary of states statement about the appointment of committees or a panel <e>", "<cs> i should be very surprised if people who make that kind of utterance are not themselves very heavily involved in private practice <e> <s> i would go so far as to say that if they were members of your lordships house speaking in your lordships chamber they would have to declare an interest before they spoke <e> <s> so i am not at all impressed by that aspect <e>", "<cs> the noble lord misses the point <e> <s> there is a point of principle here so far as we are concerned <e> <s> it is not a question of a ratio it is a question of principle <e> <s> let us get back to the principles <e> <s> the fourth principle states that after admission access by all patients to diagnostic and treatment facilities should be governed by clinical considerations <e> <s> this principle does not exclude earlier access by private patients to facilities especially arranged for them i emphasise the phrase especially arranged for them if these are provided without prejudice to national health service patients without extra expense <e> <s> i think that that is contradictory in that it permits for private patients treatment that would not he available to national health service patients <e> <s> what facilities was this clause intended to cover <e>", "<cs> yes but it does not alter the fact that the word significantly is used <e>", "<cs> i should have to look at the act but after all noble lords opposite have always said that the labour party was wrong <e> <s> i see that there is no point in pursuing these six principles <e> <s> i think that on the whole there has been something of an achievement but i do not think that the principles are as good as noble lords opposite make out <e> <s> i take the view that the fourth principle suggests that certain facilities are not available to national health service patients and the fifth principle makes it clear that private patients will be able to monopolise the personal time and expertise of their consultant <e> <s> one point that irritates many of us and i have spent very long periods in hospitals is that where there are private beds the consultant spends an inordinate amount of time looking after the patients in those beds while his registrar or houseman comes along and looks after me and other national health service patients <e> <s> i am not quarrelling with that situation because in my experience the consultant popped in occasionally so that i did not forget him <e> <s> but the fact remains that this has been one of the complaints of junior doctors <e>", "<cs> if the noble baroness is to argue along those lines i too shall argue on the same lines by saying that if there was no private practice we should have more consultants and doctors in the public sector <e> <s> but neither argument is of very great value <e> <s> i do not want to say anything more other than to add that i move the amendment <e>", "<cs> is the noble baroness the minister in a position to give any indications as to how in fact these things are monitored <e> <s> who has the responsibility to see that they are in fact properly applied <e> <s> that of course will also go for the six principles when they come into being if they have not already come into being <e>", "<cs> i am bound to say on what the noble baroness the minister has said that i think it is highly unsatisfactory and open to a good deal of abuse <e>", "<cs> it is gratifying to hear the noble baroness say that her right honourable friend the minister of state is considering this matter with the private sector but bearing in mind that the private sector is going to exist for some years on people who are already trained that is nursing staff medical auxiliaries and doctors and that they have been trained at the expense of the state does her right honourable friend the minister of state rule out the possibility of getting some kind of levy for the staff they have already got <e>", "<cs> i do not want to prolong this debate but this is a matter which is causing considerable concern to the people who are working in the field of those who could be described to a large extent as being deprived <e> <s> it has imposed a very severe burden on them <e> <s> i do not want to go over the same ground as that covered by the noble baroness lady robson because she has done it in such an excellent manner <e> <s> what i want to ask the minister is this <e> <s> is it true that the department of health and social security has already investigated the possibility of granting exemptions to more groups with specified illnesses but that this was rejected because it was unacceptable to the representatives of the medical profession because of the risk of argument between doctor and patient <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the minister aware that while in a matter of this kind it is desirable to involve a number of government departments particularly those departments that are either directly or indirectly concerned experience has shown that where several government departments are involved it is extremely difficult to reach a decision within a reasonable time <e>", "<cs> my lords we on this side of your lordships chamber have made no secret of the tact that in our view this bill is a thoroughly bad bill and one which we believe will bring lasting discredit to the conservative party <e> <s> it is a bill devoid of feeling understanding and sympathy and it is one about which i am sure many government supporters feel unhappy <e> <s> but unfortunately only a few if i may be permitted to say so have had the courage and the will to oppose the government at certain stages <e> <s> we on this side have not put down any amendments for todays stage of the bill as in our view it would be a complete waste of time <e> <s> during the passage of the bill we put down amendments and it was very clear early in the proceedings as it was in the case of the first social security bill when we put down amendments that the government had made up their mind that both bills should be returned to the other place without any amendment at all <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is perfectly right <e> <s> i should have said the health services bill which had its committee stage last thursday and i am most grateful to the noble lord for pointing that out <e> <s> but perhaps it is not without significance that noble lords opposite are prepared to cut the meagre benefits of the unemployed and the sick and those in receipt of invalidity and other benefits while supporting the claim of a group who no doubt they know and represent as distinct from a section of the community whose problems they do not know and if i may say so never will know <e>", "<cs> my lords i think this matter is much too serious to <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl allow me to interrupt and say that we on this side of the house really cannot hear him <e> <s> it is not his fault <e> <s> i know that the

lords i want to ask about the considerable autonomy as regards the management of the affairs of the new health authorities <e> <s> in point of fact we on this side are glad that there will be considerable autonomy in the management of the affairs of the new health authorities but we would ask the government and i do not ask for a reply to this now to have regard to the fact that this can only be done if on the district health committee there is a sufficient number of people who have a working knowledge of the national health service and who are in a position to make objective judgments on what the service needs <e> <s> i am thinking of those who work at the grass roots of our national health service the employees <e> <s> if i may say so we are much too fond of appointing to authorities and to committees the great and the good <e> <s> what we need are fewer great and fewer good people and far more committed and concerned people <e> <s> i hope that the government will go in for the committed and the concerned and not the others <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble baroness the minister <e> <s> i do not know whether we have the same copy of the statement i can see no reference in mine to subject to the bill becoming an act of parliament <e> <s> also i note that although this is a statement made by the right honourable patrick jenkin

leisure in <e>", "<cs> my lords what i meant is whether the minister wanted me to justify the amendment <e> <s> if not i shall move amendment no <e> <s> which stands in my name <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the minister <e> <s> if in future she is going to do something like this i think that she ought to give me good notice <e> <s> i am not sure that my constitution would stand too many shocks of this kind <e> <s> nevertheless i am very grateful to her <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for introducing this draft statutory instrument and may i say it was rather a delight to have an instrument of this kind which is so clearly set out in its terms that anyone unfamiliar with it would have no difficulty in understanding its purpose <e> <s> for that i am particularly grateful <e> <s> i feel i should like to thank the minister also for fulfilling an obligation and a promise made some time ago in producing this particular order <e> <s> i notice that the th report of the joint committee on statutory instruments has nothing to comment on and presumably this means that they are satisfied with the order <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we are not going to resolve this by merely discussing the rights and wrong of the matter and by noble lords on both sides giving their points of view <e> <s> i think the only way we can resolve it if noble lords opposite

briefer than i had intended <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness the minister for being prepared to take these orders altogether because some need more comment than others <e> <s>

which is of great importance but the fact that so many of them need aids to get from one part of the house to another <e> <s> it is now taking a long time to get these <e> <s> would it not be in the interests of the disabled if the government attached a little more importance to seeing that the physical aids which the disabled need are provided instead of having to wait as many of them do an interminable time <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister in a position to say how much money the government are proposing to make available to help the various organisations to which he made reference a

soames indicates that it was a very small amount as i understand it this government are not going to do anything <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord the minister whether it is not quite impossible at this stage for the government to give any indication at all of what can be saved when the area health authorities cease to exist and the district health authorities come into account <e>

your lordships house today any arrangement has been made for dinners tonight <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord the government chief whip whether it is not a fact that all members of the

to eat and to use the facilities of the guests dining room <e>", "<cs> my lords i promise not to take up the time of your lordships house after this question but having listened to the government chief whip there would appear to be no yardstick now in existence whereby one can ascertain whether dinners are likely to be available except any announcement that the government may make on the day

industry is suffering extremely badly as a result of the recession may i ask the minister i ask this quite sincerely whether it would be unreasonable to find out whether the banks which have made an enormous profit out of high interest rates i think running into many hundreds of millions of pounds would be prepared to offer interest-free loans to this industry <e>", "<cs> my lords with permission

responsibilities prevent his attendance here this afternoon <e> <s> i have had an opportunity of discussing the content of this order with him and getting his expert guidance on the matter <e> <s> i think that i could say that this stems as the noble earl lord gowrie has said from the employment protection consolidation act which lays out very clearly what action should be taken although it is left to the government to fix amounts <e> <s> as the noble earl has gone into this matter very deeply and if i may say so very clearly we have no reservations with regard to it at all <e> <s> i merely

community <e> <s> alas <e> <s> this is not the occasion <e> <s> may i say at the very beginning that we on this side of the house recognise the need on the part of the government to raise money to

down i think a number of your lordships will feel that i have been rather disagreeable but i shall seek to gain your approval by being brief bearing in mind that there are more speakers to come <e>

aware that the reply which the government have given on this matter is totally unsatisfactory <e> <s> when an anomaly of this kind exists the government cannot run away from their responsibility and say <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister give the house any indication of when the government are likely to be able to say when and in what way national health service spectacles will be improved <e>

very substantial amount <e> <s> i do not know whether the government who have undoubtedly considered this matter will be in a position to reply to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> if the committee will allow me to reply anybody who is paying national health insurance whether earning a week or a week is entitled to the same benefits and those benefits if i may say so are numerous <e>", "<cs> if the house will allow me to reply <e>", "<cs> yes of course <e> <s> i think that i interpreted what the noble lord lord hawke said rather too negatively <e> <s> i thought that the noble lord was referring to benefits to which one was entitled i was thinking quickly about unemployment <e> <s> i would accept that it must marginally i cannot say to what extent and i cannot say the exact amount affect the benefits that people are entitled to by way of retirement and matters like that <e> <s> i accept that <e> <s> but it would only affect them marginally because we are talking about an increase of only a week which i grant you is a year for a person who earns an additional a week <e> <s> as i have said i wish i could tell the committee what has been computed to be the value to the treasury of this increased amount if it were implemented <e> <s> i am afraid i have forgotten the third point which the noble lord asked me about <e>", "<cs> i thought that i had dealt with that when i introduced the amendment by saying that it seemed to me that the burden of raising extra money was going to be put on that section of the community which was not in such a happy state financially as the other section of the community earning a week or more <e> <s> i went so far as to say that i accept the fact that they already pay more income tax as a result of high income than the band about which i have been talking <e> <s> but what i was saying and if not saying implying is that i still think that they are in a position having regard to the times that we are going through to make an extra contribution of a week for every they earn <e>", "<cs> i should like to say to the noble lord lord drumalbyn that i would accept the decision of the chairman of committees it is said that if this amendment is accepted by the committee the other amendment cannot be taken <e> <s> my knowledge of these matters is very limited but when i tabled the amendments i was not of the view that one

contrary course on this occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the noble earl the minister whether he would regard it as another question entirely if i were to ask him what relief the government are proposing to give to ordinary users of gas and fuel who are finding the prices quite exhorbitant <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a good thing that it should be a growth service <e> <s> is it not true that over the last few years our hospitals have dealt with more out-patients and in-patients than ever before and that it is highly desirable that they should continue to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords it was my intention to apologise to your lordships for running the risk of being criticised for making a second reading speech at third reading <e> <s> but as my noble friend and i say that advisedly has done so there is perhaps no need for me to apologise <e> <s> there is a very good precedent if i may say so for anyone who wishes to review a bill at this particular stage <e> <s> i can recall having introduced into your lordships house some five years ago the health services bill which came as a tremendous shock to noble lords opposite <e> <s> they contested it not clause by clause but line by line <e> <s> they were so upset about it that on the very last stage of the proceedings when the motion before your lordships house was that this bill do now pass the noble baroness who led for the conservative party in your lordships house got up and made a speech and was followed by no fewer than others <e> <s> they took hours and minutes <e> <s> it is not my intention to take quite that long today <e> <s> however i think it right to raise a matter on a bill which causes at least some of your lordships grave concern and this stage of the passage of the bill provides a legitimate opportunity to look afresh at what has been done and i propose to do that although i shall not take long over it <e>", "<cs> i know noble lords opposite do not like it my lords because the truth is hard to bear <e> <s> we all know that but it is sometimes very good for us <e> <s> i am surprised at how many noble lords opposite who i respect and admire and know well can just sit there

lords <e>", "<cs> in any event my lords one can take some comfort from reading in the newspapers this morning that some conservative members in another place are getting so fed up with the conservative party that there is a suggestion that they might be joining the council for social democracy <e>", "<cs> we arc in the right party my lords <e>", "<cs> looking at you <e> <s> my lords i appreciate that we joke and try to carry on our affairs in a friendly manner in this house but i urge noble lords to look at this legislation <e> <s> there is nothing we can do about it now the noble

society i want <e> <s> nor do i believe it is the kind of society some noble lords opposite want <e> <s> for the government to have resisted an amendment which sought merely to take a bit more each week out of every extra from those earning over a week was petty paltry and quite scandalous <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether i am right in thinking that the man who earns a week will be paying on the per cent <e> <s> per week national insurance which is precisely the same amount as the man earning or a week will be paying <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down could we have a clear answer on this <e> <s> is it not true that a person earning over a week will in fact pay the same amount of national insurance as the person earning a week <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the minister in a position to say how many crimes are committed by persons who are already on bail awaiting trial <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i advise the government <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether i may advise the government that if they get in touch with the british medical association that body will assure them that there are doctors unemployed at the moment that that is due to the fact that health authorities are cutting back on medical services and that the bma anticipate that between and doctors will be unable to find employment in the not too distant future <e>", "<cs> my lords having regard to the waiting lists of people who want to go into hospital and who need medical attention is it not disgraceful that the government are admitting to your lordships that some doctors are unemployed <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness correct when she says that plans implying those to which i make reference are of long standing <e> <s> is it not true that quite recently the department of health and social security issued three plans a plan known as plan lionel a plan concord and a plan bittern dealing with the use of service personnel in the event of difficulties <e> <s> may i also ask the noble baroness what has happened to the code of practice which the last government introduced and got agreed and does this mean that the government have decided in the event of a dispute to abandon consultation and replace it with confrontation <e>", "<cs> but my lords the noble baroness will agree that it is a new situation in the sense that the documents to which i am referring have come into being since the government came into power in may <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble baroness as she has implied that there has in fact been a leak of a confidential circular whether the circular goes on to say <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble lord for that information <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that more doctors with small lists of patients more doctors with very large lists of patients more doctors of years of age and more doctors working single-handed are to be found in inner london than anywhere else in the country <e> <s> is this not largely due to the fact that lists of patients enable a doctor to claim the basic allowances permitted under the national health service which means that having got the basic allowances for the patients they are then free to go and earn additional income outside the national health service <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister this does not this mean that there must be a large number of people in inner london who are not being properly cared for from a health point of view or not being cared for at all or who if they want care have to go privately <e> <s> it seems that everything points to that and that in areas like that of this house in westminster kensington and chelsea in of doctors in general practice is over the age of and in has fewer than patients <e> <s> is this not quite deplorable <e> <s> i should like to know whether the government are proposing to do anything about it <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether one way out of the present difficulty which the government cannot seem to overcome is to invite woolworths to supply the service they supplied years ago <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord the minister whether the house is to understand that the government will claim this improvement to be a success of their policy <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord give the house some indication of the local authority services to which he referred and which were implicit in his reply to his noble friend and say whether he is in a position to know to which local authority services his noble friend referred <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether he is aware that we on this side of the house and i am sure his noble colleagues behind him congratulate him on the way in which he has answered what i believe is his first question at the dispatch box <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether the house is really to understand that the government do not know how much money is spent on importing blood into this country when it seems to be fairly common knowledge that the amount we spend per year is something like million <e> <s> are the government aware that a lot of this blood is bought from people in poor countries where there is a high incidence of blood-transmitted disease and furthermore that blood in some countries is obtained from junkies and alcoholics and others who have nothing to sell other than their blood <e> <s> and they sell it <e> <s> therefore we have embarked on a very dangerous undertaking <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask whether it is true that the government have decided to spend in the region of million to extend the laboratory at elstree where if the laboratory was completely upgraded i accept that it would cost something like million <e> <s> but once the laboratory had been completely upgraded and that amount had been spent it would make it unnecessary for us to buy blood from abroad and we should recover that million within three years as a result <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble baroness the minister whether she is able to say that her right honourable friend the secretary of state is proposing to use the powers he has under the national health act to call in any such applications <e> <s> may i ask her whether the government are aware that in the health authority for the area in which your lordships house is situated where there are two large hospitals westminster and middlesex one in seven of all posts in the various hospitals are vacant amounting to nearly jobs <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble baroness the minister for that reply may i ask her in view of what she says whether it is not a fact that the area that we have both referred to has the largest number of private beds in the country namely -odd and that in this particular area there are all the private facilities in harley street wellington hospital and the princess grace hospital <e> <s> further is it not true to say that the competition that exists in this area as in other areas between the private sector and the health service is such that there is a considerable shortage of staff in our national health service hospitals and that some of the intensive care units and the operating theatres not to mention the nursing side are seriously affected by the growth of the private sector <e>", "<cs> my lords we are obviously very grateful to the noble baroness the minister for introducing this order in some detail <e> <s> it is an order of some importance although i am inclined to say that it perhaps tends to conceal more than it reveals <e> <s> we on this side of your lordships house are not very happy about it <e> <s> i do not want to go into it at very great length because i happen to know that two or three of my noble friends will want to make a contribution and i have some idea of the field that they may cover <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness carries on i wonder whether she would allow me to intervene at this stage <e> <s> is she saying that health authorities can use their discretion as to whether they will apply a language test so far as nurses are concerned <e> <s> i think that is precisely what she said that it would be within their discretion <e> <s> may i ask her whether the government would give an undertaking that health authorities will be asked to see that an english test is in fact applied to all nurses if they cannot speak english adequately <e> <s> one must bear in mind that there are large areas of england today where it is difficult to get nurses <e> <s> i can see the more <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the whole house would wish me to express its gratitude to the noble baroness the minister for allowing us to hear the statement made by her right honourable friend in another place <e> <s> the statement makes it difficult by the way it is worded to ask the minister any questions but it lends itself to a great deal of comment <e> <s> i will bear in mind what is required of a speaker in this situation and will try to rely if i can upon questions and not too many statements <e>", "<cs> my lords is it possible in those circumstances for inquiries to be made in the country of origin as to what a persons possessions and means may be <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord was good enough to give the house figures of drug addicts who attend

<s> i understand the difficulty one is in when talking about success but may i ask the minister to say when he says it is estimated that the success rate is about per cent <e> <s> what aftercare and supervision there is so enabling one to form some sort of judgment as to the yardstick which is being used <e>", "<cs> my attention has been called to the situation which seems to create the difficulty <e> <s> i do not know whether the committee knows that all the numbers on page have slipped should be should be <e> <s> they have slipped down and i think this is the cause of the difficulty <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether he is suggesting that voting rights will be extended to those british subjects who have made it perfectly clear that they have no intention of returning to this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the house is grateful to the noble lord for explaining this matter in detail <e> <s> i think it is important that the house should know what it is all about <e> <s> my only comment is that of course an increase is far better than a decrease but i think we would all recognise that a week which amounts to something like a year is not in itself a very large sum to meet insurance on a home or a house and to cover repairs <e> <s> when the noble lord said that in exceptional circumstances this amount could be increased that was some comfort but i am sure the government will realise that in view of the cost of repairs these days it is difficult to get anything done without spending quite a considerable sum of money <e> <s> apart from that i have no other comment to make <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down i should like to ask her one question because i think that it is important that we should get the situation correct <e> <s> i understood her to say that the secretary of state for social services does not accept the report of the association of directors of social service <e> <s> i should like to ask the noble baroness whether it is not a fact that the association of directors of social service compiled this -page report as a result of a carefully prepared questionnaire that they sent out

world and if they get them at a very cheap rate to charge something really exorbitant because a much higher figure is in the agreement between the opticians and the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i wanted to say something about the role of the voluntary sector <e> <s> the iydp was a triumph for the voluntary sector <e> <s> it showed its strengths and obviously revealed its weaknesses <e> <s> the voluntary sector is obviously more innovative and adventurous than the statutory bodies and can provide a more flexible personalised form of care <e> <s> the state cannot afford to experiment it is too costly <e> <s> but the voluntary organisations can and the best provision is that based on co-operation between the statutory and the voluntary services <e> <s> i do not want to mention any particular one <e> <s> the one it was suggested to me that i should mention happens to be one of which both the noble baroness lady faithfull and i are patrons although the person who suggested the name to me did not know this <e> <s> so perhaps i should not mention any of them <e>", "<cs> my lords i am conscious of the fact that there is an important piece of business to follow this and i

and i hope your lordships will feel that this is the proper thing to do in the circumstances is to thank every member of your lordships house who has participated in this debate <e> <s> it has been very revealing and i hope it will be of value to the government <e> <s> i have heard every speech with two exceptions i heard only part of the speech made by the noble earl lord radnor and that applies also to the speech of the noble baroness lady masham of ilton <e> <s> i had to leave the chamber and i will leave it like that <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the fact that this matter has received publicity owing to the cost of screening may i ask whether the noble lords figure of per person per screening is accurate <e> <s> was a statement not made recently by the authorities at the royal marsden hospital that screening patients last year cost which amounts to per patient <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord the minister this if the government are going to contemplate clawing back some of the over-expenditure is it not disgraceful considering that the <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether he is aware as i am sure he is that a large number of old-age pensioners are living below the poverty line because they are not taking up the various benefits to which they are entitled <e> <s> to claw back from million or million people an amount of million in those circumstances is quite deplorable <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord in a position to say how many hospitals have been closed in scotland since this government have been in power how many wards have been closed and how many other medical institutions have been closed in scotland as a result of shortage of money <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord but this is a point of information <e> <s> how can he possibly save when the reduction is going to be <e> <s> it indicates that there are going to be people on the lowest point <e> <s> the noble lord knows as well as i do that there will not be people on the lowest point <e> <s> they would have to be very young <e> <s> how can you save <e> <s> it cannot be done <e>", "<cs> my lords i merely wanted to ask the noble lord whether we can assume that either late tonight or first thing tomorrow morning the secretary of state for the home department mr whitelaw will be informed of what decision he has already made <e>", "<cs> my lords how many of those convicted were subsequently found to be entitled to far larger benefit than they were in fact receiving <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble and learned lord allow me to tell him <e>", "<cs> my lords i have asked a question <e> <s> will the noble and learned lord allow me to <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord repeat the assurance given by his government and his party on a number of occasions that they will not have dealings or discussions with the plo until the plo gives an assurance that it recognises the existence of israel <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister give an indication as to whether the government or the prison authorities provide facilities whereby members of the family can visit prisoners at regular intervals <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister be good enough to indicate the purpose for which this land will be used <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the noble lord the minister can claim that he has made a case out against this particular amendment <e> <s> if he has done anything at all it is to damn it with faint praise <e> <s> he began by commending a good deal that was in the amendment and said that most of what is proposed is being done at present <e> <s> if that is so why can it not be embodied in the bill <e> <s> i should like to get from him if it is possible one concrete reason why the government should not accept the amendment because everything that the noble lord has said has really supported it and it has been dismissed if i may say so without any just cause <e> <s> i know that the noble lord has reservations about the interpretation of possible and practicable but i think we all know what we mean by those words <e> <s> if the amendment is as good as i think the noble lord would claim it is and if he has any reservation in his mind as to the meaning of those two words in this particular bill could he not take the amendment away and come back with some suggestion at third reading as to how this particular amendment could be met <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the responsibility of this government to know why certain things have happened and when asked by this house why they happened to give an answer <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister this question <e> <s> if i understood him correctly he said that the secretary of state had suggested that certain recommendations from the committee should be put into operation <e> <s> may i ask whether those recommendations are available <e> <s> would it be possible to have a copy of them <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister this question as i fear i did not make myself clear <e> <s> i understood him to say that the secretary of state was advising local authorities to implement certain of the recommendations <e> <s> if i have understood him correctly may i have a list of those recommendations which the secretary of state wants to see implemented without delay <e> <s> may i also have a copy of the letter that he sends to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government aware that in one month from th may to th june there were bombardments by the plo from their bases in the lebanon against israeli settlements <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness the leader of the house willing to comment on the <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether any explanatory memorandum on the various matters which he has mentioned is available which would be of interest to people who are working for the disabled and if so whether one or two sets could be made available in the

appreciate the level or if you like the depth at which some people live <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for giving way <e> <s> let me make it clear that i do not think she is typical of the members on her side of the house <e> <s> i wonder how many members on her side of the house take any big city have spent days going into homes in limehouse pennyfields isle of dogs shadwell st georges and places like that where one had to visit people every day and see the conditions under which they lived <e> <s> i do not think that the noble baroness is typical and i suspect that very few members on her side of the house have been so identified with the poor as many of us in the field of social work <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that it has been possible on this very serious issue to have what i think might be described as an agreeable debate <e> <s> in saying that none of us has lost sight of the fact whether or not we are in favour of the motion that it is a matter which needs to be aired from time to time <e> <s> i have no desire to exercise my right to address your lordships at any great length but there are three or four small points i should like to clear up <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord the minister if he is in a position to say whether the scanners are strategically placed so that it is possible for a person with a suspected tumour on the brain i have an emotional involment in this going back some years to be scanned within a reasonable period of time <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord the minister if he is in a position to say whether the profit to the pharmacist is greater on proprietary brands than on generic drugs <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government aware that the extreme wing of the plo is totally opposed and has said so quite recently to an independent state of israel or the recognition of it which culminated by way of proof in a very serious and distasteful murder within the past two weeks

surely it can be translated into the number of people who would be able to apply if it was and the number of people who are getting it now that it is only <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always a delight to listen to the noble lord lord hunter of newington because although we would not see eye to eye on this particular matter he can always be relied upon to put a case much better balanced than most of us who have shall i say very strong opinions <e> <s> the subject of this debate is of supreme importance in view of the governments thinking in respect of the future of the national health service <e>

therefore although i have read part of it i have been and am dependent on a wide variety of comments and observations which one has found in professional journals as well as in newspapers <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord the minister whether he is in a position to inform the house when these increases will be paid or do the government propose to do what they did on a former occasion and not pay the increase at the end of the nd week but at the end of the rd or th <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that it was in january that the procedure committee issued a report calling your lordships attention to the fact that if there were comments to be made following a maiden speaker they should be left only to the peer who followed the maiden speaker <e> <s> my recollection is that that was no new departure <e> <s> there had been a previous report some years before on the same matter but the attention of the house was called to it in order to save time certainly in long debates <e>", "<cs> my lords for me personally it is always a joy to listen to the noble earl <e> <s> i have listened to him many times and he has had to disagree with me many times but we can normally expect from the noble earl an informative and a very balanced contribution <e> <s> he was a little disappointing today because as far as the youth of this country are concerned we are not much farther on <e> <s> it is perfectly true that the noble earl was able to satisfy the noble lords who sit behind him because there were only five noble lords behind him to hear what he had to say the other three-quarters left the chamber immediately he stood up <e> <s> i feel that it is of supreme importance to tackle seriously this very important matter yet we are playing with it because we are not really serious about it <e>", "<cs> my lords having regard to the need for housing that people can buy in the dockland area may i ask whether the minister considers it right and proper that properties being built there should be for sale at <e> <s> some special properties are for sale at over half a million pounds <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether it is not more important that the government should pay attention to the needs of the people served by local authorities who are not getting the services they need today because of the governments cuts and the governments desire to cut back on staff <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble viscount how he can possibly use the word decisive and say that the party in power had the decisive support of the electorate in this country when only per cent of the electorate voted for that party <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl the minister in a position to give the percentage who succeed in finding work within a given period such as three months or six months <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble baroness what the government mean by minor errors <e> <s> the government have been asked how many employees on sickness benefit receive incorrect amounts <e> <s> what is meant by minor bearing in mind that when a person is sick even a small amount of money is of considerable importance <e>", "<cs> my lords as a member of the select committee i was present for the whole of the time <e> <s> i can assure the noble lords lord boyd-carpenter and lord renton that every possible consideration was given both for and against this particular suggestion <e> <s> i do not think that if they had been present they could have crossed any ts or dotted any is <e> <s> if i may say so it has nothing to do with the question of power <e> <s> it is a question of providing a new length a definite length for debate <e> <s> many of us who have sat in this house for some years have known occasions when halfway through a debate for which there is a list of or wishing to take part those who have spoken have gone and for the rest of the evening sometimes for several hours there have been not a dozen people in your lordships chamber <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord the minister whether he will not recognise that following the advance of medical science in recent years it is now possible to treat in hospital a considerably larger number of people than ever before <e> <s> that arises simply because until a few years ago after some operations patients had to remain in hospital for days whereas now they can be discharged within three or four days <e> <s> that is more largely due to the advance of medical and technical science than to anything else <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord indicate how many small businesses have gone into liquidation since <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord the minister be good enough to answer the question <e> <s> the question is when do the government expect the report to be published <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give the house an undertaking that he will see that his right honourable friend the minister sees an account of todays proceedings in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> i am stirred into action by the vehemence of the noble lord lord marsh when he talked about the information that the various organisations give <e> <s> we have known each other for a good many years and i hope that he will not take this amiss <e> <s> but it suggests that he really does not know what is going on in the community <e> <s> if he did he would not have made that statement that he made <e>", "<cs> perhaps the short answer is that it is unfortunate that the noble lord dealt with and referred to the written and printed information that certain groups give to people in the community <e> <s> we should be very worried about the ordinary person who is living below the poverty line and by virtue of the fact that he or she does not know what he or she is entitled to is not getting the benefits <e> <s> the noble lord included that section and the leaflets and information made available by advice services and other organisations <e> <s> i feel that we have to have a kind of priority <e> <s> i ask the minister to acknowledge that and not give us so to speak a few well chosen words paying lip service and saying we still cannot do it <e> <s> if he does not mind my saying so there are certain things which must take priority <e> <s> informing the people in the community who are in need is much much more important than are perhaps some other forms of social service <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister to indicate to the house the reason for these vacancies <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether he is aware that everyone on this side of the house has great sympathy with every government minister because of the way they are continually being let down by the prime minister <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not true that the local authority knew some four or five months before the town hall was demolished that the glc intended to include the building in a conservation area <e> <s> secondly does the noble lord agree that their action was the action of vandals <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord but am i to understand that copies of these documents went to the magistrates association and to the family division of the high court <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord say whether provided he obtains the permission of the two persons to whom he is to address his correspondence there is any objection to a copy of each letter being placed in the library <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord the minister will make amends for making a decision in respect of this amendment before he had heard the arguments <e> <s> i believe that the best way to do that and i say this with great kindness would be for him to take back this amendment as he has taken back amendment no <e> <s> and have another look at it <e> <s> it is quite clear that anyone who supports this amendment to the point of saying that the probation service must suffer along with other organisations clearly does not know the structure of the probation service and the contribution that it is making to the people of this country <e>", "<cs> my lords as one who is walking today as a result of prolonged physiotherapy may i ask the minister whether he is aware how much we on this side of the chamber appreciate the fact that he has said that the concern of the government is the staffing of the national health service by physiotherapists <e> <s> it is important that such a contribution is found in the national health service and many of us hope that it will be increased <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister in a position to say how many physiotherapists are engaged in the national health service and how many in the private sector <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether the motorway road signs are still made in one of our big prisons <e> <s> if this is so would it not be possible to extend this to other prisons and give prisoners some satisfactory work to do rather than a repetitive and useless work that many of them are carrying out <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister seriously telling the house in respect of the long-term unemployed who are known to be suffering severe limitations and in some cases not receiving an adequate amount of food each week that the government cannot see their way clear to doing something for them <e> <s> are we really to understand that <e>", "<cs> who cares little or nothing for the effect of those policies on the ordinary people of this country <e>", "<cs> my lords if i think that i shall say it make no mistake about it <e> <s> i took part in the general election and can look back at the tory <e>", "<cs> my lords having listened to the minister it is quite clear that much of what has been said today has fallen on stony ground and not on fertile soil <e> <s> but having said that i should like to take this opportunity of thanking him for his very full reply <e>", "<cs> my lords all that remains is for me to beg leave to withdraw my motion for papers <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not true that when the minister says that more customs officials have been employed elsewhere they have in fact been drawn from other ports and therefore they are understaffed <e>", "<cs> my lords in the event of spain entering the ec shall we as a country have the right to apply for extradition proceedings against people who have left this country when they are wanted on criminal charges <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister saying in his replies that since the advent of this government the rich are not getting richer and the poor are not getting poorer <e>", "<cs> my lords if the chairman of a board has yet to be appointed who in fact approves or vets the appointments made at regional level <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether he is speaking for the government and not from what people see or hear on television <e> <s> what evidence has he got from his departments own investigation that there is this misuse of money <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that the noble viscount the leader of the house is present because i want to make i hope nicely a minor complaint <e> <s> before doing so i want to assure the noble earl lord caithness that we are and have been ever since he came to the house very good friends and nothing that i am about to say is any reflection upon him at all <e>", "<cs> my lords i gather from what the minister said that family practitioner committees are to be autonomous <e> <s> if there is a dispute as to any action they take or decision that they make who will be able to question it <e>", "<cs> my lords are we to understand from the ministers reply that the national health service will use the services of any chiropodist <e> <s> is it not a fact that there are several professional organisations of chiropodists whose qualifications vary considerably and that it is only wise to accept chiropodists who hold a particular qualification <e>", "<cs> my lords notwithstanding the fact that there may be a shortage of qualified chiropodists will the noble lord assure the house that only qualified chiropodists will in fact be used otherwise there may be more people taken off their feet <e>", "<cs> my lords i ask the noble baroness to bear in mind that there are a large percentage of old-age pensioners who are entitled to supplementary benefit but decline to apply for it <e> <s> can they if faced with a very severe charge for their spectacles which they cannot afford ask for financial help from the supplementary benefit commission <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a mistake to have a committee merely to look into what is available in england without at the same time exploring what is available which may be better in other countries <e>", "<cs> my lords have the government considered making inquiries of the voluntary housing associations in this country to see how many more houses they can build at the speed with which they do build them if they had more government financial support <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say how many summonses have been issued for exceeding the speed limit on motorways <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that i find his reply to my question most unsatisfactory <e> <s> is he not also aware that his department ought to furnish him with information knowing full well that a question as to the number of summonses taken out against travellers on the motorways ought to be known and available <e>", "<cs> my lords over the years i have introduced a number of debates in your lordships house on the national health service and social security and i have come to the conclusion that it is a most depressive useless and pointless exercise <e> <s> when i listen to the government as i have done over the years when we have been discussing this particular matter there has always been a tendency to leave it to the minister and play it at low key so much so that i have got to the point that i look round to see whether my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter is there <e> <s> he is my friend and if he is there i think it means that he has been given the official responsibility of rescuing the government party in a debate of this kind <e> <s> i am sorry if it offends the minister but that is exactly how i feel that he is going to throw a lifebelt in to try to help <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to feel that i could say that of his successors <e> <s> this afternoon i want to confine my remarks to the national health service to which my colleagues and i attach considerable importance <e> <s> as i have already said we fear it has not received the enthusiasm of the government <e> <s> the recent autumn economic statement by the chancellor no doubt will have pleased noble lords opposite who quite genuinely feel that the government have done as much as they possibly can in the circumstances <e> <s> in point of fact i think that really was the tenor of the speech made by the noble baroness the minister <e> <s> what astounds me is that a minister can get up in your lordships house and say yes there are empty beds but we are dealing with more people than ever before <e> <s> why are the beds allowed to remain empty when the waiting lists are so long and when people have to wait so long to be seen and treated <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not say that the noble baroness had done so <e> <s> i said would she ask her advisers which is rather different <e> <s> she should not be so ready to take exception <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that his reply that the government have done so much by doubling so much is meaningless unless we know what the figures are <e> <s> after all twopence doubles a penny <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble and learned lord whether it is true that many if not all of us who sit on the woolsack leave little impression <e>", "<cs> my lords if the cbi has changed its opinion with regard to the job losses a month figure what is the new figure <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord the minister see whether the government would be prepared to advise local authorities to draw up a list of competent skilled and reliable builders and repairers in the locality so that when elderly people need things done they can be sure that they will be done properly <e>", "<cs> one firm a leading stockbroker last year doubled its wages bill paying an average of per person <e> <s> i should like to quote a comment in one of the newspapers which said <e>", "<cs> my lords the point that i was trying to make and probably did not make very well was that not being an ordinary national health service hospital it could not be used by national health service patients <e> <s> someone could get into it only by paying a night <e>",

health service <e> <s> i am glad we are having this debate this afternoon though to some extent it will not serve the purpose that my noble friend hoped because too many of us are taking part in too short a debate <e> <s> we should have had many more people taking part in it and it ought to have been for an unlimited time because we shall not be able to express all the salient points <e>", "<cs>

remanded in custody who are subsequently found not guilty <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister accept that there is a vast army of men women and children awaiting operations who should have been
