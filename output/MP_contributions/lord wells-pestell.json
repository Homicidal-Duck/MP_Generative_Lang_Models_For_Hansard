["<cs> my lords so it would be right to say that the house can assume that none of them has been made unemployed <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble lord the minister for his customary lucidity and clarity in explaining these statutory instruments <e> <s> if i may say so he always discloses a great deal more than one finds in the statutory instrument itself which of course is extremely important if we are to understand the purpose of the order <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the noble earl the minister whether he is satisfied that this arrangement in fact meets with the approval of the ministers sitting opposite me at present <e> <s> does not it mean that they will lose a year which did not involve the requirements which the will involve <e> <s> am i right in thinking that there may be other people in your lordships house who are in recept of a year for specific purposes which they still need who will not receive one penny under this arrangement <e>", "<cs> my lords i asked the minister whether i would be right in thinking that there are some people not necessarily ministers who at present are in receipt of the a year who will not now receive that <e> <s> am right in thinking that that is so <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the minister whether if the government are minded to give consideration to the request made by his noble friend they would bear in mind that this country is one of the highest consumers of sugar in the world <e> <s> a tremendous amount of sugar is consumed in this country and i think that there is abundant medical evidence to show that it is responsible for many conditions of ill health and obesity <e> <s> at present we are suffering from a very serious problem of dental caries mainly in children as well as in adults <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to point out to your lordships at the risk of incurring your lordships displeasure that this debate has been going on for five hours and there have been only speakers <e> <s> there is another debate just as important if i may say so in its field in which there are eight more speakers <e> <s> there are some noble lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the first thing i should like to do is to extend my personal congratulations to the noble baroness lady trumpington <e> <s> i do not know when i have enjoyed a maiden speech quite so much <e> <s> i say that very sincerely <e> <s> i have not a reputation for saying things that i do not mean <e> <s> it really was delightful and i am almost inclined to say to the manor born <e> <s> i was warned before the noble baroness came to this house not to be intimidated by her appearance <e> <s> i was told that i would find her a most delightful and charming personand those of us who have come to know her perhaps not too well in so short a time realise that we are fortunate in having her in this house <e> <s> i hope that it will not be too long before she makes a further speech and plays a full part in the work of this house <e> <s> we on this side i am sure will spend more time disagreeing with her than agreeing with her but that is the purpose of the whole thing <e>", "<cs> my lords their realism is based on the fact that they know the government have dug their toes in and are not doing anything more about it no my lords i am not going to give way to an intervention <e> <s> whenever i speak the noble baroness finds some reason to try to intervene <e> <s> i would say to the noble countess lady loudoun that if the government when they came <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the committee for intervening which i have not done before in the deliberations on the bill and for doing so on this part of the measure <e> <s> i do so because about years ago i was one of the founders of the national marriage guidance council in this country <e> <s> it is true to say that a good deal of the work done in schools in this field today is done under the aegis of the national marriage guidance council who deal with it as the noble earl rightly said as part of a permanent and enduring relationship <e> <s> it is because of that if i may be permitted to say so that i know the mind of the noble earl and the noble viscount on this matter <e> <s> we met when i was a minister in the department and discussed various matters and there was a great deal of common ground between us <e> <s> however i am wondering whether the amendment will really deal with the situation <e> <s> it says <e>", "<cs> with your lordships permission i should like to correct one thing which the noble lord lord robbins saidi think he may have misunderstood me <e> <s> i was not suggesting that this matter be deferred or delayed until there had been an agreed syllabus <e> <s> this is going to take too long <e> <s> what i did suggest was that perhaps between now and report stage it might be possible to get from the noble baroness the minister some idea of whether the department would be prepared to consider setting up a committee that would deal with the matter quickly with a view to getting a form of agreed syllabus <e> <s> if the noble baroness says it cannot be done then my noble friends could put this amendment down at report stage <e>"]
