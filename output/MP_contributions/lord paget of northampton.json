celebration party tonight and that in lawlessness nothing succeeds like success <e> <s> will he recognise that this is a very serious matter and a public challenge to law and order and the government can do something about it <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that i am a little shocked at his suggestion that just because a man owns a bus he should thereby he entitled to correct another mans faults <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor can cast his mind back to when we attended the eton and harrow match at lords after which wearing our top hats and wielding our sticks we descended upon the pitch in order to wreak vengeance on the harrovians <e> <s> the police with the utmost good humour intervened and suppressed it <e> <s> they suppressed it not only for but in spite of a -year presence they suppressed it altogether and it never occurred again <e> <s> can we look at that remarkable example of deterrence and see what was the deterrent used how it worked and try to repeat it <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that there are various questions here which have worried me since the beginning <e> <s> first when we are dealing with these people to whom the noble earl referred we are dealing with a category which should be of high integrity <e> <s> secondly there is no question of any closed shop <e> <s> these people of high integrity have freely chosen trade unionism <e> <s> thirdly is not the right to choose trade unionism part of the birthright of a democrat <e> <s> fourthly is not the sale of ones birthright whether it be for a mess of potage thirty pieces of silver or for a thousand quid somewhat inconsistent with high integrity <e> <s> indeed is it not a little odd that we should confine this service to people whom we must rate as of low integrity <e> <s> one final question who pays for it <e> <s> under what vote does corrupting the civil service fall <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that we fully appreciate that he is not in a position at the moment to answer this question but will he assure us that he will get us the information <e> <s> it is information in which we are very interested <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the question in the name of the noble earl lord attlee <e>", "<cs> my lords the only thing that i am asking for is the information that the question asks for and not the governments good intentions <e> <s> when the noble lord finds out what the position is can he let us know <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful <e>", "<cs> my lords as we have for many years now learned to live with a mutual level of total destruction what is there left to talk about <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl say what is the point of improving the employability of people for whom the government have manifestly no intention of providing employment <e>", "<cs> my lords not unless there is a job <e>", "<cs> my lords as somebody who is interested in dichotomy are there not certain difficulties in teaching history and peace studies since the two so manifestly contradict each other <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not true that unlike the soviets the south africans are most anxious to co-operate to enable their people to hear the bbc or the truth as my noble friend and leader expresses it if one can equate the two whereas the attitude of the soviet union is exactly the opposite <e>", "<cs> my lords there are two questions that i should like to put to the noble lord <e> <s> first is he aware that the englishmans right to express his dissent from the behaviour of other governments and to express that dissent by demonstrating outside those countries embassies is a very old one indeed and goes back at least to the th century and i think earlier and that to be frightened of doing that by assassins would be very wrong indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord tell us how many nuclear weapons the government think the russians would have over after they had destroyed their western neighbours as effective powers and how many would they have left over in the case of their eastern neighbours <e> <s> would it be something well over <e>", "<cs> my lords they need something less than <e>", "<cs> my lords does it really much matter whether they have times or times the number they could possibly use <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble baroness say that a lot of pain is caused by having to wait for this operation <e> <s> there was a time when it would take up to months to have the operation done under the national health service <e> <s> what is happening now with regard to that <e>", "<cs> my lords may we take it that the fact that the increased employment resulting from industrial recovery is apparently being taken up by overtime working instead of by increased general employment is a matter which the government regard with complete indifference <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord consider giving temple sowerby the unnecessary and unwanted bypass which is being wished on market harborough <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought it most apt <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the noble earl making the case that these savings are as trivial as they are offensive <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the important question is not whether we think we have a veto but whether the russians think we have a veto because if they do not think we have a veto and the matter is left void they will be <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first apologise to the noble lord lord kennet for missing his opening passage <e> <s> this debate came on rather suddenly but i am extremely sorry that i missed that <e> <s> may i also express my pleasure at speaking after the noble and learned lord lord denning <e> <s> in the old days i often spoke before him but this is my first experience of speaking after him <e> <s> may i also add how much i enjoyed his version of the law and how as on many other occasions i wished that his version of the law was the law but on this occasion i am afraid that i cannot go quite as far as agreeing with him as to what the law on this matter is <e>", "<cs> my lords in that regard may i say that i approached the office to ask how much time i had and i was told that i had minutes <e> <s> i have prepared my speech with some care based on minutes and i must apologise in advance that i may be speaking for that time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry <e> <s> i will swop straight over from there <e> <s> it is a very long subject but i must come to the final things i want to ask the government <e>", "<cs> my lords it now falls to me to thank noble lords who have spoken in this debate and in particular to thank the noble baroness who has replied to us <e> <s> i am sorry that she could not tell us that we were going to be a little more generous to the officers who suffered so grievously in what they believed to be our service <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord lord thorneycroft also on this occasion deplore the actions of the employers who appear to <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that we owe quite a few of our victories in history to having received and acted on the wrong information <e> <s> is this not another example <e> <s> should we not be grateful that we did not get the right information or we might have frustrated one of the wests few successes <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord feel that the government policy to reduce unemployment in the long term or the short term is likely to be improved by selling sealink to a flag of convenience and doing it just at this moment <e>", "<cs> my lords a question to which we are entitled to an answer here is why this action was discontinued while two argentine destroyers remained afloat <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord make it quite clear that nobody can join the common market without our consent <e> <s> that is in the treaty of rome <e> <s> will he make it clear that our consent will not be given to any new member who does not join with us in agreeing to the right of the gibraltarian people to choose their own destiny <e> <s> we have betrayed too many of our imperial friends <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that zimbabwe used to be the area in africa with the largest food exports that even during the period of sanctions it exported food in substantial quantities but that it is now suffering from famine and that the government are much to be congratulated on not encouraging the waste of short african funds to produce a state airline for which there is no commercial excuse except in order to build up the prestige of that government <e>", "<cs> my lords should it not concentrate on feeding its people <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lords statement intended to encourage or discourage those in russia beyond the iron curtain who attempted to follow the heroic example of these three and take over our consulates there or even possibly those who heroically dislike president reagan in america and propose to take over our consulates there <e> <s> does the noble lord encourage them or discourage them <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord not feel that this sort of proposal casts an unwarranted reflection on the competence of the judiciary <e> <s> can we not really assume that they are in a better position to judge the appropriate sentence when they know all the circumstances than we who know none of them <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the trouble here that we have had terms offered which could and almost certainly would have been accepted if they had not come from sources which have made themselves utterly distrusted and that the kind of answers we have been getting from the minister simply increases that distrust and makes acceptance less and less likely <e>", "<cs> my lords while the sinking of the belgrano or indeed of any other enemy ship which comes within the range of the royal navy has my entire approval i am nonetheless astonished at learning that a ship of the royal navy just loses its log <e> <s> it is an astonishing statement <e> <s> has any royal navy ship ever before lost its log <e> <s> the logs of all those that served at trafalgar are available to be seen at the admiralty and now the conqueror just loses its log <e> <s> surely we need a little more than that <e>", "<cs> my lords why do we go on with this nonsense <e> <s> since when has our royal navy required permission to sink the enemy <e> <s> what the hell do we keep a royal navy for <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl advises that those who buy british telecom will get richer <e> <s> if the buyers get richer surely the sellers get poorer <e>", "<cs> my lords if sadly we still have to go in for spending more on defence should not we spend it in northern ireland where we shall have to spend anyway <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness agree that it is a great deal easier to discover what happens to duty-free sales than it is to find out what happens to aid paid into africa <e>", "<cs> my lords are advertising spots of this type on our order paper in order <e> <s> if they are they could turn out to be quite a commercial proposition <e>", "<cs> my lords may we pray that we shall never see the day when a warship carrying the ensign of an enemy of this country can ever feel safe <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord tell us whether there is any record of private enterprise selling on the stock exchange a company at what was immediately recognised to be less than half its value <e>", "<cs> yes indeed my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords should we not be a little careful about entrusting a government with the right to dispose of what after all are our shares considering that they lost a couple of billion pounds last time <e>", "<cs> my lords i too have been fascinated by the noble lords difficulties <e> <s> one point on which perhaps i did not hear an explanation is this <e> <s> is the reference in the question to monetary police a printing mistake or is it a form of cabinet commissar to keep them in line <e>", "<cs> my lords does this not boil down to the fact that the poor old english once again are paying for the peripheral provinces <e>", "<cs> my lords surely we are treating this subject in a somewhat frivolous manner <e> <s> we as peers have privileges <e> <s> one of those privileges we have as human beings is the privilege of choice which alone out of creation has been given to man <e>", "<cs> my lords the ox lives and dies because it has no other choice <e> <s> we have a choice and that choice is given to us by the creator <e> <s> to deny us that choice is tyranny <e>", "<cs> my lords my question is this <e> <s> the case we have in mind has involved sending a woman to prison for not agreeing with us <e> <s> this is the behaviour of an inquisition and not a court of law <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> oh <e> <s> my lords so there never was an argentine war <e> <s> can the noble baroness say who will break the news to mrs thatcher <e> <s> i mean after oxford this will be a terrible shock <e> <s> she did so enjoy her little war <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness agree that the difficulty about a war that never was is that there are no logical means of stopping it <e>", "<cs> my lords at what level can an honest british traveller be relied upon to become a dishonest british traveller <e>", "<cs> my lords have we not got this a little back to front <e> <s> is not natos problem that our european allies are far too disarmed already <e>", "<cs> my lords surely in a lay state which caters for a vast variety of religions it is utterly wrong in principle to give a tax preference to one as against the other <e>", "<cs> may i ask one <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has told us that the plain and obvious meaning of the words of the general bear a different meaning if one looks at the context <e> <s> can he tell us what is the meaning in that reverse context <e>", "<cs> my lords while i see the governments problem with pensions surely in regard to the infirm and handicapped it would be possible to provide that their doctors could prescribe a tv <e> <s> it is so important in the lives of people who have nothing else to do <e> <s> it really is a matter of health and i should have thought that this is an instance where doctors might be of assistance <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl agree that the governments worthwhile investment in conflict has gone on rather long and has been rather expensive <e> <s> for the past five weeks certainly it has been clear that the parties concerned have had enough and wish to settle the dispute and it has been within the power of the prime minister to settle it on any day that she wants <e> <s> is not her intransigence getting just a little too expensive <e>", "<cs> my lords is there not a simple answer to this question <e> <s> it is that ships which comply with what we regard to be necessary for safety and manning cannot compete with ships that do not and until we put our foot down and say that ships which by our standards are unsafely equipped and unsafely manned will not be admitted to our ports then we shall not be giving our merchant navy a chance <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not perhaps a little encouraging to learn that not even the law can restrain per cent <e> <s> of the childrens enthusiasm for work <e>", "<cs> my lords if the real object of this exercise of which i fully approve is to spend money in england would we not be more harmlessly occupied in buying ourselves a chunnel <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not time that we began to reconsider our policy towards south africa in the light of the new circumstances <e> <s> we perceive an africa which is starving and a union in which the people of all races are well fed <e> <s> does that perhaps lead us to the thought that the south africans may be better acquainted with the needs of their country than we or indeed the united nations are <e>", "<cs> there is another factor <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that the soviet union and her allies are poaching the fish off namibia on a huge scale <e> <s> are we really going to refuse south africa assistance in providing weapons to protect those fisheries which are so urgently needed by the african populations <e>", "<cs> my lords it will at least teach us not to sign such silly resolutions <e>", "<cs> my lords did the noble baroness say that there had already been an eccentric correspondence with the noble lord lord gladwyn on this subject or did i mishear her <e>", "<cs> oh extensive <e> <s> i thought she said eccentric it sounded much more realistic <e> <s> when the noble baroness replied she said the government could not vary their position <e> <s> apparently she was then talking as the question indicated about <e>", "<cs> my lords surely there should be a little revision here <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind her majestys governments security record in this field do they think it particularly likely that they will receive such an invitation <e>", "<cs> my lords have not the recent events in south africa brought home even to my noble friend the kind of problem with which the south african government are faced in seeking racial peace the digging up of infant children and the burning of their bodies for no better reason than that their parents are suspected of having favoured racial peace and co-operation as well as the point that to deal with that kind of savagery which seems to have the approval of bishop tutu and his friends is not an easy problem <e> <s> south africa has been a loyal ally to us in two wars and now is the time to show who our friends are <e>", "<cs> i find the speech of the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter astonishing in introducing the thalidomide question here <e> <s> thalidomide was an artificial drug insufficiently tested by a swiss firm which without any regard to our medical authorities people exercised their democratic right to use with disastrous results <e> <s> it seems to me just about the worst argument that you could possibly put up on this issue <e> <s> we are talking about the exact opposite <e> <s> i should like to congratulate the noble lord lord winstanley on speaking the truth <e> <s> i have now been in parliament for nearly <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord permit me to say just one thing <e> <s> would he be in favour of allowing people to have first thalidomide and secondly pot if they chose to vote for it <e>", "<cs> my lords might it not be desirable to postpone this statement until after albania has had her next revolution <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lords reluctance to answer this question caused in part at least by the progressive absence of the blue ensign from the oceans <e> <s> they are getting fewer and fewer <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords when are the government going to wake up to the fact that the united nations plan was never practical and has been dead for years <e> <s> are they aware that south africa has carried and subsidised the namibian budget by over a third and that is the sole reason why alone in black africa namibia is not starving and has had no famine <e> <s> is the minister further aware that since those proposals came south africa with her own army and at her own expense has fought a highly successful war to protect namibia from communist invasion in the north

pay for the united nations proposal <e> <s> south africa has been putting up something like billion a year <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that i am a little surprised by the contribution of the noble lord lord molloy since after visiting the country he signed a unanimous report to exactly the opposite effect to what he says today <e> <s> should one go on wandering about with a policy that is obviously obsolete and not try to get on with what is being done very positively in the country now <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not agree that helicopters are by far the most valuable of all weapons in guerrilla warfare <e> <s> situations involving guerrilla warfare are those which arise with the least warning <e> <s> when they do arise we always find ourselves short of helicopters <e>", "<cs> my lords since we are turning to the third world can the noble baroness say whether in the whole continent of africa with the single and honourable exception of the union of south africa there is a single government that assumes any responsibility of any sort for assisting the homeless <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness give us any indication of what the waiting lists for guys are <e> <s> i am thinking particularly of operations such as the hip operation which relieves so many cripples of an enormous amount of pain <e> <s> is not what we are really seeing a squabble between the government and the glc which is being taken out on those who are suffering <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has said that he is seeking a solution which is acceptable to all <e> <s> is he not aware that is equivalent to saying that he proposes to take no action since solutions acceptable to all are not even available to god almighty <e>", "<cs> because he ran my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may first express my sympathy for the foreign office for having been placed in this ridiculous position apparently without consultation by the prime minister <e> <s> was it not in any case absurd to accept as one of the emissaries of peace the bishop of jerusalem who has been charged with gun-running to the assassins who has only evaded trial by successfully absconding and who is still absconding from his diocese <e>", "<cs> my lords all the press tell us that is so <e>", "<cs> then why does he not face a trial my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether your lordships have observed that throughout the session the order paper has been occupied as to about per cent <e> <s> by five members <e> <s> this leaves very little space for the questions

considerable percentage of these drugs come from afghanistan and indeed drugs seem to be afghanistans principal export have the government considered asking the soviet union for co-operation <e>", "<cs> my lords is the soviet union included in the term international <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that this noble house has learned from experience that when the noble baroness lady burton makes a statement of fact she is correct <e> <s> on this occasion she has made a statement of fact that the government overruled the industries on various occasions when the industries did not wish to raise prices <e> <s> is she correct or is the noble baroness wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness tell us how the difference between success and failure on these occasions is defined <e> <s> will it be any easier to define it at geneva than it has been at the bahamas <e> <s> and does it actually matter very much either way <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble lord speaks of the psychology of despair it prompts me to ask him two questions <e> <s> the first is who created that psychology of despair <e> <s> the second question is does he think that he improves it by cooking the figures <e>", "<cs> my lords could the noble lord tell us and this is the case of mr nelson mandela whether in our case we would be prepared to release a man who has been convicted of running arms and explosives into this country for the purpose of making war on the british government and who declares that if he is released he will proceed immediately to continue to do the same thing <e> <s> if the answer to that is yes whom would he not release <e>", "<cs> my lords since the major powers without doubt each have enough to make the world uninhabitable two times over what is the advantage of halving the number <e>", "<cs> my lords as one who has commuted on m since it was opened may i ask the noble earl whether the existence of a speed limit one way or the other has had any effect on the major pile-ups <e> <s> major pile-ups have resulted from people going too fast for the circumstances which is generally well inside the limits <e> <s> is he further aware that on the m the operative speeds in lanes at the moment in ordinary and normal conditions is about in the fast lane about to in the centre lane while the inside lane is seldom used <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the fact of our experience that south africa is the only place in africa where investment grows and enriches while a horribly high percentage of aid to the rest of africa is merely stolen and that if we were concerned with the benefit of african people we would send our aid to south africa where it helps enrichment instead of wasting it elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord agree that investment in south africa has proved a good investment <e> <s> it has increased the wealth both of the borrower and the lender <e> <s> however investment in the rest of africa has on average proved the opposite largely because of the amount that gets stolen <e> <s> on the whole loans to the advancing countries in south africa are money which is lost and does no good to anyone <e> <s> in the circumstances that we benefit africa as well as oursleves will the noble lord encourage investment in a good and reliable source <e>", "<cs> my lords that is surely a by-product <e>", "<cs> my lords is not this essentially the platonic problem who guards the guardian <e> <s> who decides whether these are proper persons and whether they are continuing to be proper persons <e> <s> is this a sort of vetting of a jurisdiction while it is in operation <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble baroness at least agree that if there really are six gentlemen who are fools enough to make such an offer that very fact demonstrates that they would be quite incompetent to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that while physical punishment has proved quite ineffective in preventing crimes of violence dope peddlers are of a very different type and that a public whipping might be most effective and cheap <e>", "<cs> my lords i was hoping that the noble baroness would be able to give my noble friend an encouraging answer and say that we will follow the example of the soviet union and have a complete ban on tests until we want to do the next one <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister

have we not much on which to congratulate the command there that ships have not sunk each other yet <e>", "<cs> i do not understand what has happened to amendment no <e> <s> which seems to have been skipped <e>", "<cs> i am sorry <e> <s> i thought the noble lord said amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i find myself in agreement with the last words of the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> of course this is a political amendment <e> <s> this amendment suggests that local authorities should have a right to impose sanctions on another country and that is an act which is plainly one of foreign policy <e> <s> equally i should go on to say that local authorities do not have available to them the information which is necessary to make worth while their views on a question of foreign policy <e> <s> they have no business doing so <e> <s> even less do i feel that it is the business of the church <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> the famines result largely from bad government and were certainly never even considered in colonial days <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> i have heard the noble lords views too often and mine have been heard too <e>", "<cs> i have just been talking about apartheid which has achieved the three main duties of government in africa where all other forms of african government have failed <e>", "<cs> i support it certainly <e> <s> i would rather have the best available government than no government at all which is what the anarchists are looking for <e> <s> that is the terrorists objective <e> <s> it would mean appalling chaos if the terrorists won in this field <e>", "<cs> the question in this debate is a very simple one shall local authorities be authorised to impose sanctions on south africa <e>", "<cs> that concerns what is happening in south africa <e> <s> of course what i am saying is in order <e> <s> there are lots of other people who are interested in this matter <e>", "<cs> we can look at the facts in detail <e> <s> however i am glad that that activity is repudiated <e>", "<cs> zimbabwe has had three famines to deal with and has come to us and asked for help <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not a question of whether there should be a pier <e> <s> why must it be such a damned ugly one <e> <s> in this case we have the advantage that the site has been drawn and painted by one of the greatest artists of all time monet <e> <s> could we not get the monet pictures of this lovely site sketch in the pier and see what it looks like <e> <s> could we not then sketch in something else and see whether we can get something which would look better <e> <s> we have a great basis to work on and we should not rush <e>", "<cs> my lords ever since donor cards came in i have carried one <e> <s> i have said that any organ of mine is available for anyone who can use it <e> <s> i am now years of age <e> <s> my organs have had a roughish life <e> <s> i have had years of gout <e> <s> i have a certain sneaking sympathy for anyone who has an organ to offer

time <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl permit me <e> <s> what is the position when we catch them abroad <e> <s> when terrorists are operating abroad we have to go and find them <e>", "<cs> my lords having been thrown out of the middle east first by the israelis and then by the egyptians should it not be our preferred policy to stay at home and mind our own business <e>", "<cs> my lords have we not a somewhat unbalanced picture here <e> <s> is it not a fact that the russians have just committed a lieutenant-general shaganovich with a full divisional staff to take charge of the soviet aggressive operations against an angolan army <e> <s> is the minister aware that that force together with cubans under the command of a member of their politburo was heavily defeated by angolans supported by south african artillery on the lomba river <e> <s> they were driven back to cuilo cuanavale where they are at present in difficulties and besieged <e> <s> there is every prospect of their being kicked out of the country <e> <s> is this not a matter of common cause and the first effective african resistance to communist occupation for us to express our gratitude <e>", "<cs> finally <e>", "<cs> my lords i have one more question to ask <e> <s> will the minster convey to the south africans that there are people in england who still remember with gratitude the soldiers who twice in our lifetime came to our aid when we were in trouble <e>", "<cs> my lords if we need uranium why the blazes should we not import it from namibia <e> <s> namibia is a very small country which almost alone in africa has the advantage of being well-governed and not starving <e> <s> why should we not assist her by importing one of her very few exports <e>", "<cs> my lords i find this a rather curious debate because of the degree of naivety with which a world which is unknown to the participants in the debate is being described <e> <s> the situation is so utterly unlike that when one gets over there <e> <s> this conflict is represented as a great national uprising of a people trying to get their own country back <e> <s> curiously enough palestine is a country that has belonged to a great many people <e> <s> the only people to whom it has never belonged at any point is this levantine arab is a false name for it population <e> <s> that population has never been there except upon the basis of being in somebody elses country <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that right through history styles of architecture have had their popularity and their unpopularity and then perhaps their popularity again <e> <s> does he agree that if one eliminates all the unpopular ones at the time when they are unpopular there is no chance of their returning to popularity because there are no buildings left <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord feel that the people of this country are capable of choosing their own entertainments and paying for them <e> <s> in northamptonshire people have far more fun from the pytchley hunt than they do from the film industry and the government do not subscribe a penny to them <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that historical experience almost everywhere tells us that once one starts strengthening the law against opinions one starts strengthening the law against the people who hold those opinions and from there the step to burning heretics is not far <e> <s> is he also aware that our laws against blasphemy are a parcel of obsolescent nonsense which requires junking and that the sooner those laws are junked the better <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that the truth of the matter is that this was an excellent letter which represented her majestys governments policy <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble viscount tell us whether the masters at our great schools are qualified and who qualifies them <e> <s> in my day the general impression was that they were appointed by the headmaster and i never heard of any qualification being necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether noble lords received a circular this morning describing a system sponsored by plessey which appears to be most appropriate <e> <s> the company erects beacons all over the the country <e> <s> you get into your car and tune into the beacon at which point it takes charge and directs you to the point where you have indicated you want to go <e> <s> it may be on the other side of london <e> <s> you are instructed to turn right or to turn left until you reach your destination <e> <s> can anything so perfect work <e>", "<cs> my lords if i understood the minister aright the object of the exercise is to rescue the poultry industry from the jam which it has got us into <e> <s> why do we have to be so gentle about it <e> <s> we should not be the broad givers we are the injured party <e> <s> we find that the eggs which were sold to us were poisoned eggs <e> <s> that has been going on for a long time <e> <s> what is going to be done about us <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that our ex-colonies have made a sufficient mess of things on their own without being introduced to privatisation to enable them to make a still bigger mess <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the noble lord aware that the story of the rising sun is vastly older than christianity and that it is getting on very well without any christian assistance <e>", "<cs> my lords have we not reached the point in which actions in tort for personal injuries are obsolete <e> <s> should we not have a system in which people who are injured or crippled through no fault of their own can claim upon the state with the state being responsible for that <e> <s> in view of the increases which we are seeing i believe that that may be a good deal cheaper for the taxpayer and for everybody else <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to express my agreement with the noble lord on the decision not to bring the security council into this <e> <s> if one did one would merely be signalling as one always does on these occasions when dealing with a lawless society an indication to them that there is no punch coming <e> <s> the united nations has not got a punch and we should simply indicate by taking the matter to the security council that we did not have one either <e> <s> i am very glad that that is left out <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister assure us that none of these funds will be devoted to buying a mediaeval map of no artistic value whatever and whose information could equally and much more cheaply be confined to an appropriate photograph <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that these islands of ours have produced statistically the healthiest population that this world has ever seen <e> <s> it is a population that has lived on the abundant water supply that flows under the fields of our islands and which is discovered and made useful by water diviners of whom i happen to be one <e> <s> is the minister going to allow europe to jump in and interfere with this wonderful and traditional supply to our islands <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may speak as a member of the rather newly deaf may i ask the noble viscount whether he is aware that lip-reading is extraordinarily difficult and requires a good deal of help <e> <s> i do not think that people who try to interpret with their hands would have much of a run <e>", "<cs> my lords surely that is not surprising information <e> <s> did we have to wait for the american chiefs of staff to tell us that <e> <s> did not our chiefs of staff and those of nato tell us over years ago that the positions that we had taken up in europe would be totally untenable for more than a week in the event of war <e> <s> have not we been sitting happily in that bluff position ever since <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that the present administration in namibia has done rather well in the difficult process of getting out from under resolution <e> <s> that resolution must rank among the most idiotic efforts ever put forward by the united nations <e> <s> as a result of antics under resolution the united nations blue beret in namibia has much the same effect as a red muleta in a bullring <e>", "<cs> my lords as a disabled driver i declare an interest in this matter <e> <s> i wish to express my great gratitude for the extraordinary kindness i receive in that capacity <e> <s> can we have some explanation as to what a disabled driver is and which people should give such a driver consideration and in what terms <e>", "<cs> my lords i can think of many things that one might do with concentrated uranium fuel but how does one codify it <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not true that on the rare occasions when we have not had inflation the population has had falling prices and misery <e> <s> does the noble lord agree that the only time we have been happy is when we have had a comfortable and reasonably high rate of inflation upon which depends the prosperity of our industries and the happiness of our people <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as one can see a policy here whenever anything seems to be doing well the government appear to want to stop it <e> <s> when at last unemployment begins to drop they shove up interest rates to stop it dropping <e> <s> when we have a lovely summer they discover a hole in the atmosphere and say that they must stop that too <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the truth of the matter is that trident was always a non-starter and is now definitely a non-runner <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for some voice trouble but i shall try to be very short as some compensation <e> <s> at the beginning of his speech the noble lord lord trefgarne said that it is our efforts which for years have guarded our security <e> <s> does he really believe that <e> <s> do his fellow ministers really believe it <e> <s> will he not pay any tribute to dame fortune <e> <s> have we not been wonderfully lucky <e>", "<cs> my lords i said i would be brief and brief i have been <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord tell us how many ceasefires there have been in lebanon so far <e> <s> is looking for another one not a bit futile <e> <s> is it not the position that lebanon is subject to invasion from syria and that she can be rescued only by somebody who is in a position to beat syria and that is israel <e> <s> does the noble lord agree that if we give full support to israel to deal with the situation from her position on the heights that could work <e>", "<cs> my lords is not untold misery a bit much <e> <s> is this not simply a little case of silly legislation producing silly results <e>", "<cs> my lords now that the weather has so improved will the noble earl include in his advice a note saying that the risk is well worth taking <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell me whether i am committing an offence if my speedometer stops working while i am driving my car but i continue to drive <e> <s> if i am committing an offence can we have a definition of it <e> <s> can the minister also tell me if i am not committing an offence how one can protect the speedometer <e>", "<cs> my lords since we all have to die of something does it much matter of what <e>", "<cs> my lords surely our trouble here is not too few laws but far too many <e> <s> when we introduced what are substantially methods to control trade through elected public bodies at nato we were very naive indeed if we did not all know that that was a procedure which was going to involve wholesale fraud <e> <s> these public international efforts to control trade always do <e> <s> is it not quite obvious that the right method is to try to get fewer laws not more because we cannot administer the ones that we have <e>", "<cs> my lords are we not faced with a major crisis of confidence as a result of the emergence of wholesale corruption in the european community <e> <s> in dealing with such crime can anything be less appropriate than another social inquiry <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether your lordships are aware that we are talking of the middle east which is the most ancient area of
