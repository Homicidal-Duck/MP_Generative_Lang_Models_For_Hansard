["<cs> my lords would the noble viscount not prefer to do rather better than the previous government have done and improve upon the performance to which he has just objected <e> <s> might i make life easier for him <e> <s> it is obviously very difficult for him to give these estimates of a wide-ranging nature but since he is dealing out yet another heavy blow at the construction industry albeit an indirect one could he tell us what is the employment effect on construction which must be easier to do than tell us the whole story <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not terribly sure what dangers were to be found by the noble lord lord reay arising from scotland over the last five years <e> <s> i have found the scottish scene over these years extremely interesting and in the recent election the scots certainly behaved with a great deal more care and percipience than the english <e> <s> but that is by the way <e> <s> in many respects the matters of conservation and the rational use of energy as the report calls it are the keys to our energy problems <e> <s> as the select committee report itself says in paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl leaves that point may i point out to him that he had better distinguish between the severn barrage which is tidal and research into wave power which is an altogether different thing <e>", "<cs> my lords in reply to lord harris of greenwich i think the noble lord admitted that these particular cuts would be damaging <e>", "<cs> my lords having admitted that these cuts will be damaging would the noble lord then explain to us why he is making them <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to speak as a member of the finniston committee and like the noble lord lord baker i am a member of the institution of civil engineers so therefore i may be thought to have some interest in whatever comes out of what the government decides to do after reading the committees report <e> <s> i must begin by adding to the congratulations which have been offered to the two noble lords who have made their maiden speeches today <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble viscount would allow me to say that i am by nature a compromiser <e> <s> the only trouble is that sometimes the other fellows will not compromise enough <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble viscount any comment on the notion that there is a different relationship between the institution of civil engineers and its industry and the relationship between some of the other institutions and their industries and does he draw any conclusion from that <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to speak in this matter with a great deal of diffidence and a certain amount of confusion <e> <s> my confusion arises from the fact that it seems to me that if we are inclinded to make changes in any way in the structure of society these changes ought to lead to improvement or at any rate they ought to be believed to be likely to lead to improvement <e> <s> i do not have any strong feeling about lob as it is affectionately known or whether it would be better under private enterprise or public enterprise but i should like to be told by the minister just why he thinks improvement would arise from the proposition he puts before us <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the noble lord lord renton is correct in his assertion that all of this procedure is within the rules of parliament though i am not quite sure that his lengthy quotations of <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make only one very brief point which relates to the manner in which we do our business in this house <e> <s> i had no intention of taking part in the debate although i am interested in the subject and might have been interested to hear what was said about it but i do not really think it is quite good enough for an announcement merely to be made to us that some piece of business will not be proceeded with <e> <s> i think that when a case of that sort is presented to us an explanation should be given to us at the time when the announcement is made <e> <s> the explanation should not have to be drawn out of the minister piecemeal as it is being done tonight <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble viscount would give way for a moment <e> <s> is he not just over-egging the pudding a little <e> <s> could he tell us why all the advantages he has adumbrated arise from private rather than public ownership <e> <s> it is not as easy as that is it <e>", "<cs> why should it not become clear now <e>", "<cs> why not at this time <e>", "<cs> the noble viscount mentioned a time-lag <e> <s> will he tell us what the time-lag is <e>", "<cs> yes but we are not interested in other countries we are interested in our own country <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down i wonder whether he is undertaking to bring in a change in the bill at report stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i join with those in all parts of the house who were impressed with the presentation by the noble earl lord gowrie of the case for the bill <e> <s> he was able to show that the bill was sensible in parts and so indeed it is <e> <s> he also demonstrated that there was a certain measure of public support for it and no doubt that is true <e> <s> but neither of those things means that the bill will work if it becomes an act <e> <s> the noble lord lord carr of hadley showed that he was slightly irked by some of the unkind things that had been said about his measure the act and i would say to him and perhaps bring the smile back to his face that some parts of that act were sensible too and many parts of it were popular <e> <s> even so i doubt that he would claim that that act had worked spectacularly well <e> <s> it may have worked a little but it was not a wonder in all its works <e>", "<cs> that is a long way from where we are today my lords and i am not so sure that we should be too strongly guided in all things by what the house of commons does some of the time perhaps <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl tell us whether the comment from the scottish development agency was made before or after his government changed the chairman <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the noble earls encouragement <e>", "<cs> i am willing to yield to the criticism of the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter as to the drafting of the amendment which i am sure is perfectly right <e> <s> i do not think it is quite as feeble as the minister intimated just a moment ago i believe it is a little sturdier than he seemed to make out <e> <s> however i am rather inclined to agree with my noble friend lord wynne-jones when he expressed some doubts as to whether professional people should be in a special relationship within trade unions <e> <s> i quite see that that is a very real difficulty and having been myself a member of a trade union for many years i quite understand the problem <e> <s> clearly it would be better if the problem were dealt with within the rules of the union <e> <s> some unions do deal with it but by no means all of them do <e> <s> some realise the position and deal with it precisely indeed the clause has been taken from a union rule book more or less though not entirely intact <e>", "<cs> i had not intended to speak but i was provoked by the noble lord opposite who described this as a trivial matter <e> <s> i do not think that it is <e> <s> i speak as an employer who has had the experience of sacking a recalcitrant and unruly member of staff who was so recalcitrant and unruly as to take me to the tribunal <e> <s> he did not do badly as it happened <e> <s> but the point is that as an employer i was totally outraged by the fact that the onus of proof was upon me and at that point i diverged slightly from my front bench colleagues <e> <s> i felt this very keenly until i thought about what we are talking about i thought about my commercial convenience as an employer and his livelihood <e> <s> at that point the scales fell from my eyes and it became quite clear that important as my commercial convenience was and indeed crucial as it still is it was not as important to me as that mans livelihood was to him <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down it might be possible to dispose of this debate in something like minutes <e> <s> i do not know whether that would change his mind in any way <e>", "<cs> my lords it may well be that we should go on and will endeavour to do that <e> <s> i will begin again by saying that this is a very modest amendment and it covers ground which we dealt with in the committee stage and during the second reading debate <e> <s> it covers the principle at any rate but it covers it in a much narrower way than we did in our earlier debates <e> <s> the amendment deals with the dilemma which is most serious in a closed shop situation of the conflict of loyalties which a professional man may feel as to his obligations towards his professional institution and to his trade union where he belongs to one <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not anxious to find myself in the kind of deep water about which the noble lord lord houghton warned us <e> <s> in view of the speech of the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor earlier and of the assurances just given by the noble earl i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am particularly interested in the turn which this short debate has now taken <e> <s> in answer to my noble friend lord shinwell when he asked how many jobs would be lost and if it were right that perhaps would go the minister made a reply which related not to the precise question but to the savings in management costs and i think i am right in saying that she thought there would be a per cent <e> <s> saving in these <e> <s> i may be wrong but it strikes me that part of the saving in management costs presumably relates to the reduction in manpower and <e>", "<cs> i do not want to spend too much time on this matter but it occurs to me that buying a house under the bill after the very short period of three years will attract a substantial reduction in the cost a third if i have read the bill correctly <e> <s> that suggests a possibility to me following on the remarks of the noble lord lord ross of marnock earlier when he spoke of people qualifying in various parts of the country and they buying a house in another part of the country <e> <s> it opens up the possibility of a market in second homes in some of the coastal towns of scotland where there is a very large programme of public housing and where local authority houses are relatively easy to obtain <e> <s> it would not be impossible to qualify let us say under the conditions of the bill in england or elsewhere in scotland or even if i read the bill correctly in northern ireland and then to find a council house in a coastal region of scotland buy it at a very substantial discount after a very short period and then set up in the second home market <e> <s> i am perfectly sure that that is not the governments intention <e> <s> it may well be that they have thought of that and have safeguarded themselves against that particular abuse <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl leaves that point will he recall that i was less interested in what he calls an unjustifiable profit those words were his not mine and that i was really drawing attention to the possibilities of acquiring at an advantageous price a second holiday home <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mackie of benshie drew attention to differences between different parts of scotland and he instanced prices in fort william on the one hand and aberdeen on the other and certainly house values are very different in those places because the demand is different <e> <s> houses are at a premium in aberdeen and it seems somewhat divisive to propose a situation in which council house tenants in aberdeen i mention that city only by way of example and not to pillory it in any way should receive such an advantage when their fellow citizens who are not in council houses have to buy their houses on the open market and the difference in value between aberdeen council houses and property on the open market might be considerable <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> i should like to revert for a moment to the question which i raised and which the noble earl replied to about the machinery of valuation <e> <s> as i understand the bill the initial valuation is done by experts as if the house was in an open market and <e>", "<cs> i hestitate to intervene at this moment but it strikes me that very little justification has been made for the extreme length of this list <e> <s> it consists of some very worthy people and <e>", "<cs> i have no great notion of sheriffs since i seldom meet them except in the movies but i do recall that a little earlier this afternoon while we were discussing amendments put forward by my noble friend lord ross in part ii of schedule paragraph <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to detain the committee but i wonder whether the noble earl would reconsider what he has just said <e> <s> he seemed to me to be saying that paragraph was merely guidance as to what might be reasonable <e> <s> guidance is something which should be taken into account in deciding whether something was reasonable or unreasonable but is that not exactly the proposition which my noble friend argued in relation to schedule namely following the words included in his amendment he was giving guidance as to what would be special <e> <s> if it was wrong in schedule to give guidance as to what was special how does it become right in schedule to give guidance as to what is reasonable <e> <s> i do not wish to go on about this too long but i am not as yet convinced <e>", "<cs> my lords in regard to structural defects in buildings can the noble lord tell us which structural defects he had in mind which are necessary in addition to excessive loading to bring a building down <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be brief <e> <s> i hope that the government will accede to my noble friends request and accept this amendment <e> <s> i expect that when they reply the government will say that they are dealing with a <e>", "<cs> my lords it really would not be the end of the world if the secretary of state were to be obliged to satisfy the courts or in other words public opinion at its best <e> <s> i think that the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter was perfectly correct when he described this as a very simple issue and a very simple issue it is <e> <s> however i do not think it is the simple issue which he described <e> <s> the noble lord described an extremely interesting simple issue but not quite the one we are dealing with here <e> <s> the one we are dealing with here is what clause says <e> <s> my noble friend on the front bench lord mishcon went into that at great length <e> <s> i shall go into it at much shorter length as befits a back-bencher on the extreme back-bench here <e>", "<cs> the noble lord ought to be <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord whom i promoted in error but deservedly sits down would he explain to me as an open-minded rebellious back-bencher how it comes about that he actually needs the words which he proposes to leave out when in <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to lengthen this particular part of the discussion but i should like first to acquit the minister of any discourtesy to the house at all <e> <s> i think that he has shown the greatest willingness to take part in the debates as regards this measure and any others with which he has been concerned in the period in which i have known him <e> <s> i do not think that there is any question of the situation being otherwise <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be very brief indeed <e> <s> i should like to support my noble friend lord ross of marnock in this respect and to remind the government of one word only and that word is tact <e> <s> it is the only word that matters here <e> <s> over a number of years we had differences of opinion between england and scotland over the method of devolution <e> <s> some at least <e>", "<cs> i do indeed my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not like this kind of debate at all <e> <s> in the past i have not been used to third reading debates which deal with a large number of amendments it does not happen in another place but it does happen here <e> <s> in its nature a third reading debate is fairly general so it stands to reason that debates on amendments on third reading are likely to be fairly general as well so i do not think that the complaint was terribly well founded <e> <s> but the thing i really do not like about this kind of complaint is that it arose at the end of my noble friends speech which i found an extremely interesting one <e> <s> if it turns out that my noble friend or any other member of the house is in breach of the standing orders or any of the customs of the house surely the time to challenge him is when he is in breach <e> <s> he should be interrupted then and not at the end of his speech <e> <s> to <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join the noble baroness lady seear in congratulating my noble friend lord scanlon for placing this motion on the order paper and for moving it in the way he did and also for making in his speech the initiative that he did <e> <s> next i should like to make two apologies one to the house in general in that due to a longstanding engagement i shall be obliged to leave almost immediately which will appear rude and indeed will be rude but is not intended to be so <e> <s> i am obliged to address a meeting of civil engineers in essex this evening on among other things how the house of lords works <e> <s> i shall explain to them that it is one of the assemblies wherein subjects of this nature and of this importance although they are political in their content can none the less be discussed in a fairly nonpartisan atmosphere <e> <s> we know that they are political and we quite understand the politics of them but we can still debate them in a less heated way than happens elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister rightly drew attention to national parks and such places <e> <s> will he bear in mind that most development is not there and that most development of the kind to which this question refers occurs in the streets and the cities <e> <s> is it not important that the matter my noble friend raised be borne in mind there as well as in the national parks and elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords i am a little surprised to be here <e> <s> my appearance is due to the unavoidable absence of the noble lord lord ross of marnock the most noted and leading scotsman in the house at any rate on this side <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble earl for his explanation of the order even though at first sight it appears to be taking money off scotsmen the day after the anniversary of burns birth but that over-eggs the pudding <e> <s> this is a minor measure far from being the most important of the session but it is a marginally useful piece of tidying up <e> <s> if it will do only a small amount of good at any rate we can agree that it will probably do no harm <e> <s> the opposition have no objection to the order <e> <s> as the noble earl said it arises from a review which the last government set up three or so years ago and i think he said that the local authorities do not object to the order either <e>", "<cs> it will probably be my last <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not intended to speak in this debate and therefore did not put down my name but i have been attracted by the discussion on clause largely due to my having been a member of the finniston committee <e> <s> i am therefore anxious about the fate of our recommendations <e> <s> since i did not put down my name to speak i shall detain the house for the shortest possible time i can manage and shall ask the noble earl only two questions <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down can he answer my question about whether or not we shall be able to see any revisions to the draft charter which are agreed in the course of the next week or so <e>", "<cs> i should begin by declaring an interest in this matter as a member of the institution of civil engineers which is one of the chartered engineering institutions involved in the discussions relating to clause and as a one-time member of the finniston committee from whose recommendations the entire matter arises <e> <s> the first point to which i shall address my remarks is whether amendment no <e> <s> is relevant to the purposes of the bill and i believe it is for two reasons <e> <s> the first is that clause indicates the kind of body to which the government will guarantee loans at some later stage and lists the objectives of that body the main one in my view being the first one that is listed <e> <s> the second reason why my amendment is relevant is that clause refers to a royal charter and my amendment does so as well <e>", "<cs> i do not in fact intend to press my amendment <e> <s> i am reluctant however to withdraw it immediately in case by so doing inadvertently i prevent others from speaking in reply to later amendments <e> <s> i assure the committee that i shall certainly do so in the fullness of time but first may i make one or two comments <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support lord hintons amendment <e> <s> i do so for entirely different reasons from those which he has just outlined and to which he referred in earlier debates on the bill <e> <s> first i should like to thank the noble earl lord gowrie for sending me a copy of the letter to which the noble lord lord hinton referred <e> <s> the letter attempted to remove the fears which lord hinton had expressed fears which it must be well known to the house by now are fairly widespread throughout the engineering profession <e>", "<cs> my lords i should prefer to move it separately <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl concludes may i with the leave of the house put this to him <e> <s> the minister said i was wrong in my understanding of the provision <e> <s> my understanding is this that in order to qualify for the government guarantee the new council has to satisfy two conditions and it has to satisfy both of them <e> <s> one is that it is a royal charter and we are all clear about that <e> <s> the other is that its members are for the time being appointed by the secretary of state <e> <s> but we do know from other things which the minister has said and from his speech just now that the period of appointment by the secretary of state is limited to three years <e> <s> that must mean to me that the period of the guarantee is also limited to three years <e> <s> i see the noble earl shakes his head <e> <s> that must relate to the words he used one way or another <e> <s> if he could explain what in this connection one way or another means perhaps he could satisfy me <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl lord gowrie drew attention to what is undeniably the weakness of my amendment namely that by removing the governments power in relation to the proposed engineering council it removes powers which relate to a number of other even more desirable bodies <e> <s> that is sometimes a weakness but it is a weakness which amply illustrates the fact that the engineering council should not have been dealt with in this way <e> <s> it should not have been lumped in beside other bodies or other items in a general industrial bill <e> <s> but it has been and i quite realise that were we to proceed to leave out clause we should do damage in areas where we do not wish damage to be done <e> <s> for that reason i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that many of us in all parts of the house would react much in the same way as he has done namely towards greater severity <e> <s> but will he reflect that in most countries of the world where there are fiercer police there are also fiercer riots and which is the chicken and which is the egg it is often hard to tell <e> <s> let him dwell on that with some care <e> <s> further does the noble lord understand that many of us would be a great deal happier if there were some indication that the government intend to concentrate a good deal more strongly than appears to be the case at first sight on the underlying reasons for these very regrettable and dismaying disturbances and that this is nothing to do with plastic bullets or water cannon <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add briefly to the congratulations which have been offered from all sides of the house to the government on this change in their attitude <e> <s> i do so because since the earlier debates during the committee stage i have been approached by many civil engineers and by the institution of civil engineers voicing the worries which many members of that profession have felt <e> <s> as noble lords know traditionally civil engineers have worked abroad in a wide range of capacities and sometimes for very nearly the whole of their working lives <e> <s> they felt that the bill as originally drafted afforded certain dangers to their children <e> <s> it seems to me that the amendment which has now been moved and which i hope the house will agree to removes those fears <e>", "<cs> i should like to take up the point raised by my noble friend lord ross when he referred to student unions <e> <s> i recall that a number of years ago when i was younger and more athletic than i <e>", "<cs> i should like to take up the point about bad law which was raised by my noble friend lady phillips <e> <s> i recall a year or more ago while we were debating in this house the bill that became the employment act moving amendments to exclude a certain class of person from the provisions of that particular bill <e> <s> i was assured during the course of the debate by no less an authority than the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor that it was very bad law to list inclusions and exclusions in the way i was proposing to do <e> <s> in the face of that high authority i withdrew my amendments <e> <s> i am beginning to wonder whether the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor was right or whether i was right on that occasion because the legislation before us contains exactly what he was then suggesting was wrong <e> <s> i shall be interested to see how the committee deals with this clause and i daresay that if we ever get employment bills coming before us again i will put in the same amendments as i did before armed with the assurance that what was then thought to be bad law has now become good law <e>", "<cs> very briefly may i say that although i was admonished for my absence at one stage i have been here for some of the time <e> <s> i was wondering for my own guidance whether in any future amendment which i may bring forward on later bills i should include some such phrase as without prejudice to the generality and whether i shall then be able to overcome the objections of the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor <e>", "<cs> noble lords may recall that not very long ago the noble earl the minister offered to give me certain hypothetical advice of a legal nature for a fee <e> <s> i should be perfectly willing to listen to that advice though i am not sure that i should be too keen on the fee <e> <s> let us consider another hypothetical case <e> <s> let us suppose that instead of offering legal advice for a fee the noble earl offered to wash my windows for a fee or if not he the neighbour of the noble earl lord selkirk who goes in for that kind of thing <e> <s> in the first place would the man offering legal advice for a fee be thought to be in trade in some sense as a lawyer or employed as a lawyer <e> <s> he may be i am not sure <e> <s> but if so would it be different <e> <s> and how would it differ if instead of offering legal advice for a fee he offered window cleaning for a fee <e> <s> i ask the question in perplexity and for no other reason <e>", "<cs> i am very sympathetic to the noble earl the minister in his desire to protect us from burglaries and things of that kind <e> <s> i would go a long way with him in the arguments he has used in defence of his clause but i am not wholly convinced that he answered my objections wholly satisfactorily <e> <s> i can see that carrying on the trade of implies some kind of continuity and that it might therefore be reasonably licensable but i am not sure that being employed as has quite the same sense of continuity about it <e> <s> we can perhaps get past the neighbour who cleans windows once for a fee <e> <s> he would be being employed in a sense but it would be absurd if he had to be licensed to do it <e> <s> cleaning windows is the kind of thing that schoolboys are quite likely to do during the easter holidays lasting for a fortnight <e> <s> there is an element of continuity there but they are not necessarily being employed although they will certainly want a fee <e> <s> i am not talking here of bob-a-job or anything of that charitable nature but about young fellows trying to turn an honest penny for their own profit <e> <s> are we seriously to suggest that schoolboys working at cleaning windows during the easter holidays or during the longer summer holidays will require a licence in order to carry out this very sensible service to the public <e> <s> is there not room here for some exclusions to the generality which we have allowed in an earlier debate <e>", "<cs> i have one very brief question to ask <e> <s> i say right away that i sympathise entirely with the intention of this clause but i am wondering whether it refers to a public place or to a private one <e> <s> i can imagine circumstances in which these activities could be done in a private place if for example someone left the lavatory door open that might conceivably cause annoyance to someone perhaps to other members of the family <e> <s> however i should have thought that a fine might be overdoing it rather <e> <s> i am wondering whether this clause really is as far-reaching as i imagine it to be or if it is intended to be more circumscribed than i think <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that i have to ask whether the noble lord thinks it is a good idea to make the clause quite as far-reaching as that and to include private places as well as public ones <e>", "<cs> is nuisance the same as causing annoyance <e>", "<cs> i said is nuisance in this context the same as causing annoyance <e> <s> it does not seem so to me at first sight but it may be that the minister is right <e>", "<cs> may i pick up one point from the comments of my noble friend lord ross <e> <s> as i <e>", "<cs> i have been thinking about this part of the bill in relation to the discussion which we had last week on an earlier part of the bill when we worried a great deal about the licensing of window cleaners <e> <s> i know that the two cases are not exactly the same but the arguments put forward by the noble earl lord selkirk in support of the licensing of window cleaners rested in part on the notion that window cleaners were not always trustworthy though they frequently are and that they had to be licensed for that purpose <e> <s> so he was presenting the licensing argument then in terms of the protection of householders <e> <s> yet here we have a clause which if i understand it rightly permits people not only to look in windows but actually to enter premises where they might not be wanted and without the consent of the householders <e> <s> these two ideas in one bill do not seem to me to cohere together very well <e>", "<cs> we had a discussion a little earlier this afternoon on the rights of owners to enter common property in order to put pipes and so forth through them <e> <s> i am wondering whether there is any similarity between that situation and the one covered by this bill where so far as i can see the owners of common property have certain rights of entry in order to put lighting arrangements through other peoples homes <e> <s> am i right in thinking that <e> <s> is there a similarity between lighting installations and piping installations <e> <s> if there is should we not in this clause make similar arrangements to those which we appeared to be considering under the previous clause <e>", "<cs> it does not i am sorry to say <e> <s> i quite understand that the construction difficulties are different this is obviously so <e> <s> but we are not worried about the construction we are worried about the entry into other peoples property <e> <s> the entry in order to do piping work is through the door with or without consent and the entry to do lighting installation work is also through the door with or without consent <e> <s> we agreed that it were better in the earlier case if consent were obtained as long as it was not unnecessarily withheld and i am inclined to think that a somewhat similar notion should prevail in this case <e> <s> at any rate i would like to hear the noble earl say that he will think about it before i am satisfied <e>", "<cs> it is extremely likely that i am not comparing like with like but in that situation i am in the same boat as the noble earl <e> <s> if he casts his mind back to clause the point we were arguing about was not whether it was consent to entry or consent to the work <e> <s> the clause did not have consent to anything at all and we were suggesting that consent should be included in the clause <e> <s> the consent which exercised some of the noble lords who spoke earlier and certainly exercised me was the matter of consent to entry <e> <s> the entry is the same in this case as it was in that <e> <s> i do not want to make too heavy weather of this but i certainly do not want the noble earl to make too much light of it either <e>", "<cs> let me merely say that the discussion we had earlier concerned itself as much with rights of entry as with the work but i am not eager to carry the point any further <e>", "<cs> your lordships may recall the debate we had a week ago on clause which concerned certain aspects of nuisance <e> <s> what struck me about it was that the items concerned in clause could conceivably be described as litter <e> <s> in relation to that noble animal the domestic cat it is provided with a thing called a litter box <e> <s> my point is a very simple one <e> <s> i notice that under clause the fine is whereas under this clause the fine is <e> <s> if the offender is charged under clause he is in danger of paying whereas if his activity is described as littering rather than causing a nuisance he may conceivably be fined <e> <s> is this reasonable or have i mistaken it again <e>", "<cs> there is one very small point about otherwise deposits which concerns me <e> <s> i believe we know that the noble earl does not have in mind people putting things in dustbins and things of that sort <e> <s> that is not what he means <e> <s> but we do know that it is quite a common domestic occurrence to have to get rid of things which are too big for the dustbin <e> <s> i am thinking of things like washing machines and items of that type which have lived their life and become useless <e> <s> it is quite common to dump them temporarily

highway that i hope it commemorates the person not merely the place <e>", "<cs> i should like to draw one very small point to the attention of my noble friend lord ross who has just moved this amendment of which i entirely approve <e> <s> what strikes me is that when he put down the amendment he fixed the fine at <e> <s> i have no idea whether or not that is the right sum but what occurs to me is that earlier this afternoon in the course of a previous debate the noble earl drew our attention to the fact that there was certain legislation somewhere in the offing under consideration or being drafted at any rate somewhere in the course of which some fines at least were being reconsidered and an amendment which he had put down earlier was based on whatever scales of fines are foreseen in that prospective legislation <e>", "<cs> the minister was quite right to remind us of the various ways in which waste can be suitably and even profitably disposed of by local authorities <e> <s> it

wrong <e> <s> it would not be the first time <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a brief question seeking only clarification <e> <s> this new addition to the clause allows the local authority presumably not to charge the full amount which they have spent in carrying out repairs in order to rescue some building if i understand it <e> <s> i dare say that that is a sensible provision <e> <s> but i should

considerable difficulty here <e> <s> i am anxious to assist both the government and my noble friend lord ross <e> <s> if we change the wording from neither land or buildings to neither land or

statues and does not refer to monuments at all or am i confused once again <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the noble lady lady saltoun in the general nature of her amendment though i take the point which has just been made and i wonder if the wording should really be legible to pedestrians rather than legible by pedestrians <e> <s> at any rate i think that the noble ladys intention is indisputably correct and should be supported by the government <e> <s> they should bring in at a later stage some form of words which makes her point <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to

noble friend sits down i hope he realises that i meant any place owned by a local authority should be used by all parties <e> <s> i agree entirely with him and with my noble friend lord underhill that it would be quite wrong for those places to be used by one party alone but i cannot see why it would be terribly wrong if everybody had access to it and if all were represented there <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not hitherto been familiar with the roads and bridges scotland act <e> <s> in fact i did not know there was one <e> <s> in the course of the two exchanges we have had one point that

amendment <e> <s> quite apart from its own individual and particular merits the amendment illustrates one of the problems which the government have presented us on a variety of occasions during the

<e> <s> i cannot help feeling that this is a matter of some urgency <e> <s> no one is inclined to throw stones at a minister who is not able to reply it is perfectly understandable in a matter of this nature and no one would do such a thing <e> <s> but it seems to me that it is a quite legitimate question that my noble friend asked and i believe that it deserves a somewhat quicker answer than would be obtained by means of putting down a question for written answer even though that would be forthcoming within a few days <e>", "<cs> my lords when this bill was first proposed some while ago and then published i must say that i was strongly attracted to it and felt that i ought to support it in general terms at least if not in total detail <e> <s> since then two impediments have been put in the way of my support <e> <s> the first is the attitude of the secretary of state for employment in the course of the committee stage and report stage of the bill that passed through another place <e> <s> mr tebbit as i read him seemed to me to reassure his colleagues in another place that the bill was not intended to destroy or to bankrupt the trade unions <e> <s> that reassurance was welcome but it was fairly plain from the tone of mr tebbits remarks that he rather wished that it was and that seemed to me to stand in the way of my keen support for the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords what other courses apart from witchcraft are included in this <e>", "<cs> my lords as the minister has put on record those courses which he thinks are frivolous will he also put on record the rest <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister having referred to the capability of the m to deal with the problem of through traffic in london may i ask whether he is aware that through traffic is only a tiny proportion of londons traffic much less than per cent <e> <s> the problem is not that of through traffic but of inner london traffic <e> <s> does he agree that a more sensible proposition would be to revive the long-abandoned idea of the motorway box which would be much more sensible than the m <e>", "<cs> may i ask the minister to note my lords that the <e>", "<cs> the noble earl the minister showed some uncertainty in his initial reply and he quite rightly and properly admitted it and he gave an undertaking to go away and look into the law and to write to the noble viscount lord thurso <e> <s> all of that is very proper and admirable <e> <s> however i am wondering whether the minister would consider going a little further and adding to his undertaking to write to the noble viscount another undertaking that if he finds something wrong in the spirit of the amendment if not in its precise wording he will put something down himself which would meet any points which he discovers in his examination of the situation <e>", "<cs> i do not intend to follow the line of argument pursued by my noble friend lord houghton of sowerby although it will be no great suprise to those who know me that i agree very much with many of the things that he has said <e> <s> i want to revert and to revert very briefly to the arguments <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the noble lord because of his experience is correct <e> <s> nevertheless it remains true that the amount of work for the public accounts committee is such that they will always give greater or lesser weight to each of a variety of items which comes before them <e> <s> it might be that this area of expenditure is something upon which they might feel inclined to spend a lot of time but i am sure that the noble lord will agree with me that it may not be so <e> <s> there may be from year to year a wide variety of items of government expenditure which the public accounts committee would find much more important and pressing and would deal with rather than this kind of thing <e> <s> i think that the argument which the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter raised was a strong one but i do not think it was strong enough and because it was not strong enough i think the committee should pay very careful attention to these amendments before us now <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble earl would say a word or two about the very mild and friendly altercation to which he referred <e> <s> the matter between us centred upon certain irregularities about which the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter was very worried <e> <s> what worries us are the regularities not the irregularities <e> <s> it is quite clear that while the public accounts committee might possibly though not certainly deal with the irregularities it would not be empowered to deal with the regularities <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl sits down may i press him a little further on this report as courteously as possible <e> <s> we are not dealing with the most earth-shaking matter but it has some importance if only because the government in dealing with this measure in another place have used the report in evidence <e> <s> possibly the government have used it incompetently possibly inadvertently and certainly they have done so confusingly <e> <s> but the government have most certainly used the report in the course of the debate <e> <s> there is a kind of convention although i am not sure how firm it is that when a document is referred to in parliament the whole document should be produced in some way <e>", "<cs> i hesitate to dissent from the views expressed by my noble friend lord scanlon but i must do so <e> <s> in doing so i realise that i am dissenting from the views of someone whose passionate commitment to the trade union movement has been demonstrated time and time again over a long period and it is a commitment which is quite admirable and i say that in total sincerity <e> <s> i myself have been a member of a trade union for most of my life and i now earn my living in part negotiating with the unions the nuj and natsopa <e> <s> i find in dealing with these unions a picture which is not quite the same as the picture which my noble friend lord scanlon sees <e> <s> i understand how he sees it and the passion with which he sees it but it does not look quite the same from each side of the table or from the ends of the table or in the mind of an independent observer <e>", "<cs> i shall be brief <e> <s> this is the kind of legislation which arouses strong passions <e> <s> that is clear from speeches we have heard this afternoon and that of my noble friend lord hatch who has just sat down <e> <s> the reason why it arouses these passions is because ideologies are involved <e> <s> it is because of these passions and the ideologies that i would ask the government to pause even at this late date and consider <e>", "<cs> i rise to support this amendment in a condition of some excitement because noble lords will notice that my name appears on the marshalled list in addition to those of my noble friends on the front bench <e> <s> a situation in which i and my front bench on this bill achieve almost complete identity of view is sufficiently unique not to pass unremarked <e>", "<cs> i did not <e>", "<cs> i hope i can have the leave of the committee to speak to my amendment no <e> <s> a which i think appears on page of the marshalled list <e> <s> in order to isolate this particular question i put my proposal in the form of a new clause rather than an amendment to clause as the noble earl lord halsbury has done <e> <s> my proposals differ from his although i support in general terms the proposition he made in that i do not limit the qualification that i require to people obliged by statute <e> <s> i see the problem wider than that if only because one of the examples which the noble earl mentioned was the number of civil engineers under statutory duties in relation to reservoirs under the and acts <e> <s> it is true that they come under the proposition which he outlined but that is a very small number of civil engineers <e> <s> the act applies only to those on reservoir panels and at a guess i would say that the number would not be <e>", "<cs> i look forward to the letter with eager anticipation <e> <s> it will be some letter <e> <s> i have had letters like this before and they have been very convincing <e> <s> this one will need to be even more convincing than the others <e> <s> we were talking earlier about how best to disseminate the matter in the famous letter <e> <s> perhaps we could get round it by the minister answering a written question in which case it will go into <e>", "<cs> the noble viscount is entirely correct <e> <s> that had slipped my memory <e> <s> my point nevertheless remains though the noble viscount rightly puts the blame on to the cbi rather than shouldering it himself <e> <s> what the minister did say was that in matters of this kind he wanted there to be the least disturbance to existing good relations <e> <s> i would agree with him and i am sure that he will not try to blame that on the cbi <e> <s> in a case of this nature there is the least possible disturbance if matters are left as they are <e>", "<cs> not really <e> <s> i was speaking to this amendment and amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> that is correct <e>", "<cs> would it

in my name are as the noble earl was about to say the trigger amendments <e> <s> the point about these amendments is that they allow employees where there is dissatisfaction and where they see a need to demand a ballot rather than have the ballot in the hands of either the employers or the trade unions <e> <s> this seems to me to be an elementary matter of natural justice to which we should turn our attention <e>", "<cs> the noble earl as always understands my amendment better than i do <e> <s> i hesitate to allow the word weakening <e>", "<cs> i am drawn really to the support of my noble friend lord wedderburn in this case because i happen to be just such a figurehead <e> <s> i am the president of a small but relatively unimportant union unimportant to the world as a whole but of

occasion and add dignity to a number of functions which i do to the best of my ability <e> <s> i also give them lectures from time to time when i give them what i consider to be wisdom and they are kind enough to listen to me politely even to the end but i am not in any way engaged in their deliberations <e>", "<cs> it seems to be more a case of the union having something to fear due to my ineptitude <e>", "<cs> my lords before we come to a conclusion on this matter i rise and will speak with the maximum of brevity because unfortunately i arrived too late to hear my noble friend lord ross of marnock a source of deep regret to me <e> <s> unfortunately since this is the report stage he will not be able to rise and repeat his speech for my benefit <e> <s> i shall look at it in <e>", "<cs> i mean old in the sense of long-standing and long may he continue to stand in all respects <e> <s> what i have in mind is that usage now has got past the stage where the government or a local

circles is to regard the government or the committee or the local government or anything of that sort as a body and therefore singular <e> <s> whether we are talking about one or talking about the

points raised earlier this afternoon by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter and the noble lord lord mottistone to agree with what they said to add your lordships will be happy to learn very little to it and to dissent ever so mildly from their conclusion <e> <s> they were quite correct when they said that many firms already do these things and the firm with which the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter is connected is a notable example of that and do not need encouragement <e> <s> they were also correct in saying that there were a number of firms that would do these things in a phantom or spurious way giving lip service to the idea <e> <s> however there is a great group of firms in between <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to say relatively little on this occasion because we have discussed this matter on at least half a dozen occasions in my experience and many more in the experience which goes back much longer of the noble earl lord halsbury <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to delay the house either <e> <s> i was in some doubt as to whether this amendment was the right place but since the fair wages clause has been raised by my noble friend i think that we should perhaps deal with it now <e>", "<cs> my lords it might be irrelevant to the noble lord but it is not in fact <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the chief whips point <e> <s> i said in opening my speech that i was in some doubt <e> <s> my doubt was related to the relevance of the issue <e> <s> i took the naive view that since my noble friend had been heard that gave some relevance to the subject <e> <s> clearly my naivity went beyond that of other noble lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i will be relevant because it is certainly my intention so to be <e> <s> noble lords with long memories will recall the second reading of this bill when i dissented from my noble friends on their attitude towards clause <e> <s> in the course of my speech then i said that especially as far as the construction industry was concerned which is the industry i know much better than most others the union-only labour sub-contractors were not necessary because they were protected by the fair wages resolution of i believe which appears in most public contracts and which is a very great safeguard for the terms and conditions for which my noble friend lord underhill has very properly asked in the first paragraph of this amendment which i support entirely <e>", "<cs> my lords if it turns out that the fair wages resolution is to be rescinded all the objections i have to my noble friends attitude are removed because the fair wages resolution makes their attitude towards the union-only labour contracts unnecessary <e> <s> if the fair wages resolution goes their position becomes necessary and supportable <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord leaves this point may i say that if in following my noble friend lord davies i made the same mistake as he about the recess i obviously withdraw because the noble and learned lord is clearly correct i cannot remember whether i did or not <e> <s> the noble and learned lord is quite right about this being a resolution of the house of commons and therefore within the province of the other place to deal with though we were i think if not misled at least lulled by the replies given to my noble friend lord oram earlier in the discussions on this bill <e> <s> let me ask the noble and learned lord one question what would happen if we have a fair wages resolution of the house of lords after the house of commons has gone so far as to rescind their fair wages

ask whether he agrees that there seems to be relatively slow progress in regard to the matter that we are discussing especially when we reflect that during the war a hundred or so years ago isambard

of her speech alone should make the government think very carefully about the nature of her amendment <e> <s> i would go a little further than that and i speak here from a basis of almost abysmal ignorance and as one who seeks information rather than anything else <e> <s> i understood that at one point in her remarks the noble baroness lady faithfull suggested that the present arrangements led

non-controversial way in his maiden speech the more so since i am engaged in the publication of a small number of magazines <e> <s> three at least are directly concerned with the water industry and

practising civil engineer using the products of the ordnance survey if not every other day then at least every other month <e> <s> his was a notable contribution to our debate and i look forward to many more similar contributions from him <e> <s> i am quite sure that the more my noble friend enters this chamber and the more he contributes to it the more he will realise how valuable a chamber this is and how much it should be kept a part of our constitution <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord bellwin because he has said what i was about to say i did hear his explanation earlier and now i have heard it again and it has not changed in the interim <e>", "<cs> my lords my fears would have been assuaged if those had been they <e> <s> it never crossed my mind that the english based department would fail to deal properly with scotland i said nothing like that or if i did i was more than usually <e>", "<cs> i think that most members of the committee would welcome the sympathetic response of the noble lord the minister to my noble friends amendment and would be sympathetic to the request of the noble lord the minister that the amendments should be withdrawn <e> <s> yet i hesitate just for a moment if only because when the noble lord the minister said that these matters were under consideration he did not make any attempt to tell us when there might be a result coming from those deliberations <e> <s> if the noble lord the minister could say that the government will present a fairly firm view or at any rate as firm a view as seems reasonable before we reach the end of the proceedings on the bill in this house i would then be very strong in my support for the idea of withdrawing the amendments <e> <s> but in the absence of any hint as to a time-scale from the government i rather think that my noble friend should resist these blandishments <e> <s> i see that the minister is beaming in his normal kindly way <e> <s> it may be that he is about to say that

the noble lord the minister attractive as it may be <e> <s> he has an almost bottomless well of sympathy as we have noticed but he does not really give very much away <e> <s> i think that there is one question which my noble <e>", "<cs> i want to do something which it never occurred to me in my wildest dreams i would ever dare to do and that is to disagree with both of my noble friends lord irving of dartford and lord shinwell at the same time and to go further than that and agree with the noble lord lord nugent of guildford who is clearly in the right in this instance <e> <s> i hope that whether or not he is successful in carrying the amendment today he certainly carries the idea and persuades the government whom we know to be open-minded in all matters <e>", "<cs> would it not be more valuable to deal with a matter such as this piecemeal and get it right a bit at a time rather than try something more all-embracing and get the whole thing wrong at once <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may say just a very brief word here <e> <s> as a civil engineer who has spent many years trying to build things i have always found conservationists and people of that sort extremely tiresome <e> <s> i say that with the kindest thought for my colleague my noble friend lord melchett <e> <s> but tiresome or not they have a right to be heard and i grant them that entirely <e>", "<cs> not at all <e>", "<cs> as someone who has spent years of his life in consulting engineering before degenerating into being a publisher of a civil engineering magazine i am basking in the warm praise which the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran has bestowed on my profession every bit of it absolutely deserved <e> <s> british consulting engineers are quite clearly beyond peradventure the best in the world and the noble lord has indicated just why we should regard them as such <e>", "<cs> surely it is not a grey area at all <e> <s> those in private consulting know where they are and those in the public sector know where they are <e> <s> sometimes they work in harmony and that is delightful but there is nothing grey about it <e>", "<cs> i am not at all convinced by the concluding remarks of the noble lord although i am grateful for them because he dealt precisely with what i said <e> <s> i am a little alarmed by the fact that in the case of a good deal of legislation employment legislation is a very good example we have legislation and codes of practice which are not binding <e> <s> the same applies in this case <e> <s> the legislation is binding and the guidelines are not although the guidelines are useful and agreeable <e> <s> i wonder whether it would be terrible if we had to amend legislation from time to time <e> <s> if we were amending legislation in the way the noble lord the minister seems to have in mind that is changing the guidelines when they were incorporated in legislation we should be dealing with one-clause bills <e> <s> they would take up about a minute of the time of this house <e> <s> even if we were hard-pressed we could surely spare a minute for bills of that kind <e> <s> it would be neither impossible nor difficult <e> <s> indeed the

years in the whips office in another place i do not really think the noble lord lord skelmersdale should teach his grandmother how to suck eggs as it were <e>", "<cs> so i noticed and i really think that will not do <e> <s> if the government wish to find a minute here or there they certainly can <e> <s> the noble lord is quite right a minute on the order paper sometimes turns into ten or twenty <e> <s> but we do sit something like eight months out of the year and out of the other four months they could find the half-hour needed for this <e> <s> that is not really the point <e> <s> the point lay in my reference to the reassurance to a particularly useful body of people big earners of overseas incomes almost the biggest <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord will write to me as well <e> <s> i am a terrible reader <e>", "<cs> is there any way in which we can get them out of the mind of the secretary of state and into the guidelines <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord the minister not have mercy on us and just give an undertaking to take all this away and take a very quiet restrained look at it and in so far as there is strength in the representations of my noble friend lord melchett and others he will accede to these and in so far as what they think is strength is weakness he will reject them <e> <s> i think that that might help us quite a hit <e>", "<cs> i am rather glad i stayed <e> <s> did i understand the minister to say that he intended to implement the act <e> <s> if so can he tell me when <e> <s> i know it is churlish to look a gift horse in any part of its anatomy but let me say this if the minister does in fact intend to implement the act and to implement it within a reasonable time it would satisfy me entirely if he were to write to me <e> <s> i would make sure that his letter was published in <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment should not be withdrawn just yet because the whole thing hinges on the secretary of state <e> <s> whoever he may be in the future and it may well be the distant future he might or might not have opinions and those opinions might or might not be agreeable to the house <e> <s> certainly they might not be agreeable to this side of the house <e> <s> as my noble friend on the front bench said it is not sufficient for us that this part of the bill should go through merely on the future say-so of the secretary of state <e> <s> we should have something from the government front bench which reassures us on how the secretary of state whoever he might be is likely to react in the future to the comments of my noble friend on the front bench which were i thought very restrained <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not common for public bodies to go out to tender on a list whether they are a local authority or any other kind of public body for any purpose <e> <s> they know as a rule what they want when they go to tender and they also know the kind of people who are likely to be able to meet their requirements so they go out on a list <e> <s> that is by no means unusual unique or new <e> <s> i take the point of the noble lord the minister that from time to time occasions occur when the requirements are themselves new <e> <s> for such occasions the list would include such others as were able to meet the requirements of the authority <e> <s> therefore there is no difficulty in my noble friends amendment at all <e> <s> i think that the government should accept it <e> <s> there is no difficulty of any kind whatsoever <e>", "<cs> my lords we have come to recognise that one of the characteristic features of the noble lord lord bellwin is his flexibility <e> <s> this has been mentioned in this chamber more than once <e> <s> he <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble earl lord onslow will be relieved of the dilemma into which he has got himself that is in deciding whether to press the amendment by the government agreeing to accept his proposal <e> <s> my noble friend lord melchett was correct to draw attention to the parallel between the amendment and the characteristics underlying amendment no <e> <s> which we were discussing not long ago and which dealt with land drainage <e> <s> there are similarities between the two which should commend the amendment to the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no wish to dissent from my noble friend lord melchett i would merely query whether a cost-benefit appraisal was really what was wanted in this sort of situation <e> <s> cost-benefit is a very useful tool and has been used for many years in dealing with projects of many kinds but is it not quite likely that in circumstances such as he has in mind it would be at least as and probably more useful to adopt the technique of environmental impact assessment rather than cost-benefit appraisal <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join the noble viscount lord montgomery of alamein in supporting the amendment moved by lord lloyd of kilgerran <e> <s> i thank the government for their attitude in general on this matter <e> <s> there is no need for me to add to the various comments made about the overseas successes of british consulting engineers <e> <s> they are widely known <e>

move amendment no <e> <s> and carry it <e> <s> if he carries it he can then move amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> if he does not he cannot <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down could he clarify a

like very briefly to support my noble friend lord beswick in the very sober comments he had just made <e> <s> a few moments ago before he spoke the house became a little over-excited <e> <s> both my noble and old friend lord molloy and my old friend and adversary on the other side of the house the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter spent a number of years in another place where they learned bad habits and just for a moment their bad habits came uppermost this afternoon <e> <s> i think that on reflection both of them perhaps overreacted to the situation <e> <s> my noble friend lord bruce moved a very sober and a very sensible amendment and it was very adequately supported by my noble friend lord beswick <e> <s> i thought that in the exchanges between my noble friend lord molloy and the noble lord opposite lord boyd-carpenter the treasury bench got a little over-excited too <e> <s> i think that the treasury bench should relax and soberly reflect on what lord bruce actually said and what lord beswick actually said rather than the excitement that was generated by my noble colleagues on both sides and consider whether or not there is more in this amendment than they at first thought <e> <s> i think in that way the reputation of this house would be greatly enhanced and the furtherance of this bill would be greatly improved <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to raise again the arguments that were deployed during the passage of the act <e> <s> the noble lord lord rochester from the liberal front bench mentioned some of these arguments in passing <e> <s> however i do not believe that i should allow some of the comments of my noble friend lord mccarthy to pass entirely unremarked <e> <s> i should like to say first something that i hope will please my noble friend <e> <s> i believe that the general tone of the code of practice is unduly hostile towards trade unions and trade unionism <e> <s> i am fairly sure that it is not intended to be so <e> <s> however on my reading of it it is more hostile than it should be <e>", "<cs> my lords there are one or two passages not in the explanatory part of the code of practice but in the later part where the government say that trade unions ought to do this that or the other <e> <s> it may well be that the governments opinion is entirely correct and that unions ought to behave as the government desire <e> <s> but there is little point in putting that in a code of practice <e> <s> it is as my noble friend rightly says no more than a matter of opinion <e> <s> if the government really desire that unions should behave in that way it should be in the law and not in what is after all very little more than the kind of opinion that we might get and enjoy from the government front bench <e>", "<cs> my lords unlike quite a number of earlier speakers i was not a member of the select committee <e> <s> i think i can therefore congratulate the committee on its work and on the excellence and expertness of the report without any hint of self-congratulation <e> <s> the report owed a great deal i think to the expertise of the members of the committee to the work of its clerk and also in no small measure to the support given by its expert adviser professor isaac of newcastle university <e> <s> i think that we should place that on record here as well as in the report itself <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that we thought anything was impossible in those days but perhaps it was not quite the thing to go for <e> <s> i think that the future of estuarine water might lie not in the thames but in obvious places which have been examined before like the wash morecambe bay and perhaps the solway <e> <s> i certainly hope that these possibilities for water supply will not be forgotten or overlooked <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i am sorry to press him and he has <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend decides whether she will press this amendment <e>", "<cs> i do not think she has quite yet <e> <s> before she decides will she reflect that i for one will not support her <e> <s> i am sure that that will move her deeply <e> <s> in my view there is quite enough meddling with the building industry in this clause already <e> <s> we should not add any more <e>", "<cs> i have the strongest sympathy with the institution of <e>", "<cs> i have the strongest sympathy with the institution of electronic and radio engineers and many other organisations have been omitted <e> <s> however as the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran has quite clearly said there is no problem <e> <s> this amendment simply says that in consultations which presumably will take place because i find it inconceivable that the government would blunder on into this appointment without consulting anybody two bodies should be included <e> <s> there is nothing in the amendment or elsewhere to prevent the government from casting their net as wide as they feel so inclined just so long as they do not exclude these two organisations <e> <s> the amendment is extremely sensible <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i think there is one brief answer to the noble lord whose views we listen to often with respect <e> <s> while it is true that the government have been inundated with advice for the last several years there is little sign that they pay any attention to it <e> <s> our belief is that if the advisory body is statutory much additional weight will be given to its advice and the government may possibly be inclined to pay more attention to it than they otherwise would <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount aware that this year has been designated as women in engineering year by the equal opportunities commission of which my noble friend lady lockwood was for some time the most distinguished chairman <e> <s> can the noble viscount inform the house whether or not any european community fund will be available to promote the very <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble earl the minister is unaware of the inspectors report to which my noble friend lord stallard referred a moment or two ago will he give an undertaking to find out about it and to write to my noble friend with the result of his inquiries <e>", "<cs> i think that the committee will by now be well on the way to agreeing that my noble friend lord carmichael must be right or if not totally right very nearly right <e> <s> in parenthesis let me say that it is a very good thing to see him here <e> <s> he brings a great deal of expertise and distinction from another place to our deliberations <e>", "<cs> i have a great deal of sympathy for the speech of the minister of state <e> <s> there was a good deal of sense in it but it might be worth his while to reconsider the words -shall and may <e> <s> the noble earl lord selkirk made a quite strong point <e> <s> a great deal of what the minister of state said about the input of the bta is correct <e> <s> we know about that and we accept it <e> <s> but the minister said something which is quite important <e> <s> though he felt it was right that the bta should be consulted he emphasised more than once that the consent of the bta was not necessary <e> <s> it was a key point in his reply <e> <s> it was a weakness in a very sound reply a weakness in the following way <e> <s> if the consent of the bta were necessary the word shall would not only make sense but would be necessary <e> <s> but since the consent of the bta is not necessary the word shall is unnecessary and the word may as proposed by the noble earl lord selkirk makes a great deal more sense <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord the minister accept that not many of us in this house see him as being detached from this problem debonair or otherwise <e> <s> at the same time will he realise that his statement seemed to chide the management and the workforce and they alone for what must be a very complex problem and that that hardly seems sufficient in the circumstances <e> <s> will he turn his mind to some of the matters which my noble friend lord bruce of donington raised <e> <s> what part if any was played in these regrettable delays by design changes or other alterations in the requirements of the customer <e> <s> what part has been played by delays or difficulties in supply by sub-contractors whether nominated as my noble friend said or otherwise <e> <s> what part if any has been played by the difficulties among suppliers <e> <s> all of these matters are important and all of them contribute towards something which the noble lord the minister has quite rightly recognised as a tragedy <e> <s> however in view of the difficulties of the situation will he recognise that while he says that he blames nobody he does seem to blame two groups when they may not be entirely to blame <e>", "<cs> is not the noble lord the minister being uncharacteristically harsh in accusing the noble and learned lord lord wilson of langside of trying to negate the provisions of subsection <e> <s> i do not think that that is his intention although the amendment is longer than the kind of amendments i am used to nor as i heard his speech was he intending so much to negate the provisions as to make the provisions more reasonable <e> <s> is that not a reasonable thing for a reasonable man like the minister to want to do <e>", "<cs> i have a horrible feeling that the noble and learned lord is about to withdraw his amendment <e> <s> does he wish to withdraw before the minister has had a chance to reply to these probing points put to him <e>", "<cs> may i make a brief point <e> <s> i do not wish to delay the minister but surely it will be within his experience as it is within the experience of most of us that the law of this country is dotted with provisions which make statements of a fairly straight forward and clear kind which are followed by the words except in so far as <e> <s> then follows the exception <e> <s> thus the notion of making an exception to a provision in the law is by no means new <e> <s> it is hallowed by time immemorial <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> i am beginning to have serious doubts about the noble lord the minister who <e> <s> i am sad to say i do not know very well since he entered another place after i left it and has only recently joined us here <e> <s> but i am watching with great interest <e> <s> he has the reputation of being a reasonable man and we have all been telling ourselves all afternoon that he is a reasonable man <e> <s> i do not know how reasonable he is but he has not done anything remotely reasonable today as yet <e> <s> he has not conceded anything <e> <s> he has not said that he will think again <e> <s> he has been nice he has been agreeable but he has not given us a thing <e> <s> i see sitting beside him his noble friend lord lyell whom we have often enjoyed on these scottish occasions <e> <s> he treats us fairly roughly and endearingly but every once in a while he says i will think over what you have said <e> <s> he does not mean that but at least he says from time to time that he will consider in thinking over what we have said whether or not some sense can be made out of our arguments and the principles that we have tried to argue here <e> <s> i have not seen the minister do that today <e> <s> i am not as yet convinced that he is an unreasonable man because i see that he has a very reasonable face and i feel sure that in time he will convince me that he is a reasonable man but he will have to hurry if he is going to do it today because he is well behind the start-line in that particular matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin on a genial note which i hope will raise the spirits of the noble lord the minister by congratulating him once again on the action which the government took when we were discussing the water bill last year the decision to implement the reservoirs act <e> <s> i should like to follow the comment made by the noble lord lord sherfield when he asked the minister to comment on how the conversations and procedures were going in relation to that implementation <e> <s> i hope the minister will have something to say about it later <e>", "<cs> my lords surely these undertakings are not substantial at all <e> <s> the fact is that the house can debate the act but we knew that anyway <e> <s> there is nothing new in that <e>

really getting very near the bottom of the strawberry barrel <e> <s> is it not the key to the whole thing <e> <s> the question which arises is really this to what extent would these model by-laws actually be applied <e> <s> it is all very well to set up a series of model by-laws and to ask people to take them into account but to what extent does the noble lord the minister expect these by-laws actually to be applied <e> <s> if they are applied something is done if they are not applied nothing is done so where do we stand <e>", "<cs> does the noble lord the minister think they will <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend sits down would he comment on something which struck me on listening to the explanation by the noble lord lord gray of contin <e> <s> perhaps i did not understand the explanation fully but it seemed to me he was saying that this kind of tenancy was appropriate where a young person had been looking after an aged parent or something of that sort <e>", "<cs> exactly but starting from and then onwards he had been looking after an aged parent so he could be regarded as the tenant in name <e> <s> that strikes me as a quite admirable qualification for this kind of thing but i was wondering whether the bill as it stands really limits that arrangement to such a person or whether it applies to any person who has been in a council house since the age of regardless of whether or not he has been looking after an aged parent or something of that sort <e>", "<cs> i think i understand that <e> <s> what i was really getting at was the situation quite rightly drawn attention to by the noble lord the minister <e> <s> he was talking of people who were there for a specific humanitarian purpose and of how he thought the change in the law would be advantageous to them whereas the manner in which local authorities were now exercising their powers was not <e> <s> i agree with him about that <e> <s> what i was really asking was this <e> <s> would the new arrangements be limited to people who were doing the good things that he spoke of or would it be more widespread than that <e>", "<cs> yes i quite accept that and i quite approve of the governments intention to remove the discretion <e> <s> what i am really worrying about is the relevance of the ministers argument about children looking after aged parents <e> <s> is that in fact relevant to the argument or is it not <e> <s> if it had been relevant to the argument i would have thought that the rights would be limited to such people but as they appear not to be limited to such people i am wondering what the particular relevance of that argument is <e>", "<cs> i am a little concerned about the reply made by the noble lord lord gray of contin to the intervention of the noble lord lord mackie of benshie <e> <s> the noble lord lord mackie made a fairly firm point in general terms when he suggested that there was a very strong element of unfairness in the distinction between one kind of tied house and another in relation to the obtaining of what is quite a substantial concession in the purchase of a council house at some stage <e>", "<cs> i am strongly attracted to this amendment <e> <s> despite the proposal made by the noble lady lady saltoun i incline towards the arguments of the noble lord lord mackie of benshie in addition to those of my noble friend lord ross of marnock

wifes mother is and lives in a sheltered house in troon <e> <s> it is accommodation provided for old people and remains protected under the provisions of the act <e> <s> she cannot buy the house and therefore it will remain in the stock available for letting to old and retired people in the way that my noble friend myself and the government regard as desirable <e>", "<cs> i regret to say that i did not find the ministers original reply totally convincing <e> <s> i regret it because it seemed to me that his reply was couched in very properly sympathetic terms and he recognised and was willing to continue to recognise the special needs of certain old people <e> <s> i rejoice in that but regret that i found it did not go quite far enough to meet the point which i thought i had generally made <e> <s> i was not in fact talking about housing for old people which was adapted in any special way i see that he understands their needs perfectly well and is quite sympathetic towards them <e> <s> but quite a number of old and retired people do not actually require special needs <e> <s> they live in ordinary houses in an ordinary way <e> <s> it was houses of that nature about which i was talking not ones which had been specially adapted because the ones which are specially adapted are unlikely to be bought by anybody other than people who require the special adaptions <e> <s> i was talking about houses which were ordinary in every way but which could be bought and thereby taken out of the stock and thereby diminishing the stock <e> <s> i do not think the noble lord met that point at all <e>", "<cs> yes they come in very close together <e> <s> it was precisely to that that i was objecting <e>", "<cs> before the minister sits down may i say that i have great sympathy with what he has said <e> <s> in the course of his reply he deplored certain expenditure upon what he called a political campaign <e> <s> the minister did not say what that campaign was but it is quite possible that he was referring to the advertising campaign by the greater london council which is intended to continue that councils existence <e> <s> we may or we may not approve entirely of the greater london council <e> <s> we may all have doubts about it <e> <s> but surely that would be a justifiable expense <e> <s> if a great local authority is under open threat from the government it must be entitled to incur political expenditure of that kind <e> <s> it is not the kind of political expenditure to which the noble lord lord renton referred earlier <e> <s> if that is the kind of expenditure which the minister meant surely it is justifiable <e> <s> if it was indeed what he meant surely he was hitting a little below the belt by referring to it <e>", "<cs> the minister and i often agree about what is reasonable <e> <s> he must agree with me that to spend million or million against the threat of death must be if not reasonable not totally unreasonable <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord ross of marnock in his interesting opening remarks at the beginning of this debate said that this was a highly political bill <e> <s> coming from such an authority on political matters as he this is something which we have to listen to very carefully <e> <s> my noble friends experience of politics and politicians goes back in my recollection for at least years and probably long before

referring to the engineering construction of the runway <e> <s> i am asking whether it will be built to the same standards as the existing runway <e>", "<cs> as we have discussed trade union legislation from time to time over the last several years noble lords will have realised that i am in no way averse to passing a law in this area <e> <s> i do not object to legal restraints and restrictions upon trade unions but i should like to refer to one point which was raised by the noble lord lord campbell of alloway <e> <s> if i heard the noble lord correctly he said that if the first amendment of my noble friend lord mccarthy were to be agreed to today or even later it would undermine the intention of the bill <e> <s> i think that that was what the noble lord said <e> <s> that really prompted in my mind the question of what is the actual intention of the bill <e> <s> that is something about which we should think constantly throughout our deliberations <e>", "<cs> i rise with some embarrassment since the noble earl and several others have drawn attention to my describing the bill as a straitjacket <e> <s> my embarrassment arises because i do not remember doing so <e>

not quite a straitjacket it is really a tight bandage <e>", "<cs> yes i know <e> <s> i tended more to billiards in my day <e> <s> that was probably much more sensible and i was better at it then <e>

committee <e> <s> i refer not to his opening words when he said that the <e>", "<cs> is the noble earl offering my noble friend some kind of a concession which would induce him to withdraw the

the debate because i do not think that it has quite come to an end <e> <s> i have substantial sympathy with my noble and very old friend lord houghton <e> <s> i shall come to a for instance in a moment <e> <s> i should however like to say first that the motion to oppose clause stand part has put me in a kind of dilemma <e> <s> it is a dilemma that must be shared by most of your lordships <e>

consider opposing a totally different clause in which a substantial change has been made and a principle of voting accepted <e> <s> i voted for that principle <e> <s> i know that there are all kinds of difficulties <e> <s> i know that these difficulties have to be ironed out made sensible and made acceptable but it is the principle that i feel is important <e> <s> i voted for it <e>", "<cs> the noble lord asks why not <e> <s> the reason is that this is an extremely sensible amendment and i am perfectly sure that the government will accept it without any great debate <e>", "<cs> the noble earl the minister worries me a little when he keeps returning to points of principle <e> <s> we had a difference the other evening over a point of principle <e> <s> he may have been right or i may have been right who knows <e> <s> but on this occasion the noble earl has sought refuge in the principle of the trigger <e> <s> apparently a trigger is wrong in principle if it has people in it but is right in principle if it has only one person in it <e> <s> i am not sure that that is a point of principle <e> <s> it is a point of some strength and i go a long way with the minister in that <e> <s> i especially appreciate the remarks of the noble and learned lord lord denning concerning the individual in the context of his remarks <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the noble lord lord gray is right <e> <s> he and i normally meet here on scottish business which is somewhat different from the arcane measures with which we are dealing tonight <e> <s> let me say first of all that i have no thoughts of any kind regarding the national union of mineworkers in this house or out of it and i do not wish it to be brought into these discussions <e> <s> nor incidentally am i deeply moved by the civil service unions important though they may be <e> <s> i am by no means for the first time trying to be helpful to the government front bench <e> <s> the kind of legislation which the government are trying to put through here is the kind of legislation which almost more than any other legislation depends upon its acceptability to the people upon whom it bears <e> <s> we can pass laws until we are blue in the face about secondary picketing but it seems to happen nonetheless and regardless of these laws whereas if the laws were acceptable the consequences might not be the same <e>", "<cs> i find the noble earls attitude this evening unusually sharp <e> <s> in my experience of him he has been if not benign at least half reasonable <e> <s> i find him very sharp tonight and i wonder why <e> <s> is it perhaps that he is embarrassed <e>", "<cs> if he will listen he will find that he ought to be <e> <s> we shall perhaps find out in a moment or two <e> <s> i am giving him the benefit of the doubt <e> <s> i had hoped that he was embarrassed <e> <s> i am a little disappointed that he is not <e> <s> he is arguing here strongly in favour of measures which have peculiar side-effects <e>",

wedderburn <e> <s> when i distinguished between little and big unions i was not making much of a point except that the ones which i had particularly in mind were peculiarly innocent of any of the alleged and unproven charges of crimes which have been bandied back and forth across the floor of this house and elsewhere <e> <s> that was all i meant no more than that <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise briefly because i was mentioned by my noble friend a moment ago <e> <s> it was not my intention to threaten to bring something forward during the third reading stage <e> <s> what i was hoping was that the government would reflect upon the arguments they have heard today and will continue to hear today and which they heard at the committee stage and would bring something forward <e> <s> that would be appropriate <e> <s> it is especially apposite here because the governments principle appears to me to be based on a general view of trade unionism as a whole whether that view is right or wrong whereas these amendments which i moved earlier and which are now being moved by my noble friend lord beswick with my support are not general they are specific <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord would permit me to intervene just for a second <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord is quite right when he says that such an election would be limited in its scope <e> <s> it is quite likely that it would be in the nature of a referendum on whether the matters which were as he puts it before parliament at that time were right or wrong <e> <s> but would he be right in suggesting that such a thing would be trivia <e> <s> i would have thought that such an election if it dealt with whether or not it was right to retain the glc would be a matter of very great importance and it would be something upon which the electors as a whole could properly be asked for their opinion rather than for parliament itself to arrogate the total right to decide <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> i am <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend and long-time parliamentary colleague lord houghton of sowerby is far too sensible to be thought of as an intellectual <e> <s> because he is sensible we should pay particular attention to what he said especially about inquiring into the situation of trade unionism in this country either now or in the near future <e>

relationship with the possibility of these arrangements being reversed repealed or changed if at some time in the future the wheel of fortune should turn <e> <s> i do not think that is a sensible way of conducting this complicated matter <e> <s> what is needed is a strategy of some kind <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend withdraws the amendment would he give the noble lord the minister an opportunity to reply to the remarks made by my noble friend lord bruce of donington on that letter of july <e> <s> from my position which is slighly to one side of the front bench and the noble lords colleagues there although supporting him in this matter it seemed to me that there was a distinct difference between the impression that the minister gave to me in replying to the debate and the impression i have gathered from the letter <e> <s> the minister should be given an opportunity to clear up the cloud which hangs over my understanding of this matter before my noble friend withdraws <e>", "<cs> can the minister give us any notion of what commercial activities <e>", "<cs> if i may just say a very brief word as the noble lord will be aware i am in no way expert on this subject and consequently i am reluctant to impose my views on the committee and take up time in discussing something of which i am only marginally aware <e> <s> however i do have a lay interest in the work of the cda as my noble friend lord oram knows very well and i am sympathetic to the work they are trying to do <e>", "<cs> my lords as the house will know i am no lawyer and therefore i am fearful to tread where lawyers have been treading all day <e> <s> however this is a matter of order rather than of law <e> <s> might the problem possibly be resolved somewhat along the following lines <e> <s> a manuscript amendment to amendment no <e> <s> might be put down shortly to introduce a phrase such as notwithstanding the provisions of amendment <e> <s> it would not be in <e>", "<cs> my lords i am greatly impressed by the arguments raised by the minister except in the early part of his speech <e> <s> i am concerned not with what he said about winding-up which is a particular matter but with what he said earlier on when he was speaking in more general terms about the co-operation idea which used to be a very sound idea and an idea which was spread about throughout our industrial and professional activities a good deal more widely than it now is <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble earl is studying the reports mentioned earlier will he also study the recent reports of the federation of civil engineering contractors and the cbi both of which asked for substantially increased investment in construction <e> <s> can he tell us when his studies are likely to come to an end and when action is likely to begin <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the noble lord lord annan in investigating the kite which has apparently been flown and to join every other speaker tonight who has attempted to tread on its tail and i hope successfully <e> <s> before i go on i should like to congratulate the two maiden speakers who have spoken today <e> <s> i wish to congratulate them especially on choosing such a civilised subject to speak upon and on choosing too the civilised side of that subject <e>", "<cs> my lords i know them both well <e> <s> i ought to say something which i hope nobody will listen to they are both actually too big <e>", "<cs> my lords i sincerely hope that the noble lord is going to agree with me <e>", "<cs> i should like to reflect for a brief moment on the comments of the noble lord lord campbell of alloway <e> <s> the noble lord knows that i hold him in very high regard as a fellow ayrshireman <e> <s> he seemed to intimate that we should not have guidelines and things of that type <e> <s> i must say that temperamentally i am greatly inclined to agree with him <e> <s> on the other hand let us reflect upon how things are actually done here and in the legislative process <e>", "<cs> the fault is clearly mine but i think that that is a difference without a distinction or a distinction without a difference whichever it is <e>", "<cs> my lords the reports which are before us today do not stand by themselves <e> <s> they are linked in a chain <e> <s> that is a chain of white papers committee reports and parliamentary debates <e> <s> they were all outlined by the noble lord lord trefgarne in his opening speech earlier on today <e> <s> perhaps these reports represent the closing links of this chain which will lead to a decision <e> <s> it is a decision which i hope the government will take very soon <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the electricity boards proposals are to provide a handful of nuclear stations by the turn of the century <e> <s> in view of his remarks about keeping the options open will he give us an undertaking to do what he can to see that some at least of that handful are agrs <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree that the end of the decade is quite soon <e> <s> he mentioned this in answer to my earlier question <e> <s> would not he like to substitute end of the century <e>", "<cs> i am greatly interested in the ministers reply to my noble friend lord carmichael especially on the matter of artistic architectural and cultural things <e> <s> i happen to be a member of the party of the noble lord lord ross of marnock i mean that in the very narrowest possible sense <e> <s> i think that possibly the party was mistaken in preferring to dilute the word cultural for narrower things <e> <s> in so far as these narrower matters alluded to artistic things they were sound but they narrowed the field rather far <e>", "<cs> i should like to return to the question of this list in clause <e>", "<cs> i do not want to slash the list and make it very narrow i want to slash the list and make it very broad <e> <s> by that i mean that we should leave out the fairly large number of specific items which could be lengthened page after page to include them all <e> <s> that would be a mistake <e> <s> i think that we should slash the list by including only the general items which could then be thought of as subsuming the word which lord grimond used the specific items <e> <s> if that were done i think the committee would be satisfied and certainly the people to whom these specific items were of interest would be satisfied as well <e>", "<cs> i should like to support my noble friend lord carmichael of kelvingrove because he does something quite sensible here that is he distinguishes between special exhibitions and permanent collections <e> <s> the two things are quite distinct <e> <s> none of us objects at all to paying for special exhibitions because we know that they have had to be gathered together at special cost with travelling expenses and so on being incurred <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that this statement will be very warmly welcomed by the construction industry which has been very hard pressed for the past several years sometimes almost to the point of despair <e> <s> can he go a little further in response to the question put by my noble friend lord carmichael on when the project might be completed by giving us an informed guess about when it might be started which is probably more important at the moment <e> <s> secondly in view of my noble friends remarks about new technology and his fears about escalating costs can the minister reassure my noble friend by reminding him that the technologies involved in the fixed link are in fact extremely well understood by the construction industry and are not new at all <e> <s> if there is an escalation of costs it will not be for that reason <e>", "<cs> i should like to assure the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter that there are many noble lords on this side of the committee and in other parts of the chamber who support this amendment without being in any way interested in the powers of patronage on the other side of the river nor necessarily supporting some of what he thought was the lavish public expenditure <e> <s> i think that when the noble lord reflects on the closing parts of his speech he will realise that he has been less than generous to many of his colleagues on this side of the committee <e>", "<cs> i think that that is an important and crucial factor in the debate today <e>", "<cs> is it not the case that the example that the noble lord cites is exactly the same in relation to the electorate for local authorities <e> <s> if he follows his logic through with regard to the referen-dum he must therefore ask whether the people who live out of london and yet work in it or in the areas of other local authorities should have a vote in a local election <e> <s> this is the same thing is it not <e>", "<cs> the argument about what has happened in another place is an important one and as an old hand of the other place if i may put it that way the noble lord is well placed to speak about it <e> <s> but surely he would agree that legislation must go through both houses and although we have to bear very much in mind what has happened elsewhere elsewhere has to bear in mind what we do <e> <s> it is not enough for the noble lord to say that it has gone through another place and that therefore we must roll over and wag our tail as it were <e> <s> if the other house has not been totally correct it is up to us to pull them into place <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to take up the point that was raised a few moments ago by the noble lord lord stodart of leaston concerning the difference between england and scotland in this respect <e> <s> i ask my question with a certain amount of trepidation because although a scot i pay my rates in england <e> <s> as the noble lord the minister regards his endeavour as such a munificent affair will he try to induce his colleagues on the government front bench to apply the same rules to england as he applies to scotland <e> <s> we may then have the interesting spectacle of a similar uprising in the conservative party in england to that which we saw in perth a week or so ago <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble earl lord gowrie will not be quite as commercial as the noble lords lord harmar-nicholls and lord boyd-carpenter who spoke a moment ago <e> <s> the noble lord lord rochester rightly distinguished between two types of employees concerned in this redundancy for that is what it is those who are political appointees and for whom i myself hold no brief any more than does the noble lord lord rochester and others who are employees in the ordinary way of their profession professional men such as engineers and scientists and others who have been in local government for many years <e> <s> these people are in this instance victims of something which is quite out of their own control <e> <s> they are being made redundant just as though there had been a commercial takeover <e> <s> but there is a difference here <e> <s> this is not a commercial takeover this is a political act which the government feel it right to carry out and which the government are entitled to carry out if they have a majority to support them <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish very briefly to comment on only two remarks of the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter in his interesting earlier speech <e> <s> he said not once but i think twice that parliament in its wisdom had made certain decisions <e> <s> that is not quite right <e> <s> parliament in its wisdom has not yet decided <e> <s> one part of parliament and one part only in its wisdom has made a decision <e> <s> another place had made certain proposals in the bill which came to this house where these proposals were examined and in part amended <e> <s> the amendments went back <e> <s> they have been criticised and sometimes rejected <e> <s> we are now considering what another place has made of our proposals <e>", "<cs> certainly <e>", "<cs> my lords yes that must be true but i thought it was hardly worth mentioning today <e> <s> the part of the bill which is before us is the part upon which we have not decided <e> <s> thus the noble lords remark was inessential <e> <s> we have not decided <e> <s> parliament has not decided and parliament is now deciding <e> <s> there is no reason why we should not dissent from the other house whether we are elected or nonelected <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no idea either how my front bench is going to vote in this matter but i for one as a member of the labour party voted for this amendment the last time round and i propose to do so again <e> <s> there is a simple issue involved here and it is one which should be close to the heart of the labour party <e> <s> it was close to the heart of the labour party in this house not so long ago but we seem to have been overriden by our colleagues in another place <e> <s> they are not going to override me <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend bear in mind that any civil engineer worth his salt would certainly wish for that type of expenditure but only because it is needed <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg the noble lords pardon but is the noble lord leaving the railways at this point <e>", "<cs> i thought that the noble lord was going on to newspapers <e> <s> i beg the noble lords pardon <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise for adding my name to the list very late in the day <e> <s> i have been in scotland on urgent family business for the past days and could not be sure that i should be here at all <e> <s> i apologise to the house for that <e>", "<cs> i am a little surprised to hear the noble lords lord harmar-nicholls and lord mottistone remind us how amenable and agreeable the local authorities are since we spent a good part of last year with the government trying to abolish them for not being amenable and agreeable <e> <s> that is a most welcome change <e> <s> i should like to have seen it a year ago but it is never too late <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter has a strong point <e> <s> we should think about what he said in the latter part of his remarks <e> <s> but the museum of london covers london as a whole <e> <s> it is not concerned solely with the city it covers the entire area of london <e> <s> whether or not the amendment is correctly worded it is right or so it seems to me that the views of londoners outside the city and outside the government should be borne in mind in dealing with a matter of this sort <e> <s> this is perhaps an area where we can seek the largest and widest area of consensus and ask that the views of londoners outside the city that is in the boroughs be taken into account and also that the government should consider the arguments that have been made and come back with a proposal that is in line with the intent of my noble friend on the front bench <e> <s> if that happened the committee would i think be very satisfied <e>", "<cs> i accept the general argument about too much legislation <e> <s> i have felt this for a very long time <e> <s> it is all very interesting but most of it is unnecessary <e> <s> even among the necessary parts a good deal of it does not work terribly well <e> <s> i see that the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter looks at me with understanding because he knows about these things very well <e> <s> however legislation appears before us and we have to deal with it and try to make it work as best we can whether or not it is necessary in the ultimate <e>", "<cs> my lords i have followed the argument carefully but is my noble friend equating like with like <e> <s> there have been a number of wars since but they have tended to be between people who are not in what we might call the nuclear club <e> <s> when my noble friend talks about the threat of retaliation there was no question of that between the russians and afghans and so on <e> <s> will he turn his mind to the notion that where powers face each other with nuclear weapons they do not go to war but that where countries face each other without nuclear weapons they do <e> <s> it is a paradox and not a happy one <e> <s> will he face it <e>", "<cs> this is a highly legalistic bill and most speakers so far have been lawyers <e> <s> it is however a bill which bears heavily on the construction industry and as a civil engineer i should like to say a word or two about the effect of this amendment on that industry <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord hacking has said the amendment that we are now discussing is in a sense an alternative to my amendments amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> it may be convenient if we discuss them together <e> <s> i can then come to move my amendments later <e> <s> otherwise we shall be holding two debates that are virtually identical <e> <s> the important matter of insurance has already been mentioned <e> <s> we have to distinguish between a factor that was prominent in our earlier debates and what is the reality of the problem facing the construction industry <e>", "<cs> i should hate to fall into a basic fallacy <e> <s> but if i have done so i take some comfort in that i am joined there by the noble and learned lord lord denning <e> <s> i was greatly impressed by the reply of the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor <e> <s> i feel that once i have studied his remarks in <e>", "<cs> before the noble and learned lord sits down will he take note that in the formidable list he has read out there was only one construction industry organisation noted and we must assume that the rest were opposed <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble baroness would clear up possibly a fairly minor confusion which arises in my mind from her statement <e> <s> as your lordships will recall the statement combined two episodes one was a series of three brutal murders in the lebanon and the other was a bomb episode at heathrow <e> <s> does combining these two episodes in the one statement mean that there is any connection between them apart from the general connection of terrorism as a whole <e>", "<cs> my lords as your lordships will recall i was associated with the noble lord lord hacking in somewhat similar amendments at the committee stage of the bill <e> <s> my amendments were alternatives to his but as he said a moment ago we sought the same end ultimately <e> <s> we have now reached a compromise where we are putting forward and speaking to the same amendment <e> <s> these amendments really try to seek certainty in the application of the long stop which is a new matter for english law although as the noble lord lord hacking said a little while ago it is not unknown elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether my noble friend will say not with clarity but with less unclarity <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down will he reflect that when the amendment refers to <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble and learned lord but when he speaks about there being one law for the construction industry and another law for the rest and he mentions solicitors and others does he not recollect that the amendments i put down at committee stage were meant to include everybody but that he threw them out anyway <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support the noble lord lord broxbourne and other noble lords who have spoken in criticism of this bill as i did during its earlier stages <e> <s> noble lords will remember that we had a considerable amount of discussion on the question of the long stop and on the difficulties which arise from determining the exact date of the breach of duty upon which the long stop depends <e> <s> there was also a great deal of discussion on the uncertainty to which these problems gave rise <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend replies to the minister i should like to support him in this amendment but i wonder for an instant what he means by real terms here when he talks about the value of the expenditure <e> <s> i hope that he will not measure in this instance real terms merely in relation to the retail price index but would bear in mind such guidelines as the baxter indices of construction costs which are somewhat different from the retail price index and much more apposite to this amendment <e>", "<cs> i hope that the minister will feel able to accept this amendment which is clearly extremely sensible <e> <s> but i am not sure whether my noble friend on the front bench has gone far enough <e> <s> this is something to which we might return at a later stage in the bill <e> <s> when he says a recognised qualification the amendment might be greatly strengthened if it were to state by whom it must be recognised <e> <s> if the amendment were accepted it might be good if we added later a phrase such as recognised by the engineering council or a recognised qualification such as a city and guilds certificate or something a shade more specific than the amendment as it stands <e> <s> the principle is admirable and ought to be supported but it would be strengthened if it were later made more specific than it is <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend sits down would he reflect that my reference to the engineering council bore in mind the fact that the qualifications which they recognise depend on academic attainment on competence and on training <e> <s> i think that is exactly the kind of thing he is looking for <e>", "<cs> i do not think it was me who raised that point <e> <s> i could be thoroughly demolished on it but i think it was my noble friend on the front bench who raised it <e> <s> if i am to be demolished as a surrogate for him i am perfectly willing to suffer that fate but in fact it was not me <e> <s> i am an innocent bystander in this particular encounter between the two front benches <e>", "<cs> may i assist my noble friend at this point <e> <s> the minister spoke about paper qualifications as though they were mere things <e> <s> i think he has perhaps forgotten or overlooked for the moment and temporarily i am sure the fact that within the engineering industry qualifications are on the whole based on peer judgment which means that a person in the engineering business is judged by other engineers to be competent to do engineering <e> <s> the piece of paper merely certifies that this is so <e>", "<cs> the titanic actually sailed longer than the ark <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no great wish to look years ahead in the context of the bill <e> <s> i am sure however that my noble friend is right in saying that we should look years ahead in terms of air transport <e> <s> today we should stick to the bill <e> <s> i rise briefly to say that to my dismay i shall be obliged to vote against the amendment <e> <s> it is totally misconceived <e> <s> it is possible that stansted will be subsidised at an early stage in its life <e> <s> i do not know <e> <s> that is a matter for the airport authority <e> <s> if it is subsidised it will be subsidised by the airport authoritys money <e> <s> it will be a cross-subsidy within the revenues earned by the airport authority from the seven airports <e> <s> incidentally it is likely that prestwick airport will be subsidised as well <e> <s> i come from a good deal further north of the watford gap than my noble friend <e> <s> i know prestwick quite well <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl the minister remind his noble friend lord bruce-gardyne that it is not really agreeable to cast aspersions in however veiled a manner against one of our commissioners in brussels <e> <s> after all some of us do not like the other one either and if we were all to carry on like the noble lord where would it all end <e>", "<cs> i am dumbfounded by the noble lords reply to my noble friend <e> <s> would it help him if instead of being accused of tagging something on to clause he were accused of squeezing it in after clause <e> <s> he just pleaded guilty he took it out <e>", "<cs> i should like to support my noble friend very briefly because we are in no mood to detain the committee terribly long <e> <s> in my experience of another place which is much less than that of my noble friend by a very long way this kind of thing could not have happened <e>", "<cs> i must say that the noble lord speaks as always in emollient tones and with graciousness <e> <s> his flattery was so delightful that i willingly subside <e>", "<cs> my lords since one of the major exports of coal-fired power stations is acid rain will the government take great care before ordering too many of them <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down will he clarify what he said about industrial disputes <e> <s> we all know that industrial disputes were governed by what used to be called the golden formula in which trade unions were free from the law of tort provided that they were within the ambit of a trade dispute <e> <s> but nobody ever thought that trade unions were free from the criminal law <e> <s> this bill seems to deal with criminal rather than civil actions <e> <s> i wonder whether i understood the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to speak briefly in support of my noble friend lord morton of shuna not as a financial expert nor as a lawyer but as a journalist <e> <s> the subject of journalism was raised by him in his opening remarks <e> <s> at one point the noble lord used a word which i think is the key to my support for his amendment <e> <s> he used the word mistaken <e> <s> journalists are admirable people in many ways though they do have their shortcomings of which we are all aware <e> <s> they are capable from time to time of being mistaken and it seems to me that the clause as it stands at the moment does not allow room for honest error <e> <s> i think that that is a weakness in it <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the point that the noble and learned lord makes about journalists and i go a long way with him <e> <s> but as i understand it here a journalist may make a statement which creates a false or misleading impression and he may do it for the purpose of creating that impression <e> <s> my point was that he may try to create that impression and yet merely be wrong merely be mistaken rather than dishonest <e> <s> how then would he stand <e> <s> if he was dishonest it is right that he should be dealt with by the full rigour of the law but if he is merely wrong i think the situation is somewhat different <e>", "<cs> my lords i speak as one of those university pro-chancellors of which the noble lord lord chalfont has such a poor opinion <e> <s> in my university which is an obscure one the city university in london we have had a succession of notable speakers including i am glad to say the noble lord lord grimond and not one hair on his noble head was injured on that occasion nor has anything untoward happened to any others of our speakers <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble baroness will accept the sympathy of all sides of the house on her being obliged to bring such miserable news to us on this matter <e> <s> do the government realise that school teachers are miserably paid and that our high technological society depends upon education and teachers and the ability to attract people into the profession <e> <s> does the noble baroness realise that many members of this chamber employ secretaries and that these secretaries are paid more than we pay to the average teacher <e> <s> secretaries are important but they are less important than teachers <e> <s> is there no way in which the government can be induced to recognise that education is important that it costs money that the key to education is teachers and that teachers ought to be paid more <e>", "<cs> is it adequate to restrict this examination to the armed services <e> <s> surely the civil service comes into this as the noble lord lord grimond indicated <e> <s> then there is the question of members of another house <e> <s> would it be appropriate for scottish members of another house to have some <e>", "<cs> my lords i was a little worried by one of the remarks made by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> he thought that this amendment would undermine the authority of parliament <e> <s> we in this house and elsewhere are strong in our support for the authority of parliament but that is taking too narrow a view of parliament <e> <s> parliament exists not only for its authority but it is also a representative organisation or at least the other house is <e> <s> how representative we are i am not sure but in some way we are <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble baroness lady carnegy agree that the swiss and the californians manage to frame questions for referenda more or less every year and that there are many who vote on them pass them and agree about them <e> <s> the british could probably manage given a little help <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not delay the house for any length of time <e> <s> i wish merely to ruminate very briefly on the two points raised by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> those noble lords who have seen the noble lord in action on the front bench opposite over many years will not believe that he fears the civil service or anything else on earth <e> <s> those of us who remember him when he was a minister in various departments will know that he ruled those departments with a rod of iron <e> <s> the civil <e>", "<cs> you see what i mean my lords <e> <s> the noble lord had every intention of interrupting me <e> <s> he indicated this by saying that he did not want to do it <e> <s> i shall carry on where i left off <e>", "<cs> my lords i must come to the support of my noble friend lord ross of marnock <e> <s> surely there is a distinction here <e> <s> the noble lady lady saltoun is quite right <e> <s> we put young people down on the electoral register before they reach the age of <e> <s> however the difference and it is a serious one is that when their names are put down on the register they are claiming a right which is not quite the same thing as claiming a liability <e> <s> people can decently be asked to claim a right but i am not quite so sure that they can be decently asked to claim a liability <e> <s> it is not the same thing <e>", "<cs> my lords this is an area where the government ought to be specific <e> <s> in the first three paragraphs of that subsection they are specific <e> <s> they indicate a number of people who are entitled to inspect and examine the register and all of them seem to have a specific precise and indeed defensible reason for inspecting the register <e> <s> then the clause seems to fall to pieces <e> <s> it appears to say that another nameless nebulous body of people who might be prescribed in some particular way might then be entitled to examine the register <e> <s> i wonder why that last part is there and why paragraph d should exist at all <e> <s> in a clause which is mainly precise why should there be an imprecision introduced at the end <e> <s> i think we are entitled to a fairly detailed explanation <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down will he recognise that he has not told us anything at all <e> <s> he said that this is a contingency which it clearly is and it is a contingency to deal with certain nameless circumstances which might arise at some unspecified future time and for <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister was good enough to join us on this side of the house in respect of the last amendment <e> <s> i am inclined to join him from this side of the house in respect of this amendment <e> <s> i take that view because as i read it subsection of this clause provides that any member of the public shall be entitled to inspect the register <e> <s> that means that anybody can get his hands on the names and addresses <e> <s> what the minister is saying is okay let them have the names and addresses but let us have the money too <e> <s> it is a little sordid but not unduly so and i must say that i am on his side <e>", "<cs> my lords what has gone wrong here is that the schedule refers to parliamentary proceedings and parliamentary proceedings would of course be appropriate matters for a schedule <e> <s> however the body of the schedule does not deal solely with proceedings it deals with the secretary of states powers <e> <s> the secretary of states powers should be in the bill <e> <s> they should be clearly stated in clause and that clause should refer to schedule for the proceedings <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down will he try to get it right in the english bill <e>", "<cs> my lords now that the m motorway around london has been completed and shows evident signs of becoming saturated within the foreseeable future will the government consider reviving the proposal for an inner ring motorway around london <e> <s> this issue was precipitately abandoned in the early s by the late glc <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that my noble friend lord galpern will not support the amendment <e> <s> most of us sympathise with the general proposition that in the long run the ferries ought to be sustained as competition for the tunnel and for aircraft and to provide for those incapacitated people mentioned by my noble friend <e> <s> however there is no place for either new clause in the bill <e> <s> there may well be a place for them in some kind of shipping bill or in a special bill relating specifically to ferries and marine transport <e> <s> no doubt they have been spatchcocked on this occasion for good reason

interested in copyright <e> <s> i am also an engineer and when we discuss architecture i shall be interested in that <e> <s> i am also involved in higher education as pro-chancellor of the city university and therefore will be involved in the clauses involving education <e> <s> i hope to be brief <e>", "<cs> i spoke to the committee office on friday <e> <s> they told me that the marshalled list would not be ready on friday otherwise i would have picked it up <e> <s> i may have been wrongly informed but it leaves a certain amount of doubt in my mind <e>", "<cs> i quite understand there will be a further opportunity to discuss the problem which i raised and i interpret originality exactly the <e>", "<cs> before we pass from clause could we think about clause c which deals with the typographical arrangement of published editions <e> <s> it takes us back to the comment i made not long ago on my noble friends amendment <e> <s> when we deal with the page of a magazine which contains a substantial body of original work by various hands to what extent is the copyright invested in the author of the words as it were the photogapher or artist who produced the pictures <e> <s>

of some significance in the typographical arrangement of published editions <e> <s> i dare say that we shall have ample opportunity to discuss those matters later but i should be grateful if the minister would reflect upon them for a moment <e>", "<cs> i put on the table a question which can be answered now or later <e> <s> is it the intention of this provision to protect the publisher or the typesetter <e>", "<cs> i hope that when the minister is compiling his mailing list he will include me only for those parts which refer directly to me <e> <s> i do not wish to overburden the minister <e> <s> i fear that he will have quite enough problems on this bill without writing to me on matters which are none of my business <e> <s> i hope that he will bear that in mind <e>", "<cs> this is a convenient moment to raise a worry of mine which relates to clause as a whole which hinges upon the words intended to be sung <e> <s> i am seeking enlightenment i am not attempting to attack the bill <e> <s> i am wondering where in clause the libretto of an opera comes in <e> <s> it is sometimes sung and it is usually intended to be sung but the subsection relating to literary work includes the words <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that the minister has completely removed my doubts <e> <s> he has told me that dramatic work includes a variety of things but the bill does not tell me that <e> <s> the bill only tells me that dramatic work includes a work of dance or mime <e> <s> it does not seem to include the interpretation that he put upon it though i must say that the ministers interpretation appears to include a fair amount of sense <e> <s> i dare say that if he turns his mind to this question between now and report stage he will be able to satisfy me a little more <e>", "<cs> well maybe but i should like to be convinced that i am wholly wrong <e> <s> when i am convinced that i am wholly wrong i am convincible <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may enter this interesting discussion <e> <s> there

give this matter further thought <e> <s> i wish to support what my noble friend said about the definition of dramatic work <e> <s> i know we have heard this in the chamber many times that it is bad law to produce lengthy lists <e> <s> the longer a list becomes the more important are the things that are omitted <e> <s> i learnt that from the noble and learned lord lord hailsham <e>", "<cs> as an engineer who has very often committed engineering drawings to paper wholly irrespective of artistic merit i must say that the bill seems to me to provide quite adequate protection <e> <s> i think that on this occasion the minister is right <e>", "<cs> whenever a minister suggests that he will pay careful attention to what i have said consider my words and possibly adopt them or at least think about

<e> <s> if a woodcut which presumably at some time derived from a drawing as a typeface in some cases does can be included i should have thought that there was also a strong argument for including typeface in the bill <e>", "<cs> will the minister let me have his views on the points that i made about woodcuts <e>", "<cs> does the minister include among the works of craftsmanship a certain form of typeface which does not occur in a drawing or as an impression on paper but which is an item you can hold in your hand <e> <s> if the minister has any time on his hands in the next week or two

it be covered by copyright while it is still in the computer and available to be retrieved from the computer <e>", "<cs> i strongly support the stance taken by the noble lord lord broxbourne <e> <s>

dromedary <e> <s> perhaps it will be the loch ness monster with even more humps before the night is over <e>", "<cs> for that reason we should not pass the amendment in a hurry <e> <s> we are talking <e>", "<cs> i am rather uncertain about this amendment <e> <s> i want to make two comments on the contribution just made by my noble friend lord willis <e> <s> the example that he raised of the employee in the mint whose work was marketed to the great profit of the mint but not to the employee is a good example <e> <s> it illustrates exactly the point that the noble earl lord stockton made that is that there is a difference between the kind of examples which the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran raised at the beginning of somebody making a thing and somebody involved in publishing <e>

author of a hook i am haggling with the publisher who is trying to screw me into the ground <e> <s> the difficulty arises from the fact that the company which is publishing the book is my own company <e> <s> the head of the book division is in fact my employee <e> <s> because he is my employee i feel morally bound not to pull rank on him and i hope that my co-author will coerce him into doing justice <e>", "<cs> that means the noble lord is shaking his head from side to side in agreement <e> <s> at all events i do not want to go over that ground again <e> <s> in certain cases the situation is simple and this amendment can apply <e> <s> in the case of a magazine article it is not simple and the amendment cannot apply <e> <s> therefore i am on the side of the government on this occasion

is wonderful as we all know and it is enlightened <e> <s> what happens is that house agreements are reached by negotiation not between powerful editors and feeble individuals but between feeble editors and powerful unions <e>", "<cs> no i was not saying that <e> <s> to say such a thing would not cross my mind <e> <s> it would not cross my mind because it does not depict the reality of the situation <e> <s> there may be a substantial number of to year-olds who would like to become journalists but that does not mean that a substantial number of to year-olds are capable of becoming journalists <e> <s> the two things are not the same <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for his reply <e> <s> i do not think that there is a wide gulf between us <e> <s> the minister will notice that the amendment is subject to prior agreement to the contrary although admittedly the original boot is on the other foot <e> <s> the bridging provision is the same <e> <s> i should be happy if the minister would agree to look at this <e> <s> if he is able to do that i shall withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> unfortunately i do not agree <e> <s> i think that the balance is slightly wrong although not wildly so <e>", "<cs> i do not find this an easy matter to deal with <e> <s> it is clearly advantageous that small businesses should be helped as much as possible as the noble lord lord mottistone has rightly said and it is important that educational research should be assisted as much as possible as other noble lords have said <e> <s> however i found the earlier speech which described the work of the british library disquieting <e> <s> part of the british librarys work involves disseminating large quantities of other peoples intellectual property <e>", "<cs> i have only one small doubt about this amendment <e> <s> in a case where an author provides an abstract of a paper in a publication for example the proceedings of the institution of civil engineers and a secondary publisher of some sort <e>", "<cs> i do not want to become involved in an internecine struggle with a sister engineering institution <e> <s> however am i right in supposing that the institute of electrical engineers charges people for abstracts <e> <s> if that is so would it not be sensible for it to pay for the materials it uses when that is appropriate <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mottistone on reflection might come to believe that his intervention was ill-advised <e> <s> indeed he may have prolonged the proceedings rather than accelerated them which was perhaps his intention <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble earl will agree with me that the northern reasonableness of my noble friend on the front bench is persuasive and especially so in the intervention that he made a moment ago <e> <s> surely the noble earl will consent to consider this matter most carefully <e> <s> two points in the noble earls response startled me a little <e> <s> it may be that i misheard or misunderstood what he was saying <e> <s> at one point he seemed to be talking about the difficulties of dealing with a movable time-scale <e> <s> i imagine that he was referring to

clause <e> <s> as a publisher i am drawn towards the arguments expounded by the noble earl lord stockton and i see his point of view clearly <e> <s> as a writer albeit a minor one i am drawn towards the arguments posed by my noble friend lord willis who defends the writer just as the noble earl lord stockton defends the publisher <e>", "<cs> in so far as i am one i am being merciful towards my

that reason i think there is more to my noble friends amendment than some members of the committee seem to think <e>", "<cs> the minister seems to underline the fears of my noble friend lord monkswell in suggesting that the design right applies only to the shape or configuration of an item or article <e> <s> indeed that is right in the context of the bill <e> <s> the fear of my noble friend is that by considering design solely in the context of the bill we may be saying something about design or designers as a whole <e> <s> he would argue as i would that the design of an engineering article contains a great deal more than its configuration or shape <e> <s> it contains the means of application of engineering science and mathematics to determine the dimension and size of the material itself <e> <s> while these in turn determine the shape i suppose they are not aesthetic matters but engineering matters <e> <s> my noble friends fear which i share is that if one designs in this way one limits the notion of the designer to a narrow group of persons whereas designs proper embrace a wide range of persons some of whom come from the art schools and some from the engineering colleges and universities <e> <s> that is the blurring of design that both i and i think my noble friend see in the bill <e> <s> i think that it needs more thought and definition than the government have given it <e> <s> there is no reason why the government should not limit the provisions of the bill to a narrow area of design but they should make clear that it is no more than a narrow area of design that is referred to in the bill <e>", "<cs> i wish to refer briefly to two of the four parts of subsection paragraphs a and d <e> <s> paragraph a specifically excludes methods or principles of construction <e> <s> that would be part of design as i would use the word and indeed as any respectable dictionary would use the word <e> <s> i can see that from the point of view of the government it is quite sensible to exclude that since it underlines the narrow range over which this part of the bill is intended to apply <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously i must begin my remarks by thanking the minister for responding so well to the amendment which i moved in committee <e> <s> i hope that i shall not seem too churlish if i look this gift horse in the mouth for just a moment <e> <s> i believe that my amendment which <e>", "<cs> my lords as a publisher of magazines i welcome the governments amendment no <e> <s> about which we are speaking a little prematurely <e> <s> at the same time i have up to a point an underlying current of sympathy with amendment no <e> <s> moved by my noble friend lord williams <e> <s> there appears to be an element of natural justice in what he says <e> <s> if i knew precisely what was meant by the words <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord is a good enough photographer <e> <s> i should like to see his face about our office in any event quite apart from his photographic abilities <e> <s> however we provide the gentleman with the facilities to carry out the work and it is obviously correct that we rather than he should reap the benefits from that <e>", "<cs> my lords i must come to the support of my noble friend on the front bench on this occasion <e> <s> i believe that he is entirely right <e> <s> i remember that we discussed this at committee stage on an amendment that i put down <e> <s> i forget the details of the amendment but i can remember discussing it very briefly and very late one night <e> <s> at that time i made only one point and i shall repeat it again today <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to say very much about this matter except to remind the minister that during the committee stage we enjoyed a number of interventions from my noble friend lord kilbracken of a somewhat dry grammarian-like kind <e> <s> as i recall to begin with the government resisted my noble friend on all of them <e> <s> i think i am right on that point <e> <s> however on reflection noble lords will have noticed this afternoon that a substantial number of the governments amendments have been based on the views of the noble lord lord kilbracken which were rejected at the committee stage <e> <s> i suggest that when he brings his grammarians weight to bear on this bill we accept what he says because he usually turns out to be right <e> <s> on this occasion perhaps the government should accept his advice now rather than as they undoubtedly will at a later date <e>", "<cs> my lords it is important to remind ourselves that the bill is supposed to be about the protection of intellectual property <e> <s> the amendment is the exact reverse it permits the piracy of intellectual property by business <e> <s> that is not what the bill is supposed to be about <e> <s> i know that the government justify this u-turn or somersault by saying that they wish to reduce the burdens on industry and the cost of research <e> <s> that is true <e> <s> the amendment will reduce the burdens of industry by transferring them to the publishing industry <e> <s> that is not what the bill is intended to do nor is it what the government supported in committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to express my gratidude to the minister for responding to the debate at committee and attempting to correct in the bill a matter which i considered to be wrong <e> <s> he eventually agreed that it was wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords as i see it the issue in relation to the amendment of the noble earl lord stockton regarding composite works is a simple and practical one <e> <s> like most of your lordships i have no objection to authors being identified journalists having by-lines and photographers being properly identified when their work is reproduced in magazines newspapers books or elsewhere <e> <s> the trouble is that when one deals with composite works in relation to magazines and encyclopaedias the <e>", "<cs> my lords the bill deals with the protection of intellectual property and this part is about the protection of moral rights <e> <s> we strongly support such matters <e> <s> my noble friend lord graham is right in essence in saying that such waivers should be made in writing so as to preserve the utmost clarity in order that everyone knows exactly what is happening and that matters are permanently on the record <e>", "<cs> if an editor is at one end of a telephone and the author is at the other what kind of proxy or other intermediary can assist <e>", "<cs> my lords is it the governments intention to bring this part of the bill into conformity with clause <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mottistone has been far too modest in attempting to amend subsection by deleting the words <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down perhaps i may ask him to reconsider his comments about girders and reflect that the hong kong bank for example consists of some very large girders of a very high aesthetic quality <e>", "<cs> i was intervening in the ministers speech my lords and as briefly as i could <e> <s> i shall cease to do so of course <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sympathetic towards the amendment <e> <s> i listened with great care to the arguments advanced on its behalf <e> <s> i hesitate only in one sense it is this <e> <s> what seems to be happening here if i understand the amendment correctly is that only one particular professional group is to be licensed to carry out certain functions <e> <s> while that in theory might be defensible and in this instance might be defensible has the noble earl considered that other professions are not so protected and that they might feel that what is good for patent agents is good for chartered engineers and other people of that kind <e> <s> i am inclined to support him on the grounds that the amendment would lead to the effect i have hinted at <e>", "<cs> does not the minister agree that the law has been changed somewhat since and that the example he has just given is wildly out of date and not relevant to the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down will he elaborate very briefly on his use of the word evaporate or evaporated which i thought i heard <e> <s> does he mean that this exception is of limited duration <e> <s> if it is of limited duration would it not be as well if the bill were to say that <e>", "<cs> my lords as always in this house i shall be extremely brief on this matter <e> <s> i am drawn to my feet by the notion that the duchy of lancaster goes back to the battle in and is obviously a very ancient part of our constitutional arrangements <e> <s> however i must remind the house however gently and however briefly that we are a united kingdom and apart from in there was the union of the crowns and in there was the union of parliaments <e> <s> although the duchy of lancaster is of great interest to some parts of the united kingdom it is only of marginal interest to some other parts of the united kingdom <e> <s> we wish it no harm in that respect but we wish merely to remind constitutionalists that the duchy of lancaster is a very local matter and is a local matter only to part of the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the house for not being present when amendment no <e> <s> was called <e> <s> the reason is very simple <e> <s> i had been trapped on the docklands light railway which is an excellent mode of transport but it left me at west india quay station for quite a while <e>", "<cs> my lords surely it is in order for the noble lord to make a comment before the minister sits down <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down will he take note that i have just come from a meeting at the city university which he knows extremely well <e> <s> city technology limited is a company wholly run by the city university it has just won its third queens award this time for export <e> <s> on the other two occasions it was for technological expertise <e> <s> the noble lord is absolutely right <e> <s> the amendment should be supported <e>", "<cs> i should like to support my noble friend lord morton of shuna and also the noble lord lord grimond <e> <s> i speak as a graduate of a scottish university strathclyde although in my day it was the royal technical college and as the pro-chancellor of the city university london <e>", "<cs> before the noble and learned lord sits down will he look back to clause below line where it refers to having regard to the desirability of including a variety of persons <e> <s> can he perhaps encourage his friend in the government to consider the desirability of having scotsmen as well as the other people <e>", "<cs> i am greatly interested in the reply of the noble and learned lord but must admit that i am rather puzzled by it although possibly that may be because of the lateness of the hour <e> <s> it seems to me that the amendment deals with particular universities that is to say it deals with universities one at a time but part of the reply at any rate seemed to deal with universities as a whole <e> <s> i am not sure that those two ideas are quite concurrent one with the other <e> <s> it may be that i have not properly understood the matter <e>", "<cs> i wish very briefly to ask a question on this <e> <s> as i understand it clause provides that the council shall have power <e>", "<cs> is not this the opposite of what the noble and learned lord said <e> <s> it is not a matter of the master in this case the secretary of state wanting to get things done <e> <s> it is a matter of the council having the power to give him something in such manner as he thinks fit <e> <s> while i am on my feet will the noble and learned lord confirm that <e>", "<cs> we debated this matter <e>", "<cs> i do not think <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the committee <e> <s> i was obviously over polite <e> <s> that was an error on my part <e>", "<cs> the noble lord did so and is suitably admonished <e> <s> the point is that as the noble lord lord grimond said scotland is a separate place <e> <s> whether or not it is a nation is academic in a sense but we believe it to be a nation <e> <s> the university system is entirely different from that of england <e> <s> it is therefore quite wrong that it should merely be stuck in as part of a general system which applies to england and wales <e>", "<cs> i want to speak very briefly i shall not take up much of the time of the committee <e> <s> members who know me know that i shall not do so <e> <s> i want to reflect back to a year or so ago when similar matters were considered in relation to scotland <e> <s> at that time arguments arose against the imposition of the poll tax in relation to scotland but not then to england and wales but such as the noble and learned lord lord hailsham did not then argue that these matters were unconstitutional or anything of that sort <e> <s> it seemed that while they were appropriate to scotland they have now become innappropriate to england <e> <s> we went through this argument very thoroughly then <e> <s> those of us who are scottish members or have connections with scotland were irked that english people did not come to our aid at that time <e> <s> we were very hurt and a little subdued <e> <s> we said look you are going to get it later on just you wait <e> <s> and of course so it has turned out <e> <s> i do not think that the constitutional arguments are of any significance whatsoever <e> <s> if they were not significant a year ago they cannot be that significant now <e> <s> things have not changed that much in the time <e>", "<cs> the noble lord knows of my great admiration for him <e> <s> however will he put his thumbprint on the proposition that more people will vote hereafter in the way that he has just said <e> <s> i know that he is carried away by the exuberance of his argument <e> <s> but will he put his thumbprint on that and give me a fiver when the time comes <e>", "<cs> i should like to add briefly to the comments made by the noble lord lord bonham-carter from the liberal front bench <e> <s> he spoke reverently of the attraction of london as an international centre of culture and so forth <e> <s> i should like to add one example to the generalised examples which he gave <e> <s> this week at the institute of civil <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister says that the government will take into account the costs of implementing the community charge or poll tax <e> <s> does he mean that the poll tax will be increased to cover these costs or does he mean that the government will cover the costs in some other way <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not very moved whether scotland is a kingdom or a nation but like it <e> <s> i know that many scots including the noble lord lord grimond think that it is a nation and that really matters <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down perhaps i may ask him whether he would accept that there is one substantial difference apart from the ones raised earlier that is that the scottish universities with the possible exception of st andrews are rather more regional than are the english ones and that the great majority of students from glasgow will come from within hailing distance of that city <e>", "<cs> my lords i was greatly impressed by the remarks of the noble baroness lady carnegy when she drew attention to the possibility of people moving in and then obtaining a tenancy <e> <s> it seemed that she was right in suggesting that there was a problem there which somewhat weakens the amendment of my noble friend <e> <s> however his amendment refers to a member of the family moving in <e> <s> it is not just anybody moving in <e> <s> that puts a gloss on the matter which is totally different from what the noble baroness lady carnegy was saying <e>", "<cs> my lords when a day or two ago i put my name down to speak in the debate i had hoped to follow the noble baroness lady white and to support some propositions that she intended to make <e> <s> unfortunately i am told that the noble baroness has been taken ill and is consequently unable to speak today <e> <s> to all intents and purposes i shall abandon my notes and make her speech for her <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment of my noble friend and dissent from only one point that he made namely that the bill is now balanced as between the publishers and authors <e> <s> i do not believe that <e> <s> those who remember the debates earlier in this session will not be surprised that i say this <e> <s> we say very often in this house that after a lengthy period of debate we have got it just about right <e> <s> it is not very often that i say it about the government but i think that here they have except that i support my noble friend in his amendment no <e> <s> b <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to say having supported my noble friend to the extent of going through the lobby with him earlier this afternoon that i have to dissent in the case of this amendment <e> <s> i dissent because fair dealing in the nature of things must be evenhanded <e> <s> by that i mean that it must be fair dealing between the student to whom he drew attention the author and the publisher <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down will he take note when he has finished waving his hands at me that it is not really a good idea if he wishes to be persuasive to open his remarks by saying that those of us who take a different view from him have no experience or do not know what we are talking about <e> <s> some of us do <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the government have in mind an opera for the moment i have forgotten the name in which the soprano sings the last rose of summer <e> <s> perhaps they have in mind an instance of that nature <e>", "<cs> my lords i must join other noble lords in thanking the noble viscount lord hanworth for giving us the opportunity to discuss this important subject <e> <s> there is something which he and others might have said but did not say <e> <s> it is that engineering is difficult <e> <s> it is as demanding and as intellectual a discipline as any <e> <s> the mathematics and physics necessary for engineering are complex <e> <s> they must be allied to organisational and management skills of a fairly high order <e> <s> because of the difficulty and off-putting nature of mathematics and physics the point has been made over and over again during the debate something must be done to secure a higher level of teaching of maths and physics in the schools <e> <s> there is no question about that <e> <s> it is the most important thing we can say tonight <e> <s> it is the aspect which the government should do most about to overcome the shortage of engineers <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not mind giving way to anybody <e> <s> while these matters are under consideration will the minister attempt to use his good offices to dissuade the baa from proceeding with its proposals to build a fifth terminal at heathrow and instead to concentrate on the possible runway deficiencies at gatwick or stansted <e>", "<cs> speaking from this side of the chamber surely the noble lord who has just spoken has exaggerated the dangers of delay <e> <s> it is nice to see the noble earl lord gowrie back in the chamber <e> <s> i have enjoyed his presence in the chamber in the past <e> <s> but when he referred to the speech of the noble lord lord wyatt did he not recall as i think i do that the noble lord said that this was not a matter of overwhelming importance <e> <s> it is not <e> <s> since it is not a matter of overwhelming importance not one of the great measures of state the constitutional consequences do not arise with that weight which the noble earl lord gowrie placed upon them <e> <s> what would it matter if the privatisation of water were held back for a year or even for two years <e> <s> there can be nobody in this chamber who thinks that that in itself would be a disaster <e>", "<cs> i wish to refer briefly to the comments made by the noble lord lord renton <e> <s> unless i misunderstand the amendment i do not think it would preclude roads being built through these areas where they are necessary <e> <s> access is the matter which is to be protected access by the public to the areas listed in the amendment and in the bill <e> <s> there is no difficulty about access over a road <e> <s> one builds a footbridge and can cross from one side to the other <e> <s> then the problem of access is solved <e> <s> our motorway system involves access bridges for pedestrians cattle and other animals on almost all our motorways especially those in rural areas <e> <s> that was a red herring referred to by the noble lord in an attempt to illustrate the problem <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble baroness for drawing attention to that issue <e> <s> i do not regard a road as having a deleterious impact <e>", "<cs> i am happy to support my noble friend lord mcintosh in these amendments <e> <s> i should stress however that i am mainly interested in amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> i say that lest i inadvertently give the noble baroness lady carnegy of lour the opportunity to score another bulls eye <e> <s> that is something which i am most anxious to avoid <e>", "<cs> when the minister takes away amendment no <e> <s> will he also take away my comments on it <e>", "<cs> conifers are fine trees and native to my part of the world but i think it is fairly well established that they play a substantial part in the acid rain problem <e> <s> the amendment merely talks of preventing further afforestation <e> <s> there will still be a large number of plantations in south wales for example and south-west scotland where experiments are taking place <e>", "<cs> the problem with combined heat and power is that while more hot water is produced one gets less electricity <e> <s> that is fine if one wants only hot water but it is not quite so good if one wants electricity <e> <s> the argument about combined heat and power is rather more complicated than my noble friend suggested <e> <s> the elegant power station at pembroke could supply combined heat and power for milford haven but megawatts of electricity supplying a marginal amount of hot water in milford haven is not such a wonderful idea <e>", "<cs> one would get less electricity <e> <s> we are both agreed about that <e>", "<cs> my lords at the risk of being thought curmudgeonly are we not in danger of going overboard about this interesting matter <e> <s> from remarks in the press and indeed in this chamber it might be thought that we were preserving the rose theatre important no doubt though that is <e> <s> are we not preserving a footprint of the rose theatre <e> <s> is it possible that we are going too far to preserve a footprint rather than an artifact <e>", "<cs> the minister used the word nuance towards the end of his reply <e> <s> that is perfectly correct <e> <s> it is clearly difficult to impose an absolute duty to supply important though that might be on all occasions <e> <s> the noble lord lord renton referred to people in distant places and the difficulty of supply them but something could be done marginally using windmills diesel generators and so on <e> <s> surely it is not impossible to deal with those situations <e> <s> in any case they ought to be considered <e>", "<cs> before the minister leaves that point i remind him that on the copyright bill to which he alluded a moment ago the great difference between the debates then and the debates now and on other bills in the more recent past is that throughout the debates on the copyright bill the government front bench including the noble earl was extremely reasonable <e> <s> the front bench then listened to reason and came back with reasoned amendments based on the arguments put forward <e> <s> the front bench seems to have slipped back from that happy condition of or months ago <e>", "<cs> i find myself as i often do seeing both sides of the question <e> <s> temperamentally i am strongly in favour of metering <e> <s> as the noble lord lord jenkin has pointed out metering is one way of conserving a scarce resource for which it is difficult and expensive to obtain the capital investment stake <e> <s> in theory i would welcome turning over to metering <e>", "<cs> i should like to support my noble friend in general terms and to agree strongly with his description of the manner in which <e>", "<cs> it may have been an analogy but whatever else it was it was not an engineering one <e> <s> engineers design to the standards and meet them as best they can <e> <s> it is correct that the standards ought to be the best possible ones <e> <s> the danger of their not being the best possible ones can be shown not in analogy but in an example drawn from a wholly different field <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support my noble friend on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> what worries me about the governments reply on the matter is that if sub-paragraph remains which requires the consent of the treasury what is there left for the secretary of state to do <e> <s> there are various references to him in this part of the schedule including sub-paragraph where it specifies that certain actions are to be carried out with his approval or consent <e> <s> however what is the point in the secretary of state giving his approval or consent to such matters if at the end of the day the treasury has the final say <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment from a slightly different point of view from that of the mover <e> <s> noble lords will recall that part of the duties under clause of the bill are to protect and conserve buildings <e> <s> on all sides of the house we are agreed that that is the right and proper thing to do <e> <s> however there is one aspect of the duties of the national rivers authority and the flood protection bodies with which the bill does not seem to me to deal adequately that is dealing not with the problems of over-abstraction of water from rivers but with the problem of declining abstraction of water from underground sources <e> <s> as noble lords will recall the effect of that is to raise the water table in various parts of the country especially in areas where de-industrialisation has led to a reduction in the water demand by declining industries <e>", "<cs> will the leader of the house say something on this point <e>", "<cs> my lords i read the amendment as going further than fixed structures <e> <s> in earlier debates we referred to the copyright act as regards fixed structures <e> <s> i thought that the government had omitted the word fixed in order to include such items as sluices which by nature are not fixed <e> <s> i am happy with structures and do not need the word fixed <e>", "<cs> my lords i must expresss the most modest disappointment with that reply which i found to be quite disgraceful <e> <s> it illustrates the contempt with which engineering is held in this country and quite improperly so <e> <s> the noble earl was right in saying that the word historic covers engineering <e> <s> however it is true that the word covers architectural and that is in the bill <e> <s> it is also true that it covers archeological and yet that is in the bill <e> <s> there is no reason in logic or good sense why engineering should not be recognised in an industry which is almost wholly engineering <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that my noble friend will not be put off by the thought that the noble earl lord balfour has no control over the pressure at which water comes out of the spring <e> <s> i am quite sure that he is right <e> <s> he has no control over that but ensuring water at a proper pressure is not the point <e> <s> that comes from the noble earl or anyone else taking water from the spring or wherever and putting it into a suitable tank or receptacle at a suitable height <e> <s> it is from that height that the pressure comes <e> <s> there is no difficulty of any kind in applying regulations to that situation <e>", "<cs> my lords it appears to me that these amendments are correct and ought to be supported <e> <s> it seems to me from memory that all the precedents point in this direction <e> <s> when industries were nationalised in the past no one thought that the consumers committees should be appointed by the head of the nationalised industries <e> <s> they were appointed by the secretary of state to make them separate from the nationalised industries <e> <s> it would be quite wrong for the director to appoint the consumers committees in this case because with the best will in the world it would be quite impossible to <e>", "<cs> my lords i find myself in the interesting position of agreeing with both amendments <e> <s> however that is impossible because if we have one we cannot have the other <e> <s> as i read subsection it suggests that the director shall have regard to the desirability of doing something <e> <s> that presumably means that having had regard to the desirability of doing so he may do something else <e> <s> presumably he is permitted to consider appointing persons who have experience of this that and the other but he might appoint people who do not have that experience <e> <s> that would be a very desirable arrangement one which i believe the noble lord lord peyton would desire <e>", "<cs> my lords the point that we must bear in mind is that my noble friend lord shepherd said that this was a probing amendment <e> <s> he is trying to find things out <e> <s> there is therefore little point in delving too deeply into the wording of his amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the government will treat this amendment with the utmost possible caution <e> <s> my experience of large scale construction over the past generation or so is that public inquiries have changed their nature <e> <s> at one time they were inquiries into the need for <e>", "<cs> my lords it may well be democracy but democracy means doing things as well as stopping them <e> <s> i think we must be careful about this <e>", "<cs> my lords this is the second time within minutes that my noble friend has been <e>", "<cs> my lords i come to the support of my noble friend on the front bench <e> <s> there is no point in saying that there is no difference between the word may and shall and that there is no change in removing shall and inserting may <e> <s> we have been debating this matter since time immemorial and no doubt the debate will go on forever <e> <s> however there is no point in saying that there is no change because there is a change and the government should admit that <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the house for returning to this matter so soon after we have debated the water bill at some length <e> <s> we came to some rather unsatisfactory conclusions but at least they were conclusions <e> <s> the fault is not mine but that of the government that the electricity bill followed so soon after the water bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i happily support my noble friends on the front bench as regards amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> however i fear that i must bore the house for a moment or two by referring to my king charless head which arises under subsection c <e>", "<cs> my lords in the noble earls case i withdraw totally my remarks <e> <s> he is as muscular as any noble lord in the chamber <e>", "<cs> that would appear to be a satisfactory way of resolving the problem but can the minister tell the committee why this proposed amendment for the next stage of the bill was not brought forward at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords from this side of the house i should like to congratulate the government on having done something extremely sensible albeit rather late in the day and albeit they were advised long ago to do so <e> <s> secondly i would ask the government not to be unduly overweighed by the cold water that has been thrown on the nuclear programme as a whole by my noble friend lord williams whom i congratulate on his recent appointment and my noble friend lord stoddart <e> <s> i hope that the government will continue to support nuclear power rather beyond what seems to be the extent of the support in todays statement <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down does he agree with me that the great advantage of nuclear energy is that you can get more energy per pound out of uranium than you can get out of any other available fuel <e> <s> however desirable the alternatives such as wind and wave energy and they are desirable they are not immediately available in a way which he and i would desire <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down perhaps i may ask whether he recalls our debates on the copyright act <e> <s> i am sure that he does <e> <s> at that time a bill came before this house in a form which required something like amendments from this house after the committee stage <e> <s> would he join me in hoping that the government have paid more attention to the drafting of this measure than they did to that one <e> <s> otherwise let me say that there will be another amendments to this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join my noble friend lord fitt in asking what is the hurry <e> <s> there might be an emergency but in my recollection the emergency in northern ireland has existed since if not earlier if one considers the historical perspective <e> <s> the immediate emergency has existed since <e> <s> i do not believe that this order is an element of that emergency which is of such urgency that it should be rushed through in this way as my noble friend has said <e> <s> education is not a matter of urgency it is a matter of time <e> <s> we all know that <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for allowing me to intervene <e> <s> i am sympathetic towards much of what he has said <e> <s> however one of my major points was that because we were segregated we threw stones at each other <e> <s> i do not believe that that is a good idea <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down will he respond to the following notion <e> <s> he and i were brought up in the south-west of scotland where there is a noticeable problem although less severe than in northern ireland <e> <s> we were part of a segregated education system until the age of <e> <s> we then went to university where we were not segregated and that did not do us the slightest bit of harm <e> <s> therefore what is the difference <e> <s> why would it have mattered if we had been unsegregated before we went to university <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down will he accept that it is not really a question of roads against public transport <e> <s> it is really a matter of roads and public transport <e> <s> the london system is inadequate <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to yield <e> <s> i have made my point <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble earl lord selkirk i am a little surprised to find this provision in the bill although it is a miscellaneous <e>", "<cs> i was struck by the ministers distinction between the highlands and lowlands <e> <s> as he rightly says they are different parts of the world <e> <s> we know that remoteness exists in the highlands but it must not be concluded from that that remoteness does not exist also in the lowlands <e> <s> the noble earl who has just spoken indicated that <e> <s> however i ask the minister to think of south ayrshire and for example of small towns like dalmellington or patna or of the road from straiton south to glen trool <e> <s> you cannot get much more remote that that even in the highlands <e> <s> it is a remote and distant area to which this type of provision can reasonably be held to apply <e>", "<cs> the minister was too quick for me <e> <s> i was struggling to rise to my feet but he is spry youthful and jaunty <e> <s> in clause of the bill we see that what is known as scottish enterprise has the function of furthering the development of scotlands economy <e> <s> we are all agreed that that is what it is for and we applaud that <e> <s> it seems to me that scottish enterprise cannot further development without keeping under review all matters relating to the economic development of scotland and therefore my noble friends amendment is essential in order to carry out the function under clause ai <e>", "<cs> i think that the minister must have misheard me <e> <s> i did not say that the amendment was unnecessary <e> <s> i said that it was necessary <e>", "<cs> i wish to intervene briefly with regard to clause e on page of the bill which states that the body is entitled to <e>", "<cs> i am satisfied with that reply <e>", "<cs> this clause concerns delegation of functions and powers <e> <s> if i understand it correctly it is probably a delegation of functions and powers to private enterprise organisations of one kind or another <e> <s> among matters according to clause that should not be delegated are <e>", "<cs> i have one worry about this part of the bill and the amendment with which we are dealing <e> <s> do the governments proposals make the conservation industry stronger or weaker <e> <s> if they strengthen the conservation industry i tend to be against them if they weaken the industry i tend to be in their favour <e> <s> i do not know the answer to the question but it will certainly influence how i vote on the matter <e>", "<cs> most certainly <e> <s> i should point out that i am speaking for the people <e>", "<cs> i have much sympathy with what has been said on both sides <e> <s> however i cannot help feeling that we have been making heavy weather of this issue <e> <s> the amendment is perfectly reasonable <e> <s> it is not draconian in any way <e> <s> it merely asks the commission to seek to reach agreement <e> <s> as the noble lord lord marsh said sensible employers would do that anyway <e> <s> that is no reason why they should cavil about having the provision written in the bill <e> <s> however the amendment does not suggest that there is an obligation to reach any agreement which might be on the table <e> <s> the commission is merely asked to negotiate to attempt to reach agreement <e> <s> if it does not reach agreement something else will happen <e> <s> the argument that the amendment is one-sided is surely false or mistaken and misguided <e> <s> i dare say that it is a good debating point <e>", "<cs> the committee will be extremely pleased to learn that i have not received a letter from anyone <e> <s> if i were to advise the government i would tell them to follow that precedent and send letters to no one <e> <s> it seems to cause nothing but alarm and despondency on the benches in front of me <e>", "<cs> i should tell the noble earl that that omission left me unconfused <e>", "<cs> i agree with the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls he knows i often agree with him as regards this matter being an emergency <e> <s> it is an emergency and it must be dealt with with some urgency <e> <s> however we have all day and we may even have all week to deal with it <e> <s> that is enough time to deal with it <e> <s> the position is not only an emergency for the people of hong kong but also for those british companies operating in hong kong <e> <s> the committee knows that as a consulting engineer i have associations with consulting engineers and consulting architects who employ people in hong kong <e> <s> the situation is an emergency for them because of the erosion of the technical base of the hong kong economy <e> <s> engineers and architects are rapidly emigrating from the colony <e>", "<cs> the minister explained that for a variety of reasons including bad character and so forth the secretary of state has the right to remove people from the list submitted by the governor <e> <s> does the secretary of state have the right to add people to the list which is what i wish to see <e>", "<cs> this is probably one of the most important amendments before the committee <e> <s> i accept the general proposition stated by the government that there should be a limit to the number of residents of hong kong who are entitled to come here whether or not they do so <e> <s> i also accept the general proposition expressed by the noble lord lord bonham-carter that there should be more than <e> <s> however i do not know how many more <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for correcting me <e> <s> i thought that a mandate meant a mandate rather than some sort of opinion poll <e> <s> no doubt that was my fault <e> <s> however i was not thinking of a substantially greater number i was thinking of a greater number <e>", "<cs> why would further legislation be required if the amendment were accepted <e> <s> would not such a measure be the further legislation <e> <s> the secretary of state would be in no way incommoded <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord will accept my thanks for the kind words that he directed towards me <e> <s> however will he think again about his comment on my special interest group <e> <s> i do not have a special interest group in the shape of the hong kong institution of engineers <e> <s> i happen to be an engineer and consequently i look on engineers with more sympathy than most people in this country do but i do not have in any way a special interest group in hong kong <e> <s> i wish that to be made absolutely and totally clear <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord responds perhaps i may say that i found the intervention of my noble friend lord mishcon not just now but earlier quite shameful <e> <s> whatever my front bench may do on the amendment i shall certainly support it <e>", "<cs> my lords it will be plain to those who were present during the committee stage a week ago that i support the amendment on slightly different grounds from those of my noble friend on the front bench <e> <s> i do not say that i disagree with his constitutional grounds for i agree with them although we were all impressed by the comments of the noble lord lord renton who is unsurpassed as a textual critic of legislation in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls was right to remind us that those of us with experience in campaigning at elections are close to the people <e> <s> the noble lord has had considerable experience <e> <s> i remember an election in which he campaigned vigorously for several weeks and eventually won by three votes <e> <s> i take it that had he campaigned for another half an hour or so he would have lost and he would have been in this house much quicker to enjoy life here <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may interrupt the noble lord i accept the point he is making but what i said earlier on was that no one in this house was thinking of a substantially higher figure <e>", "<cs> i shall be very brief <e> <s> first i must say that i am vice-president of the periodical publishers association but i make absolutely clear that the magazines with which i personally am involved have nothing to do with listings or cultural matters of any sort whatsoever <e> <s> i am therefore entirely innocent in terms of this debate <e>", "<cs> my lords am i right in supposing that the west bank is a piece of jordan <e> <s> what my noble friends propose is that a piece of jordan should be given away to somebody else <e> <s> has not jordan quite enough trouble on its plate at the moment without our trying to add to it <e>"]
