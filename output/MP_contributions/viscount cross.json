["<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord nugent of guildford for giving your lordships the opportunity this afternoon to discuss this important question of the compulsory wearing of seat belts <e> <s> i should also like to thank the noble lord lord balfour of inchrye for his reasoned amendment <e> <s> may i say straight away that i shall support the noble lord lord balfour of inchrye in his amendment <e> <s> may i also say that i should like to support the last speaker the noble lady lady saltoun also the noble earl lord cork and orrery and the noble lord lord ferrier in what they said about the standardisation of seat belts <e>", "<cs> if i may i should like to say a few words about amendment no <e> <s> in the name of the noble lord lord underhill and i should also like to speak to the amendment moved by the noble baroness lady stedman <e> <s> i do not agree with either of these amendments <e> <s> i do not agree with them because i think they do to a degree tend to perpetuate the present system <e> <s> i do not know of any other sphere of life where the offender is punished for an offence in the first instance and then continues to be punished for many years after that for the same offence <e> <s> i think the present system is rather unfair <e> <s> i think the public think it unfair and i hope to show quite briefly why it is unfair <e>", "<cs> i also should like to support the amendment put by the noble baroness lady macleod of borve as i believe that it would make a very great contribution to road safety <e> <s> i have just one qualification and that concerns the brightness of the lighting <e> <s> i personally find that a very bright motor-cycle headlamp whether on dipped beam or full beam can be distracting when the motorbike is travelling towards one so bright that one cannot see other traffic or a pedestrian crossing the road <e> <s> if the headlamp is reflected in ones rear view mirror again it is distracting <e> <s> if the light was no more powerful than the sidelights which are illuminated on a volvo when it is in motion then i think it would be quite sufficient <e> <s> one could see the motorbike coming and this would be of very good assistance <e>", "<cs> i have every sympathy with the amendment moved by the noble lady lady saltoun but i understand that children restrained in the back of a car are safer than those restrained in the front <e> <s> on the point which i think that my noble friend lord mottistone was about to make concerning anchorage points under the construction and use regulations will my noble friend the minister ask the secretary of state to ask the manufacturers to provide the necessary four anchorage points on the floor in the back of the shooting-brake type of car hatchback or station wagon whatever you like to call it <e> <s> because they are necessary in order that children may be safely restrained on the rear seat by seat belts manufactured for that type of car <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendments of the noble lord lord monson for the reasons which he has given <e> <s> the effect of his amendments are compulsory seat belts for front seat passengers only <e> <s> that is very desirable <e> <s> it would be accepted by the public <e> <s> it has the further advantage that if in an emergency a passenger is wearing a seat belt the driver can put on the brakes really hard if say a dog crosses the road and he has to stop suddenly <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask my noble friend the minister a question <e> <s> this point was raised by my noble friend lord balfour of inchrye <e> <s> how are the police to tell who has been granted a medical certificate and is there to be a licence on the windscreen of the car when a certificate has been granted <e> <s> how are the police to tell who has had a certificate and who has not <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment because it would achieve an important improvement <e> <s> in this country in the winter months there are many multiple accidents on motorways and often there can be fires <e> <s> rescuers using the device described by my noble friend would very easily be able to undo the seat belts and get the people out <e>", "<cs> i too support the amendment because is far too high would be quite sufficient my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend the minister for what he has said <e> <s> the wearing rate on motorways in germany is as high as per cent <e> <s> and i think that is very high <e> <s> as this is the first time i think that the german system has been discussed in your lordships house i should like to test the feeling of the house on the matter and to press my amendment <e>", "<cs> briefly i support the amendment of the noble lord lord lucas for the reasons that he has given <e> <s> may i also ask whether the problem might not be solved by the police officer fining the offender on the spot <e>", "<cs> a number of your lordships have spoken on the question of fire in london and i should like to say a word or two on that subject <e> <s> as your lordships know many london streets are narrow and they are certainly all congested <e> <s> i think it would be very tragic if a fire engine was delayed or obstructed in reaching a fire <e> <s> when a fire breaks out speed of course is absolutely essential and if the fire engine has to stop to unclamp cars its journey is delayed <e> <s> no one can tell in which house building or factory a fire may break out and when the fire engine has reached the site of the fire it still might not be able to rescue the people in the building because there may be clamped cars that would have to be removed <e> <s> a similar case can occur when people are trapped in a building with locked and bolted doors so that they cannot get out <e> <s> in such a case the fire engine might be prevented from rescuing the people in the building because of locked and clamped cars <e> <s> i think that clause should not stand part of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say i understand from the bill who is not going to be allowed to do the testing but at the same time may i ask the noble lord the minister who the government have in mind as doing the testing <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say that the system described by the noble lord the minister sounded to me very like the present system <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house may i just say that the system described by the noble lord the minister sounded to me very like the present system which i believe works very well and it would be a very great pity to change it <e> <s> it is very important to have an impartial authority something similar to the people who do the weights and measures and as the present system is run by such an authority it would be a great pity to change that part of it <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i must also apologise for not having put my name down on the list of speakers but with the leave of the house i should like to support the noble lord lord monson and the noble lady lady saltoun <e> <s> like my noble friend lord mottistone i am also in favour of just one further exemption and that is for people who are less than five feet tall <e> <s> of course the danger with people who are less than five feet tall is that the belt comes across their neck and across their windpipe and that is a very dangerous thing to happen <e> <s> the government may say that you can raise the seat you can sit on a <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not detain your lordships long <e> <s> perhaps i may say straightaway that i shall support the amendment moved by my noble friend lord peyton of yeovil <e> <s> i support many of the points made by the noble lord lord ross of marnock <e> <s> the noble baroness lady macleod of borve has told us that the public think that some of us are asleep some of the time <e> <s> i do not want to exaggerate but it is possible that some of us may have had our eyes closed to avoid the glare from the lights <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble earl the minister for that reply though i am disappointed that it is in the negative <e> <s> at the same time i should like to congratulate him on the construction of this bold and imaginative road around london <e> <s> in view of the traffic problems on the m will he consider adopting the traffic system as practised on the freeways of the united states of america and that practised in for example oxford street whereby all lanes are equal so as to make the best possible use of the road space provided and to ensure the free flow of traffic <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend the minister not agree that drivers in this country drive quite as well as those in any other country <e> <s> can he say why it should be more dangerous to overtake on the left-hand side than on the right-hand side <e>", "<cs> i have noted what the minister has just said <e> <s> nevertheless i should like to support the new clause moved by the noble lord lord underhill and in the name also of the noble lord lord carmichael of kelvingrove <e> <s> at the same time i should like to say a few words about safety <e>", "<cs> my lords i support my noble friend lady gardner of parkes in her amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i believe that this is a very valuable amendment <e> <s> i understand that in france they have had a probationary system for many years <e> <s> on its introduction there was a marked large and immediate reduction in accidents <e> <s> if my noble friend the minister finds that he is unable to accept my noble friends amendment i hope that she will feel constrained to press it to a division <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord lord underhill for initiating this debate <e> <s> perhaps i may say a few words about the governments recently announced expanded road programme and about road design a few words about the proposed rail link from paddington to london airport and finally a few words about the great north road the a <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister say whether the commission is allowed to contribute to the cost of the proposed new railway line from the mouth of the channel tunnel to london <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend say whether her majestys government recommend the tuning of engines for maximum efficiency <e> <s> will he also confirm that most regrettably catalytic converters and green petrol provide fewer miles to the gallon and therefore greater discharges of <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that rather disappointing reply <e> <s> despite the discussions which took place in the other place last week i make no apology for leaving this question on the order paper <e> <s> it is a matter of the greatest economic importance to the whole country and there is always time for second thoughts <e> <s> have the government considered the implications of the flood of freight lorries which will pour on to the roads of kent <e> <s> apart from the likely congestion how does the emission of large quantities of diesel fumes and carbon dioxide line up with the governments so-called green policies <e>", "<cs> my lords if it is a matter of the age of the child would it not be easy for the child and the parent to give the childs date of birth to the owner of a riding establishment before the child signs on for lessons <e>", "<cs> my lords do her majestys government consider it safe for the public to travel in the cross-channel trains while sitting in their cars in view of the fact that in this country many hundreds of cars catch fire due to self-ignition electrical faults overheating and fuel leaks <e> <s> that often happens when the vehicle is stationary and after the ignition has been switched off <e> <s> the car could be on the cross-channel train and the train could be in the tunnel and under the sea <e>"]
