["<cs> my lords if in the few words that i say on this subject i irritate or indeed annoy the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby i hope he will accept that i entirely agree with his aim that animals not just farm animals although obviously i am most concerned with them must be properly cared for fed and protected from cruelty <e> <s> every livestock farmer knows that if only for financial reasons <e> <s> it is in the way of achieving that objective that i perhaps differ from the noble lord <e> <s> i am pleased indeed to hear that if i take an opposite view to that held by the noble lord lord collison he is not necessarily going to condemn me to the nether regions <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that careers teachers are encouraged to dissuade young people from making as she says a sound vocational choice and in particular from taking an interest in technology and engineering because universities unfortunately do not allow an a level in engineering to be regarded as an entrance qualification <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that our present inflation problem has not been caused by and is not being accompanied at the moment by a rise in farmers returns <e> <s> i should like to ask him whether he will help us out in this matter because we are in a very serious cash flow position with a continuing devaluation of the green pound and this applies not only now but to the future should the pound fall bearing in mind that we had a particularly rough deal from the last government on devaluation of the pound <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble baroness will give way before she moves on to another topic <e> <s> i may have misunderstood her <e> <s> was she saying that it was farming practice that increased the nitrates in the empty reservoirs <e> <s> i do not think that the royal comission put it quite as simply as that i may have misunderstood the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords i speak as someone who has removed hedges burnt straw heaped on the nitrates and pesticides by tractor and aeroplane made silage and who given half a chance would export live lamb to france <e> <s> in fact i speak as someone who tries to make his living from farming and it was therefore with some apprehension that i opened this little blue book blue no doubt in deference to the noble baroness lady white <e> <s> in fact i find that i had no need for such misgivings for although the report does not actually portray me as the archangel gabriel it does not make me out as lucifer either and i hope that by the time i have finished speaking i shall have persuaded your lordships that i need or deserve some minor beatification <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not put myself above my predecessors <e> <s> i think they did exceptionally well <e> <s> however i think our track record is good i do not think we argue over that and i hope i have shown your lordships that it will continue to be a good track record <e> <s> nevertheless i should like to ask the government to look at this report and as a result to consider the role of the ministry of agriculture and in particular adas <e> <s> i hope i have convinced your lordships that we farmers are concerned about what we do <e> <s> we realise how little we know as opposed to some of those who i fear realise only how much they know <e> <s> but despite this or maybe because of this we are in some cases ahead of ministry of agriculture thought and practice <e> <s> i have the highest regard for the ministry of agriculture but i think they should devote more time to the matters raised in this report even at the expense of advising individual farmers and of course definitely at the expense of bureaucratic nonsenses such as the fhds which is surely not adass role <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down would she agree with me that if adas did not have all these regulations to administer and indeed perhaps a few more they would have time to do this job that we obviously both agreed they should be doing <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend on the front bench replies i should like to take him up on one point <e> <s> he said it is up to us in the bee industry to insure ourselves and to look after our own financial arrangements <e> <s> i took the precaution of ringing up a main lloyds broker like the noble earl about insurance <e> <s> he said to me that unless there was a ministry compensation scheme he would be most loath to do any form of insurance <e> <s> as those who have been unfortunate enough to have tb in cattle as happened to me will know you can insure against that very easily because there is a quantifiable risk <e> <s> i shall not go on with this subject but the snag is that we cannot insure until my <e>", "<cs> i too very much welcome the remarks made by the noble friend on the front bench that he will look at this again <e> <s> i am glad that though he did not say so in so many words he implied that he was slightly confused just as i am totally confused over the matter <e> <s> i think that agricultural co-operatives are slightly different from other people <e> <s> we have been encouraged for many years we are terribly weak sellers <e> <s> it is one of the things that is being permanently complained about the minister of agriculture permanently says get out and sell <e> <s> here we are trying to get out and sell as agricultural co-operatives so i would to some extent disagree with my noble friend here and i do not think it will be the last time that i shall do so during this committee stage <e>", "<cs> of course i thank my noble friend for what he has said and i look forward to seeing the form of the amendment that he will bring forward at the next stage <e> <s> i should like to mention one or two matters that i would like him to consider as regards this issue <e> <s> first i must point out again that clause as i see it deals only with the internal arrangements of the board and not the external arrangements <e>", "<cs> my lords could i ask my noble friend whether i heard him correctly that these five wise men are going to encourage the agricultural marketing boards and the agriculture co-operatives <e> <s> if he did say this which i think he did i wonder whether he could pass on those comments to his noble friend before the report stage this afternoon of the competition bill so that they might be able to help us when we come to that matter <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems as though i have to sum this up and i am not sure i am going to do it very well <e> <s> perhaps i may start by saying that in agricultural terms my front bench are quite wrong and they have not answered any of my questions or any of my noble friends questions <e> <s> i am sory to put it so bluntly but the front bench opposite suffered from me last year so you have to suffer from me now <e> <s> you really have not answered the questions <e> <s> it is a disgrace if i may say so <e> <s> we are a revising house <e> <s> there is nothing political in this <e> <s> my noble friends and my old friend lord cledwyn have brought all these points up and you have not answered them <e> <s> first let me say that we are very different <e> <s> agricultural marketing boards are controlled under the agricultural marketing act in every aspect i can tell my noble friend <e> <s> with regard to efficiency audit the minister of agriculture can call for an efficiency audit if he wishes <e> <s> what is the difference between him and the secretary of state for trade might i ask <e> <s> why duplicate the damned thing <e> <s> i am sorry why duplicate it <e> <s> then it is said expose these boards <e> <s> well they can be exposed and scrutinised again under the agricultural marketing act <e> <s> they can be exposed and scrutinised by the consumer committees by the investigation of inquiries <e> <s> anyway what happened to the egg marketing board <e> <s> what happened to the tomato and cucumber board <e> <s> they were exposed once by farmers for inefficiency and once by consumers <e> <s> i do not suppose the secretary of state for trade is going to expose people any better than i can expose them i hope <e> <s> you have not answered any of my questions <e>", "<cs> i take the point my lords but the house does not need addressing because they <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend accepting this amendment <e>", "<cs> then my lords i am afraid you will have to be bored by me again <e> <s> the purpose of the amendment is consumer-orientated <e> <s> as the bill stands complaint could be made by the director general of fair trading to the secretary of state about an agricultural marketing boards uncompetitive action <e> <s> having submitted the complaint the secretary of state can in his wisdom decide to take no action and the matter will end <e> <s> the effect of our amendment would be that the director general of fair trading would have to consult the minister of agriculture as as well as the secretary of state which would mean that the minister of agriculture could advise the secretary of state on the best method to adopt perhaps as we have suggested to the house before through the agricultural marketing act <e> <s> moreover the minister of <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry and i will take the advice of the house on this <e> <s> i am speaking to this amendment <e> <s> i will speak to the other two in a moment altogether as your lordships wish <e> <s> the minister of agriculture has more experience in investigating complaints and that is why we wish him to be consulted <e> <s> he has more experience through the workings of the act <e> <s> as the bill stands the minister of agriculture could be totally unaware of a complaint made about the agricultural marketing boards which are his concern <e> <s> he should realise it if there is a complaint going about <e> <s> i have some more to say about what has happened in this bill but i shall leave that to the next amendment <e> <s> i hope my noble friend will accept this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords as i moved the amendment i think i am in order to finish it <e> <s> my noble friend lord drumalbyn pointed out that outside organisations should look at our affairs if one calls the agricultural marketing boards my affairs <e> <s> may i ask him to look very carefully at what the committees of investigation or at what the consumers associations on those boards do <e> <s> when he has a chance to do so perhaps he will look at them <e> <s> they are very powerful bodies certainly they arc not puppets <e> <s> therefore i think that we are getting outside organisations to look at our affairs <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord think that the petitioners could possibly have thought about their purse <e> <s> i have had experience of this <e> <s> it is a very very expensive thing to petition in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords since during the passage of the act i requested that the government look at certain matters regarding agricultural co-operatives i should like to say a few words about schedule paragraph of the order <e> <s> as i understand it this paragraph excludes those organisations such as agricultural co-operatives that were previously excluded by section of the restrictive trade practices act from being examined by the director general of fair trading <e> <s> again as i understand it this paragraph excludes the director general from looking at the internal affairs of agricultural co-operatives and not as my noble friend lord lyell said the external affairs and practices of a co-operative as a whole with outside traders <e> <s> believe it or not that is exactly <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt my noble friend to explain something <e> <s> i welcomed it on <e>", "<cs> my lords i will be brief <e> <s> many of the points have already been mentioned but i must start by saying that the way the government have handled the presentation of these orders has been appalling crude thoughtless and clumsy <e> <s> the proof of the clumsiness as has already been pointed out in the house is that it is the first time i can remember that every kind of conservationist has been driven into the agricultural lobby <e> <s> however as a farmer in north wales where there are over acres of national park or sites of special scientific interest i want to emphasise just one point which i think was mentioned by my noble friend lord middleton <e> <s> under the new arrangements the farmer wishing to apply for a grant in those sensitive areas will have to clear his application with the national park authority nature conservancy or indeed local authority <e> <s> due to a very recent and very welcome change the government have agreed that once a week adas will call in and inspect these applications with his opposite number in the national park or nature conservancy and they between them will decide which of the schemes might have a conservation problem <e>", "<cs> perhaps it is necessary for me to declare an interest in that this pipeline to which the noble lord lord cledwyn refers goes through my farm in anglesey <e> <s> later on in the committee my noble friend lord caithness is moving an amendment on compensation for farmers and landowners when their land is compulsorily requisitioned <e> <s> without taking away his thunder he will explain how unfair and unjust the method of compensation is and it is one of the reasons why farmers object so very strongly when their land is compulsorily purchased or used <e>", "<cs> in rising to comment on my amendment no <e> <s> my words may enable the noble lord lord evans of claughton to choose my amendment <e> <s> if i must i might support my noble friend lord ridleys minimum as i would call it amendment no <e> <s> a but i would much prefer the government to accept no <e> <s> which is tabled in my name or indeed which is very similar no <e> <s> to which my noble friend lady trumpington spoke and which is tabled in the name of the noble baroness lady stedman <e> <s> i support my amendment or no <e> <s> as the case may be because they protect the structure plan much more strongly than the amendment of my noble friend lord ridley <e> <s> before explaining why i think that is so i should like my noble friend lord bellwin <e>", "<cs> there is considerable feeling about this <e>", "<cs> if everybody has spoken i must tell my noble friend that i am not happy with his reply <e> <s> first i shall reassure him that i do not intend to divide at this moment but i am not saying that i shall not return on report and divide at that stage <e> <s> i am sorry to say this but i think that his reply was thoroughly unsatisfactory <e> <s> obviously i did not put my case clearly and he has not yet got the message <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for that reply though needless to say i do not quite go along with it <e> <s> i would remind him that there is much land particularly in the new towns that has not been returned to agriculture but which could be <e> <s> however be that as it may it seems to me that my noble friend is saying to me that i have the amendment in the wrong place <e> <s> i rather tend to accept that <e> <s> i shall come back on report and try it in clause which is after the register or maybe in the clause that refers to the new towns <e> <s> meanwhile i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that i am surprised at that answer <e> <s> i thought that i would receive a more negative one <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may i should like to rise briefly to support my noble friend on this <e> <s> if my noble friend lord bellwin cannot accept this amendment now i wonder whether he could consider the matter in connection with the proposed countryside and wild life bill and perhaps consideration could then be given to the vexed question of footpaths and in particular to the point raised by my noble friend regarding charging arrangements and their possible standardisation <e> <s> i think that would help in the sensible alteration by farmers of footpaths to suit not only farmers but the public as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support my noble friend and in so doing i must say i cannot quite understand why my noble friend lord bellwin does not look forward with <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support this amendment not because i have any particular desire to cause any more trouble between the district and county councils but because so far despite the words that my noble friend has said he has put nothing into the bill to protect the structure plans and prevent the needless waste of agricultural land <e> <s> all we have had so far i am sorry to say are comforting words and to me and i think a large number of people those words are not good enough <e> <s> something at some stage must be written into this bill to protect the structure plan and agricultural land from being needlessly lost <e>", "<cs> my lords i also have read section and i am completely bemused by it but no doubt somebody can understand it and hence the reason for this amendment <e> <s> if i may say one word i was very pleased to hear the noble lord lord collison talk about the strutt report he must know as much as anybody in this house about that report having served on the committee <e> <s> the point i would particularly make to my noble friend lord beilwin when he says that all is well is that the strutt report said it was not well and that is what i am going on <e> <s> i believe lord collisons remarks emphasise the importance of an amendment i shall move in a moment <e> <s> meanwhile i beg leave to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords if there is some flaw in the drafting of course i should be happy to put it right later <e> <s> the crucial point of difference between my view and that of my noble friend lord bellwin is one of understanding how those of us who live in the country and farm regard the acquisition of our land <e> <s> although my noble friend may convince me and some of your lordships that all of the problems which i and others have raised are taken care of by the department of the environment or government and that of course there would be consultation between the department of the environment and the ministry of agriculture and for that matter any other government department i am sorry to say that that is not how farmers and landowners whose land is being taken see it <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for those remarks <e> <s> if i may say so they are a great comfort to us and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very pleased to hear what my noble friend says on this amendment <e> <s> although i have made some fairly abrasive remarks about how the government do or do not take agricultural land i fully accept that they are trying exceptionally hard and i thank my noble friend for his remarks <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> i must say that i feel i can never win <e> <s> i thought that we had copied out the whole clause word for word from the no <e> <s> bill <e> <s> but evidently we did not do it correctly because we have motor vehicles muddled up with horses <e> <s> i thank my noble friend for saying that he will do something about the problem at some stage <e> <s> therefore i beg to leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords in the past i have criticised the government occasionally and in the future i may do so again and so i should <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend consider whether it would be possible for exporters to deduct the price of their exporting from the clawback they have to pay to the eec <e>", "<cs> i am sure the noble lord lord donaldson knows that i am never against a bit of compensation <e> <s> it is a question of how much of my soul i am going to have to sell in order to get it <e> <s> i think that in this case i should have to sell too much of my soul in order to get it however much he gave me <e> <s> it would mean as i understand the amendment that occupiers would lose their right to advance notice of orders <e> <s> i may have misunderstood it but i think that is right <e> <s> certainly it would mean that the occupiers would lose their right to refuse to donate their land to an area of special protection <e>", "<cs> i do use very extraordinary words as i think the noble lord knows <e> <s> one can use other words of course but i thought that was as good a word as any <e> <s> the point about this is that it comes to a matter of principle which is always difficult <e> <s> if you make people give or donate or whatever word the noble lord wants to use you are on occasions going to lose their co-operation <e> <s> here is an area i am absolutely in favour of these areas let us be quite clear about that and you really must have the goodwill not only of the occupier but also probably of his neighbours too and i think that any compulsion here will mean that he will quietly shoot the odd goose or whatever it may be <e> <s> i think you must get his cooperation and forcing him to make an area of special protection on his land would not achieve as much as i hope this order would as it stands <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank my noble friend for that contribution <e> <s> it makes me very much happier <e> <s> he is on record as saying that to say the least of it they will make the greatest effort before doing this and omitting to tell the owner and bearing that in mind i beg leave to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for that statement <e> <s> i am sure he understands that i am not entirely happy without looking it up but in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i have my name down to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> as i understand the position my noble friend on the front bench is removing part of the clause and putting in its place amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> if that is correct i should like to speak to that because i have various points to raise on amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend replies may i say that i think the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby realises that this would have major implications for the battery hen industry <e> <s> i am only to happy to go one-for-one with him and pontificate on the opposite side indicating why it is so necessary to have this industry <e> <s> however as the noble lord intimated i do not think that this is the place to discuss such a vast subject and i hope that my noble friend on the front bench will reply to the point straight away before the committee loses a lot of time over it <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that i am in favour of the amendment <e> <s> first since the noble baroness has decided to rewrite the bill i would say that had i been writing it i would have gone completely the other way <e> <s> i would have disregarded the birds act and i would have arranged the schedules accordingly <e> <s> so i start on the opposite side of the road on this <e> <s> i expect that the noble baroness will ask me why i take that view <e> <s> i think that as the bill stands the arrangements for the mammals compared with those for the birds are more simple <e> <s> they are certainly more simple to understand and they are more flexible <e> <s> i hope that the noble baroness will agree that flexibility is very important in legislation relating to the countryside and as in this particuar case to pests <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend the minister responds i should like to say that my name is down on the amendment <e> <s> i feel much more strongly about it than my noble friend lord mowbray <e> <s> i think that we are in great danger as a committee to answer the point the noble lord lord melchett raised of appearing to make ourselves very stupid in the eyes certainly of any agriculturist <e> <s> this black-backed gull as your lordships have heard is a vicious animal <e> <s> it does not just take weakly lambs it particularly likes sleepy full fat ones <e> <s> if your lordships <e>", "<cs> i should like to follow up what the noble lord lord kilbracken said <e> <s> as he said the same philosophy was discussed very fully when we were considering clause and i think that on that occasion i supported him and the noble lord lord houghton in the view that it should be done by an authorised person <e> <s> i think that the government promised to take the matter away and to look at it <e> <s> i hope they will take it away on this occasion too <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord houghton withdraws the amendment as i hope he will i think that there is common ground here over authorised persons and there is another point of commonality which i think both the noble lords lord houghton and lord melchett have missed <e> <s> it is the point about adding to the schedule which my noble friend lord ferrers raised <e> <s> believe it or not i should like to see more animals on schedule <e> <s> but if they are to be added before they are added no doubt the minister will consult the relevant people <e> <s> i strongly suspect that one section of such people will be those concerned with agriculture <e> <s> if there is no control over those animals farmers will strongly object to them being put on schedule <e> <s> i think that this clause helps to put more animals on schedule with which i think we all agree <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord will give way <e>", "<cs> if the pine marten is going to be added to schedule of the bill which i would support i wonder whether the government will bear in mind that farmers will need the provisions we have been talking about under clause which the noble lord lord houghton said might not be needed <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank my noble friend very much for that statement <e> <s> i feel it must have something to do with the fact that my noble friend the chief whip is present about to announce a pleasurable experience for us <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend gets up i think that he needs a little bit of support <e> <s> i have always been against the noble lord lord northfield on his bill although i fully accept that what he is moving now is in the spirit of what we agreed when it left this house <e> <s> what slightly worries me and i am sure it worries the noble lord too is that i only saw the final amendment to this at midday today <e> <s> i think it is correct but i honestly cannot say that it is <e> <s> i think that he is as usual and good luck to him <e> <s> pushing his luck here <e> <s> i think the government are right to take it away and look at it and to make sure that it is right <e> <s> perhaps i should say that i hope the government will take it away and <e>", "<cs> i should like to raise two small points <e> <s> first i note that the penalty under clause for contravening this part of the bill could be a two-year prison sentence <e> <s> i wonder whether that is in fact appropriate and whether my noble friend will look at the matter and perhaps let me know the governments reason for such a penalty <e> <s> if he cannot do so now perhaps he will do so at the report stage <e>", "<cs> surely at the end of the day one would have to convince the licensing authority that one had a case and i have always found it difficult to convince civil servants that i have a case they are always very well prepared by ministers and people like the noble lord lord houghton <e> <s> i think the noble lord has missed the point <e> <s> one cannot do it just because it says in the bill that one is providing food for an ornamental duck one must convince the licensing authority that it needs to be done <e>", "<cs> i do not suppose the noble lord lord houghton will be surprised if i say that i am not very keen about this amendment <e> <s> it would as he knows cause considerable delay and by the time we received our licence if we did the damage would be done <e> <s> i would just draw the committees attention to the words <e>", "<cs> i am surprised at what the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge has said <e> <s> this is a question of principle <e> <s> the trouble with the noble lord is that he has no trust whatsoever in anybody <e> <s> these licences will be granted by a licensing authority <e> <s> i happen to have enough faith to think that licences will be granted only in reasonable cases <e> <s> there are going to be cases when the licence will have to be general <e> <s> may i quote an extreme example as did the noble lord <e> <s> there would be need for a general licence in anglesey against greylag geese <e>", "<cs> i do not suppose that the noble lord lord melchett will be surprised if i say that i do not think that the amendment is a very good idea <e> <s> in my view the ministry of agriculture are the best people to look at this problem with regard to pests <e> <s> i think that if <e>", "<cs> the point is taken but on these particular occasions they will only be able to be destroyed if they cause a nuisance <e> <s> i think that the noble lord has taken that point <e> <s> in my view the ministry of agriculture are the best people to deal with this matter <e> <s> if it is given to the secretary of state and the department of the environment it must be remembered that they are not really involved with crops and i can foresee that the first thing that they would have to do is to rush round from marsham street to horseferry road to find out what was happening <e> <s> i do not think that that is a particularly good idea <e> <s> it takes time and adds bureaucracy <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is trying to tie me up and he is very welcome to do so <e> <s> let us face it the first people that they would go to is the nature conservancy council and not necessarily the secretary of state <e> <s> i think that the nature conservancy council must be the first people <e> <s> indeed they are duty bound to consult them <e>", "<cs> they would do so <e> <s> the noble lord is interpreting me wrongly in thinking that if it were a rare animal they would not consult <e> <s> it says shall consult <e> <s> if there is a rare bird that is harming crops no responsible official of the ministry of agriculture is not going to consult the nature conservancy council of course he will do so <e>", "<cs> since most of the time i seem to be against the opposition front bench it gives me great pleasure to support the noble baroness here <e> <s> i entirely take her point that by and large prison sentences are not appropriate in these cases but extra fines most certainly are <e>", "<cs> i have one other question to ask on the clause <e> <s> i did raise it on the question that clause stand part <e> <s> that is the question of whether imprisonment is the correct punishment for offences here <e> <s> under clauses to it is three months imprisonment under clause it is up to two years <e> <s> i fully supported the amendment to increase the fines i have no objection at all to that <e> <s> but i am not at all happy that imprisonment is the right thing to do here <e> <s> it fills our gaols and i see no purpose in it whatever <e> <s> i would hope that my noble friend will take this away and if he cannot give me an answer now perhaps he can give me an answer later <e>", "<cs> i could tell the noble lord lord melchett that on quite a few occasions the minister of agriculture and the secretary of state act jointly not only in this bill but in the local government bill as well <e> <s> here under clause they act jointly and it seems to me that perhaps it would be more logical that if they act jointly in clause they should act jointly to appoint those bodies who are going to advise them <e> <s> it is not a vitally important point but there is a definite precedent for it and i think for them to be seen to be consulting with the minister of agriculture may help a little <e> <s> there is certainly a precedent for it <e>", "<cs> when the noble lord comes to move all his many amendments under part ii i hope he will bear that particular philosophy in mind that it is making it very much more difficult for us <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that my noble friend had to say that <e> <s> we have given very detailed discussion as to what should be included in which schedule in relation to creatures which should or should not be killed <e> <s> i cannot see why in the future when we put creatures on to a schedule or take them off a schedule the matter should not be discussed in parliament <e> <s> it is proposed to have a negative resolution but that is not very satisfactory <e> <s> however at this stage i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness has quoted a case about which i know nothing <e> <s> nor do i suspect she knows the details of this farmer in suffolk <e> <s> she is talking about having statutory controls to stop that <e> <s> in that case they had them but they did not work <e> <s> i am absolutely in agreement with her in suggesting that what he did was terrible but the controls did not stop him did they <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether i am allowed to speak at this stage but i should like to make one point to the noble baroness <e> <s> this amendment describes the conditions that are needed to become what i call a super site of special scientific interest and i think we are right in that respect <e> <s> as regards the point that i think the noble baroness has made i understand that the ncc grade their sites and <e> <s> i think that there are about grade i sites <e> <s> they would in fact fall into this category of a super sssi <e> <s> the point that i am trying to make and i have no doubt that the noble lord lord melchett knows this is that there are only of those at risk the other are not at risk may i say thank god <e> <s> because of farmers and landowners who are not putting them at risk <e> <s> so when it is said that there are only that will be covered by the clause we are in fact talking about which is a rather different story

of sites have not been damaged and that is the point that the noble lord misses <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord give way for a moment <e> <s> can he explain why he thinks he and the planning authorities are better at deciding what should or should not happen in the countryside than the farming community <e> <s> he has not quite explained that to me <e>", "<cs> i am absolutely delighted to agree with the noble lord lord melchett <e> <s> the reply was quite incomprehensible to me <e> <s> of course i shall study what my noble friend said but in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i do not think that was a very good answer <e> <s> i shall consider what was said <e> <s> i do not think my noble friend is right or i misunderstood him <e> <s> i am talking about roads other than motorways <e> <s> he said that on some occasions the authority may be prepared and i should prefer should be prepared <e> <s> finally i must say to my noble friend that if the government cannot afford to do their little bit and quite honestly he did not give me much encouragement as i think noble lords will agree i do not see why you should expect farmers to do better although they will <e> <s> meanwhile i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i will agree though if i were on the other benches i suppose i would not <e> <s> if it can be done in two months for capital grants i really cannot understand why it cannot be done in two months in this case <e> <s> however i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> all i can say to my noble friend is that he has not persuaded me but i will reluctantly withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend replies i wish briefly to say a few words in support of this proposal <e> <s> i was particularly interested in the remark of my noble friend lord bellwin on a previous amendment i think it was the one before last when he said that the role of the bill was to provide for pedestrians and riders not vehicles <e> <s> this amendment may not be correct but it emphasises the need that arises here since it would require the authority to take note of the state of the path before reclassifying it as my noble friend lord monk bretton said <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend on the front bench will see the point of the amendment <e>", "<cs> i was delighted to hear the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby in such good form <e> <s> occasionally it has occurred to me that when the noble lord lord houghton moves amendments they have a certain difference from mine <e> <s> i have one very quick question to ask my noble friend on the front bench <e> <s> as i understood him he was saying that if a path of any sort has been dedicated for more than years the case that is made in the bill under clauses <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that my noble friend on the front bench thinks i am sniping at him but i have to support this amendment if only out of consistency <e> <s> i hope therefore that when he sums up he will be able to give some positive reply that he will make some effort to accommodate the noble lord lord melchett <e>", "<cs> had given notice of his intention to move amendment no <e> <s> a <e>", "<cs> no i do not wish to move the amendment <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend replies i think the noble lord lord houghton is going to get a rather disappointing reply but could he between now and report look very carefully at the amendment moved by my noble friend lord caithness because i think he might find that he would be rather in favour of that if he looked at it carefully <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether when my noble friend takes this away he could look at what is happening in lincolnshire where the lincolnshire county council have entered into close consultation with the farmers particularly over these green roads <e> <s> they have insisted for instance that the road should be say feet wide and if the farmer has knocked down a hedge as i think my noble friend has suggested we occasionally do they have insisted that it be put back <e> <s> they have also helped the farmers tidy up the lanes in places and i think it would profit my noble friend if he looked at what lincolnshire is doing in this matter <e>", "<cs> i have one or two questions to ask my noble friend <e> <s> these amendments highlight my worry that the thrust of the bill is to make footpaths into bridleways or even byways open to all traffic and bridleways into byways open to all traffic and indeed to motor-cyclists as well <e> <s> what steps should a landowner or indeed a rambler take should he find horses on a footpath <e> <s> surely the person on the horse would merely say to the apprehender i have reason to believe that this path was previously a bridleway and he would continue to ride there <e> <s> what does a landlord or a rambler do in that case <e> <s> he might not want horses on that path <e>", "<cs> if my noble friend would give way i have got an answer in my amendment no <e> <s> c which deals with equestrian traffic <e>", "<cs> on the noble lords first question i would point out that it is covered in subsection of my amendment <e> <s> of course he would have to keep the dog on a lead <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> i have no intention of pressing it if it is worrying him <e>", "<cs> i must say that i did not realise that your lordships were as fond of sheep as i am and my noble friend lady elliot <e> <s> i feel as a result that there is hope for your lordships house yet <e> <s> i have listened with the greatest interest to the points raised and i am particularly impressed with the measure of support that i got from all parts of the committee including the noble lord lord melchett in <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment <e> <s> there is no question here of taking away the power of the individual also to make a diversion and in this connection i would remind my noble friend lord bellwin that we have not heard anything about the governments view on diversions <e> <s> this is an important subject and i am wondering whether my noble friend would care to make a statement now on diversions and their use or perhaps he would prefer to do that at another time <e>", "<cs> i am a little troubled still because i wonder whether the powers in the highways act referred to have worked satisfactorily or not <e> <s> if they have i should have thought that there was something to be said for using them again <e> <s> this is a matter which needs going into carefully <e> <s> what worries me is the fact that this kind of thing is what fossilises the rights-of-way system <e> <s> what i wonder and should like confirmation of is whether the government presumably they do pay regard to the white paper <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord would tell me how we are to get the cows in calf or does that not matter <e>", "<cs> certainly there have been fatalities with bulls but can the noble lord give me one example where there has been any fatality or any danger with beef bulls running on footpaths <e> <s> to my knowledge and to the knowledge of the ministry of agriculture there has not <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will give way it may be that those figures are right i do not know but the fact that a footpath goes through a field means it is very likely to be a grass field rather than an arable field <e> <s> hence i suspect that that number is not correct in regard to the number of fields into which you could put your bull <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i might set one matter straight because i think my noble kinsman has been rather unfair to mr battell <e> <s> when this question arose local farmers nearby because the farming community was somewhat worried about it did approach him and it was found that certainly <e>", "<cs> i could give full details to my noble kinsman about what happened but in fact the tree preservation order was imposed last year and was contested by mr battell who managed to have the order cancelled by the secretary of state for the environment <e> <s> in fact he had been doing this work for three weeks <e> <s> i am not saying whether or not he should have done it environmentally but he was totally within the law and was wrongly reported <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that we have not had a more helpful debate on this but there are one or two points which i could perhaps answer <e> <s> the first is that i think you can have an inquiry before a road traffic order and i see no reason why you should not here <e> <s> the second thing is something that my noble friend lord renton raised <e> <s> the point that i think perhaps he missed is the great help that this would be in controlling abuse on footpaths which we have discussed at considerable length <e> <s> at the moment you have no way of stopping horses being ridden down footpaths <e> <s> i have such a footpath on my own farm which causes a great deal of aggravation <e> <s> the horses come down it and we are normally blamed for allowing them to do so <e> <s> we do not in fact but there is no way in which we can stop them because they say that they have ridden down it or their grandfathers did for years <e> <s> this could control that <e>", "<cs> in which case i hope the government will find that they are able to support it <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it the noble lord has met our objection that we would be allowed to shoot pests such as woodpigeon and he is applying this amendment only to schedule part i starting with capercaillie <e> <s> in that case i would be very happy to support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords once again i am afraid i cannot support the noble lord on this <e> <s> it poses the question of compulsion to start with <e> <s> i am not in favour of compulsion <e> <s> once you start compulsion you will lose goodwill <e> <s> i am all for seeing these sites set up but if you compel a farmer or owner to take part i am sure you will somehow or other lose the site <e> <s> apart from that if you are going to have compulsion i think you should have an appeal i do not think this amendment does allow that although i am sure the noble lord will put me right if i am wrong <e> <s> lastly there is the question of compensation <e> <s> i do not know how you are going to compensate <e> <s> technically it is very difficult <e> <s> what do you compensate him for <e> <s> the last point is the one which the noble lord made specifically to me that it is not going to affect farming operations <e> <s> i really cannot quite understand that <e> <s> you are not going to be able to disturb the area and neither should you if it is a bird sanctuary <e> <s> you must not go in during the nesting time <e> <s> this may well affect farming operations <e> <s> you might want to plough it i know that is rather an extreme case but you may want to go in and spray for some reason <e> <s> so i do think there is an agricultural content even though <e>", "<cs> my lords i must remind the noble lord lord melchett that ordinary people do not read bills and he is not an ordinary person <e> <s> apart from that i support the principle of the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am perfectly happy with that answer and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i have quite a few queries which are rather complicated <e> <s> the first is a question to my noble friend which is as follows am i correct in assuming from the remarks made previously by my noble friend lord avon in connection with amendment no <e> <s> which applies to birds but is similar to this amendment that if a licence has been refused in relation to a particular species under clause it is not then permitted for a farmer to take emergency action for birds under clause or for animals under clause <e> <s> if that is so and i think i understood my noble friend aright i ask what would happen should a licence not be granted say today for shooting brent geese because it was said that there were not enough brent geese to cause trouble and then tomorrow or even next year i get an enormous influx of these birds and i am not then allowed to take emergency action to do anything about it <e>", "<cs> my lords i too thank my noble friend for the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it would be churlish of me having taken such an active anti-part in this bill not to congratulate the noble lord lord northfield for getting this through <e> <s> if i took a part he would accuse me in the words of this bill of causing or about to cause damage to his bill and he would therefore be entitled to shoot me with any smooth bore gun with i hope a single projectile weighing not less than grammes <e> <s> i congratulate him indeed for getting this through <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very pleased to hear that reply <e> <s> i hope perhaps that my noble friend will be able to write to me before third reading so that i know what to do before that stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend again <e> <s> i must say that from the letter which i received i thought that it did do so <e> <s> however my noble friend is going to write to me <e> <s> i am glad that other people are in the dark too as regards this matter <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i think my noble friend was also speaking to no <e> <s> a <e> <s> is that not right <e>", "<cs> there is one point i should like to raise here <e> <s> as i understand it after two years the licence will terminate <e> <s> if the pest is still a nuisance can my noble friend assure me that the system for renewing the licence will be simple and indeed will not cost anything <e>", "<cs> my lords briefly i should like to support this <e> <s> my feeling is that if the cost is very high there will be a terrible temptation not to apply for a licence <e> <s> on the other hand if the cost is very low the bureaucracy will not pay for the cost of the licence <e> <s> so either way i reckon there should be no cost <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend particularly for the removal of the prison sentence for which i asked <e> <s> i hope that we shall all be able to pay all the fines that will be imposed for planting bulbs in the woods <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend gets that right before third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords i am particularly concerned that the noble lord lord melchett thinks <e>", "<cs> my lords the real snag is that we are all agreed that no money is available <e> <s> i am entirely with my noble friend lord buxton of alsa <e> <s> we want the greatest number of sites to be conserved and if no money is available the voluntary system will go much further than the compulsory one <e> <s> we are both on the same side it is just a question of how one looks at it <e> <s> i could quote thousands of cases where farmers are looking after very good sites for nothing at all <e> <s> they will not even enter into a <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister replies i should be interested in what the noble lords lord melchett and lord winstanley might have to say about this <e>", "<cs> i feel my lords that i must tell the noble lord lord winstanley that i too am suspicious <e>", "<cs> my lords with that final remark by my noble friend i am happy to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not necessarily say local authorities <e> <s> i said highway authorities which might be the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords i must put my noble friend lord ridley right i do not think that he was here when i moved this amendment in committee so i must put him right <e> <s> in the past local authorities which are the highway authorities have behaved quite exemplary <e> <s> i can give an example in gwynedd where they put a road through my farm and replaced the wall superbly <e> <s> unfortunately in the construction of a by-pass in gwynedd however the secretary of state for wales is behaving quite disgracefully <e> <s> that is basically the pattern <e> <s> the local authorities are all right but the secretary of state for wales and the ministry of transport are disgraceful <e> <s> so i am not complaining here <e> <s> it is the inequality of it <e> <s> you get the situation of a local authority building a wall so far and then coming to the ministry of transport road and then nothing at all or just a barbed-wire fence <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that the noble lord lord melchett was particularly plausible today which makes me very suspicious of him <e> <s> he did in his own words try to drive a cart and horses and then he realised that he should not have used those words because that is exactly what this amendment as i see it tries to do <e> <s> it is what i have marked in my brief as all up and no down <e> <s> it is easy enough to make better rights of way that is footpaths into bridleways and bridleways into byways open to all <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend decides what to say i like quite a lot of what has been said but i am not at all happy that that is what it says in the bill <e> <s> unfortunately i have not moved on to the new bill i am afraid from laziness and i still do not think that my noble friend has answered the question that i put to him at the committee stage in column <e> <s> however i shall let my noble friend decide what he is going to do about it because that is what is worrying me and i am not sure that the bill says what he has said or what i thought he said <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend makes up his mind what he wishes to do with this amendment i must say to my noble friend on the front bench that i really cannot quite accept his argument <e> <s> it does seem that this falls in with all the principles of this side of the house in that it would cut down unnecessary bureaucracy <e> <s> all we are asking here is that the work which has been done by the local authority to reclassify should not now have to be done once again <e> <s> but i leave it to my noble friend lord monk bretton to decide what action he will take <e>", "<cs> my lords i am getting in a bit of a muddle <e> <s> is the noble lord lord melchett also speaking to amendment no <e> <s> ya <e> <s> he spoke rather quickly and i do not quite understand whether or not he is speaking to that amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend replies i spoke to this at committee stage and i must support this amendment for all the reasons i supported similar amendments on local government land planning <e> <s> i would just say that in the article my noble friend quoted which appeared in <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his answer <e> <s> i must say that i feel as though i cannot do right <e> <s> i tried spicer and there was one reason so i listened to your lordships and i changed it and i am still wrong <e> <s> i suppose that it is my fault for trying to change spicer <e> <s> however of course the points that the noble lord lord melchett raised are valid but i cannot resist telling him that earlier on when we accused his drafting of being slightly defective he said oh it does not matter about the drafting it is the principle that matters <e> <s> that is what i say to him now <e> <s> it is the principle that i am still trying to establish <e> <s> i accept the points that he made and those made by my noble friend lord massereene <e> <s> yes perhaps six months is too long <e>", "<cs> my lords in those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had another long discussion on this amendment <e> <s> i am put in a difficult position because i want this amendment very badly or something in this form and something in this form i am going to get at some stage <e> <s> i am raising my voice just like the noble earl lord avon did in reply to me <e> <s> i am probably going to disappoint the house now i am not going to press the amendment <e> <s> i still think i am not absolutely right in my drafting though those who drafted it for me have done a better job than last time <e> <s> i shall move it on third reading <e> <s> there will be no ifs or buts about it i shall get it right <e>", "<cs> i do not know my lords that is the trouble <e> <s> i think that unless your lordships feel otherwise and it is entirely in your hands to press it if you wish i personally would prefer to leave it until third reading because i think i would get it quite right then and i feel sure that i would have your support again <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope my noble friend will not accept this <e> <s> the equivalent law on barbed wire does not work well <e> <s> cases arise where a walkers loose coat flaps on to the wire he has heard that this is illegal he complains the authority sends out an abatement letter usually without even being able to check the facts or view the site <e> <s> it is costly bureaucratic and a legal tangle <e> <s> if a fence is an obstruction it should be prosecuted as such <e> <s> the amendment is unnecessary and it will encourage aggravation between farmers and walkers <e>", "<cs> my lords bridleways may be walked down by walkers <e> <s> as i pointed out earlier if the bridleway becomes rutted the walker is inclined to go to the side <e> <s> i also said rider <e> <s> i would remind your lordships that you are taking a walk or a ride in the country and not in parliament square <e> <s> the noble lord lord spens did not tell your lordships which <e>", "<cs> my lords i see <e> <s> i am not sure whether or not my noble friend is accepting this amendment <e> <s> if not i shall have to delay the house <e>

should like to thank my noble friend for that statement and also to thank him very much for the letter that he wrote in the intervening period explaining the problem which i think is now resolved <e>", "<cs> my lords in answering some of the points that have been made i should like to make it clear first that this is obviously a nonparty matter and even the agricultural lobby the mafia as i believe we are called by the noble lord lord houghton are somewhat divided on it which i am sure will please him <e> <s> to answer the point made by my noble friend lord avon probably on this occasion he needs driving mirrors <e> <s> if he thinks the law is working correctly then i would support the remarks of my noble friend lady eliot of harwood dead is not a very good record <e> <s> added to that as the noble viscount lord thurso said damage is not in death but in abortion and malpresentation at birth <e> <s> i have experienced a great deal of that and it is heartbreaking <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend for tabling this amendment <e> <s> i hope he will not think i am ungracious when i say that i am surprised he has changed his mind in view of the way he treated me earlier on in relation to this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am pleased to have had this discussion <e> <s> there seems to be an agreement here that we have not quite got it right and i wonder whether my noble friend on the front bench could give some assurance by nodding his head that it would be looked at again perhaps in another place <e> <s> we have tried to get the right words but i agree with the noble lord lord melchett that they are not quite right and i think it wants looking at again <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend very much <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend <e> <s> he has given me two amendments and i am sure that he would be hurt if i did not thank him <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that i would get that reception <e> <s> i hope that the parliamentary draftsmen will not think ill of me if i call them spoilsports <e> <s> i am sure that they would take it in the spirit that i meant it <e> <s> by and large i have achieved what i wanted to achieve to point out that we as farmers realise our responsibilities in the countryside <e> <s> i am sure that your lordships will appreciate the point i made <e> <s> the last matter that i shall raise on this bill is one of agreement between us all about the philosophy behind it <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment

livestock in transit <e> <s> being a farmer i shall concentrate my remarks on the welfare aspect but as i am being constantly told by governments of all colours that i should try to sell my goods more efficiently i have to remind your lordships that exporting is a vital outlet <e> <s> this bill would discriminate against british farmers and exporters without similar conditions being put on our eec partners <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> can my noble friend say how in addition to the care and trouble that the ncc have taken in this matter and if it is designated this area will become the largest inshore site of special scientific interest in england and wales the government will be seen and heard by the inhabitants of the berwyns to exercise their duty under section of the act <e> <s> that section reads <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought the noble lord lord melchett had a rather weak case on the latter three amendments but again i support him on the amendment with which we are dealing <e> <s> i cannot see any party point in this matter <e> <s> i too have read the commons debate <e> <s> it is not for me to comment on it but i can find no reason whatever for changing <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble earl for this particular amendment as i was worried over the foodstuffs side earlier on <e>", "<cs> my lords it appears to me that there will be a delay between the time of making an order and assessing compensation <e> <s> this is contrary to present practice <e> <s> my other point is that although subsection b gives guidance to owners and ocucpiers guidance is really needed on depreciation of a tenants interest <e> <s> i do not think that there is any such guidance in the bill <e> <s> i will fully understand if my noble friend cannot give me detailed answers to those two points in fact it is not really my subject but that of my noble friend lord caithness who would like to thank the government very much for tabling this amendment <e> <s> but perhaps my noble friend the minister will give some thought to the two points i have raised because i believe compensation law would be breached <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say a few words about grants because the question of grants has been bandied around the floor <e> <s> for better or worse every civilised country supports its agriculture and the way for better or for worse that we in this country do it is through grants <e> <s> i think i am right in saying that in france it is done by way of a cheap interest rate <e> <s> if your lordships are saying which you are saying that certain farmers should not be entitled to grants because they are in a certain area you are discriminating against those particular farmers <e> <s> i put it to your lordships that if we had cheap interest rates as in france would you say that my neighbour on snowdon should not have cheap interest rates <e> <s> that would be grossly unfair because with the best will in the world i think that on the lowland i am better off than he is and i would still get the grants <e> <s> so let us be careful about this grant business <e> <s> if you take away the grant you must give the farmer something else instead and this is what your lordships are going to give him in the bill <e> <s> i pray that your lordships do not muddle yourselves over the question of grant <e> <s> i am not going further into grant because it concerns the entire system of agricultural support and there are many people here better qualified than i to have a -hour debate on that <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e> <s> has he any evidence to show that those institutions that have owned and are owning behave irresponsibly <e> <s> because my record is that they do not <e> <s> can he give me any <e>", "<cs> my lords with your lordships permission i should

that my original amendments were nos <e> <s> b and c and the parliamentary draftsmen decided they did not quite like it that way and made a rather larger affair of it <e> <s> i am afraid i have to

month will be insufficient to consider and possibly initiate an offer and it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to stop the rush but i must make a few remarks on these amendments particularly as my noble friend lord buxton obliquely referred to this amendment when he <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to speak briefly on this <e> <s> regarding the words reasonable belief and at the material time with

noble lord lord mackie i fear i can find nothing else to agree with <e> <s> i would like to put the points that worry and concern me <e> <s> paragraphs and suggest that cereal prices are relatively too high and support prices should be fixed at a lower level <e> <s> if your lordships are saying and i think my noble friend lord brooke-borough was certainly saying that livestock producers have fared worse than their cereal brothers i would reply briefly in two ways <e> <s> first they will not achieve prosperity by improverishing their cereal brothers and they will not achieve prosperity by throwing out lock stock and barrel the whole of the cap <e> <s> what are they wanting <e> <s> are they wanting to go back to deficiency payments or do they want a complete revision of the cap including article which i will be happy to give to any noble lord who wants to read it afterwards <e> <s> perhaps in a lighter vein i might misquote the old beer advertisement by saying that all farming is bad but some is worse than others <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> my lords if i made such a remark it was certainly not my intention to do so <e> <s> i think i said that both should be treated equally and that you do not make one rich by making the other poor <e> <s> certainly article applies to both <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that all noble lords will agree that internal drainage boards have an important job to do and that they do it efficiently <e> <s> if this job was not done some of our most productive land would revert to marsh and would result in a loss of wealth both to the farmer and indeed to the nation <e> <s> the result would be indirectly more unemployment <e> <s> your lordships may not all agree with me but i believe that unemployment is our nations worst evil and i am sorry to say that i would sacrifice a bird or two for a job or two <e> <s> my noble friends lord buxton and lord onslow called attention in their speeches to modern methods of drainage and farming <e> <s> as a result the countryside can he changed dramatically overnight and things now are different than they were <e> <s> so we should look at things again and maybe call a halt <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank my noble friend for that reply and ask him whether he would do all in his power to alert the public to the unreliability particularly of the cartridge type fire extinguishers especially on agricultural vehicles <e> <s> bearing this in mind i wonder whether my noble friend would agree that perhaps we would all be a lot better off if we reverted to sand and water and a bucket and spade <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend agree that the figures do show that farmers can co-operate successfully with the national park authority particularly when helped by the ministry of agriculture officials in adas <e> <s> secondly due to the wildlife and countryside act at present if one farms in a national park and on a site of special scientific interest one has to apply to both the national park authority and the nature <e> <s> conservancy council to clear the operation <e> <s> would it be possible in future for that to be altered so as to apply to only one preferably the national park authority <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to congratulate my noble friend lord shrewsbury on his maiden speech <e> <s> i must say that i was somewhat sorry to hear that his home town was a base for attacking the principality but perhaps they have got over that now <e> <s> my noble friend was kind enough to speak to me before he made his maiden speech expressing a certain amount of nervousness <e> <s> i think that we have all suffered from that and indeed i think that we all continue to do so <e> <s> i am afraid that that is with him for the rest of the time that he addresses this house <e> <s> however i hope that he will continue to address us <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to interrupt my noble and learned friend indeed i am fearful of doing so but he has now gone on to my next two amendments and i was going to say something about them separately because they involve a slightly different problem from trespass <e>", "<cs> i knew that my noble and learned friend would get me in a muddle and of course he has <e> <s> i would start by saying that he trespassed very strongly on my next two amendments and if he is going to do that i do not see why i should not trespass on them too which is what i think he wants me to do <e> <s> we moved on to what i call my access to the countryside bill which he answered but i do not think he really answered at all satisfactorily <e>", "<cs> with those very kind remarks of my noble and learned friend of course i will withdraw this amendment <e> <s> i am sure that if he keeps on pushing at the wheel we shall one day get these minor adjustments to the law through in a satisfactory bill <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> i shall not be able to answer all the questions <e> <s> probably in any event i would not know the answers <e> <s> however i shall try to answer some of them <e> <s> first the whole committee is agreed that the present state of the law makes it look an ass in so far as there is vagueness in it <e> <s> the noble lord lord mishcon brought this out and so did my noble friend lady sharples <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to my noble and learned friend for that reply and if he puts his case so charmingly and forcefully to his colleagues i am sure that by report or third reading he will have something more pleasant to tell me and i shall not have to take up the cudgels again <e> <s> meanwhile i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the question asked by the noble lord lord underhill on the armitage report though i have to say to him that i do not really agree with his view despite his persuasiveness and indeed despite the help from his noble friend lord davies of leek <e> <s> i would only say to the noble lord lord davies of leek that perhaps he has been absent from wales too long and that he has got the wrong end of the stick on this occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend will give way for a moment the real problem that is worrying us mostly is the updating of the terms <e> <s> if he assures me that that is one of the things at which the government will be looking it will make me happy <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether my noble friend is aware that one of the problems when a school closes is that the trustees of that schools playing ground cease to get any rent <e> <s> therefore they cannot pay any rates to the local authority and they have to sell the playing ground <e> <s> i wonder whether my noble friend could tell me what action if any the government or local government could take to allow these playing fields to remain playing fields <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank noble lords for the remarks that they have made on this amendment <e> <s> i accept that it has become a controversial matter though in my opinion there was no need for it to be so <e> <s> i find it rather difficult to say and if i use the word idle i hope that my noble and learned friend when i refer to his department as possibly being idle will treat it in the way that it is treated in the army in a fairly good humoured way <e> <s> what happened was that there was a conference nearly a year ago to try to discuss these matters and the three main parties which i have mentioned the central council and the two main organisations that are responsible for or have affairs with land agreed <e> <s> since then it seems to me that not a great deal was done until these last three or four weeks or so but perhaps i am being unfair <e> <s> all i am asking my noble friend which i think i have got from him is that he will keep a watching brief on this matter in case things do go wrong <e> <s> so far they have not gone wrong i am glad to say and he will make some progress which obviously he has by the large detail he gave to me in which case i beg leave to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that my noble and learned friend will have some pity on me rather than that i should on him <e> <s> i make one or two points before we leave the matter <e> <s> one of the remarks that my noble friend lord mottistone made was that traditional terms would be upset <e> <s> it is the traditional terms many of them that we dislike so much because there are unfortunately unscrupulous traders and the noble lord lord mishcon brought this out who keep us out of our money <e> <s> it is those that we are going for <e>", "<cs> my lords of all the papers i have read emanating from sub-committee d i must say that i found this one on national aids by far the most interesting <e> <s> may i thank the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos and his sub-committee for it and for trying to explain to me what an important problem national aids are and worse still what a difficult problem they are to solve <e> <s> i am certainly no nearer to solving it well perhaps just a little nearer than when i started reading the report <e>", "<cs> yes he is <e>", "<cs> i must interrupt my noble friend <e> <s> i did correct myself on that <e>", "<cs> may i thank all noble lords for their tremendous support for the amendment <e> <s> i thank in particular the noble lord lord elystan-morgan for his very helpful and very kind remarks about farmers trying to regulate their own matters <e> <s> but he would say that because he has the great <e>", "<cs> i think i am going to agree with no one <e> <s> first of all there is the noble lord lord melchett i knew our friendship would not last very long and it has not <e> <s> i have not overstated my case and the reason i have not overstated my case is that he does not know what it is like to farm on grade or land he farms in the land of goshen and he can do what he likes and get away with it <e>", "<cs> my lords if it is in order to speak on no <e> <s> first before we go on to the amendment to the amendment i should like to thank my noble and learned friend for tabling this amendment <e> <s> i am not in order <e>", "<cs> my lords i seem to have started a little early last time <e> <s> i should like to thank my noble and learned friend for tabling the first amendment and i hope he will not think me ungrateful because i am asking for more <e> <s> i am only following a good tory principle of trying to do better <e> <s> i would have preferred that the habitual offender was banned <e> <s> i was not able to get that so i am supporting the maximum fine <e> <s> i would ask the government whether it is possible for them to publicise the merit of these straw-burning by-laws to local authorities <e> <s> there are still local authorities in straw-burning areas in the south and east who have no by-laws <e> <s> i know it is not the governments job to tell local authorities what to do but perhaps they could publicise it for it would be very helpful for all in straw-burning areas to have by-laws so that we were all equally treated if we offended against the straw-burning code <e> <s> i hope that the government will accept this amendment of maximum fine <e> <s> if they cannot do that then i ask that they give the house a categorical assurance that by the harvest of the maximum fine will be raised to for contravening the by-laws <e>", "<cs> my lords this question concerning lorry operating centres has a considerable effect on farming and the rural scene <e> <s> therefore i should like to thank my noble friend lord lucas for bringing it to your lordships attention and moreover to thank the government for taking so much trouble and finally tabling this amendment which i am glad to say is proof that they too want to see villages as places where employment is encouraged and not just places for the retired to die <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether my noble friend would allow me to intervene <e> <s> is he saying that he wants shall rather than may now <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much welcome this code and its encouragement of the voluntary approach particularly in relation to landowners and farmers as stated in paragraph of the code <e> <s> i have one question <e> <s> my noble friend said that the nature conservancy council is bound under section of the wildlife and countryside act to offer a management agreement when the agriculture grant is denied <e> <s> my noble friend also confirmed that paragraph of the code means that it is the intention of the nature conservancy council to offer management agreements when the capital grants originate elsewhere and particularly in the eec <e> <s> what i want to know is what is the position of the national park authority <e> <s> will my noble friend encourage that authority to take a similar view to that of the nature conservancy council <e>", "<cs> my lords is it true that the acres referred to in the question was cultivated during the war and that since that time it has fallen into its present disuse and become scrub due to bad agricultural management <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend tell me of any instance so far where a site has been damaged because of lack of funds by the ncc <e> <s> would he agree that perhaps if we talked a little less about the problems of the wildlife and countryside act we might all get on a little bit better <e>", "<cs> my lords although the select committee have implemented the instruction that i moved when this bill was read a second time i would not be honest with your lordships or indeed to myself if i did not admit that i am disappointed that the select committee have not come out on a stronger line on a number of points <e> <s> for instance as my noble friend lord kinnoull mentioned the bill pre-empts the planning commission judgment for a multi-storey car park and quite outside the bill as my noble friend pointed out a large number of compulsory purchase orders that will be required for the new traffic system <e>", "<cs> i beg your lordships pardon if i put it in that way <e> <s> what i said was that i thought the tone of the report gave the impression that the football club i would take back the word honest were acting in a different manner because <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say how pleased i am to hear <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether he is as pleased as i am as a result of the code of practice <e> <s> i should also like to ask my noble friend whether he accepts that it is an essential agricultural practice on some soils to carry out burning <e> <s> in view of the last replies may i also ask my noble friend whether he will bear in mind the great hardship imposed on farmers who have roads pushed through their land against their own will and who then find that they are at risk when they try to burn stubble near a new road <e>", "<cs> my lords i have one query on the vet code if i may call it that and one on the pigs code and a general point concerning all the welfare codes <e> <s> as far as the veterinary code is concerned i am still worried despite the very helpful remarks of my noble friend about part ii <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the idea behind the bill for as a member of a number of agricultural co-operatives and indeed chairman of one for the past four years i am more than conscious of the failure of farmers to bother to market their produce <e> <s> so if i now air a few reservations i hope that your lordships will accept them as constructive although i suspect that i shall not for the first time or even for the last time be chided by my noble friend and other members of your lordships house for not joining in the general euphoria <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships ask whether modern farming methods have had an impact on rural areas <e> <s> the answer of course is yes but farming methods throughout the ages have always had an impact both on the rural and indeed on the urban scene <e> <s> who could argue for example that the black death did not revolutionise agriculture <e> <s> in the conservation field also who could argue that farmers <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether my noble friend would let me interrupt <e> <s> will these committees in fact be chaired by a member of the board or will they not <e>", "<cs> i have two short questions for my noble friend <e> <s> at second reading i believe my noble friend said that the central council would continue to be funded as in the past both by national government and by the eec <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will be able to confirm that this is so and that it will continue when food from britain runs out if it does <e> <s> may i ask my noble friend how much money he thinks will come from food from britain to the co-operative sector <e> <s> does he envisage that the co-operative sector will get say per cent <e> <s> from food from britain or does my noble friend see a much smaller proportion of food from britain money going into the co-operative sector <e> <s> i concede that my noble friend may not want to answer that question because it is up to food from britain but if he is able to give me a guide it will be helpful <e>", "<cs> not quite <e> <s> it was a question of how much they would get from the central council <e>", "<cs> not quite <e> <s> i am sure it is a question which my noble friend cannot answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether my noble friend the leader of the house can help those of us who live in the backwoods and who have other commitments <e> <s> is my noble friend saying that she would rather such members did not take any part in your lordships house for fear of not being able to be present at the end of a debate <e> <s> as my noble friend has said your lordships do sometimes speak for rather a long time <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend lord bellwin for the care and thought contained in his replies and i am also grateful for the other replies that came from various parts of the chamber <e> <s> i do not agree with all of them and particularly with some of the remarks made by the noble lord lord nugent <e> <s> i would of course like more but i can appreciate the very valid points put forward by various speakers <e>", "<cs> i oppose this amendment wearing the hat of someone who has had the privilege of sailing and indeed fishing on many water authority reservoirs particularly oxford <e> <s> in making that remark i hope that i make a true friend of my noble friend lord nugent <e> <s> i know that their record has been first-class as regards their efforts towards recreation <e> <s> indeed as far as welsh water is concerned as opposed to the remarks made by the noble lord lord melchett on the alaw which years ago was made into a reservoir they have segregated areas entirely for wildlife much i must say against my own personal wish which on that reservoir was fishing <e> <s> but i think that they were right in doing so <e> <s> i do not think that it is fair to castigate the water authorities on the recreation line <e>", "<cs> i am afraid i am not satisfied with that answer <e> <s> i am sorry to tell my noble friend that in fact he has not answered any of my questions <e> <s> he has not answered my questions on the or if i may put it that way <e> <s> as the bill is written there is no need to appoint anybody responsible for fisheries or land drainage <e> <s> they could all be concerned with some other matter <e>", "<cs> i knew it was a mistake to let the noble lord lord melchett say anything <e> <s> he says that he finds my arguments difficult to comprehend and i find his impossible but i do try to listen and sometimes i feel that he does not <e> <s> i must remind him with the greatest respect that he did not actually listen to my argument at the beginning of this debate as he was kind enough to admit <e> <s> perhaps if he went away and read this in tomorrows <e>", "<cs> i am getting in a terrible muddle now <e> <s> as i read the amendment it is only the <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord lord melchett <e> <s> i always try to understand what he is thinking as opposed to what he is writing <e> <s> but i can only understand what he has written in the amendment so we are on the same net <e> <s> if i may continue if that is the case the people who will get the cost benefit analysis are the ncc and they will look at it <e> <s> my question and i am going to answer my noble friend lord skelmersdale is what will they do with it <e> <s> here we are giving a cost benefit analysis to an organisation i am sure that i shall now get into trouble which is greatly over-pressurised <e> <s> many are great experts on birds butterflies and bees but one thing that they are not experts on is human nature and the whole set-up in agriculture <e> <s> until they get to that stage and they will given years like the ministry of agriculture who took that time before they were confident there is no point in giving them this information <e> <s> their job is to advise the minister which they do on the scientific side of a particular development not to have the final veto <e>", "<cs> i can see that the noble baroness was at school much more recently than i was <e> <s> of course it does not prevent them <e> <s> but what i am saying is that they are trained in that way and they are not trained in agriculture as such <e> <s> meet any of them and they will be the first people to admit that <e> <s> they are not given an overall training <e>", "<cs> i want before my noble friend replies just to put the record straight although the noble baroness lady white i am sure will not believe me <e> <s> but many farmers believe it or not think that the drainage committees bend over backwards against their interests and in favour of the conservation interests <e> <s> it is not just on the one side <e> <s> we also feel sometimes that they lean over backwards the other way <e> <s> the other point that i would make which was made by my noble friend on the front bench is that the drainage committees are duty bound by statute to do that and presumably if they offend against that statute they can be taken to task <e>", "<cs> my amendment follows amendment no <e> <s> and is very much on the same lines <e> <s> therefore with the permission of your lordships committee and in order to save time i should like to speak to it at this stage <e> <s> my concern in my amendment is that members of consumer committees as proposed in the bill though nominated from organisations outside the water authority can be vetoed by the water authority <e> <s> i hope and indeed judging from what i have heard so far i believe that your lordships will agree that such a state of affairs is not a good principle <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe this amendment to be divisive <e> <s> to me it once again draws attention i believe destructively to the divisions that sadly exist in the countryside <e> <s> in this case the division is not between farmer and conservationist but between recreationist and wildlife and conservationist <e> <s> as the amendment is written your lordships will appreciate the relevance of the word or which in practice will mean that the recreationist and by that i mean the sailor or the fisherman could never get a place on the authority <e>", "<cs> my lords when during the administration of justice bill we discussed this problem of occupiers liability both stupidly and unfairly i accused my noble and learned friend of not appreciating the farmers problems and doing nothing about them <e> <s> i say stupidly because i was unable to appreciate the points of law of my noble and learned friend and unfairly because i failed to believe that he would do anything about the situation despite his remarks which he has quoted again today that he hoped that a bill would be produced which had round and not square wheels and that it would go forward with acclamation and success <e> <s> may i suggest that the vehicle of my noble and learned friend has neither square nor round wheels in modern parlance it has done better <e> <s> he has put the skids under it <e> <s> i am today proved to be a proper doubting thomas but i do not altogether regret that <e> <s> when dealing with nature it is usually best to go forward slowly <e> <s> my noble and learned friends years i believe as a farmer prior to his changing to another profession may have encouraged him to carry that philosophy into making new laws <e>", "<cs> my lords as this is my first opportunity i should like to congratulate my noble friend lord belstead on his new job on the front bench <e> <s> as he is a farmer i am sure he will enjoy working with farmers <e> <s> it is therefore rather sad for me to have to tell my noble friend that i am not very keen about this particular order and the way in which it has been introduced <e> <s> no doubt it will not be the first time nor the last <e>", "<cs> i am very pleased that my noble and learned friend accepts the principle of the amendment which is all that i am particularly concerned about as i told him earlier on <e> <s> i am not able to master the intricacies of these legal points <e> <s> i accept however that the place for this amendment is probably where the noble and learned lord has suggested and i await with great interest what he says on amendment because honestly i do not think that i ought to know which is the correct wording ought or has reasonable grounds <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> i too was somewhat worried by the noble and learned lords ladder story on second reading <e> <s> before withdrawing this amendment let me say that i hope that my noble and learned friend will give it some thought between now and the report stage <e> <s> as i understand it minor offences such as the stealing of apples would be covered by the theft act as would be for instance stealing mushrooms or wild flowers although wild flowers i suspect would be covered under the wildlife and countryside act <e>", "<cs> i made an initial remark about little legal problems of drafting but i now feel that they are somewhat more than little <e> <s> nevertheless i am very grateful for the attention which i appreciate is constructive given by noble lords in trying to clarify the position <e> <s> my worry is still that if any charge is made does the occupier become liable and i understand from my noble and learned friend that the answer is yes maybe <e> <s> my noble and learned friend says that i am asking too much <e> <s> having obtained a concession which i accept under the unfair contract terms act yes i am now asking for another one <e>", "<cs> we have it also for charity <e> <s> we also have it for the rnli and other organisations <e> <s> they do rather better than ours for our own cases <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment is similar to the amendment which i moved in committee <e> <s> i support it again for two reasons <e> <s> the first is because i fear that during committee my little legal drafting problems assumed a major role as opposed to the minor one that i hoped they would <e> <s> the point i failed to make but which my noble friend lord campbell of alloway has made so well today is that i am firmly of the opinion that the farmer owes less of a responsibiltiy to the criminal trespasser than to the innocent one <e> <s> i am not at all sure that the words of the amendment achieve that objective but i hope that my noble and learned friend will be able to accept the principle that there should be a difference a less onerous duty on me as the occupier of a property to the criminal than to the innocent trespasser <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble and leaned friend says that he is not repentant and i am not repentant <e> <s> but i intend to continue to sin because the noble lord lord mishcon left me as a layman <e>", "<cs> my lords although i am not strictly in order to congratulate my noble kinsman lord howard of henderskelfe on his maiden speech i think i am entitled to do so because for a very long time my father was his guardian and trustee <e> <s> my noble kinsman tried so hard to be uncontroversial but he supported short-term tenancies and disliked the act and perhaps clause <e> <s> it looks as though i and he will have the same sort of stormy relationship that our forebears had <e> <s> i do not know what duty the noble lord lord howard owes to his guardians son <e> <s> i feel sure that there should be a duty on the noble lord at least to follow me into the same lobby <e> <s> if not no doubt the chief whip would support me in an amendment to the fifth commandment <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i ask him this question <e> <s> he made the rather surprising statement at the beginning of his speech that he was never consulted over the package <e> <s> was it never discussed at his branch level two or three years ago <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that discussion on this bill took place at <e>", "<cs> my lords it is one or two inches <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry i thought that my noble friend was talking about straw <e>", "<cs> my lords i can see that i shall be cast in the role of the villain <e> <s> so be it <e> <s> but as usual i ask for your courtesy to listen to my case <e> <s> if your lordships can answer the following questions i can promise that the next time i appear on this matter i shall appear in the third row of the chorus <e>", "<cs> i should like to support my noble friend lord renton who said that this committee stage should be a valuable exchange of views <e> <s> i hope to put before your lordships what i believe to be the tenants views although i would not for one minute say that every tenant like every land agent would agree with my views <e> <s> the problem is that there is no such thing as an open market <e> <s> i believe therefore that the amendment which is before us is based on a mythical hypothesis <e>", "<cs> of course there were very few arbitrations <e> <s> we were too frightened to go to arbitration <e> <s> this is what we are trying to grasp in clause <e> <s> my noble friend says that the new formula is too long and complicated and too difficult to interpret <e> <s> i am surprised that he says this <e> <s> chartered surveyors are highly intelligent and well-trained people <e> <s> i ask my noble friend why make it more complicated by his amendment <e> <s> the noble lord lord nonhfield did not think that clause take into account all relevant factors made good the loss of the open market <e> <s> i ask him and i am sure he will tell me the answer when he has given it some thought to look at subsection <e>", "<cs> i regret to tell my noble friend after the help i received last week on another matter that i am not very keen about this amendment <e> <s> needless to say i am not keen about the words open market in the first five lines for all the reasons that i gave earlier <e> <s> i shall not delay the committee on anything else <e> <s> but i shall be interested in an explanation of heading <e>", "<cs> i do not see the point of this amendment <e> <s> i am not against the underlying principle but the amendment seems to me to be unnecessary <e> <s> first this is likely to be taken into account in any tenancy agreement <e> <s> what is more important clause of the bill says take into account all relevant factors <e> <s> surely that solves the problem <e>", "<cs> may i point out here that i hope my amendments nos <e> <s> and no <e> <s> will in fact deal with this problem but i should prefer to speak to those amendments when we reach them <e>", "<cs> it is amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> they are trying to achieve a fair balance between the newcomer the existing tenant and the farmer who wishes to expand <e> <s> my second reason is a personal one <e> <s> many of your lordships think that whenever i or indeed my noble friend lord middleton get up our amendments originate from knightsbridge and therefore they are suspicious of them <e> <s> may i with the humility of years of marriage tell your lordships that this amendment originated from my wife who suggested that i take the beam out of my own eye before i tried to take the mote out of clause or at least words to that effect <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> the only thing is that i have gone down one stage further with my wife <e> <s> perhaps he will he able to sort that out later <e> <s> i thank him very much for that concession <e>", "<cs> i am now getting in a muddle <e> <s> i thought that this part of subsection <e>", "<cs> this was the point of my amendment no <e> <s> no he will not <e> <s> but he does take it into account in the case of the person who tenders to try to grow bigger <e>", "<cs> may i make just one point there are two sorts of retirement <e> <s> one is the retirement concerning those who are protected under the act and then there is the question of retirement for those who are not covered but who will be covered by future tenancies <e> <s> as i understand it my noble friends amendment is really dealing with those who are protected under the act <e> <s> i just wonder whether i ought perhaps to make a remark on that specifically at the moment <e>", "<cs> i agree entirely with the noble lord lord northfield that this is a most important subject to which we should address ourselves this afternoon <e> <s> what i do not agree with him on needless to say is how we should do it <e> <s> it is absolutely vitally important that your lordships should get quite clear in your minds the position of someone under the act <e> <s> it is totally different from the position of someone who will come in after this bill is passed <e> <s> i should like those two issues to be dealt with separately otherwise we shall get ourselves <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down may i ask him whether he said that he wants an age in or whether he does not <e>", "<cs> i also agree with the noble lord lord northfield that there has been trouble in the past over whether one is eligible or not <e> <s> what i think we do not disagree on is the principle <e> <s> as i understand it the principle that we are all trying to get at is that we want to exclude someone who is tenanting or owning and farming another viable holding <e> <s> but rather like my noble friend lord middleton i am concerned as to whether the amendment achieves that <e>", "<cs> there may be some small fault in the drafting of my noble friends amendment <e> <s> however i hope that when my noble friend lord belstead replies he gives the principle a very fair wind <e>", "<cs> for the second time this evening i should like to support my noble friend lord ridley on this amendment <e>

to the government am i correct that there would be no question of a case of bad husbandry put against the tenant so getting him removed and indeed that there would be no case for giving greater dilapidation <e> <s> i understand from my noble friend lord ridley that that is the case <e> <s> i should be happy to hear the minister confirm that in which case i support this too <e>", "<cs> i strongly support the noble lord lord mackie <e> <s> i cannot support the retention of this clause for one minute <e> <s> the rics must be seen to be impartial and it cannot be at the moment when it is to be both judge and jury <e> <s> i should like to quote a written answer which i received on rd november to the following question <e> <s> this brings out the point very clearly <e> <s> it is as follows <e>", "<cs> my noble friend is entitled if he wishes to move a wrecking amendment but he should not hide his light under a bushel <e> <s> he should say as i say that this is a wrecking amendment <e>", "<cs> i think that in principle i would support this amendment and i do not think i agree with a single word the noble lord lord northfield has said <e> <s> i support the principle of resident farmers rather than absentee city farmers <e> <s> i am particularly concerned at the moment if i may say so about the ownership of land encouraged by the business expansion scheme <e> <s> these schemes are heavily tax subsidised and i do think contrary to what the noble lord lord northfield said that these schemes may well push up the price of land as opposed to the institutional buying <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask my noble friend lord sandford a question <e> <s> who can the agreement be made with <e> <s> he has mentioned a number of bodies but does he suggest that an agreement could be made for example with a way-out conservation body <e> <s> if the agreement is made with such reputable bodies as the ncc or the national park authority i very much welcome the suggestion <e> <s> i understand that there is evidence that tenants have been somewhat shy of making agreements with those bodies for fear of their tenancy agreement <e> <s> i should welcome it if my noble friend could confirm who the agreement can be made with <e>", "<cs> i would like to put one more nail in this particular coffin <e> <s> my noble friend says it would encourage new entrants <e> <s> i very much doubt it i think that if anybody gets these tenancies they will go to the agri-business man helped with my pet hate the business expansion scheme <e> <s> i have to tell my noble friend that i really think this is rather a nasty amendment <e>", "<cs> all i would say to my noble friend is that he is a lawyer but not a farmer <e> <s> i suspect that the amendment is totally impractical because by the time one has gone through the process i suspect my noble friend wants us to go through the tenant will have gone anyhow <e>", "<cs> my lords may i start the afternoon by agreeing with my noble friend lord caithness <e> <s> i have some sympathy for this amendment <e> <s> if i may give an example to fortify his case what is happening today is that some land agents are negotiating michaelmas rents now under the old rules because they fear in my opinion quite incorrectly that the new rules under clause might not be attractive for them <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to speak on one or two points made by my noble friend lord renton but first i should like to thank my noble friend on the front bench for his amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i do not think it is quite right and i propose amending it with amendment no <e> <s> a but i shall speak to it then <e>", "<cs> my lords i find this a rather interesting amendment because it touches on the problem i raised in committee <e> <s> does my noble friend lord kinnoull consider that after three years when the rent goes for arbitration or review the premia that the person has paid in order to get into the farm will be reduced to nil <e> <s> if that is so i would accept the amendment <e> <s> but my reading of it is that that will not be so <e> <s> the position will be roughly the same as today where a new tenant comes in and is forced to pay a very high rent <e> <s> he has no option <e> <s> over a period of say three reviews nine years his rent becomes more or less the same as those of his neighbours theirs have gone up and his has gone down <e> <s> if in the future that would be the position i cannot accept the amendment because there is an element of premium and scarcity after three years <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord lord northfield replies i should like for a change to give a little help to my front bench <e> <s> if this amendment is accepted i would agree with my noble friend that it would drive a coach and horses through the whole idea of scarcity which is in the clause and which has been agreed or has sought to be agreed over a long period of time <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly be very happy not more or less to withdraw it but completely to withdraw it until third reading <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not get a great deal of change from my noble friend but i should like to thank noble lords from both sides of the house who have supported me <e> <s> my noble friend lord caithness did not do so <e> <s> he pointed out as did my noble friend lord belstead that the appointments were made by the lord chancellor <e> <s> perhaps they are in theory but in fact it has always been the minister of agriculture or the secretary of state for wales who has made the final appointments <e>", "<cs> my lords if for one moment i felt that my noble friends bill would encourage more responsible straw burning i would support it <e> <s> but alas <e> <s> if allowed to proceed this bill will do exactly the opposite <e> <s> why is that so <e> <s> clauses and are examples of bureaucracy gone crazy <e> <s> each local authority will be able to issue licences in any form that it wishes as the spirit moves it <e> <s> so there will be a multitude of different regulations from field to field <e> <s> we have already seen cases where local authorities have not conformed to the present code of practice which has led to confusion and chaos and in the county next door to me it has led to irresponsible <e>", "<cs> my lords they were not there except for my noble friend lord caithness <e> <s> i would point out that there was a case of farmers leading and the public not following <e> <s> it is fashionable today for many who cannot think of anything or indeed anybody better to criticise to take to farmer bashing <e> <s> this bill has an element of that in it <e> <s> but our backs are still broad nature forces us to have a sense of humour or should i say <e> <s> resignation <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down he asks for a national scheme but how does he reconcile that with clause of the bill which will allow every local authority to do every single thing differently <e> <s> i am with the noble lord on the question of a national scheme and that is the code of practice but how does he reconcile clause <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down he says that he does not want to overstretch the scientific resources but what grounds does he have for saying that by there will be some form of processing <e> <s> he has said so in his speech <e> <s> can he tell me <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness goes on to the the bill she referred to the fact that we burn because it is easier and quicker <e> <s> could she tell me how one deals with unstable soils not heavy soils but unstable ones <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that i am not apart in principle from my noble friend in thinking that some form of profit should be thought of when rents are being decided <e> <s> however i could not go along with his argument <e> <s> he argued one way for five minutes and then the other way for five minutes <e> <s> may i take the last five minutes and his caravan case and i hope destroy that <e> <s> my noble friend was arguing that because my neighbour had a caravan site and could afford a rent of i also should have a caravan site and afford a rent of <e> <s> that perhaps rather simplifies his argument but first i am not sure that we want a lot of caravan parks and secondly here you are completely ruled out by the fact that as my noble friend said himself it is a competent tenant practising a system of farming suitable to the holding <e> <s> so that caravan park might not be suitable for my holding <e> <s> there was another point that my noble friend missed and that is that in clause the terms of the tenancy have to be considered <e> <s> if i want a caravan park and here i come back to my noble friend lord caithness who has suddenly changed his mind because he finds that my amendment is not so attractive for him as it was before and i have permission from the local authority to have it then i go to my landlord and it goes in the terms of the tenancy <e> <s> therefore there is no <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the noble lord <e> <s> lord northfield is totally wrong <e> <s> he will remember that i moved an amendment and that is where his comes from i might remind him that would penalise the tenant who went next door or owner-occupier and hid up highly this next door land <e> <s> now the noble lord wants to get hold of my cake or to be more truthful my wifes cake and say that not only will he be penalised on the part he is bidding for but on the farm itself <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say that all three of my noble kinsmen are wrong about the word substantial but we covered this matter before and i do not intend to go over it again <e> <s> i would put one hurdle in the path of the amendment of the noble lord lord northfield <e> <s> i believe that it will complicate a complicated clause <e> <s> we all say that the clause is complicated but he is putting in words such as <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the differences of opinion that this bill has caused i now realise why my right honourable friend mr peter walker was not anxious to introduce this bill even though he was promised three years ago that there was no dispute <e> <s> i think that my noble friend lord belstead is saying <e> <s> yes <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend replies i have a couple of small technical points on which my noble friend lord alport is at fault <e> <s> first i am amazed that he says that straw is now combined higher than it was <e> <s> any reasonable farmer today will make his combine driver drive as low as he possibly can <e> <s> i shall not go into the details but i could show my noble friend in practice <e> <s> there is another small point on which my noble friend might even have misled the committee <e> <s> he said that the bill is not banning straw burning but i would quote to him clause which reads a local authority may grant a licence <e> <s> if it does not want to grant a licence it need not do so <e> <s> so before my noble friend gets up i am assuming that he will accept the principle that the local authority shall and that he will accept the amendment of my noble friend lord mountgarret on this small point <e>", "<cs> yes i do wish to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> i beg leave to do so <e>", "<cs> i welcome the remarks about trying to have some standardisation in the regulations that my noble friend has indicated he will discuss <e> <s> i think the answer is that between now and report we can get together and achieve some form of standardisation <e> <s> the new model by-laws are so severe that i wonder whether the noble lord lord alport would consider withdrawing his bill and accepting the model by-laws <e>", "<cs> i thought that i was naive but my noble friend is being too naive when he says that the minister may <e> <s> he knows as well as i do that if this amendment is included in the bill in my noble friend the minister will be put under tremendous pressure to do this <e> <s> he will receive advice from all to do it <e> <s> it is tying his hands now in advance for doing something and it would expose him to intolerable pressure <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps for the convenience of the house i might speak to all the amendments tabled by my noble friend lord alport on licensing straw burning <e> <s> as your lordships will remember the government published during the passage of my noble friends bill their proposals in the form of a new model by-law <e> <s> they said that that by-law as i hope and as they believe will be the way forward <e> <s> i believe with them that all local authorities who have a straw burning problem will adopt the new model by-law <e> <s> this new model by-law should be given a real chance to work and by a chance to work i do not mean for just one season <e> <s> nor do i accept that it is not working just because some reporter somewhere suggests in some paper that the by-law is not working or indeed a member of your lordships house somewhere else does exactly the same <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to say to the noble lord lord gibson that if we could pursuade the government to encourage local authorities to place skips in advantageous places around the countryside it would help the litter problem enormously <e> <s> it has certainly helped in my village <e>", "<cs> i must thank all noble lords for their great contribution <e> <s> they did much better than i could have done <e> <s> i shall not delay the committee except to say that i shall bring this back at report stage <e> <s> i would make one or two comments in so far as my noble friend says that he wonders whether the amendment would help <e> <s> i shall send him between now and report examples of difficulties that the police have experienced through not being able to enter <e> <s> my objective is the same as that of other noble lords <e> <s> a point made by the noble lord lord elystan-morgan brought home to me a case that occurred in my own village where the enmity not between dogs but between individuals became very unpleasant indeed <e> <s> therefore i think this would have helped <e> <s> in regard to the reply which my noble friend gave to my noble friend lord gibson-watt i would say okay <e> <s> the act works but first find the dog <e> <s> i am trying to get the police officer to come in and make a positive identification <e>", "<cs> my lords despite the comforting words of my noble friend lord belstead it is not possible for me to congratulate the government on the way that they have handled the problem of milk surpluses <e> <s> the action that they have taken or to he charitable that they have been forced to take by the commission is a disaster for the dairy industry and has undermined the confidence of the whole industry in the government and in particular in my right honourable friend the minister <e> <s> in imposing this quota one could say retrospectively the government or perhaps they would prefer me to say the commission have broken the golden farming rule which is to give time to adjust a point repeatedly made by your lordships sub-committee d and also made this morning by the noble lords lord john-mackie and lord sainsbury <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether my noble friend will give way while he is dealing with the question of the landlord and tenant problem <e> <s> i am grateful for the remarks he has made but the minister put in the proviso that it has to have the landlords consent <e> <s> in these discussions which he and i very much hope will continue would he make himself or his ministry available to help in those discussions as they are very much part and parcel of it <e>", "<cs> my lords it has been a great privilege for me to be disciplined under the chairmanship of the noble lord lord adrian <e> <s> perhaps before he disappears as vice-chancellor to some university or other in east anglia he might like to give the whips a tutorial on how to discipline reluctant peers <e> <s> i noted with regret the press comment on both reports <e> <s> a number had comments such as peers slam maff <e> <s> i would ask your lordships to read the reports <e> <s> although you may find that some of the witnesses were critical of maff the findings of the committees particularly that of research and development do not take such a hostile view <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i am grateful to him for answering half my question hut did he or did he not say in the interview that he recommended people breaking the civil law <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted that the government have accepted the seriousness of livestock worrying in the words of my noble friend the terrible scourge of some dogs to some flocks <e> <s> if i may i will make one ungracious remark and that is that i hope my noble friend lord elton will make quite sure that his right honourable friend the secretary of state for the environment places a similarly high priority on this cruel problem and that he will take the same line as my noble friend when he comes to future dog licensing <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend for bringing forward this amendment <e> <s> although it was suggested to me by one party that it might be better to allow the police officer to inspect more fully i feel that the sight of a police officer putting a truncheon down a dogs mouth to look for bits of sheep is more worthy of a cartoon than common sense <e> <s> i should therefore like to thank the government for this valuable if minor amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that apparently helpful answer <e> <s> but will the government ponder and indeed accept the great damage caused by failure to provide export guarantees and export credits similar to those in the ec and that we are losing our long-term competitiveness as an exporter <e> <s> can my noble friend tell me whether this being less than equal to the french it has resulted this year in the french exporting their corn whereas most of the british corn has very regrettably gone into intervention at great cost as was mentioned yesterday by his right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer <e>", "<cs> my lords i am never per cent <e> <s> sure of the purpose of a second reading debate in your lordships house <e> <s> however i shall use it today to inform my noble friend on the front bench that perhaps not totally to his surprise i shall try now and during the committee stage to put the view of the farmer and the sprayer operator <e> <s> i am a little worried by some of the remarks made by my noble friend lord stodart <e> <s> i shall take a slightly different view perhaps because i have too many expensive children and greedy landlords around me <e> <s> this is not to say that my view is contrary to the production of wholesome food and the protection of the environment <e> <s> far from it <e> <s> it is in all our interests to produce wholesome food and to do so in a pleasant environment for we farmer farm worker and operator have to eat this food and live in this environment <e> <s> we create part of it <e> <s> at the risk of having a thunderbolt land on my head i would say that i do not think that we look too unfit or too miserable though maybe a little overweight <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the support that i have received on this amendment <e> <s> i agree entirely with the noble lord lord john-mackie <e> <s> about the polluter paying <e> <s> there is no difference here <e> <s> if we can find the polluter he should pay <e> <s> the trouble is when we cannot find him or when he cannot pay <e> <s> if i may bore my noble friend with one case we had a situation in oxfordshire two or three years ago where we had pollution and the polluter was willing to pay but even then it took two years for the farmer to be paid <e> <s> wonder what would happen if we met a really unpleasant polluter who would not pay or indeed an unscrupulous polluter who would be prepared to what i call play the courts and take the unfortunate farmer right up to the house of lords when usually you lose puff half way through or confidence on the costs <e>", "<cs> could my noble friend explain about these nine ministers <e> <s> i was somewhat shocked to read in his notes for which again i thank him that there would be nine separate ministers to be consulted <e> <s> my noble friend has just said that one of the reasons why we have only just got the notes is because nine separate ministers had to be consulted <e> <s> i shall not go along this line too far on this amendment but when we come to deciding on new pesticides and new methods of applying them i am worried if we shall have to consult with nine separate ministers <e> <s> i should like to know whether he really means that he has to consult with nine separate ministers <e>", "<cs> may i ask my question which follows on that <e> <s> for once i am supporting the noble lord lord melchett <e> <s> i am lost on this <e> <s> i think the amendment in fact is defective in so far as my noble friend on the front bench said it might stop us exporting stuff that we consider dangerous but which might do a job over there <e> <s> what i have not heard from the government and what i really do want to hear is are they or are they not in favour of prior informed consent <e> <s> i have not heard a yes or no to that and i should very much like to do so <e>", "<cs> as i read the amendment it will in fact make delivery devices subject to approval and regulation <e> <s> in principle i am with the noble lord lord northbourne and other noble lords who have spoken but i am not sure that this amendment will do what we want it to do <e> <s> i think it will be very difficult for manufacturers fully to assess their machines until the chemical manufacturers give precise details as to how the chemical should be used <e> <s> the trouble comes here because a chemical used in a hydraulic machine will need regulations completely different from one used in a cda machine or electro-static machine or indeed something we have not yet heard of <e> <s> that is what worries me <e> <s> dare i suggest that the amendment of the noble lord lord northbourne and my amendment no <e> <s> might better deal with this problem <e> <s> no doubt we shall have another go at it then <e>", "<cs> i do not much like this amendment in fact i do not like it at all <e> <s> the noble lord lord melchett is really trying to throw the baby out with the bath water again <e> <s> if it is dangerous to spray near a footpath the minister has powers to stop us as he told my noble friend lord craigton in an earlier amendment <e>", "<cs> i rather agree with my noble friend over the minimum but i would rather leave this question to a later amendment when we are discussing it in full <e> <s> but either way whether my noble friend on the front bench accepts this amendment or whether he leaves the bill as it is i should like to ask him three questions about which perhaps he can try to help me <e> <s> first who will enforce that a particular pesticide is being used correctly so ensuring that the right residue or no more than the right residue is left in the crop <e> <s> i ask this particularly with regard to gardens <e> <s> i should like to know what is my noble friends view over gardens <e> <s> i cannot believe that there can be a single noble lord here who gardens who has not over-dosed and vastly over-dosed his garden with chemicals at some stage <e> <s> i should like to know how the government are going to deal with that particular problem <e>", "<cs> i am glad the noble baroness has raised this problem <e> <s> first of all i would say to her that it emphasises the responsibility of farmers in this case <e> <s> we were very well aware about four or five years ago that the ester formulation particularly of cmpp would go on the crop and then in two or three days take off and destroy a neighbouring crop <e> <s> i am delighted to say that i am informed that no case has occurred in and the amount of spray used in the ester formulation as opposed to the salt has dropped to absolutely minimal proportions <e> <s> i hope this perhaps brings out how farmers too can take a responsible and indeed an experimenting view <e>", "<cs> i am glad that my noble friend lady carnegy said something because then i am not the only black sheep <e> <s> i think your lordships are being a little hard on the aerial sprayer <e> <s> your lordships are being hard i think because of tv and media coverage and the thought that aeroplanes must be inaccurate because they rush about madly spraying and looking like a sort of dragon pushing out fire <e> <s> they are not <e> <s> many pilots particularly helicopter pilots i think i shall carry the noble lord lord john-mackie here are very accurate indeed and probably more accurate than many of your lordships when you get on a tractor <e> <s> they are certainly more accurate than i am <e>", "<cs> i should like to take a slightly different attitude towards this amendment which has also been tabled to encourage lower rates of pesticide <e> <s> i therefore ask my noble friend to explain why paragraph and paragraph <e>", "<cs> i have found this a very interesting debate <e> <s> i shall have to come back to it at report <e> <s> perhaps the first point of interest to me was the noble lord lord melchetts remark that most chemicals on the continent are more strictly looked at than they are here <e> <s> if that is the case it seems to me that we have not a problem with safety when we are importing <e> <s> so far as the remarks of my noble friend lord belstead are concerned i thought he was going to be more helpful in what he said than he was <e> <s> relating to ingredients he first of all said yes they would be the same if it was the same company <e> <s> i am not so sure what happens if it is a different company <e> <s> it seems to me that very often the company will be different but the ingredients the same <e> <s> maybe i misheard my noble friend <e> <s> i shall read his remarks very carefully <e> <s> my noble friend also did not say anything about a different formulation <e> <s> it sounds to me in respect of these two cases if it was a different formulation and it was a different company even though the same ingredient we would not get rapid clearance <e> <s> i feel that we want to look at this <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to noble lords who have taken part in this debate and also for the fact that we have dealt with two more amendments amendment no <e> <s> a in the name of the noble lord lord melchett and amendment no <e> <s> in the name of the noble lord lord northbourne dealing with minor crops <e> <s> i was particularly pleased to hear my noble friend lord belstead saying that there might be a case for farmers making a direct approach say to adas to clear certain chemicals <e>", "<cs> i would support my noble friend lord ferrers on this and add what about the unfortunate small farmer who does not have time to do all these things <e> <s> there are probably people spraying each day <e> <s> it could be a fair bureaucratic madness <e> <s> having said that i go along with the noble lord lord john-mackie they certainly should be trained but paper qualifications i doubt <e>", "<cs> if i may just take up a remark made by the noble lord it is not just the spray operator but the boss he who tells the operator what to do <e> <s> it is he who has to be trained not the operator the can falls on the farmer <e> <s> if he is uneducated or poor he is poor but not the operator <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord northbourne replies if my noble friend lord belstead is referring to paragraph <e>", "<cs> i must say that in what he said there was a lovely sentence from my noble friend on the front bench <e> <s> however i am very grateful for his remarks <e> <s> i will study them in the cool light of day and meanwhile i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask one very simple question <e> <s> i want to ask my noble friend who are the ministers referred to in line i think it is at the beginning of clause as opposed to the ministers who are referred to on page which mentions the minister of agriculture and the secretary of state <e> <s> previously we have been talking about nine ministers <e> <s> i wonder whether my noble friend could clarify this point <e>", "<cs> in both cases is that <e> <s> both on page where it refers to the ministers as meaning the minister of agriculture fisheries and food and the secretary of state and in this clause it means either <e> <s> is that correct <e>", "<cs> i have listened to my noble friend but am not sure that i am happy with his answer <e> <s> however i will consider it and meanwhile beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> as my amendment amendment no <e> <s> a has been mentioned may i ask my noble friend when he takes it away to consider it and i am grateful to him for saying that he will do that whether he will just consider the position of an engineer on this august body <e> <s> i went through it and could not see many engineers <e>", "<cs> i do not agree with my noble friend and i certainly do not agree with the noble lord lord melchett <e> <s> i am not saying that a person cannot bring a prosecution <e> <s> what that person does is that he or she draws the attention of the minister to an offence <e> <s> it is then up to the minister to decide whether an offence has been committed <e> <s> my noble friend says that i am worrying unnecessarily about this <e> <s> i can tell the committee that i have had experience of people wandering into my farm saying do not spray <e> <s> this is the sort of person i am trying to prevent causing more trouble in this manner <e> <s> i am just saying that it should be up to the minister <e> <s> there is precedent for this and my noble friend must know it <e> <s> it is under the nuclear installations act <e> <s> it is also under the <e>", "<cs> i think this is the question where my noble friend is cutting out the words due diligence is it not <e> <s> i am correct am i not <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to delay the committee <e> <s> it is rather a legal question <e> <s> i am advised that my noble friend is incorrect again <e> <s> i am sorry to disagree with him over the last two amendments <e> <s> i am advised that there is a great deal of difference between due diligence and reasonable excuse <e> <s> reasonable excuse can be made when perhaps an accident occurs and the person cannot go on spraying or he falls over and he spills the spray tank <e> <s> however due diligence is another matter i am told i am afraid i am speaking from hearsay i am not a lawyer and this would be a case when the person has taken all care to fulfil the instructions on the label etc <e> <s> therefore i find it rather difficult to understand why my noble friend has taken out the words due diligence <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful for the contributions which have been made from the floor of the house on this amendment <e> <s> i do not think that we have solved all the problems but certainly my noble friend lord belstead has solved a great many of them <e> <s> i was particularly pleased to hear the answer which my noble friend gave to the noble lord lord walston concerning the fact that if an area is designated and certain parts of it turn out afterwards to be innocent or free from pollution the polluter will pay as regards that area which the minister has designated because he should be and i think that these were the words which my noble friend used aware of this problem when he reads this bill or when the bill becomes an act <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend for that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i am at all happy with my noble friends reply <e> <s> i feel that the way in which he replied would allow an unscrupulous manufacturer to keep out what my noble friend calls identical imports <e> <s> the only comfort that i can give myself and perhaps my noble friends is that when we reach amendment no <e> <s> we <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so to my noble friend that was a rather more helpful reply <e> <s> there are two points that i want to make quite clear which judging by the remarks he made i do not think i got over <e> <s> he made the point of a precipitate forming and certainly that does happen <e> <s> it is very irritating but that is what i had in mind when i talked about a farmer being very stupid <e> <s> if he wishes to be stupid i see absolutely no reason why he should not be <e> <s> it is quite nice to be stupid occasionally <e>", "<cs> my lords i also support the amendment <e> <s> i thought that last autumn the parliamentary secretary in another place intimated that a maximum rate would be specified <e> <s> i am now a little lost as to why we do not have a maximum rate <e> <s> i go along entirely with the noble lord lord mackie of benshie if a farmer wants any sort of comfort he really wants to know what the maximum rate is and that if he goes above the rate it is probable that a residue will be left in the crop and the farmer will therefore be liable <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend for this amendment <e> <s> at this stage i should say that i am not happy that the tasks that the committee is being asked to carry out are wide enough <e> <s> i was hoping to expand on this in my amendment no <e> <s> as was suggested by the noble lord lord mackie of benshie <e> <s> i prefer to leave the expansion of the work which i think the

with his endeavours and with everyones help we shall come to the right solution <e> <s> i think that we have moved along this path satisfactorily <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i understood my noble friend to say that he would reconsider this matter <e> <s> if he did so i shall withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure we still have not got this matter quite right <e> <s> i take the point made by the noble lord lord mackie of benshie which differs from that made by my noble friend <e> <s> for example supposing that there is a case where there has been no pollution but the government have taken perfectly correct steps where they thought there was going to be pollution <e> <s> as i understand my noble friend lord belstead one would not have a case against the government because their action obviously was necessary in the circumstances <e> <s> so as a farmer i am left on a limb at the end of it <e> <s> i am sure i am <e> <s> i cannot go against the government because their action at that time was legally necessary or the courts would say so <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to your lordships for the support that i have received throughout the house and indeed from the front bench on these amendments <e>

am grateful to my noble friend for his reply on this amendment <e> <s> he may be amused but i was being too greatly pressed by <e>", "<cs> my lords i had prepared a suitably lucid lawyers speech to my amendments nos <e> <s> and far superior i might say to that delivered by my noble friend lord swinton at committee stage and even better than the one that i delivered to him at report stage <e> <s> however i am afraid that i cannot now deliver that superb speech and on this occasion i am most grateful to my noble friend lord belstead who seems to have chosen the easier path and did not go into such lovely lawyers language as did my noble friend lord swinton <e> <s> i am most grateful to him for accepting anyway per cent <e> <s> or per cent <e> <s> of my amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i have one pleasant comment and one unpleasant one <e> <s> the unpleasant comment concerns government resources for this bill <e> <s> the government have decided to take into their hands the regulation of pesticides their application and their approval <e> <s> this will inevitably <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not intend to restate yet again the case that farmers should be allowed to dispose of straw by burning <e> <s> your lordships have been over that course too many times and at the risk of being out of order the weight of this file on the subject as your lordships can see bears testimony not only to the correspondence on it but also to the efforts of the noble lord lord alport <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that the noble lord would ask me that question <e> <s> i think that he is splitting hairs <e> <s> the code is put forward and from that code the by-laws have been drawn up <e> <s> it is the by-laws that enforce the code <e> <s> almost without exception we have heard from my noble friend lord radnor about various small exceptions in salisbury in the arable growing areas the by-laws are virtually in line with the code <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend replies may i say something <e> <s> i should first like to apologise to the house for not being present at the previous stage but i have read every word that your lordships have said <e> <s> i have sympathy with my noble friend lord sandford for having to wait years <e> <s> i support my noble friend lord middleton and ask whether my noble friend lord sandford could perhaps wait another month or two until we get the consultation paper <e>", "<cs> my lords it will come as no surprise to your lordships that i support the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran in this amendment except that i should prefer the limit to be even longer but then i suspect that my noble friend lord sandford <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness lady birk and indeed my noble friend lord montagu said that this is a narrow amendment <e> <s> i would support their principle of controlling speculative planning in such areas as chester and indeed in the little boltons and other conservation areas <e> <s> however i think this amendment would also catch farms in conservation areas <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend makes up his mind about what he intends to do on this matter i shall of course read carefully what my noble friend on the front bench has said about the chance for individuals and organisations to make comments on the strategic plan <e> <s> however i have to say to my noble friend that the government must ensure that at the beginning of the planning process the strategic plan i think it is called there must be consultation not just with individuals but also with organisations particularly in my view needless to say those responsible for land management <e> <s> if this is not done chaos will ensue <e> <s> despite what my noble friend and some other members of the committee have said about the fact that it will delay the process i do not think that it will <e> <s> i believe that it will speed things up <e> <s> otherwise at the end of the day when you come to the district plans as i call them you will get an enormous number of complaints from all over the place without any logic <e>", "<cs> this really is the other side of the coin to amendment no <e> <s> moved by my noble friend lord molson <e> <s> his amendment dealt with the long-term problems and this amendment deals with the short-term immediate problem of what happens when the metropolitan counties get disbanded next april <e> <s> it is politically minor but to those of us involved in the countryside the national farmers union the countryside commission and indeed the national trust and i have an apology from the noble lord lord gibson who has had to leave it is important and it is constructive allowing us to plan forward which is so essential in all country matters <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it the main purpose of the bill is to close the so-called loophole in section of the act although there have been very few cases of this loophole being exploited by farmers <e> <s> only a tiny minority affected by section did in fact exploit the loophole <e> <s> to that extent i disagree with the noble lord lord melchett that it is a very serious problem <e> <s> however i fully accept that this loophole should be closed because of those shall i say rogue farmers who have exploited it <e> <s> but i must say and impress upon the house that it was a very small number <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend for that answer <e> <s> i should also like to ask whether it is true that there is a per cent <e> <s> ceiling put on this extra land that could be included in the less favoured areas and that if this per cent <e> <s> is exceeded we have to go to brussels <e> <s> i should further like to ask whether this ceiling or possible ceiling is in fact being transferred by the government to the assessors so that the assessors are taking shall i say <e> <s> a very mean view of including other farmers in the area <e>", "<cs> my lords is it true that the original designation of these areas was based on very old maps and also on a very old ministry land classification map which does not now correctly reflect productivity <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords bilberry <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank all noble lords who have spoken in favour of this bill i am most grateful <e> <s> i shall just repeat and endorse the remarks of my noble friend lord belstead in respect of getting the balance right a point which the noble lord lord john-mackie raised <e> <s> this is the part played by the working party and i really do believe that they have got it right <e> <s> i trust that the noble lord lord john-mackie will be satisfied as much as any farmer can ever be on this matter <e>", "<cs> i voted against the inclusion of marine nature reserves during the passage of the act <e> <s> however i accept that parliament decided otherwise and i therefore accept the principle that marine nature reserves should be set up <e> <s> indeed i can say on behalf of the royal yachting association whose interests i pursued during the passage of that bill that the association is also happy about the creation of marine nature reserves in principle provided of course that there is the right of passage and the right to moor particulary if stormbound <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e> <s> therefore unless any noble lord objects i beg to move that the order of commitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to intervene in scottish legislation but often what happens up there comes to us and vice versa as i think the noble lord will remember <e> <s> i understand the feelings of the noble lord lord northfield or at least i should do as i have heard enough of them and indeed of my noble friend lord massereene but deer are pests <e> <s> they are very serious pests <e> <s> my noble friend lord massereene shakes his head <e> <s> come and see them with me down in the south of england <e> <s> they are grossly overstocked and they are increasing at a vast rate <e> <s> i know that i am talking about the south but these regulations will come there in the end <e> <s> they are there at the moment <e> <s> at times deer need severe culling <e> <s> the culling in my district is something like per cent <e> <s> below what would be satisfactory <e> <s> that is not my figure it is that of the forestry commission and indeed all the other organisations round me <e>", "<cs> my lords i said before that we have people on our farms and we combine with a whole series round us including the forestry commission who are authorised to shoot with rifles <e> <s> they are members of the deer society <e> <s> i regret to say that the cull is something like per cent <e> <s> wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may make a brief comment on this amendment <e> <s> i very much welcome it as does the noble baroness in so far as it goes on from an amendment that was proposed in this house and accepted by the government i think at third reading <e> <s> being a rather suspicious sort of person i have to ask my noble friend bearing in mind that i think this was somewhat if i may put the word in parenthesis reluctantly accepted in the commons whether the government really have their hearts behind it <e> <s> i have to point out to my noble friend that in a recent publication which was circulating at the royal show no mention was made of the continuous development which the noble baroness has just mentioned <e> <s> otherwise i very much welcome it <e>", "<cs> my lords once again i am on the same side as the noble baroness <e> <s> unbeknown to her i wrote to my noble friend lord belstead on the very point she has raised <e> <s> i support the noble baroness on another point <e> <s> if farmers are going to have to pay for this service probably by the increased cost of the commodity will they be consulted on these charges perhaps through the nfu or by some other method <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may start this afternoons proceedings on a happy note by thanking the government for accepting this amendment <e> <s> i do so on behalf of all those who have their hearts in the country and in the countryside and in particular on behalf of the national farmers union and the countryside commission who were very interested in this amendment <e> <s> on their behalf i should like to thank the government not only for the amendment but also for the discussions and the letters that have gone on between the government and those organisations since the moving of this amendment <e> <s> perhaps in a lighter vein i may say that despite rumours to the contrary the chief whip has not been pressurising me or my noble friend lord radnor in dark corners of your lordships house since this amendment was accepted <e> <s> perhaps that is because your lordships threw out a certain bill a week-and-a-half ago <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to have to tell my noble friend lord belstead after a parliamentary session that i have spent admiring his work and being able to thank him for it that this order comes to me as a black end of term <e> <s> i am not surprised that he introduced it so quietly and as i thought sadly <e> <s> why do i not like these orders <e> <s> first it is for the reasons already stated particularly by my noble friend lord middleton <e> <s> i shall not drive those nails in any further maybe i shall give them just a little tap but i have to say that this order further disadvantages british farmers against their competitors and particularly their continental ones <e> <s> despite what has been said in another place a change in grant from per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> is a cut albeit if you are under you may have that grant increased by per cent <e> <s> which will raise it to per cent <e> <s> if my arithmetic is correct <e> <s> it is not a great incentive for the young farmer <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend goes on could he clear my mind on this point about notice prior to th july <e> <s> if a conversation has taken place between a farmer and his merchant prior to th july that he wishes some bracken sprayed but it is not written down then if now that merchant writes in to the ministry to say that he accepted this as an undertaking would the ministry consider that to be a contract <e> <s> i personally would <e> <s> is it all right if he writes now <e>", "<cs> my lords i look on this report wearing two hats <e> <s> the first is as a member of the select committee whose task it was as i saw it on behalf of the taxpayer to limit the cost of the cap in order among other things to prevent it from going bankrupt and so causing <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether my noble friend can explain how this arrangement can possibly be fair farmer against farmer <e> <s> for instance why is it that the new less favoured areas in gwynedd are not receiving help <e> <s> so far as i was aware the rain fell on my head as much as on those miles away <e> <s> i would ask my noble friend will not this statement cause just the same problems as the unfairness of the recent designation of the new marginal lands has caused <e> <s> would it not have been far better had this money been put towards the long-term restructuring and guidance of agriculture <e> <s> it is just not good enough for my right honourable friend the minister of state for agriculture to say as he did yesterday that all is well in the farming scene <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord john-mackie for raising this question tonight for it poses the unpleasant question of whether the governments left hand in the form of the department of the environment understands the implications for them of the problems of the right hand the combined hands of the ministry of agriculture and the secretary of state for employment <e> <s> sadly i cannot find much fault with the speech made by the noble lord lord winstanley and i would support the remarks made by the noble lord lord john-mackie <e> <s> we have a certain problem not just in the green belt but throughout the agricultural industry in making farming profitable thereby hangs the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i must interrupt the noble baroness <e> <s> i did not like it either and i knocked it down which is more than the planning authority might do <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord give way for a minute <e> <s> i see entirely what he means but i wonder whether he would change one word <e> <s> to my mind and i think that the noble lord lord northfield would agree with me the conflict is between the developer if you call me a developer and not the conservationists but the preservationists <e> <s> i do not know whether my noble friend will take that suggestion <e> <s> i think that the noble lord lord northfield will take it <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may be allowed to congratulate select committees d and e on their reports and in particular to thank the deputy chairman of committees for getting parliamentary time to draw the attention of the house to the crisis that faces the agricultural industry and indeed rural well-being today a crisis that the council of ministers the commission and even my right honourable friend the minister of agriculture seem unable to grasp or to do anything about as was so ably explained by my noble friend lord mottistone <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that my noble friend lord ferrers will forgive me if i do not follow him down the food from britain path for the reasons which i gave in the house when he promoted that bill <e> <s> though there is quite a lot of good in this bill i fear that there is really a lot of tidying up work to do <e> <s> i address this remark to my noble kinsman the chief whip to try probably pointlessly to curb his impatience when we go into committee <e> <s> my remark is certainly not addressed to my noble friend lord belstead who as your lordships know will always do his utmost to accommodate sensible suggestions <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness lady nicol for at last finding the time or the government finding the time to debate this problem <e> <s> i agree with practically every word that she said but i am sorry to say that i can only offer to my noble friend lord belstead vinegar because i am highly critical of and deeply regret the cuts that the government have made and are indeed making in agricultural research for the following reasons <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> in presenting this bill which has been skilfully piloted through another place with no changes by my honourable friend sir john wells i am faced with a dilemma <e> <s> i can either spell out the exact meaning of every clause which would take thirty minutes of your lordships time to the fury of your lordships and indeed the whips or alternatively as i hope that your lordships will agree it may be better for me to explain the bill in my customary seven minutes and if i cut a few corners no doubt your lordships will cross-examine me and i shall attempt to fill any gaps when summing up <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord john-mackie for his kind words <e> <s> i can assure him that clause meets the point he made that if there is substandard material about and there is a home for it possibly through processing by factories or regrading and coming back on the market regraded these matters are within the power of the inspector under clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e> <s> therefore unless any noble lord objects i beg to move that the order of commitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether it would be for the convenience of the committee if i speak to my amendments nos <e> <s> and with the amendment of the noble lord lord john-mackie <e> <s> they are more or less the same <e> <s> my amendment as has been partly stated by the noble lord is to ensure a long-term future for adas <e> <s> there is nothing worse or more liable to cause low morale than uncertainty <e> <s> at the moment in part due to this bill being an enabling bill there is great uncertainty felt about the future of adas by both farmers and ministry staff <e> <s> indeed rumours abound that in future there may be no service at all <e> <s> my amendment our amendment rather would remove that uncertainty by giving a firm undertaking that some service would be provided <e>", "<cs> i therefore shall not move the amendment <e>", "<cs> i support my noble friend <e> <s> i have little to add to his remarks except to reinforce the point that there is need for thought as to what job adas will do successfully in the future <e> <s> it will be necessary for adas to become more specialised <e> <s> it must not shrink from providing specialised services not just to the farmer but to the farmers specialised private advisers <e>", "<cs> i really cannot accept the argument of my noble friend lord belstead <e> <s> if the government have agreed to pay the charges for tuberculosis and brucellosis why cannot they pay the charges for the inspection of milk <e> <s> other diseases carried by milk are probably worse than those two diseases <e> <s> i just cannot see how they separate the two <e> <s> as the noble lord lord mackie of benshie said this is a public health worry and should therefore be carried by the public as i said when i proposed the amendment <e>", "<cs> i can agree with my noble friend lord middleton in his opening remarks that we need to give this matter some considerable thought <e> <s> but that is where any agreement with my noble friend ends <e> <s> if my noble friend on the front bench believes that he can pick up the sword of solomon and cut the baby in half between us i feel so strongly against my noble friends amendment that i shall let him cut the baby <e> <s> there is one point on which i would agree with my noble friend lord middleton <e> <s> it is that his method of dealing with milk quotas appears simpler than schedule simpler for the landlord but simply horrendous for the tenant <e> <s> i shall explain why within i hope two minutes <e>", "<cs> i was not bringing forward a special case <e> <s> i was giving the committee the majority of cases <e> <s> i could bring special cases on the whole lot and put them in the library if the noble lord wishes <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may intervene because i think it might help the committee <e> <s> i have to tell my noble friend on the front bench that unless my noble friend lord middleton moves so much to the right or to the left to give average quota to litres which is ridiculous i cannot accept this method of doing it <e> <s> i must be honest here <e> <s> i am sorry to fall out with both parties but i must make it clear otherwise we shall just go on with this <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend replies i should like to ask him a few specific questions <e> <s> i do not think he answered them when he made his original speech but if he did perhaps he will answer them again <e> <s> first of all i go along with the noble lord lord mackie of benshie <e> <s> i am afraid that the amendment only tinkers with the problem and does not really deal with it radically enough <e>", "<cs> first i should like to repeat what the noble lord lord cledwyn has said this is a very important matter which gets everyone very steamed up <e> <s> as i have said i spent most of the beginning of this afternoon somewhere on the ceiling and i am just about coming down <e> <s> we must return to the matter again because it affects so many people <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to come in on scottish law but there are two small technical points <e> <s> i understood my noble friend to say that for less-favoured areas the standard quota would be litres <e> <s> i did not hear him say anything about ordinary areas <e> <s> in paragraph it comes where he has standard yield per hectare <e> <s> do i gather this will be the same as the english at <e> <s> i wonder whether he would let me know that <e> <s> i was concerned about another remark <e> <s> my noble friend talked about tenants improvements <e> <s> he said if they were genuinely written down that would be the value <e> <s> can he explain that more fully <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that i am at a loss now <e> <s> what i understood to be the case not in <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down i should like to say that i read his parliamentary question the other day and found it quite fascinating <e> <s> from the answer i found that over the last five years five people have been killed by bulls four by sheep and four by cows <e> <s> should we ban the sheep as well <e> <s> in that case what would your lordships grandchildren do for cuddly toys <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the noble baronesss amendment partly for the reasons she has already mentioned <e> <s> but may i refer to the broad scheme that has been very successful for a lot of reasons but possibly the greatest reason is that there was an extremely good person in the form of i think keith turner who ran it and co-operated and made sure that all the farmers came in <e> <s> i am most anxious to see these esas getting off the ground and i go along with my noble friend on the front bench in that i would prefer to see fewer rather than more in order that those we start are properly monitored and controlled <e> <s> i do not want to see them exploited and i think that the noble baronesss amendment would help in this way <e> <s> i am not too worried about whether the detail is right <e> <s> it is the philosophy behind it which is vitally important <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord would give way <e> <s> i deeply regret that he should burden the committee with now minutes of a report which per cent <e> <s> of your lordships have not seen <e> <s> certainly i will look at it but for the noble lord to read out only parts of it when the majority of noble lords have not seen it is i think totally irresponsible if i may say so <e>", "<cs> since the noble lord asks me yes i will intervene <e> <s> i think the noble lord opposite is being irresponsible <e> <s> no doubt the government will publish this report in due course and we shall he able to have a debate on it in due course when we can all give our views <e> <s> this is the committee stage believe it or not of the agriculture bill and i think we should try to address ourselves to that <e>", "<cs> the noble lord referred to me or looked at me <e> <s> as i understand it esas are going to be funded in a way totally different from sites of special scientific interest which my noble friend mentioned when he replied earlier to the noble baroness lady white <e> <s> therefore this report as such does not bear on this amendment <e> <s> what we are discussing is whether this amendment is the right way forward <e> <s> when we come to that report at another time no doubt we can deal with it <e> <s> but here we are dealing with blanket planning in the countryside which i with my noble friend oppose totally because we run a rather successful business <e> <s> if anybody who has been in the countryside this weekend says that we are ruining the country he must be out of his mind <e>", "<cs> for once i can agree with the noble lord to start with <e> <s> those who break the law and obstruct footpaths should be brought to court and the situation should be put right <e> <s> the trouble is how to do it <e> <s> that is where we disagree entirely <e> <s> i remind the committee that rights of way are in the same category as highways they are highways <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank the noble baroness lady nicol for her last remark that the way forward is co-operation <e> <s> i could not agree more <e> <s> there is one point which i would query with my noble friend on the front bench over these landscape conservation orders <e> <s> there is a danger if they are used in conjunction with esas of taking away the voluntary side of it <e> <s> the whole principle of esas is voluntary co-operation <e> <s> if there is a threat of a landscape conservation order coming in behind it may well destroy this voluntary approach <e> <s> i would regret that very much <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the house will sympathise with him for having to give such a negative reply <e> <s> how does he reconcile that reply with the code of practice recently issued by the department of employment which says that private firms should pay interest and should pay their accounts on time <e> <s> do i understand my noble friend to say that there is one law for the government and another for me <e>", "<cs> my lords may i finally ask as this is an administrative matter whether it is not possible for the government to pay costs adminis-tratively <e> <s> if my noble friend does not want to answer this question now will he take it away and think about it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry but i mean the interest as well as the costs <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the philosophy behind the noble lords amendment and i go along with it quite a long way but there are certain snags as i see it <e> <s> one is in making it a statutory duty on the poor unfortunate adas officer who comes to see me to advise me on this particular matter <e>", "<cs> all right my lords i will take that back but it will make it a duty on him to give advice on this matter <e>", "<cs> all right my lords a power <e> <s> but my objection to it is that he will be put in an invidious position because enjoyment of the countryside is subjective what is beauty and what is not <e> <s> you may find the unfortunate adas officer saying i think that really you ought to make hay rather than silage because it is rather more beautiful <e> <s> in fact he may even think that i ought to make it in the way that constable showed us how to make it years ago <e> <s> that is the first point <e>", "<cs> my lords for once i agree with my noble friend rather than my noble kinsman lord onslow for a change <e> <s> i think we are being ungrateful to the minister for the trouble he has taken in bringing forward this amendment <e> <s> i have no reason to know but i suspect he had quite a job getting this past his colleagues <e>", "<cs> my lords i find this an interesting amendment <e> <s> i am sorry that more noble lords are not present in the house at the moment <e> <s> as a farmer i am desperately interested in the consumer <e> <s> without him or her i should not be in business <e> <s> it is important to know what he or she wants as opposed to what i think he or she wants or the conservationists or the animal welfarists think he or she wants <e> <s> i want to know what the consumer wants and then i may be able to produce what he or she wants <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i am being asked to comment on the series of amendments that i have on this point <e> <s> i am glad to say to my noble friend that i am happy with his arrange-ment albeit it is a little more lengthy than mine <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether my noble friend would give way <e> <s> i spoke last night to the chairman of the tenant farmers association <e> <s> they are very much in favour of this amendment and they do not say what the noble lord thinks that they have said <e> <s> i am sorry to have to say that but i can say it categorically unless they have said something different to the noble lord of course <e>", "<cs> i quite agree my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords as i put my name to this amendment perhaps i may intervene <e> <s> the first point raised by my noble friend lord radnor and others concerns subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords it is attached to the land that i am talking about the tenants land <e> <s> perhaps i may address myself to the remarks of my noble friend lord belstead <e> <s> i was interested in the point he made <e> <s> i had a slightly different picture in mind in so far as it was possible that the tenant had been given the quota by his father his aunt or his grandmother and i should have thought this could be quite common that this would fall into the category of the amendment moved earlier by my noble friend as though the tenant had purchased the quota from outside <e> <s> i do not know whether my noble friend wishes to think about that and reply to it now or whether perhaps i should write to him between now and third reading so that he can consider the matter <e> <s> i think that we are all on level keel about this except that he sees it in a different light to the way i see it <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend <e> <s> with that assurance i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i think there must be a certain amount of radioactivity between the noble lord lord mackie of benshie and myself on this matter <e> <s> i also considered this amendment with suspicion <e> <s> i believe that in fact it would restrict the arbitrators latitude and i would put it to my noble friend lord belstead that if it is a dairy farm and that is written into the tenancy there is no need for this amendment <e> <s> however if it is not a dairy farm so far as the tenancy is concerned then it is unfair in assuming as i think the noble lord lord mackie of benshie pointed out that the tenant should have farmed it in an intensive dairy manner whereas he might have used it partly to farm sheep or corn or beef <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that my noble friend has given that reply <e> <s> i make just four points <e> <s> first anybody who has milk cows and can obtain litres from each is not doing too badly and i doubt whether there is a single person in this chamber who would be capable of doing it <e> <s> secondly my noble friend is saying in effect that the average tenant who can produce this litres per cow which as i said i consider to be high is only deserving of per cent <e> <s> of the quota value <e> <s> i do not think that is just <e> <s> i know that every tenant in this country and in scotland would think that is too low <e>", "<cs> my lords let me deal with my noble friend lord stodart regarding wales <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already spoken <e> <s> i have no right to reply <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> he has understood the point correctly <e> <s> i tried to nod to him but he was looking the other way <e> <s> i accept the point that he is making <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot support this amendment and the noble lord lord melchett will know that i cannot <e> <s> first of all i am surprised that he has per cent <e> <s> support from the countryside commission <e> <s> i must say that i have not had a brief to that effect <e> <s> no doubt when he sums up he will say that he has had per cent <e> <s> support from the countryside commission <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not say necessarily signs i said extra work and extra stress <e> <s> as my noble friend lord belstead said we will not know where we are going to put them in two or three years time <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank all noble lords for the great trouble and effort they have taken in participating in this debate <e> <s> i must reply to one or two of the remarks that have been made <e> <s> first i thank the noble and learned lord lord denning for his very helpful remarks <e> <s> as he said it is a question of time and money and trouble <e> <s> there is the difficulty of finding the squatter and that is why i feel it must be a criminal offence which i think the noble and learned lord felt too <e> <s> he pointed out correctly that these people are totally different from the rambler to whom i shall come in a moment <e> <s> it is time that the law was changed <e> <s> he said i think i quote him correctly that we should be able to overcome the difficulties <e> <s> it sounds from the remarks of my noble friend on the front bench that that is just what my noble friend is trying to do <e> <s> i thank him very much <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend for that explanation <e> <s> i have to admit that i have difficulty in finding fault with the scheme if it really is one-fifth of per cent <e> <s> i hope that those noble lords who come from scotland will not think i am being somewhat suspicious that i am being ripped off as they say by them <e> <s> but to be serious if my noble friend intends to make the regulations such as to make identical farms in england and wales against those in scotland have a difference of only one-fifth of per cent <e> <s> then yes i have reluctantly to concede the point on this <e> <s> but of course we have not seen the regulations yet and it is up to my noble friend to make sure that this is so when the regulations are produced for us as i know he will <e> <s> with that i beg leave to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords it goes without saying that i support the amendment and i shall not bore your lordships as to why i do so <e> <s> but if some of your lordships and indeed my noble friend lord belstead feel that this amendment tips the balance too far in favour of the tenant as my noble friend lord middleton felt it did i would say that by accepting it we would give the other place a chance to discuss it <e> <s> quite frankly the other place has not had a chance to discuss in full this whole clause which deals with milk compensation <e> <s> i believe that it should be given this opportunity <e> <s> i hope therefore that your lordships will see this as a way of giving the other place the opportunity even if it wishes to moderate the actual details of the amendment of the noble lord lord mackie of benshie <e> <s> i support it <e>", "<cs> my lords i have recently criticised my noble friend for being mean over motorway competition <e> <s> on this occasion i should like to correct the balance by thanking him on behalf of the agricultural forestry and horticultural industries for the exemptions provided and also in the absence of my chairman my noble friend the duke of atholl i should particularly like to thank my noble friend for the representations that he is making to the commission on behalf of the rnli <e> <s> we are most grateful for that exemption <e> <s> i support the regulations <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down may i say that that was only one small part of my amendment <e> <s> there are three other amendments <e> <s> has he no feelings about that <e>", "<cs> it will probably be convenient if i comment very briefly on the four amendments that i have down first of all no <e> <s> bb which was my prevention rather than cure amendment <e> <s> from what i understand from my noble friend he accepts the principle that it would be a good idea but believes it is too difficult to draft <e> <s> listening to members i accept that point <e> <s> i am sorry that it is too difficult to draft because even the noble lord lord mishcon will agree that as a principle it is better to prevent if you cannot cure <e> <s> if we cannot cure then i am prepared to accept that <e> <s> as far as amendment no <e> <s> bc which deals with the number of vehicles is concerned i understand that my noble friend is going to look at it again and perhaps he will confirm this and that possibly the answer as has been suggested by members is that we should not have any number in at all <e> <s> i think that maybe that is right <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend considers any alteration to the very successful straw-burning rules will he consider the knock-on effects that this could have <e> <s> for instance what would we do with the million extra tonnes which would be wandering around <e> <s> an alteration to the rules would inevitably increase both bankruptcies among farmers and the use of precious fossil fuels it would also increase the nitrogen level in some of our waters <e> <s> finally i congratulate my noble friend on tackling such a hot number on his first appearance at the dispatch box <e>", "<cs> my lords the act is a most interesting one <e> <s> indeed i had never heard of it until a few weeks ago and i am sure that a great many people had not heard of it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to hear that <e> <s> if it is resurrected a great many people may be somewhat surprised at its contents <e> <s> indeed perhaps even the noble lord lord mishcon might prefer my amendment to some of the parts of that act but i shall leave it at that <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend replies i wish to say that i oppose the amendment <e> <s> i hope that in amendment no <e> <s> i have a way out that may help the noble lord <e> <s> we shall come to it later <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i am correct in replying to the amendment to the amendment first <e> <s> i should like to thank my noble friend lord caithness for his helpful remarks <e> <s> i should also like to thank the noble lord lord hutchinson and the noble baroness who knows so much on this subject for supporting the amendment <e> <s> i am glad that on this occasion this philistine can support english heritage <e>", "<cs> but my lords in all seriousness i believe that any police officer and much more important a magistrate and if i may be a little naughty here particularly a country magistrate would be able to interpret the word adjacent <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not really thank my noble friend for that particular remark <e> <s> as i said earlier when i introduced my amendment i accept the protection in subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords like the vehicles it is somewhat unclear <e> <s> however bearing in mind the assurances that i have had from my noble friend and in particular the subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords it will not have escaped your lordships notice that according to clause agricultural products are excluded from the bill <e> <s> indeed my noble and learned friend the lord advocate said that no other member state has made agricultural produce liable <e> <s> it is important that farmers in this country are not unfairly dealt with <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way before he leaves that point <e> <s> i hope that before we come to the committee stage the noble lord will make particular reference to the food and environment protection act and all the other acts that i quoted in my speech because he will find that the point he mentioned about chemical residues is covered <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness makes me break cover over slugs <e> <s> i have often eaten them and i am still alive although it might affect my appearance <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may add a word of support for my noble friend on the front bench <e> <s> earlier this afternoon at question time there was an interchange as regards simple language which would enable us all to understand legislation <e> <s> as a potato producer it is clear to me that when my process finishes industrial processes start <e> <s> as my noble friend has said the potato comes into the store and i sort it out <e> <s> it is clear to me that that is not an industrial process <e> <s> however if we put the word initial in i may have to think again <e> <s> at the end of the day i must interpret this legislation we have been told that earlier <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i shall be in the position at some stage of trying to interpret whether i have carried out a process or not <e> <s> i have to say to the noble lord that i do not like this amendment mainly for the reasons that the noble and learned lord lord denning gave <e> <s> if the words in the amendment undergone any process are included they could well cause doubt in my mind when i am lifting sugar beet or sorting potatoes <e> <s> at the moment for better or worse i consider that the directive allows me to be exempt for what i do inside the farm gate <e> <s> once outside then i believe it becomes a farm process <e>", "<cs> i think i had sat down <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lords lord walston and lord john-mackie for their very warm support <e> <s> both pointed out how different agriculture is today from what it was say years ago or indeed only years ago and the vital need for skill training as opposed to learning by following dad <e> <s> i should also like to thank my noble friend lord hesketh for his support and for answering some of the awkward questions about dogs and suchlike <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e> <s> therefore unless any noble lord objects i beg to move that the order of commitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> i hope the committee will support this amendment for all the reasons given by the noble lord lord cornwallis and by my noble friends lord salisbury and lord renton <e> <s> i do not want to repeat the points they have made but i hope that the committee will seize the real difference between compulsory purchase compensation in the public interest for infrastructure as opposed to compensation for private commercial enterprises as envisaged in this bill and indeed as i see it to be envisaged in future privatisation bills <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down i should like to put his mind at rest <e> <s> he is also supporting the tenants <e> <s> that may make him feel a little happier <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened carefully to my noble friend <e> <s> he said that he understood our concerns that he found it a difficult matter and he finally finished with the assurance that he would look at this again <e> <s> so far as i am concerned looking at the procedures again really does not go far enough <e> <s> how far are we to go on looking <e> <s> are we going to look today <e> <s> are we going to look tomorrow <e> <s> it seems to me that tomorrow never comes for the government when they do not want it to come unless they are given very considerable encouragement which i hope your lordhips will do tonight <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for what he said in that last sentence <e> <s> i am <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that imported pests may be necessary to control bracken <e> <s> in that case does she know what the ncc might say bearing in mind the powers of the government to restrict imports of pests and bugs under the act <e>", "<cs> my lords this is the first and i hope the last time that i have to apologise for having to catch a train so i may not be able to be here for the winding-up speech of my noble friend this evening <e> <s> the alternative is to face divorce which after years of marriage would be very expensive <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for accepting the last part of my amendment <e> <s> i am disappointed that he cannot look at the other two parts <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish that we could pass the whole amendment as the noble lord will realise <e> <s> unfortunately my noble friend can give me only a little but a little is better than nothing i suppose <e> <s> that is all the more reason why we should consider the other two points <e> <s> i know that my noble friend is very busy between now and third reading but i hope he will look again at the points i have made <e> <s> i am trying to give the magistrates more power and taking work off the crown court <e> <s> however bearing that in mind i beg leave to withdraw the amendment in the hope that my noble friend will bring something forward at third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords i should also like to say thank you <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend replies i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> strangely enough a similar situation occurred on my farm with a self-pick farm shop <e> <s> it was not satisfactory to put it on our land and we had to put it somewhere else <e> <s> i hope my noble friend will think about this quite deeply <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord answers i do not think that my noble friend should be too worried <e> <s> while rents are at the height they are today it would not be feasible for the tenant to take up the incentives offered in the scheme <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend makes up his mind what to do i am concerned by the reply of my noble friend on the front bench because it implied to me that the amendment is too expensive <e> <s> it may be said that it is too expensive but if any scheme is to work it requires sufficient funds <e> <s> if the government do not intend to put sufficient funds forward to make this or any other scheme work to reduce our surpluses then we will continue as farmers to be in the muddle that we are in today <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend replies i am afraid that i have one or two queries <e> <s> the first is an easy one <e> <s> it relates to the means test <e> <s> what happens if the farmer incurs loss and he has in national savings <e> <s> is he means-excluded from the scheme <e> <s> my second point follows those made by noble lords opposite on planning <e> <s> if the process requires planning is it possible for the government to look carefully at whether the two departments planning and the ministry of agriculture fisheries and food could get together so that the schemes could be taken together rather than go forward with the ministry and then have to obtain planning permission afterwards <e> <s> that seems to be a waste of time <e>", "<cs> my lords whenever the subject of pollution is mentioned either the government are blamed or the farmer <e> <s> i am pleased to note that most noble lords who have taken part in the debate tonight realise that such a simplification of the problem is rubbish for it is man and nature who are and always have been the main cause of pollution <e> <s> it is not in the governments nor the farmers power totally to control either <e> <s> that is not to say that both should not try to minimise the problem <e>", "<cs> as my name is on this amendment perhaps i may suggest to the committee and to my noble friend lord hesketh in particular some answers to the points raised in defence of the governments proposed abolition of the dog licence which in my opinion hold very little water indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend is not going to reply perhaps i can finish this debate because i am sure we want a decision <e> <s> i think i must answer one or two questions <e> <s> first of all there is the question of money <e> <s> yes it will cost money <e> <s> we are suggesting that it could cost once and for all <e> <s> that does not sound much and the reason for that is the help which we shall receive from the rspca which is horrified at the amount of money it has to spend doing the horrible task of putting down unwanted dogs <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend replies i should like to reinforce one point made by the noble lord <e> <s> lord irving <e> <s> where is the million to come from <e> <s> can my noble friend say whether it will be funded to the local authorities <e> <s> if he cannot say that today i sympathise with him and perhaps he can tell us the answer at third reading <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank noble lords for the contributions which they have made and particularly the noble lord lord mcintosh <e> <s> village shops have much to fear <e> <s> i shall keep my powder dry now because i have some fairly nasty figures which will come up at the next stage but i do not think my noble friend understands the vital social role which these shops play in the village <e> <s> that must be brought clearly home to the government who time and time again say that they are worried about this <e> <s> meanwhile i shall reserve my position to come back at report stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> one of the ways in which farmers and others who live in the countryside can create employment and wealth is by letting accommodation as holiday flats or homes <e> <s> this amendment which is supported by the tourist association and the national farmers union suggests that the best way to rate these holiday lets is by having them rated under the national non-domestic rate rather than under a multiplier of the community charge <e> <s> there are two reasons for preferring this method of charging <e> <s> first the charge will be predictable which is important for a business <e> <s> secondly the charge will be geared to the size of the business <e> <s> if as i hope the government concede that this is how they believe holiday lets should be dealt with i have a query or two to put to my noble friend <e> <s> my queries would apply even if he does not accept the principle <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend withdraws the amendment i must say that i was somewhat staggered by the point brought up by the noble lord lord mcintosh <e> <s> i had assumed that the position would continue as it is now and that ordinary bed and breakfast would not attract any charge <e> <s> perhaps i may ask my noble friend two questions <e> <s> first will he accept the principle of my amendment which is for what i call fair long-term holiday letting to be rated under the non-domestic rate <e> <s> because as i understand it when the rating officer comes round to rate he will have a fair idea whether that flat or holiday accommodation will be let for a month two months or three months and will set the charge as such <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will feed that in <e> <s> my next question is one which my noble friend probably will not like but i should like to have an answer to the question whether such properties will be rated under the national non-domestic rate by report stage if possible otherwise i shall feel obliged to table a similar amendment again <e>", "<cs> my lords it would probably be for the convenience of the house if i spoke to amendments nos <e> <s> and which really relate to village shops <e> <s> this problem of village shops was discussed at committee stage in particular the disadvantages which they face economically from the large high street retail shop as the noble lord lord graham said <e> <s> under this bill these shops will be paying a business rate on the shop part of their house as well as having to pay a personal community charge so they could be paying twice over <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that i put up this hare originally and it ran faster than i expected helped by the noble lord lord mcintosh and my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to thank my noble friend for that statement <e> <s> i did not realise how complicated the issue was when i raised it <e> <s> i am glad that in principle he accepts that those properties should be rated under the non-domestic rate <e> <s> i am very grateful for his efforts and for the efforts of his department <e>", "<cs> if i may i shall interrupt on that point because it is rather important <e> <s> under the rent agriculture act these families will not even be put on the list <e> <s> on the point made by my noble friend lady faithfull about the homeless they are at least accommodated and are waiting to be put on the list <e> <s> i merely want my people to wait <e>", "<cs> i thank the committee for the interest it has shown in this debate <e> <s> i should like to comment on a few matters raised by my noble friend on the front bench <e> <s> he said that the position of the agricultural worker was not dissimilar to that of the homeless <e> <s> that is the point i am trying to make <e> <s> it is dissimilar <e> <s> in the case of the homeless there is a duty <e> <s> in the case of the farmworker it is not a duty and i shall explain exactly why i am worried about that duty having been weakened <e>", "<cs> my noble friend will not be surprised to hear that i do not agree with him in the least <e> <s> he says that section d provides that any other matters whatever he considers relevant will deal with the problem that i have raised <e> <s> it will not <e> <s> with the greatest respect the whole clause deals with sections and of the housing act dealing with the terms of the tenancy <e> <s> if a lawyer is thinking about the terms of a tenancy he will not think about the need to rehouse <e> <s> i cannot agree with my noble friend <e> <s> i am advised by my lawyers that they would not think in that way they would think as i have done <e> <s> that is my first difference of opinion <e>", "<cs> my lords i speak as a shepherd or i try to be a shepherd and i thank the select committee and the noble lord lord gallacher in particular for bringing this very valuable report to the attention of the house and the sheep industry <e> <s> i shall confine my remarks to just two aspects <e>", "<cs> my lords i knew i would be dissatisfied with my noble friends reply <e> <s> i have been rather dissatisfied with him lately <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord lord mcintosh has found my noble friend somewhat inflexible today if i may say so <e>", "<cs> my lords that is indeed the point <e> <s> i am still a little worried as to whether there will be the ability to re-house <e> <s> i do not know whether my noble friend can add one final point <e> <s> i asked him i do not think he replied in so many words about the guidelines sent to local authorities which clearly state their responsibilities to re-house agricultural workers <e> <s> as i understand it they only refer to large-scale disposals <e> <s> i wonder whether he can confirm that the guidelines also apply to small-scale disposals <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not entirely happy with my noble friends reply but i shall study what he said <e> <s> meanwhile i can see that regrettably i shall not make any more progress on this matter <e> <s> i shall just have to trust that the position works out as well as my noble friend on the front bench hopes and believes that it will <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that encouraging answer <e> <s> will the government make it an enforceable requirement that all bottles and cans that contain drink carry a returnable charge <e> <s> as far as the cans are concerned will he also make it illegal for the little bit that opens the can to fall apart when one pulls it out and insist that it should be retained on the can as is common practice in other countries <e> <s> that would stop children and animals being harmed by the sharp edges <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend realise that to delay joining the ems makes solving our already difficult agricultural problems even more difficult <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no views on whether or not water should be privatised <e> <s> however it might help my noble friend if i listed some of the points that concern me or that i feel need clarification during the passage of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords is not one of the problems that the wildlife and countryside act placed a duty on the secretary of state to consider all the objections <e> <s> does the minister not agree that that makes it very difficult to produce marine nature reserves such as the one proposed for the menai straits where there have been a great many objections <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord prys-davies asked the government a very pertinent and indeed sensitive question <e> <s> in the first instance i hope that my noble friend lord trefgarne will agree that it is vitally important not to destroy rural communities <e> <s> if he does not then i think the sooner i jump off the south <e> <s> stack into the irish sea the better <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not watch the programme <e> <s> so far as concerns people with caravans i accept that that certainly happens and it is sad <e> <s> for those who probably own houses in the area it is less of a problem <e> <s> the point i was making is that the neighbours i know who are part-time farmers are not providing the food but are providing slates bricks and mortar which brings in a very welcome extra income <e>", "<cs> my lords my concerns about this bill are almost identical to those concerning the water bill and relate to two main points <e> <s> first compensation for land taken by the public liability companies must be at a realistic value and not at the existing use value which apart from being unjust will encourage the electricity plcs to develop on green field sites <e> <s> i believe that they will be encouraged and forced to do so by their shareholders <e>", "<cs> i understand that this is a radical approach to try to find money for the national rivers authority <e> <s> my noble friend on the front bench may not feel able to accept it in total today <e> <s> we do not feel that that is necessary but i hope that he will be able to take away this amendment and think very seriously about it between now and report stage <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend sits down he stated that he thought that this sum of money should come from the treasury <e> <s> did he listen to the remarks of my noble friend lord crickhowell who said very strongly at second reading that he wished to be independent of the treasury <e>", "<cs> my lords my remarks will be addressed to the challenge that faces the agricultural industry on the coming of the single european market in <e> <s> before the industry can take advantage of that single market it is essential to know what is likely to happen which of course may not be exactly as is proposed <e> <s> after the speech of the noble earl lord shannon noble lords may think some of my remarks a little detailed <e> <s> however unless one gets the detail right in any project and certainly in the single market it will not work <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that answer <e> <s> is it true that the commission believe that our pest schedule as i call it is contrary to their birds directive <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that he would have the wholehearted support of every shepherd and indeed of every noble lord who took an interest in drawing up that schedule in the act if he strongly resisted such a move <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord withdraws the amendment may i say that i regret that i did not realise that my noble friend would take this amendment with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i thought that he would take it with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i have two points to raise on my amendment but it is up to him to say whether he would rather that i spoke later than now <e>", "<cs> i should apologise to the committee <e> <s> i specifically asked that my amendment no <e> <s> should be taken with this amendment rather than with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> therefore with the permission of my noble friend on the front bench i will speak to my amendment now as it fits in much closer with the amendment that has been moved <e> <s> two points that have been raised are relevant <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend <e> <s> i shall remember that in future <e>", "<cs> i did listen to that part of it <e>", "<cs> i feel that there is a spy in your lordships house <e> <s> my noble friend must have seen me creeping around the library the day before yesterday in order to obtain paragraph d <e> <s> if he did not he must have another spy <e> <s> i have read that paragraph <e> <s> for the moment as my noble friend is no doubt one stage ahead of me i will leave it until we come to discuss this matter in more detail under clause <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords while i welcome my noble friends initial reply is he aware <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that i was entirely satisfied with my noble friends a reply <e> <s> for instance she did not reply to the question regarding surplus power <e> <s> she did not say if i produce surplus power whether it will go into the grid <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble baroness for giving way <e> <s> if she really wants answers to these detailed questions surely it would be much more satisfactory for the committee and everyone else if she were to table amendments <e> <s> the minister would then be able to give a proper answer <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to cross swords with the noble baroness <e> <s> it is possible to table probing amendments just as everyone else does <e> <s> the minister can then give a reply <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank noble lords for their support <e> <s> i think that all of us including my noble friend lord hesketh are on the same side it is just a question of how we deal with the problem <e> <s> perhaps i should say to my noble friend lady blatch that it was a probing amendment <e> <s> i put it down before i read the report in <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment <e> <s> i have had experience of a water authority which discharged raw sewage on to my fields <e> <s> i eventually went to court to stop it and all that it did was to put the raw sewage into its own stream <e> <s> that is totally irresponsible <e> <s> it backs up the case made by the noble lord lord mcintosh <e> <s> water authorities must be stopped from doing that which is why i feel that the secretary of state should have such a power <e>", "<cs> we have made progress because we have now had an absolutely categoric statement from the minister that we might pay more or we might pay less and that we could be differentially charged against <e> <s> this is very different from the story we had when the matter came from another place <e> <s> we have achieved something <e> <s> at least we know where we are <e> <s> it is quite clear that the plcs will be able to charge more for rural outlying places than for towns a point raised by my noble friend lord wise <e> <s> consumers may well pay more because as my noble friend lord middleton said the cost is so high that a great many people will go onto private supplies and the matter will become even more difficult <e> <s> that is why i bring up my next point <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> i very much regret the fact that my noble friend is withdrawing that phrase <e> <s> i expect that kind of remark <e> <s> i also expect that i am sometimes somewhat naughty in trying to put words into his mouth which he does not really want to have put there <e> <s> in conclusion all i say to my noble friend is this <e> <s> i suggest to him that if he will take out clause b as opposed to clause a then i may be just a little happier <e> <s> we cannot go futher on the matter at this stage but i hope that my noble friend and i shall be able to discuss the matter between now and report stage <e> <s> perhaps we can introduce something better into the model clause especially in regard to condition d <e> <s> in the meantime i thank members of the committee for their help and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> will my noble friend give way for a minute <e> <s> i shall move that amendment in one second plus all the others and it might be easier if we just stick to the main point <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to interrupt my noble friend but i have not spoken to those amendments <e> <s> i thought we came to an agreement that the minister would answer the general questions before i moved those three amendments <e> <s> i have not moved them yet <e>", "<cs> i am sure that i shall be out of order but first of all i should like to thank my noble friend very much for those very good answers <e> <s> at least we now know where we are <e> <s> we may not like the answers but that is another matter <e>", "<cs> i am perfectly happy to do so but it is a matter for the noble lord the deputy chairman <e>", "<cs> after that adjournment i should like to explain this series of amendments nos <e> <s> c d and e <e> <s> it was confirmed in the governments recent consultation paper that where farmers are obliged to restrict their agricultural practices beyond the degree which could be regarded as good agricultural practice they should be compensated <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may just say to the noble lord lord mcintosh that we discussed quite fully the proposition that establishing nitrate sensitive areas was probably not the right answer in many cases and my noble friend on the front bench accepted that <e>", "<cs> the government have failed to follow through the basic principle that with nsas i repeat the polluter does not pay <e> <s> if my noble friend can get that back to the government it would help us all the way through <e> <s> if she is saying that we pay it is a different matter but the government have not accepted that we pay so in my opinion it is no good saying that just because the rest of the bill does not accept this sort of compensation it follows in this case <e> <s> we are the exception in so far as for better or worse i should like to say better we are not polluters in this case <e>", "<cs> i believe that it clarifies the situation and gives this amendment and my previous amendment even more merit <e> <s> my noble friend is shaking her head <e> <s> we shall have to come back to this on report <e> <s> i raise these as genuine probing amendments and i shall have to read carefully the ministers remarks <e>

of the way <e> <s> i do not feel so strongly about this matter it is a transitional one <e> <s> however i shall just repeat the question asked by my noble friend lord middleton what is the hurry <e>

<e> <s> however i shall leave that aspect for the moment and in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i do not intend to waste the committees time on this matter <e> <s> i still believe that i am right <e> <s> if my noble kinsman lord russell were here he might have a better idea than i do <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to my noble friend for coming i think halfway towards my views <e> <s> i fully take the point of the noble lord lord hylton which i have been trying to convey to the committee that if nsas are made they will revolutionise farming to a drastic extent <e> <s> it could mean that the public would have to pay more which might help me as a farmer but i do not think that that is particularly kind or right thing to do <e> <s> i am just saying that these are drastic measures as the noble lord lord hylton indicated and that farmers and the public will need time to adapt to them <e>", "<cs> i am deeply disappointed by my noble friends remarks <e> <s> i can hardly agree with a word <e> <s> if i really wanted to annoy the front bench i would say to my noble friend lord caithness that the reply must have come straight out of a computer in marsham street <e> <s> i am sure that i shall get into trouble over that <e> <s> it shows a complete misunderstanding of the whole problem <e> <s> the committee has accepted that this is something radical that could happen to a farmer much more radical than a site of special scientific interest yet you do not even bother to go and tell him personally <e> <s> what a government <e> <s> what an organisation <e> <s> i am sorry but i am not pleased with my noble friend <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble friend for that remark <e> <s> while she is considering this matter perhaps she will bear in mind that water protection zones are a different matter from this provision <e> <s> i am sorry to keep repeating myself but these are serious matters for the farmer and indeed for the country <e> <s> i wish to mention another instance against my noble friend which concerns ministry of transport line orders for new motorways and trunk roads <e> <s> in the highways act under schedule paragraph one is allowed a three-month objection period <e> <s> new roads do not affect farmers lives half as much as the governments proposal may affect them <e> <s> i do not use that example with any desire to be unpleasant to my noble friend but perhaps she will bear that in mind when she is considering the provision <e> <s> however i am most grateful for what she has offered me <e>", "<cs> i am more than aware that my noble friend is aware of the importance of this matter <e> <s> what i am not so sure of is whether the public and the farmers are aware of its importance <e> <s> one of the reasons i am moving these probing amendments is to drive the importance of this matter home to people outside this chamber <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i shall not waste the committees time on the matter <e> <s> i am not sure that i am happy but i think that it would be far better for me to speak to my noble friend between now

possibly for a large number of years <e> <s> there might perhaps be a secretary of state or minister who would not carry the confidence that my noble friend does <e> <s> i shall therefore have to think about the matter <e> <s> i take what my noble friend says and i understand the problem <e> <s> there might be a middle way here not a full public inquiry but some form of inquiry <e> <s> i am sure that we could think about the matter between now and report stage and perhaps find a proper form of words <e>", "<cs> i believe that was a very satisfactory answer <e> <s> unless my noble friend says something different as i understand it the national rivers authority will be able to give this advice <e> <s> she did not say whether it will be free or whether on the first visit prosecutions i will not say will be forbidden but will be looked on kindly as something not to do <e> <s> i do not know whether she feels inclined to volunteer that information <e> <s> i do not believe she does <e>

shall perhaps write to him between now and report stage to see whether he will consider a slight increase <e> <s> my noble friend lord monk bretton has a point <e> <s> on a large or even a normal herd is running very tight <e> <s> perhaps a slight increase might be welcome <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i was most interested in my nobel friends reply <e>

example which i find most strange <e> <s> it is near a farm in oxford <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for both those replies <e> <s> he has caught me out in both respects <e> <s> in fact i would take my hat off to him if i had a hat on at quarter past two in the morning <e> <s> however i shall check up on the blue boar development to make quite certain of the situation <e> <s> perhaps i may

<e> <s> having said that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> before making my concluding speech i ask my noble friend is he or is he not giving me an undertaking to come back at report

lords on all sides of the chamber who took part in the debate <e> <s> i believe that all members of the committee understand what i and the noble lord lord ezra are trying to achieve with these amendments <e> <s> i take the point made by my noble friend lord renton that we should perhaps look at existing legislation and change that <e> <s> i am afraid that i have not done that as my noble friend knows but perhaps that represents another solution <e>", "<cs> i am terribly sorry i meant to say the north of scotland <e> <s> i shall ask what is the difference between the north of scotland and the north of wales <e> <s> in fact that suits me better because in the north of wales we have two nuclear power stations so we provide quite a lot of power just as the north of scotland provides a lot in the form of hydro-electric power <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that i am right in saying that during the slave trade her majestys ships could stop slavers to search for slaves <e> <s> does my noble friend know whether her majestys ships are allowed to stop ships which they think have illegal ivory on board <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it the amendment of the noble lord lord mcintosh must be grouped with the one that is in my name and in the names of the noble lord lord ezra and the noble earl lord shannon <e> <s> it is a paving amendment <e> <s> i am sorry that i have rushed your lordships on this but i cannot be responsible for british rail having a signal failure at rugby <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps my noble friend will give way for a moment <e> <s> can he

i wonder how many of your lordships have been in the position of feeling that whatever you say or do is bound to be wrong <e> <s> i feel that very strongly at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has not misunderstood me <e> <s> he has understood me absolutely right <e> <s> my noble friend did not answer my last question as to whether he would meet me to discuss putting something on the face of the bill before third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for that generous suggestion <e> <s> my amendment arises again later tonight <e> <s> i shall have tea and think about it <e> <s> i think it would be correct to give my noble friend on the front bench a chance to have a cup tea with me and consider the matter further <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment <e> <s> it concerns a similar problem to that debated at considerable length earlier <e> <s> now that the water authorities are to be public liability companies the old existing practices that worked well enough in the past need careful consideration where the new authority is to be a public liability company driven by profit and competitiveness as the noble earl said with other commercial bodies <e> <s> the whole matter needs careful consideration by my noble friend because it is in line with a problem that comes up time and again <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend accepts that <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that assurance <e> <s> i fully understand that he cannot say precisely what he will put in the bill because neiher he nor i know exactly what he

noble friend is aware of that fact <e> <s> i am not threatening him in anyway but if he is unable to put something on the face of the bill then i shall have to return to the matter on third reading

lords i am sure that the noble lord lord mcintosh is glad to see that the sun has gone in and i am back to throwing bricks from behind my noble friend on to his head <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say to the noble lord lord mcintosh that the crichel down rules have been looked at most carefully in the past <e> <s> however i was trying to suggest to the house that they could perhaps be used with benefit as regards this problem over incidental commercial development which the government have been offering to landowners as a kind of palliative to all the ills in the world <e>", "<cs> my lords i

time has been spent on it and a decision must be reached on the principle <e> <s> i shall first try to comment on a few remarks which i believe to be important <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say a few words about the amendment <e> <s> i have to admit as i said on report that amendment no <e> <s> was not quite correct <e> <s> in fact now that the government have been so good as to accept the amendment to clause i have to further admit that i was just a little concerned that amendment no <e> <s> was sailing close to the wind <e> <s> indeed it gave my noble friend lord renton such a shock

lord hesketh <e> <s> i am delighted that he said he was prepared to listen and would read what has been said <e> <s> i am also pleased that we shall be able to discuss the matter between now and the
