which nobody wants then the sooner somebody pulls it down the better and it should not need planning permission to do so <e>", "<cs> i support this amendment for one additional reason <e> <s> in scotland there are vast distances with farms way out in the outback either on the hills or on the west coast <e> <s> the practical effect will be that farmers will certainly dig up nearby rather than try to get planning permission from somebody miles away in inverness <e>", "<cs> i would like to support my noble friend lord boardman for another reason which i think should be considered that a company might well get planning permission for five years and then a political turn either way could result in a political refusal of planning permission perhaps from public pressure <e> <s> it would be very difficult for industry to know just where it stood <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i could explain this <e> <s> as an example perhaps a mining company might be allowed five acres to start with where they might open-cast <e> <s> then they would have a second five acres perhaps and while they were open-casting that they would replace all the topsoil back on to the first five acres and until the first five acres were completely <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for that and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> would it be convenient to talk on amendment no <e> <s> which comes later but which is dealing with virtually the same thing <e> <s> that amendment reads <e>", "<cs> may i just make one other point which arises from that and has to do with the advice <e> <s> there will be many occasions when an owner is aware of things which a planning authority may not know for example underground streams geological faults and so on <e> <s> it may he greatly to the advantage of the planning authority to dove-tail with the owner <e>", "<cs> this is quite an important point <e> <s> i should like to withdraw it for the moment but i may bring it back at report <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble viscount for his answer <e> <s> can he say whether there are any other plans for increasing orders through the warship builders <e>", "<cs> my lords while we welcome this improvement can my noble friend say why the figures are still below those of despite what must have been a certain amount of modernisation and updating of equipment <e>", "<cs> may i briefly support this amendment <e> <s> planning decisions should be taken for planning reasons but all who have been in local government know that there are occasions when planning decisions are taken for blatently political reasons <e> <s> this can happen on either side i am not blaming one party or the other <e> <s> it may be that a planning decision has been taken against the other partys wishes and the other party may wish to close a mine that has been open <e> <s> therefore the addition of the word reasonable would give some protection against political planning decisions being taken in the middle of the operation of a mine <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for that answer which i am afraid is a little beyond me because i am not a lawyer <e> <s> i should like to take the answer back and have it studied <e> <s> on that understanding i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble earl and on that understanding i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble lord will accept this amendment <e> <s> i think that the arguments have been well put and it should be accepted <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord bellwin made a big point of the fact that councils have a great responsibility to their electors <e> <s> this strengthens enormously the point which was made by the noble lord lord melchett who said that a maverick council might wish to make footpaths and would certainly <e>", "<cs> my lords there are always problems between the british airports authority and the aviation industry and the airlines <e> <s> first and foremost is the lack of adequate consultation by the british airports authority regarding the needs and limitation of needs by airlines operating the authoritys airfields <e> <s> in the past there has been inadequate response and reaction to the needs of airlines at local executive level and often there has been too ambitious local investment beyond the needs of the airlines <e> <s> there <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that intervention <e> <s> i felt that perhaps it was in order to quote something which existed i was not really producing anything new <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise and i will leave out all about aberdeen <e> <s> with regard to stansted again this is in the future

partly by baa with its own profit centre to create good management policies and discipline <e> <s> if the private sector could own per cent <e> <s> and the authority per cent <e> <s> the loan would no longer fall within the psbr <e> <s> the problem would be to design an adequately attractive and guaranteed investment to attract the public <e> <s> perhaps this could be achieved by novel and imaginative tax incentives on the eventual and inevitably delayed dividends to attract both private and institutional investments <e>", "<cs> i hope that the minister will consider the spirit of the amendment because there is no doubt that the cowboys are on the increase and there is a terrific increase in the number of trail riders <e> <s> most of them do not appear to act within the rules of motor-cycle clubs and associations <e> <s> i hope that the minister will give good consideration to the amendment <e>", "<cs> is this not a situation where there is a footpath which is being established but which has not been established as a public footpath and where a farmer or landowner quite rightly wishes to establish the fact that is is not a public footpath <e> <s> he quite rightly

like to state an interest as i am a private forester <e> <s> as the great forests of the americas are felled and it is only recently that any thought has been given to replanting those vast areas and

vast areas of south america and nepal are being levelled and overnight the sparse forest soil of milleniums is washed away never to be replaced <e> <s> what damage to the planet is being caused by the release of all the carbon can only be guessed at <e> <s> by the time it becomes apparent it will be too late to reverse <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that that sounds eminently sensible <e> <s> there are some peculiar worries expressed over the sales of the forests that a forest is going to be taken away <e> <s> when they are bought by private or institutional buyers they will still need managing they will still need a labour force <e> <s> it is silly also for the users to complain that they will no longer be able to buy stocks of timber <e> <s> the growing timber will still have to be sold but the users may have to compete a little more for what they want and this will do nothing but good to them and to forestry <e>", "<cs> i should like to go on with this point <e> <s> one sees this very often when one compares private and commission planting side by side <e> <s> the drawback is bureaucracy and does not reflect against the individual foresters within the commission <e> <s> i do not expect that to appeal to the party opposite <e> <s> however the minister must not at this time of high interest rates expect an immediate demand to buy <e> <s> this will come over the years and particularly at times of lower interest rates <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that answer <e> <s> is he aware that no fewer than per cent <e> <s> of the people polled in a private poll expressed a desire for sunday and late hours trading <e> <s> would he not agree that local authorities might be empowered by means of by-laws to allow such trading in their own areas <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not rather absurd that due to the state of the present laws one is allowed to go into a chemists shop for example late at night or on a sunday and buy one particular article but not another <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to draw further attention for a few minutes to this question of the cancelled lightning squadron <e> <s> it was in july that the under-secretary of state announced that an additional lightning squadron was to be formed <e> <s> it was one of three moves

to what extent he believes that these recurrent disasters are the result of bad weather and to what extent they relate to local political inability <e> <s> can he also say whether helping to improve local political ability would be a great contribution as well as giving relief <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not true that most of the counties that have large areas of dereliction have already made

<e> <s> government grant for the removal of waste heaps <e>", "<cs> my lords could my noble friend say whether the other examples that he mentioned also carried with them such a very big financial liability as there would be if the operator goes bust and is left with everything to pay <e>", "<cs> my lords i will have to withdraw the amendment but i hope if my noble friend cannot find some way around it that he will find a way of absolving the owner who has not been consulted from the risk of having to restore the land himself <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend again and i must beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> it is a battle between background lawyers <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask about one point <e> <s> it is now established that owners of land do not get consulted <e> <s> here we have an amendment which relates to consultation with owners with interest in the land <e> <s> is that not rather an anomaly <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord said earlier on a previous amendment that if the owner was to be consulted it would be the first time <e> <s> he said that on an amendment which i withdrew <e> <s> here we have a case of the owner being consulted <e> <s> it seems to me rather an anomaly <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for meeting that point and if clause does do the job i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i echo the words of the noble lord lord mottistone and thank the minister for dealing with so many of the points which were made during earlier stages of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say whether this particular case is to do with the <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my congratulations to the minister <e> <s> this has been a most interesting bill to work with and it has been particularly encouraging because so many

on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble viscount for that answer <e> <s> could he say what was the cost of these courses and could he also tell us the system of pay and allowances for those who attended them <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the house will agree that this has been a very useful debate <e> <s> we have had some extremely interesting and well-informed speeches <e> <s> i should particularly like to add to the congratulations to my noble friend lord elphinstone <e> <s> he pointed out that farmers are presented with a problem as to whether to do very little and have no overdraft or to modernise and work for the bank <e> <s> that was supported by the noble lord lord woolley who pointed out the difference between borrowing in inflationary and deflationary times <e> <s> i hope that <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say what counter-withdrawal has been made by the soviet union in response to the americans withdrawal of warheads from their stockpile in europe <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble viscount confirm that the transferability of man days has now been stopped and therefore each man is only able to do his strict number of days rather than borrow from another and will this not impinge on the maintenance of vehicles which were maintained by active members doing more than their strict number of days working in place of those who did not turn up <e>", "<cs> my lords i too wish to thank the noble lord lord spens for bringing this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that the reason for that rate rise is the excessive spending of the ilea <e>", "<cs> first i should like to commend the amendment to some extent <e> <s> one has in mind a picture of a nice open forest with fairly mature trees and paths and it would be very unfortunate if such an area were sold and immediately closed to the public <e> <s> in fact i think that would be inexcusable <e> <s> but one must look a little further than that <e> <s> first the forestry commission planted its trees entirely for investment purposes <e> <s> they were planted probably at -ft intervals and were thinned out over many years until they were growing at intervals of ft <e> <s> or so as is seen for instance in the attractive scots pine forests through which one very much likes to walk <e> <s> to suggest that such a forest having been grown at enormous expense should then be sterilised forever as a conservation area is to negate the whole point not only of planting but of the forestry commission itself <e>", "<cs> i take up the point that the noble lord made in referring to me <e> <s> the point is that the timber of today will be the young plantations of tomorrow and if you put a footpath through you cannot or may not be able to replant <e>", "<cs> would it not set an interesting precedent if this amendment were accepted <e> <s> there must be many boards which could claim the same right and the minister would not be able to do anything without the agreement of those many boards in various departments which might not agree with what he wanted to do <e> <s> for future governments this might be more interesting when ministers might find themselves hemmed in from their rather hare-brained schemes <e> <s> on the other hand on this particular point the minister would act only on the advice of the commissioners and would rely entirely on their advice as to which plots of land would best be sold <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble lord who is moving this amendment would consider another amendment at a later stage using the words with the advice of the commissioners or some wording like that rather than with the agreement <e>", "<cs> i think i said on the advice <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for that explanation <e> <s> i do not think that there is much point in my pressing the amendment and therefore i beg leave to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> i should just like to add to what the noble lord lord ross has said inasmuch as one could well get the situation where a previous owner had sold land adjacent to his own interests to the <e>", "<cs> i should like to oppose the amendment <e> <s> i can see no reason why the particular maximum proposed should be fixed <e> <s> i see no harm in selling forestry <e> <s> obviously i would make the firm proviso that the forestry commission must have a minimum acreage for all its requirements regarding experimentation and so on <e> <s> that might amount to or a million acres <e> <s> but subject to that minimum i can see no harm in any amount of forestry going under certain conditions <e>", "<cs> i was going to come to that <e> <s> i agree <e> <s> i was talking about the investment <e> <s> it would be per cent <e> <s> investment for the country instead of per cent <e> <s> and therefore the country is better off <e>", "<cs> you can argue that backwards <e>", "<cs> could my noble friend say a little more about price and flooding the market <e> <s> i am not sure whether he is covering this point <e> <s> this is one of the real points how the prices are going to be maintained so that the sales of private forestry do not drop through the flooding of the market by the forestry commission <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for that answer <e> <s> before i withdraw the amendment can he say whether the condition that the purchaser should continue to maintain the stockproof fencing which it may be the duty of the forestry commission to maintain would be framed in such a way that it would have to be passed on again to a subsequent purchaser should the forestry be resold <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for that explanation <e> <s> i think that there would be no reason why in the sale of a plot of forestry discussions could not take place with the purchaser regarding the plan of operations and what was expected to be done and that that plan of operations could perhaps be included in the contract of sale with conditions <e> <s> it may be that the forestry commission could not follow it up if they were ignored but i believe that if that plan and those conditions were included and discussed with the purchaser thoroughly then in a great number of cases it would be very helpful for the purchaser and indeed might make the difference between those woods being well looked after and neglected <e> <s> i do not know whether the minister would like to take up that suggestion <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that answer <e> <s> is he aware that there is a current report that there are no fewer than soviet divisions in this area <e> <s> if this is true would it not present a very serious threat to the oil states and if it proves to be true will he draw the attention of the ussr to the concern of the west <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say whether there is evidence that the west is still offering cheap interest loans to the soviet union <e> <s> can he assure the house that at least this country will not be associated with such things <e>", "<cs> i should like to raise a point for thought that of the motorist who in pushing himself into a parking place goes into someone elses bumper so causing a dent <e> <s> this is a frequent occurrence <e> <s> if he is seen and does not report that small damage that would be equal in penalty to the penalty given for careless and inconsiderate driving <e> <s> i wonder whether that is the governments intention <e>", "<cs> surely with regard to fixed penalties is it not a fact that a motorist who gets a fixed penalty will have the option to say that he does not like it and would rather go to court <e> <s> surely exactly the same thing happens if a policeman says that he is going to give the motorist three points he can then take the option to go to court <e> <s> therefore he is protected just as well as if the fixed penalty was higher than he considered just <e>", "<cs> i take the point that the noble and learned lord made about consent but i do not feel that he has covered the question <e> <s> if someone is carried in a stolen car then he can be assumed guilty unless he can prove himself innocent <e> <s> if the person was a hitchhiker he would have no idea that the car was stolen but it would be up to him to prove his innocence <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very suspicious of these amendments <e> <s> i hope the government will not accept them <e> <s> forestry is like farming it is farming trees <e> <s> this amendment attempts to interfere for the sake of all sorts of other reasons with the commercial considerations of forestry which are tight enough as it is <e> <s> i think that interference with industry has always had the same effect when politicians get together and interfere with public industry and we have seen it with the nationalised industries <e> <s> the less interference with this growing crop the better <e> <s> indeed if it is interfered with enough the time will come when it will make such huge losses if it has not made them already that public forestry will become one of the things to be cut as being too great a loss-maker <e>", "<cs> my lords this is an important amendment <e> <s> on the question whether land could be <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say whether it is true that already a number of strikes have been made some within miles of the falklands <e> <s> and if that is true or likely to be true what can be physically done by this country to get reparations <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend confirm that sir harold wilson did in fact say what he is alleged to have said <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble viscount confirm that there are coming off the assembly line at hurn at the end of the year two small vac-s which are not sold <e> <s> if that is true would they not be very suitable for transfer to the queens flight <e> <s> secondly is it not a fact that many of the uses to which the queens flight are put would be better and more economically catered for by the hs s in the ministerial flight from northolt <e> <s> therefore is there not a very strong case for combining the ministerial flight and the queens flight <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that very satisfactory answer and it is good news that there are still further plans to improve the productivity of the department in dealing with appeals <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that planning authorities are often loath to grant planning permission for the conversion of rural barns for rural industries because of the danger of precedent being used at subsequent appeals to get other rural industries nearby and is he satisfied that the precedent argument is not being overused to get incorrect planning decisions <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend agree that the reason for this was that the pay scales came out of alignment and that now the pay scales for police have improved the average age of the policeman on the beat should gradually increase <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind that civilisation and business activity do not stop at watford could my noble friend say what the position is further afield in places like birmingham and other important centres <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that this amendment does deserve more consideration <e> <s> as has been mentioned the islanders are entirely british <e> <s> they speak english and they are very few in number <e> <s> they have strict immigration restrictions themselves so they do not constitute a danger with regard to all sorts of people getting into britain and becoming british by first becoming falkland islanders <e> <s> the falkland islanders have the very special problem which is well known with the argentines <e> <s> i believe this puts them quite apart from other dependency and makes them quite different from hong kong because nobody could possibly suggest that all the people in hong kong are british stock <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl say what is the estimated lack of revenue to local authorities throughout the country as a result of this long underdevelopment or lack of development of available land <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say why there is not much greater use being made of

population <e> <s> thirdly the wholesale and now commercial poaching in the estuaries and rivers <e> <s> the poaching of the odd salmon by rod and line and the small net for one for the pot is of no concern <e> <s> the pressures on the salmon are such that if the situation is allowed to deteriorate beyond a certain point the time could come when the total numbers of breeding fish in the rivers

county councils and a number of boroughs the automobile association the rac motor hauliers and so on all supported the improvement <e> <s> could he say whether pressure will be brought on to the greater london council to make a long term plan for improving their part of the road <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend agree that it would be desirable if more beds could be found for

there is a significant difference between the motorist who drives at high speed and the motorist who is just over the speed limit and obviously that point is not recognised with the single three-points penalty system <e> <s> there are also considerable differences among the attitudes of both police forces and individual officers in them as to whether to insist on imposing penalty points or an on-the-spot fine or as often happens to let off the motorist with only a warning <e> <s> i believe that there is a very good argument for the variable penalty points system <e> <s> there is no argument against it <e> <s> if there were to be an argument against it it must also apply to variations that are accepted in other parts of the bill <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl sits down finally may i just ask him whether special constables come into the category of traffic wardens or of police regarding this particular aspect <e>", "<cs> may i raise a third question <e> <s> it is the question of damage <e> <s> in the event of a policeman locking or unlocking presumably there must be a liability for damage should he chip paint off or whatever <e> <s> what would be the position with regard to damages to the vehicle if he authorised a third person to do it <e>", "<cs> i should like briefly to support the amendment and to say that having the right type of device might save a great deal of money in damages in the long run <e>", "<cs> this also worries me because i think that it is the thin end of a wedge which could well be tried elsewhere by other towns <e> <s> most other towns have no traffic problems resembling those of london but they consider that their traffic situation is very bad <e> <s> if this was successful in westminster which it could well be the next thing to happen would be that on a friday morning in this house we would have an affirmative resolution which would pop through and before long we would find every police constable in every large country town

around one can get to the city in minutes and not face a parking problem and so on <e> <s> there is however the problem of such places as hyde park corner which is difficult to get round although it

intends to check bicyclists speeds <e> <s> does he intend to have policeman mounted on bicycles with blue flashing beacons checking them at pph <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend accept that most of his noble friends on this side accepted and agreed with most of the statements made by members of the party opposite at the time they were in government and were in the same situation with the only exception that it seems that we have been much more generous <e>", "<cs> my lords briefly i should like to speak on one particular matter <e> <s> dereliction in town areas is very likely to produce the situation whereby the area can be redeveloped and therefore be financially rewarding whether for the individual or for the local authority <e> <s> but in the case of a national park even if the land is restored from its use as pit heaps or whatever which caused it to become derelict it is highly unlikely to have any residual value apart from after a long period when perhaps a few sheep can be grazed on it <e> <s> therefore perhaps my noble friend the minister can explain why there is only a per cent <e> <s> grant for local authorities in national parks as against a per cent <e> <s> grant for land which afterwards will be of some use <e>", "<cs> my lords i was lucky enough to be able to visit china in march and i felt it would be appropriate to say a few words about my experience there <e> <s> we encountered great friendliness from those we met and most of the population seemed by nature to be happy and smiling <e> <s> we were generously looked after and were shown every consideration and friendship <e> <s> but when one sees the low standard of living at all levels that inevitably goes with communism one wonders what on earth makes left-wing socialists in the west aspire to reduce their own countries to such poor standards <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say whether it is true that under the convention a situation could arise with regard to profits on mining of the seabed in which some of those profits could be allocated to such people as the ira and so on <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend able to say whether the government agree with the estimate that the world will be in a position of per cent <e> <s> overall shortage of timber by the year <e> <s> if so and if therefore it is necessary as it is to plant now is this not a great opportunity to create jobs in the labour-intensive activity of planting <e>", "<cs> my lords has my noble friend noticed that there is just as much conservationist concern directed against cutting down trees as there is directed against planting them in other places <e> <s> is it not essential that trees should be cut down when they are due to be cut down planted when they are due to be planted and that the matter should be managed on a proper rotation regardless of conservation <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend give any idea of the relative sources of information technology hardware british made as opposed to perhaps japanese and foreign made <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend give the date of the circular he mentioned <e> <s> is he aware <e>", "<cs> my lords is he aware that there are still district councils which would rather see buildings fall down than that they should be converted into useful workshops or accommodation <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say whether this raid took place just for fun or to wipe out terrorists <e> <s> if the latter can he say whether we are also condemning the presence of terrorists on the other side of the border <e>", "<cs> my lords could my noble friend say whether the increase in staff is all at the recruit grade or whether some of it is due to the recall of senior officers who had left the force in earlier years because of poor pay <e> <s> if the former could my noble friend say whether the police force is becoming bottom heavy with recruits without sufficient people in the senior ranks <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend agree that during the last years there have been very considerable relaxations not only in sport of the restrictive laws of south africa and that if we continue not to recognise that progress indeed just add further insults and demands it will become increasingly difficult for the south african government to persuade their electorate that any further relaxations are worth while carrying on with <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that answer <e> <s> it will impress the house that the expenditure has gone up by three times <e> <s> can he say whether we can now expect to see rapid progress in investment in such things as letter sorting equipment <e>",

government are satisfied that they have above all adequate supplies of ammunition which has not been mentioned rather than items which will sustain us for a long war that is unlikely to happen anyway

account rather than cash <e> <s> while my noble friend lady platt talked about bulk-buying and while she was correct in what she said many people live on a knife edge and are not capable of buying forward <e> <s> many people live a long way from banks in the depths of scotland for example and there are the elderly who cannot get out to visit the bank <e> <s> they present not necessarily insuperable problems but problems which must be considered <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that these figures represent a differential of approximately times by way of spending money <e> <s> does my noble friend find it interesting that after years of socialism in the egalitarian state of russia the differential is approximately if one excludes conscript soldiers where the differential is and that in the egalitarian state of china where there are millions of unemployed the differential is infinity because there is no unemployment pay at all <e>", "<cs> i feel concerned with regard to the justice of this provision <e> <s> i wonder whether my noble friend could at this stage give some reassurance with regard to values from the point of view of the head lessor of the ground lease <e> <s> the ground lessor originally let the land to the person who built the lessee at a low rate because he would have his value back at the end of years or whatever <e> <s> having entered into a perfectly reasonable agreement from all sides then halfway through this period just like in the leasehold reform act the government say you have given this land cheap but we are now going to remove it from you with inadequate value <e> <s> if this is to happen i am not happy that the original lessor will get his proper value for the land <e>", "<cs> i should like briefly to add my support and ask one question relating to the quality of repairs <e> <s> is it not possible for a tenant to make a repair which is totally unacceptable to the landlord <e> <s> in such circumstances to what extent would he then be able to claim back unwarranted repair costs <e>", "<cs> my lords i must first apologise because i have a duty in the north tomorrow morning <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that answer <e> <s> would he agree that if the japanese carbon fibre is used for the production of the demonstrator it will be extremely unlikely that it will be possible for the british carbon fibre to be used in the production line <e> <s> this is a material which has such a great future and it is one in respect of which we held the lead years ago <e> <s> that whole lead will disappear and will be transferred to the orient <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend express the concern of the house to british aerospace over this matter particularly as the united kingdom manufacturers say that they can meet all the specifications that are required and can match the particular fineness i think it is that the japanese can achieve <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to speak very briefly in support of this bill <e> <s> it has the desirable object of allowing occupiers to know better where they stand on this whole matter <e> <s> the object of clause is to help resolve some points of doubt <e> <s> but it does undoubtedly raise new ones <e> <s> i hope that light will be shed on the concept of danger <e> <s> for example is the occupier liable if he did not know of the danger <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the traffic using the m in the area of gatwick can the <e>", "<cs> my lords i must also declare an interest <e> <s> like the noble lord lord hylton i have taken land into partnership in recent years rather than letting it <e> <s> as most of us know the landlord-tenant system has stood the test of ages and has proved highly satisfactory <e> <s> the landlord has generally invested improved and repaired all for a very low return on capital and in exchange has had the privilege of ownership <e> <s> not always but certainly in the past years he has seen his capital appreciate in notional value <e> <s> meanwhile the tenant has paid a rent representing a fraction of the cost of servicing a mortgage for the purchase of his farm and been able to devote his funds to the production and earning capacity of his stock <e> <s> over the past years he has missed out on the notional capital appreciation of the land <e> <s> in previous ages he has avoided a reduction in his capital by falling land values <e> <s> the same could occur again <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> if he is correct on this matter could he tell us why he thinks so many people have entered into management arrangements in lieu of tenancies over the last four years <e>", "<cs> my lords the numbers of cases of personal violence and of robbery have doubled since <e> <s> since then those cases involving firearms have gone up by per cent <e> <s> annually and it is an interesting fact that of those firearms used no less than two-thirds were air guns <e> <s> the causes of violent crime are of course very varied and many of these have already been covered by a number of speakers <e> <s> obviously environment is the first one and high-rise flats with no play areas must surely account for a great deal of the crime in younger people <e> <s> they have nowhere to play and inevitably the only thing they can do is to cause damage and write graffiti in those buildings <e> <s> such buildings are the first step towards anti-social behaviour <e>", "<cs> no my lords and i would not like to think it went on for long but i think the idea of having a long prison sentence would be equally unpleasant <e>", "<cs> i should like briefly to support the amendment <e> <s> it is only fair that if we put in the scarcity we should also put in the surplus <e> <s> we must remember that as regards the farms which were let pre- we are talking about a period of perhaps years and during that years anything could happen <e> <s> indeed the one thing we can be quite sure of is that things will happen which we cannot now foresee

provided by the tenant could be disregarded in the case of a tenancy prior to for perhaps to years and i should have thought over three generations <e> <s> i should have thought it would be quite impossible to carry through an ignoring of the grant for that sort of period <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble friend and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that answer <e> <s> may i ask whether he agrees that in principle double white lines have made a great contribution to safety <e> <s> will he agree however that the system has proliferated and that the man with the paint brush has almost indiscriminately painted the roads to try and take away the decisions of the motorist <e> <s> does he agree that the system is therefore likely to come into disrepute <e> <s> has my noble friend noticed that there are many places where the dotted line indicates that one can overtake but where it would be quite dangerous to do so and vice versa places where one cannot overtake but where relative speeds indicate that it is safe to do so <e> <s> does my noble friend not agree that the system should be confined to particular areas perhaps crests and dangerous corners so that the effectiveness of it is not cheapened by overuse <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend not agree that there are not only the double solid lines the solid lines dotted on one side or the other and the solid lines hatched with dotted lines but also single dotted lines single intermittent lines long intermittent lines solid lines that go down the side and so on <e> <s> does he not think that it has become rather a dogs breakfast <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that encouraging answer <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that due to the inadequacy of the proxy system a very small proportion of those people serving abroad in fact voted <e> <s> i hope that he will continue to put forward the idea of postal votes for them <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the house whether this is a time to make speeches or whether it is customary purely to ask questions <e>", "<cs> my lords can by noble friend say whether there is any effect when men are drinking when in his own words their wives are contemplating pregnancy <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble minister accept that the number of people leaving school who still cannot read or write is not quite so funny as the minister perhaps suggests <e>", "<cs> i should like very briefly to support the amendment <e> <s> there are many farmers who breed poultry for the christmas trade and then have to slaughter it themselves <e> <s> while there is every support for ensuring that the method of slaughter is controlled and that the right method is used the bill allows for extra people to go in to do the job at such times as christmas <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say whether the fines are being paid or whether they are being ignored <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the statement in general but does my noble friend agree that not one of these freeports is on the east coast and that in particular not one is on the north-east coast where there is much unemployment <e> <s> can my noble friend say whether that is because there were no applications <e> <s> does it not counter the ministers desire to have reasonably distributed freeports throughout the country <e> <s> can the opportunity be given in the reasonably near future to have this point about the east coast considered <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> the present situation is a farce <e> <s> you let a field for days and you make certain that the tenant gets out the sheep <e> <s> then you go along on nd january and say you can put them in again <e> <s> he knows and you know that you are going to do it and it goes on year after year <e> <s> but one mistake about even a week has been held to be good enough to create a tenancy <e> <s> as this situation goes on now it would be sensible to make it possible for land to be let on the understanding that notice can be given at any time <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i might say a few words before the noble baroness speaks <e> <s> i grow corn and it is grown very close to the hills and i am lucky because the hillmen descend on me and remove all the straw and take it back up to the hills where they do not grow corn <e> <s> i am also near to ici and it is quite possible that when ici get a plant they are quite capable of getting one they have the technology they could take that straw because again the farms near me are within reach <e> <s> but one has to think of the farmers who are neither close to a big plant nor to the hills and who therefore have a much greater problem than the people who can get rid of their straw <e>", "<cs> my lords is it to be the county councils or the district councils <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend take into account the improvement in health which came along with free school meals and will he inquire as to the number of children who are sent to school after a totally inadequate breakfast which i believe is quite a large number <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend look into the question of what other governments have discrimination and in particular for example the discrimination against the untouchables in india and if so what justification there is for having one policy against one country with discrimination and a different policy for another country with another discrimination against different people <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say whether this increased value of the land reflects some existing or adjacent infrastructure such as tarmac and drainage and so on <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the consideration given by farmers and landowners over hundreds of years to the conservation and appearance of the countryside and to the build-up of the countryside that we now like so much will my noble friend do his best to kill the knocking of farmers and landowners by often ill-informed self-appointed towny conservationists <e>", "<cs> there was a very serious accident near perth where as i understand it the stubble itself was so dry that it exploded and in one moment the fire ran through the stubble fairly short stubble very much faster than one could run to put it out <e> <s> i have never seen it myself but i understand that it can explode in very dry conditions <e>", "<cs> can the noble lord the minister say whether these by-laws are now a matter of fact <e> <s> if so why have they not come before the house for consideration <e> <s> because i think they are totally <e>", "<cs> i should like to take up some points made by the noble lord lord alport <e> <s> he made the point that a form should be filled in giving details of all the fields which the farmer intends to burn over the period <e> <s> of course during this governments term of office the minister has done his best and very effectively to reduce the number of forms that everyone has to fill in and here is one that has been introduced <e> <s> as we know farmers plough up fields which were previously down to grass <e> <s> therefore assuming that a farmer practises some form of arable crop rotation having filled in one form he will have to fill a new form in every year <e>", "<cs> i appreciate that <e> <s> the point i am making is that under that particular form he would have to restrict his arable land to that land that he put in on the form <e> <s> much of it might be grass in one year and then become arable in subsequent years <e> <s> then there is the question of the council permits <e> <s> councils vary enormously <e> <s> many councils have a number of agriculturally orientated councillors who know what they are doing <e> <s> but now with the larger districts many agricultural districts are covered by totally town councils who have not the faintest idea and want to know less about what agriculture does and in some cases have an actual antipathy towards agriculture <e>", "<cs> perhaps that serves the case <e> <s> then we come to the by-laws which are the most absurd by-laws i have ever read <e> <s> every paragraph is nonsense <e> <s> according to the nfu brief that i have while they have agreed to the matter of having by-laws there is no mention of them having agreed in any way to any particular by-laws and i cannot believe that they would agree to one single paragraph that has been written <e> <s> finally the noble lord lord alport mentioned that the farmers interests would be represented on the local authority <e> <s> would he be kind enough to tell me on what assembly within local government the farmers are represented alongside the district councillors <e>", "<cs> here again we have the position of a district which may well be an urban district knowing very little of farming and it is in a very different situation from the countryside district where farming is part and parcel of its general work <e> <s> i should like to support this amendment because i think we may get a lot of problems in the urban districts where people do not know what they are talking about <e>", "<cs> the problem here is that a farmer would almost certainly undertake burning and as far as he could obey the regulations or the by-laws which are drawn up so absurdly that they would not do much good anyhow <e> <s> so it could well be that even in obeying those by-laws he might have an accident or something might go wrong <e> <s> in

thought you could only be punished once for an offence not twice <e> <s> if having been fined he then gets his licence withdrawn not only is he punished twice but the following year he cannot take

unrepresented in parliament and that this is a gross injustice to all those who have voted for him <e>", "<cs> my lords is not criticism rather rich from a party which has nailed its colours to the mast of mr scargill whose object is to create unemployment for political purposes <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say whether or not productivity has risen during that period <e> <s> secondly what is the position as regards vacancies <e>", "<cs> my lords when the report is published can my noble friend also publish alongside it an estimate of the casualties of a non-nuclear attack thinking back in terms of coventry hamburg and places like that <e>", "<cs> my lords after that rather unpleasant and unnecessary personal attack on the minister i feel perhaps i might be right to defend myself for a start by saying that i was a county councillor for years <e> <s> there can be no disagreement <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think there will be any disagreement about the importance of local government spending to the economy <e> <s> the public expenditure white paper made clear that present capital and current expenditure of all local authorities was no less than billion a quarter of all public expenditure and per cent <e> <s> of the gross domestic product <e> <s> no government can ignore that sort of expenditure and both labour and conservative governments have always kept and must keep control of local authority spending <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i am unaware <e> <s> as i understand it the secretary of state has no funds to do that <e> <s> the government have been singularly ineffective because one opens <e>", "<cs> my lords the assertion made by the noble baroness is grossly unfair <e> <s> i do not believe that i said anything of the sort or implied it <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend bear in mind that one of the first questions which foreign purchasers ask as regards arms is is this aircraft used by the british air force <e> <s> if the answer is no it will be almost impossible to think about sales <e>", "<cs> i rise briefly to support the amendment <e> <s> this seems to me to be a pointless clause in the bill which has been largely instigated as has already been said by party conference clamour <e> <s> furthermore it is no more than an academic exercise because after all the sentence cannot be altered <e> <s> when there is a different trial subsequently under the bill if it is passed as it is there will be very little likelihood of the accused giving evidence again and therefore it is almost inevitable that a different slant will be taken on the result <e> <s> apart from that i point out that no two judges at any time are likely to give exactly the same sentence <e> <s> therefore in my view all that will happen is that it will cast doubt on the legal system and on the justice of our courts which are probably in fact the fairest in the land <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware of the great deal of misleading propaganda which has been spread about in certain parts of the country against this bill <e> <s> can he say how much money any particular counties have spent in particular lancashire where rumour has it they have spent over <e> <s> can he say whether it is legal to spend ratepayers money on propaganda as opposed to information <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend the minister will be aware of statoils opinion that by the s there will not be enough oil and wet gas going through the pipelines from ekofisk alone <e> <s> perhaps i may quote <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that there is any argument about the enormous value to our currency of our airport system <e> <s> therefore it is of vital importance to maintain the commercial advantage which we possess and that advantage could be lost if the airports become unable to cope with the traffic increase <e> <s> there are foreign airports for example schiphol which are only too willing and anxious to take over our traffic <e> <s> it is prophesied that our traffic will double by the year and some estimates show that it will treble <e> <s> there is already overcrowding at some of our terminals and the airports should long ago have expanded along the lines of the plans that we are looking at now <e> <s> however we look back on wrangling since since when it has always been difficult to decide which airport should be developed next <e> <s> now there is an urgent demand for expansion within five years and it has been shown by the inspector that that demand can be met in that timescale only by developing stansted <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say whether this project involves the agile combat aircraft and if so whether it is the british agile combat aircraft or the french one <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend agree that salmon are no less important a part of wildlife to be protected than are seals and that it is just that seals can be easily seen and salmon cannot <e> <s> if we do not deal with the seals we shall have no salmon <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend will be aware how disappointed we are but will he answer three questions <e> <s> first will carbon fibre be used in the construction of this aircraft <e> <s> if so will it be british carbon fibre or japanese carbon fibre <e> <s> secondly can he give the house some idea of the difference in cost that lies between the firecracker and the aircraft chosen <e> <s> is it very vast <e> <s> he mentioned a sum of million below his estimates but what kind of figure are we talking about <e> <s> thirdly my noble friend mentioned that there would be a lot of exports of british-produced aircraft <e> <s> does he not think that aircraft will also be produced by the brazilians themselves and that they will have a very much better chance of selling theirs <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend agree that however much the chinese may wish to buy our goods and however much we may wish to sell them we cannot conclude a good agreement because they have so little currency <e> <s> would my noble friend agree therefore that it is just as important to make certain that they have an outlet for their goods in our country so that they can gain the currency to buy our own goods <e> <s> in particular would he encourage the chinese from an agricultural point of view to take a pavilion at the royal show so that their goods can be on show and can be sold <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no argument about the amount of aid and rescue that has been given by national international and private organisations <e> <s> so much of this has gone into ethiopia as we all know because we have seen the situation there on the television and so on <e> <s> but of course we know equally that there are many other areas no less in trouble quietly starving away and with less publicity <e> <s> all these areas not only need help but as has been said by others need in the future to have early warning of the impending tragedy so that there is time to act and action can be taken in time <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that it is necessary to go into the soviet capability because that is well enough known <e> <s> i do not think that it is necessary either to go into the nato lack because that is also well enough known <e> <s> the question is would chemical weapons be used in a war that we envisage <e> <s> with training for chemical warfare by the warsaw pact with the fact that it treats chemical warfare as conventional and with its stocks the ranges at which it can deliver such weapons and the modernisation of its chemicals there is no doubt in my mind that it would use such weapons as part of its enormous amount of offensive weaponry far greater than it needs for its defence <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that and we did not use nuclear weapons in all the affrays in which we have been involved but the situation was utterly different surely <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that the amount of money put into training is about as good a capital investment as could possibly be arranged in these times <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say when and why the teachers reduced their advantages resulting from the houghton award <e>", "<cs> my lords with particular regard to teesside can my noble friend say whether any reasonable requests for grant aid have been refused and what encouragement has been given for expansion at teesside <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say whether the government are prepared to give credit for all the many reforms that have already taken place and which are being planned particularly by the business sector in south africa in an almost impossible political situation <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend agree that the fundamental fallacy underlying the views of the party on the other side is that there is no difficulty in the government arranging as much employment as they wish and no difficulty in making as many goods as they wish but it is quite impossible to get those goods sold if they are not at the right price <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say whether any effort is being made to invite airship industries to partake in this relief <e> <s> i was in the sudan a few years ago and it was obvious that due to the lack of air strips fuel roads and so on that the airship was the implement for that area <e> <s> does the company have anything that would carry goods at this stage <e> <s> it would be an opportunity to enhance the british airship industry and an opportunity for it to provide something which would be most useful <e> <s> is it not true that with the ethiopian relief about half of the corn sent out was sold in order to meet the cost of transport <e> <s> that rather backs the point made from the other side of the house that this should not be allowed to happen in the sudan <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend do what he can to ensure that the competitive fares are particularly relevant to the northern airports so that they will gain and that more transport will be available from the northern airports to relieve those in the south-east <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the shortage of skilled labour which already exists and taking as an example that one company said that it could absorb every computer graduate who came from the universities will my noble friend try to get the message over to youngsters many of whom in certain places do not want to be trained because they believe <e>", "<cs> my lords i come from a place not far from a town where there is per cent <e> <s> unemployment throughout the town <e> <s> there is one particularly harrowing area of population with a housing estate where unemployment approaches per cent <e> <s> i do not believe that this sort of area is unique in the country when it comes to inner cities <e> <s> the social consequences of this sort of unemployment must be highlighted <e> <s> it obviously produces great boredom depression and inactivity among the people who live there <e> <s> it brings on despair and so little motivation that even the playing fields there are not used <e> <s> there is no chemist because the chemists shop gets vandalised <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to training schemes does my noble friend the minister not accept that there are a large number of young people who are not acceptable for training schemes by virtue of their poor performance or low ability <e> <s> will he consider setting up special training schemes to cater for those young people who are particularly difficult to fit in <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend agree that if there were to be a public inquiry into this matter it could drag on for years and years cost the country an enormous amount of money destroy a great many potential exports and do nothing but total harm <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that the kerbside cycleways which are increasingly in evidence in london streets are very much appreciated by london cyclists and will he do as much as he can to encourage the construction of more of them for safety <e>", "<cs> my lords when my noble friend speaks of a small amount of radioactive material still going into the thames can he say how it compares with the natural radioactivity that is already there <e>", "<cs> my lords in this industry year is it not most important to encourage heads of industry not only to be well-rewarded but also to show that they are well-rewarded in order to attract the best people to industry rather than into banks and financial services <e>", "<cs> as this is a moderately new innovation will the noble lord not now but at some stage look into the matter to see whether under english water boards legislation they have the powers to contain and to organise these cages <e>", "<cs> can my noble friend the minister say whether he would give the fishery board permission to blow up a hydro-electric dam <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say whether these facilities will be open to the residents and also to visitors <e>", "<cs> may i at this stage say first of all that i support the noble lord lord ross of marnock who has just spoken <e> <s> much of the poaching particularly in the outer hebrides is done by very seaworthy ships which sweep up large quantities of salmon in the night <e> <s> they may be the same ships which are used to go inland and shoot deer at night and have them sold as well <e> <s> but having taken their salmon if northern ireland and the isle of man are open to them where england and perhaps scotland are not then it is a very short distance for them to go over there to sell their fish <e> <s> even if ireland and the isle of man are included in some way in this provision probably the scots would still go over and sell the fish <e> <s> i believe that it would be at least a deterrent because most people do not wish to break the law if they can avoid doing so <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that there are very many small young firms which are not prepared to contribute toward having these youngsters <e> <s> they would like to employ a youngster but are not prepared to contribute and are very half-hearted because they cannot afford the cost <e> <s> if for very small fledgling firms there could be some way round this problem more places would be available <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend the minister say how many african countries who have had democracy under their own rules have been able to maintain it more than once <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend agree that the revenues have been spent largely on the formation of foreign investment <e> <s> can he give an indication of by how much foreign investment has gone up in the last period during the present government <e>", "<cs> i believe that there is considerable concern by the voluntary sector over this bill and it has already been shown <e> <s> i hope that the government will make a great effort to reassure those organisations and to show that they will not in fact suffer <e> <s> there is also great concern shown by the councils and we have all had a mass of papers in this respect <e> <s> it has been suggested that there will be no less than a paralysed silence from councils in case they are sued by any one ratepayer of either party <e> <s> it is necessary for the government to give reassurance on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the fact that for every extra spent by everybody in the country per week on british goods rather than foreign goods people are put into work will my noble friend take steps to encourage the further purchase of british rather than foreign goods <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend sits down if this measure becomes an act will it cease to be legal for a household with perhaps just one or two staff to advertise for a girl or a man to do whatever job it might be <e> <s> i believe that one can do that at the moment with a small staff <e> <s> that presumably will become illegal <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that the whole point of establishing the forestry commission was to redress the situation whereby over per cent of the timber used in this country came from abroad <e> <s> in fact it still does so <e> <s> does my noble friend agree that as that is the whole object of the forestry commission provided the trees are grown it makes no odds whatever who owns them <e> <s> further-more bearing in mind the slow rate of return the fewer owned by the government rather than by the private sector the better because it is a bad investment financially but it is good investment for the timber <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not important that the company should be part of a large group with large capital available and with a large sales organisation <e> <s> is not the question of who owns the shares a red herring because what does it matter <e> <s> what is important is that the capital and so on should exist and that the jobs should be maintained <e> <s> it really does not make a haporth of difference whether the shares are owned in britain or anywhere else <e>", "<cs> in view of the almost unanimous opinion in the committee i hope that the noble baroness will take this back and reconsider it or <e>", "<cs> my lords we must remember that this great crime wave about which we are so worried is worldwide <e> <s> it has occurred in third world countries and in communist countries <e> <s> it happens in all political systems and so we must not think that we are alone in this situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry i missed what the noble earl said <e> <s> did it relate to a change of sex <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not quite see the relevance <e> <s> if therefore some of these people want to change are they able to do so <e> <s> i would ask your lordships whether we are able to change ourselves <e> <s> some of us do not regard ourselves as perfect <e> <s> we know our faults and we should like to change <e> <s> is that possible <e> <s> how many people can stop smoking <e> <s> some can but many of us here probably have not the willpower to do so <e> <s> if it is difficult for us to overcome faults that we know we have how can we expect some criminal quite likely of lesser intellect to overcome his natural instincts <e>", "<cs> my lords i also should like to thank the noble lord lord taylor for instituting this debate which is certainly worth having <e> <s> i must also declare an interest as i am a forester and i let land to the forestry commission <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that the comparatively high wages that it has been necessary in the past to pay apprentices have been one reason why firms have been loath to take on youngsters for training <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend not agree that so long as the rise in wages exceeds the rise in inflation this will make the situation much worse <e> <s> what extra will be done to try to keep wages in proportion <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to all the noble lords who have supported this bill <e> <s> they have all regretted the loss of clause <e> <s> environmentalists may well contemplate on the lack of support that they have had from people from all parties and feel if they continue their opposition and do not ask to have the clause reinstated that they may stay for a long time without support <e> <s> i hope that voluntary bodies who read this debate may wish to think again and ask to have it put back <e>", "<cs> my lords that may be true but there is also the fact that if it is amenity timber it is quite likely to be over the size of eight centimetres <e> <s> but i should like to follow that point up <e> <s> i thank my noble friend the minister for welcoming the bill and other noble lords for making valuable contributions <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> have the government any plans to aid the recovery of the national beehive <e> <s> secondly is it their intention to relax or to maintain the rules relating to the import of queens and bees <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that in we exported million worth of honey compared with importing million worth <e> <s> would he consider encouraging greater production after the recovery of the stock and perhaps ask his noble friend the secretary of state for employment whether he would get the msc to teach youngsters how to keep bees and help them to set up their own small industries <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i can understand the concern of the noble lord lord kilbracken to ensure that an owner or tenant who has been found guilty of an illegal felling and who is served with a restocking notice should be bound to maintain the trees for at least years <e> <s> it is important to recognise however that someone who is having to replant after an illegal felling is in exactly the same position as someone having to replant as a condition of a legitimate licensed felling <e>", "<cs> i should like to congratulate my noble friend lord dulverton upon the succinct and persuasive manner in which he has presented the case for the reintroduction of the clause which was removed from the bill in another place <e> <s> the noble lords lord taylor of gryfe and lord john-mackie also spoke to good effect on this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords in regard to unemployment in the north-east which is very large <e>", "<cs> my lords if it was considered so desirable that we should stop the clock in the milleniums with history at this particular moment when we have so many hedgerows which we so much love and want to maintain can my noble friend say why there is no pressure to plant hedgerows on all the downs <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to hear that cleveland has been included for an urban development corporation because we have no less than per cent <e> <s> unemployment throughout the county and up to per cent <e> <s> unemployment in some quite sizeable areas so we really need help <e> <s> can my noble friend say whether this is for middlesbrough or for hartlepool <e> <s> they are two different factors and i believe that hartlepool is probably the place where it needs to be <e> <s> secondly i should like to support what the noble baroness opposite said <e> <s> surely the minister will take into account the contribution of the local authority and their involvement <e> <s> having said that i am sure that the lesson has been learned with the london scheme <e> <s> the commercial interest must be in charge and unfortunately must have predominance over the elected council <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say how things are going

would my friend agree that the south africans are fed up <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that the south africans are fed up with trying to break down apartheid in small ways and never getting any credit and that if they were given credit when they did make progress they would be more inclined politically to go still further <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say whether there is any danger of infection via insects such as mosquitoes <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend also bear in mind that the technology of the british system is up-to-date at this moment whereas the awacs system is some nine years out of date <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend agree that there is a lot of evidence that the south african government would like to have dismantled apartheid more quickly than they are doing but that they are held up by their electorate who are insisting that apartheid remains <e> <s> therefore is it not important to play to the electorate as much as it is to play to the government <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say whether it is true that it is very difficult to find people to volunteer to teach in inner-city schools and that therefore many inner-city schools have to put up with less good teachers than they would like <e> <s> is this not similar to the excellent case made by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords about years ago on a nice

survey of properties in the inner city per cent <e> <s> were found to be in a state of substantial disrepair and per cent <e> <s> had defects in their main fabric <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree that most of the work of the development commission goes into the provision of new factories and workshops in the wealth-producing sector and that this is of great benefit to the local economy <e> <s> would the minister therefore agree that further finance for the development commission would be likely to be well spent in job production <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say

lord will explain the significance of the words <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend assure me that the same standards which are used in criticism of human rights and legal legitimacy in south africa are applied to other countries around the world which have the same problems and which are equally worthy of such criticism <e>", "<cs> my lords with reference to the channel tunnel-related

noble friend aware that while some of us may sometimes be tempted to think there are too many lawyers in practice there is an extreme shortage <e> <s> it is extremely difficult for legal firms to find young lawyers <e> <s> one of the reasons is that a great number of youngsters on coming out of law school do not practise but instead go off into industry and so on <e> <s> is there anything the government can do either to encourage people or to restrict law school to those who are prepared to practise afterwards <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that i am much more alarmed at the prospect of inefficient russian nuclear stations such as chernobyl going off again and about the mad sputnik with a nuclear engine which is going around and which could end up anywhere than i am about weapons under american control in this country <e>", "<cs> i also support the amendment <e> <s> i was glad to be able to meet yesterday with some of the youngsters we are discussing <e> <s> i was interested to learn that one of the disabled people needed two volunteers to look after her at all times <e> <s> the youngsters are dedicated and have service to the community at heart <e>", "<cs> it is not a question of the charity now paying rates when it had not done so before but more a matter of timing <e> <s> these community charges will be recoverable <e> <s> it is more a question of timing than whether they are out of pocket at the end of the day <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the new grant scheme whereby the grant is only paid over the first five or six years for maintenance will make people plant varieties which do not need subsequent maintenance namely the sitka spruce the one variety which causes the most antagonism with the public <e> <s> that will achieve the exact opposite of what the government want <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment <e> <s> i should particularly like to support the words of the noble lord lord mason about the national rod licence <e> <s> for people to pay for two licences to fish on two rivers not very far apart is absurd <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that cyclists are killed a year <e> <s> only yesterday i passed the police removing a bicycle from the crossroads at sloane square <e> <s> in view of the contribution that cyclists make to road safety it is a very good sign that measures are being taken to promote cycling <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that there is a pothole just outside the peers entrance <e>", "<cs> my lords where slavery is proved and where governments are not taking action against it does the minister advocate collective international pressure against such countries <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend sure that we use the word enemy <e> <s> is it used by the government as opposed to its use within nato and on exercises <e> <s> is it not a fact that in the last exercise the enemy came from the west <e>", "<cs> is it not a fact that the only ones that have been used have not been held on certificates <e> <s> therefore it is only a matter of law enforcement <e>", "<cs> these weapons are allowed in museums but not in private hands <e> <s> are they allowed in a private museum <e> <s> for example many houses have areas which are effectively museum rooms <e> <s> would they he allowed there <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment because there has been a great deal of trouble from air weapons for a number of years <e> <s> they are lethal <e> <s> there are almost too many uncontrolled air weapons at the moment <e> <s> anything that can be done to control them a little is welcome <e>", "<cs> is not the obvious answer this <e> <s> enormous effort is being made in the falkland islands to develop machines whether x-ray or whatever to detect the presence of plastic mines <e> <s> if that is effectively achieved then presumably the same apparatus would detect the plastic guns about which we talked earlier <e> <s> if it then became possible to detect plastic guns then all the previous arguments would no longer be valid <e>", "<cs> in following that up what about owners of knives pickaxe handles or anything else <e> <s> all such items are thoroughly lethal weapons <e> <s> logic would suggest that the owners should also sign an undertaking <e>", "<cs> i should like to dispute the point that has just been made <e> <s> i believe that it is possible to recock the guns again against a table simply by using force <e>", "<cs> if a chief constable reads the clause as entitlement to limit and informs someone accordingly it is highly unlikely that that person will feel confident to challenge the police on a matter of law <e> <s> he will accept that the police must know the law <e> <s> therefore it is necessary to spell out that there is no limit <e>", "<cs> surely with the firearms certificate any use is allowed <e> <s> it is only weapons such as pistols with a special limit attached that are restricted to use for certain purposes <e> <s> i believe that my noble friend the minister was right when he said that effectively somebody could obtain a gun in the belief that he wanted it only for one purpose <e> <s> it would never occur to him that he would want it for anything else until somebody suggests that he should go to a pigeon shoot and he agrees but finds that he does not have permission to do so <e> <s> i think it is a crazy idea <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the sentiment behind both amendments very strongly <e> <s> i first came across this problem when i was interested in air guns <e> <s> it was quite obvious that air guns were being sent by mail order to people who were not of an age to receive them and there was no control because the guns were going through the post <e> <s> one can imagine stolen certificates and all sorts of things going through the post on a mail order basis <e> <s> there is a great opportunity for fraud and the obtaining of a gun by someone who is not allowed one

a recent case that to lock ones gun in the boot of a car is not a defence <e>", "<cs> this is one of the most commonsense amendments that we have yet seen <e> <s> it would be absurd to have to apply to more than one chief constable perhaps to several three or four for one visit <e>", "<cs> i am very disappointed <e> <s> there have been statements from previous ministers advocating what is now proposed <e> <s> even with the renewal for the gun the amount involved every three years will he and there will be delay in acquiring the licence <e> <s> because of that one incident relating to a firearm held incorrectly which was the result of poor supervision by the police a great deal of damage will be done to all those who genuinely have guns and look after them properly <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister encourage the planting of shrubs between motorway carriageways to deflect the lights of oncoming traffic <e>", "<cs> my lords does not my noble friend believe that many people would much prefer to travel by night to a provincial airport where they would be very welcome rather than spend three or four days lying on a sofa at gatwick airport <e> <s> perhaps he would therefore encourage the use of provincial airports <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the small amount of pollution by nuclear power stations compared with coal stations can the minister say to what extent nirex

government any plans for recommending a restriction on sporting links and such matters <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the fact that air space is in the long term finite no matter what improvements are made will her majestys government accept that there will be a long-term need for alternative travel on internal short-haul aircraft <e> <s> further are the government giving consideration to the eventual need for such surface transport as monorails and suchlike <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the inevitable shortage of skilled youngsters in the next few years will my noble friend consider

noble friend made light of the number of fins there may be on a fish <e> <s> but can he assure the house that there is no health hazard to people who eat fish caught in polluted waters <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the very heavy cost of maintenance of heather moorlands in the north of england does the minister agree that it is absolutely vital that the forces for access should not drive out the forces prepared to spend the money to put moorlands in a condition in which people wish to go to see them <e>", "<cs> my lords the end of apartheid is an almost universal goal but i should like to discuss whether sanctions and disinvestment are likely to bring that about and what they will achieve if they are successful <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend not believe that everything should be done to discourage year-olds from going off to live by themselves <e> <s> where there are valid reasons for them to do so does he agree that the government should not fear to use coercion to

matches will not know whether a particular ground has made such a provision or whether it has decided not to <e> <s> if it turns out that he has gone to a ground that has not made the provision under subsection merely attempting to get into the ground would render that person liable to an offence <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether my noble friend can enlighten me about one matter <e> <s> now that subsection c has been included with subsection as being an obligatory provision does that not cover all the cases about which we are talking <e> <s> surely that means that the provision must be made for anybody such as the disabled by the football club <e> <s> is it not a waste of time going through all these individual cases <e>", "<cs> what has this got to do with families <e> <s> are we not

proposals would fix the level of the river at meters above ordnance datum <e> <s> thus a tidal river would become non-tidal <e>", "<cs> my lords is there not a great deal of misunderstanding about low level <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that not only has the new regime damaged or is about to damage the planting programme but worse still when it starts to bite it will seriously damage the management of existing timber <e> <s> that will tend to create forestry which is massive unmanaged and unattractive as opposed to the production of high forest which is good for

town that is he is within a country area it is almost impossible for the computer to find the number <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that that implied request for sanctions leading to unemployment and poverty of the blacks would be against the wishes of the majority of the blacks in south africa and namibia and would be counter-productive to the ideal of creating black empowerment

that to the best of my knowledge the moorlands association agrees that there should be a certain number of miles of footpath per thousand hectares of moorland and that that would be the ideal and satisfactory solution for all those including myself who enjoy walking <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that demand for access is not from walkers <e> <s> they want only footpaths <e> <s> the demand is purely for political reasons <e> <s> is he further aware that full access by people in pressurised areas would greatly damage the wildlife and would be contrary to the rules laid down by

solely a matter of jobs but of motivating people who have had a tradition of not working for several years and who therefore experience difficulty getting started in work <e>", "<cs> my lords is my

recent north yorkshire moors plan it was discovered that no less than per cent of walkers actually wish to walk on footpaths only <e> <s> in view of the fact that every sport has to limit its activities and not interfere with other peoples interests does my noble friend not agree that it is selfish of many of the walking interests to insist on per cent access regardless of the detrimental
