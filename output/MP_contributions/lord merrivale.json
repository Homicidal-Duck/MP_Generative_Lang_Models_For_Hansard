increase in the french short-wave broadcasts to west africa for the reasons given in the question <e> <s> may i ask whether he does not feel that in the context of the economic community of the west african states ecowas more should be done towards getting a better understanding and better relations between francophone and anglophone africa <e> <s> furthermore on the question of the development of that area on a regional basis and bearing in mind the cultural aspects have not the bbc a very important role to play in bringing together the anglophone and francophone countries and helping them to co-operate to a greater extent <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask one further question of my noble friend <e> <s> he said that the external services were very satisfactory <e> <s> they are indeed but they do need extending <e> <s> as mr nicholas ridley the minister of state said in another place on th november at col of the <e>", "<cs> my lords may i support the plea made by my noble friend lord alport as i was in pakistan in september and with my wife visited warsak refugee camp close to peshawar <e> <s> may i ask my noble friend whether it would be possible for someone from our embassy to see for himself the conditions there which might also incite her majestys government to be more generous than they may already be prepared to be <e> <s> also is my noble friend aware of what mr azmat hassan said at the united nations in november this year to the effect that the provision of food to these refugees had proved a burden on pakistans severely limited resources <e> <s> may i further add that there are now over refugees from afghanistan <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of what i think is recognised as a definite change of attitude on the part of president skou tour and the fact too that in effect he now has friendly relations with neighbouring states would the minister he willing to look into the question of the opening of a mini-mission in conakry bearing in mind that at the moment our ambassador in senegal covers six countries and also bearing in mind the potential for the future of guinea <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend the minister for his detailed answer <e> <s> would he not agree that if the cdc are overcautious it could be counter-productive <e> <s> also would he not agree that senegal is very keen on closer links with this country and not just on getting aid but on trade links between dakar and london <e>", "<cs> my lords i was under the impression that the ministers approval had been given but as my noble friend has said that the minister has not given approval can my noble friend use his best influence with the minister under the commonwealth development corporation act section to ask the minister whether he will be kind enough to look into this and give his approval in the not too distant future <e>", "<cs> my lords although i agree wholeheartedly with everything that has been said regarding the bravery fortitude and patience of the police and the courage and skill of the sas i should like to ask two practical questions of my noble friend <e> <s> first is he aware that a very large area indeed has been cordoned-off with a certain amount of inconvenience to the residents <e> <s> secondly there is a fair amount of traffic chaos in cromwell road and brompton road can he say when in effect this position will be eased <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper

favourable terms to business people here who trade with that country <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank my

licensing authority was filed by laker on rd june last and that it was sup-ported by the hong kong government <e> <s> if it was supported by the hong kong government will my noble friend say whether her majestys government have given to the hong kong air transport licensing authority via the hong kong government any economic information which will assist them to approve or disapprove the

october-november of the acquisition of three hawker siddeley aircraft by the malagasy government the fact that her majestys government placed those orders would in effect assist a sales campaign for

aircraft with maintenance being carried out in madagascar <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask my noble friend one further question although i do not wish to delay the house <e> <s> is it not a fact that a few years ago a british delegation sponsored by the odm went out and that one of the promises that this delegation made was that it would get in touch with the commonwealth development corporation with a view to involving the cdc in the agricultural field <e> <s> will my noble friend not agree that the agricultural field represents per cent <e> <s> of that countrys economy and

the french government will be kept <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the long list of speakers and despite my noble friend lord boyd-carpenters strong and eloquent plea for gibraltar i propose to

bearing in mind too the fact that the viability of commercialisation is still very much in the melting pot <e> <s> furthermore if i may refer to the figure of million may i ask my noble friend to bear in mind that at the time the gibraltar government asked for million over two years but received only million <e> <s> also would my noble friend agree that the delay in opening the frontier which was to have been done today means that there is an increased urgency for supplying the gibraltar government with funds as they require them and anyhow assistance on account of extra financial commitments

adjournment debate on st april in the canadian house of commons the question of the future of gibraltar within nato arose <e> <s> may i ask him therefore whether this question could be raised either bilaterally or with the allies by her majestys government as the canadian government felt it was not a matter for them <e>", "<cs> my lords i was very interested in what the noble lord lord underhill had to say but i wonder whether i may put a question to him before he sits down <e> <s> for the purposes of clarification will the noble lord say whether he is in favour of the introduction of wheel clamps and does he feel that these would in fact reduce congestion <e> <s> it seems to me that wheel clamps may reduce congestion if the vehicles are moved but it does not seem right because where

noble viscount for his answer <e> <s> may i ask him whether or not he agrees that many see the short-term outlook for gibraltar as very pessimistic while the long-term outlook is viewed by some with only qualified optimism <e> <s> could the minister therefore indicate to a greater extent than he has so far the amount of refit work which will be undertaken over a period of years if he could indicate the years it would be useful on royal fleet auxiliaries and on mine hunter refits <e> <s> could the minister also say whether from now on any work will be undertaken on leander class frigates

december regarding an oda funded consultancy which was to advise how home ownership can be encouraged in gibraltar <e> <s> can he say whether further defence land will be made available for the gibraltarian private sector <e>", "<cs> my lords without wishing to weary the house would my noble friend not consider that there is very little flat land available in gibraltar <e> <s> also would he not think that for there to be only per cent <e> <s> of properties in gibraltar which are owner-occupied is a very small proportion of the whole <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend tell us what

effect the question of viability has been confirmed <e> <s> if not will her majestys government be prepared to look closer at the idea of an extended interim period should it be viable before

seek the support of our european community partners to hasten the implementation of the removal of those measures which conflict with the obligations of community membership including obstacles to trade between spain and gibraltar <e>", "<cs> my lords following on what my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter has just asked will the minister agree that due to a partially opened border and a closing naval dockyard there has been a considerable decrease in passengers and freight between gibraltar and london and gibraltar and tangiers <e> <s> will she recognise the need for increased viability there and an improvement in the persistently stagnant tourist market <e> <s> a point which was stressed by my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter <e>", "<cs> my lords in pursuance of the answer he has
