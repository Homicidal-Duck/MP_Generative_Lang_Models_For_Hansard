["<cs> my lords a maiden speech is perhaps a suitable occasion in a debate as wide as this for a newcomer from another place to make his views about your lordships house clear <e> <s> i was very disappointed to be so unceremoniously and painfully dismissed from another place during the may election <e> <s> when it happens to one twice in years there is no greater test for a democrat <e> <s> nevertheless i was very pleased to come to your lordships house because i have always taken the view that it does a useful job and a very good job indeed as regards european legislation <e> <s> in time i hope to make a modest contribution to that work <e> <s> i have never wanted your lordships house to have more power than it has at present <e> <s> nor have i at any time wished it to make a real challenge to the elected house <e> <s> i do not do so now <e> <s> i do not wish it to be abolished nor do i wish it to be elected because i believe that inevitable conflict will arise between the two chambers <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister to remind the managing director of bbc radio that less than months ago he said that the very point of public service broadcasting and indeed its reason for survival was to nurture musicians <e> <s> would the noble lord not agree that if the bbc were to withdraw from this role it would be disastrous both for music and the nation <e>", "<cs> my lords i have been invited by the promoters of the bill to answer on their behalf and i speak as a member of one of the local authorities in kent in which all of the authorities have given a two-thirds majority in support of this bill <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord lord middleton for informing me of his intentions and i am happy to tell him that the point he made about trees that die will not be included in the bill the promoters are only too happy to exclude that situation <e> <s> the promoters are concerned with the protection of woodlands with preventing people felling trees in contravention of tree preservation orders and with accepting fines as a way of moving from woodland to farmland <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord lord dulverton for the opportunity which he has given us to discuss this important subject <e> <s> i should like to think too that the useful suggestion he made about a joint committee will be given serious consideration <e> <s> i should like also to congratulate the maiden speakers <e> <s> both of them made interesting and constructive contributions from great experience and both will enrich our debates by their membership of the house in the future <e> <s> i want to make a very short contribution my lords because unlike all those who have gone before and i believe a number to come i am not an expert in forestry but i believe that the reading report is a valuable contribution to understanding the problems of securing a satisfactory forestry policy <e> <s> it recognises that afforestation can be detrimental or beneficial depending upon the care taken in designing our new forests and my lords we must take that care <e> <s> this reconciliation of our industrial needs and the needs of the environment is all important and if i may say so not just in forestry <e> <s> but the fact that the reading report believes this reconciliation to be possible gives us a reassurance which opens the door to developing a policy which could be of the greatest benefit to us industrially <e>", "<cs> my lords whatever the differences may be between northern ireland and the rest of the united kingdom will the noble lord bear in mind that a dog warden scheme has the support of local authorities police farmers members in both houses of parliament and support from everyone who has looked at this problem <e> <s> as the noble earl lord listowel has said the report of the noble lord lord houghton indicated that the problem of stray dogs is widespread in the whole of the united kingdom <e> <s> will he seek early implementation of the scheme for the whole of the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that this has caused the greatest disappointment to the workers and company alike because of the failure to bring this project to a successful conclusion <e> <s> will he bear in mind that there is a contradiction in our closing one of the outlets for forest products when he as i know well is working very hard to bring about an effective forestry policy <e> <s> will he accept that the two go together that the paper industry and the pulp mill help the whole of the forestry policy by taking the thinning trees and thereby enabling greater profitability and more effective working of mature forests <e> <s> will he therefore keep this scheme in mind and under constant review <e>", "<cs> i hoped that the noble earl as i had the leave of the committee to discuss the second new clause might reply to the substance of the second new clause at the same time <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble earl for giving way <e> <s> he talks about the under-pricing of gas <e> <s> will he explain why if our gas is under-priced almost every other major country can receive it at a cheaper price than ours <e>", "<cs> i find a number of the statements made by the noble earl contentious but i do not want to detain the committee tonight <e> <s> i hope perhaps to return to these matters at a later stage of the bill and i ask leave to withdraw these amendments <e>", "<cs> i should like to support amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> after years experience in local government and still a member of a local authority and chairman of its finance committee i am firmly of the opinion that the outstanding need and the area of the greatest neglect is that of housing for old people <e> <s> many authorities under pressure from growing numbers of families needing housing after the war for nearly years pressed on with two-and three-bedroomed properties at the expense of homes for the elderly <e> <s> many elderly people remained in under-occupied properties private or council or lived with their families when they needed homes of their own <e> <s> this was because there was no suitable council accommodation and because private enterprise had not entered the field in any measure <e>", "<cs> my lords during the committee stage of this bill the matter of energy price disadvantages between the united kingdom and other countries was questioned by the noble earl lord gowrie and i promised to return to this at this stage of the bill <e> <s> i did so because i believe that there is an unwillingness on the part of the government to accept that energy prices generally and gas prices in particular in other countries are substantially lower than those in britain <e> <s> as i outlined to the house in my previous speech the price disadvantage to united kingdom industry particularly to the paper and board industry can be completely substantiated and in many cases the lower energy prices in other countries result entirely from a deliberate policy of subsidisation <e> <s> this is aimed at enabling these countries to compete more successfully in world markets <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl bear in mind that in the paper industry gas prices are already per cent <e> <s> of total costs <e> <s> if the forecast in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i like other noble lords would <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord recognise that sir john grugeon does not stand alone <e> <s> he stands with the leaders of every shire county in the country and many other senior members of local government <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord write to me with those names <e>", "<cs> this clause provides for the substitution of the requirement for quinquennial revaluations of the discretionary power to the secretary of state to decide when new valuations shall take place and when they shall come into effect <e> <s> rateable values provide the tax base for local government <e> <s> even with the statutory requirement for five-yearly revaluations only three revaluations have taken place since the war <e> <s> with the existing law however parliament has to agree every year if a revaluation is to be postponed <e> <s> if clause were enacted parliament would only hear of rating revaluations as and when the secretary of state saw fit to order a revaluation <e>", "<cs> i am sorry the noble lord is unable to accept the amendment <e> <s> he mentioned that the three valuations since the war had been under conservative governments and i <e>", "<cs> there are two related amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> i think you have had submitted to you a manuscript amendment on the same clause <e> <s> if you would be kind enough to call it i should be happy to discuss the three together <e>", "<cs> would it be appropriate and convenient if i discussed the three amendments together <e> <s> thank you very much <e> <s> i beg to move amendment no <e> <s> a <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl for his answer <e> <s> i think he will appreciate that these points are very complicated matters and we should like time to consider them between now and report stage <e> <s> in the meantime i am happy to beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the new clause seeks to remove the right of individual local authorities to levy empty property rate on business premises <e> <s> section of the act is capable of being used very sensitively and i know that this is not the view which the noble lord takes but it is true having regard to the economic and other conditions in their areas <e> <s> for example it means that empty property rate may be levied on properties within one or more geographical areas of a rating authority and applied only to properties of a type or size specified by the authority <e> <s> the act as it stands is better able to cope with varying conditions than this blanket amendment to remove all rights to levy empty property rates on business property <e> <s> in a buoyant economy the amendment would enable property owners to leave property empty while awaiting an increase in the rental value without any liability to pay rates <e> <s> in a depressed economy local authorities are as aware of the problems as anyone else <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl for his answer <e> <s> will he recall that he gave an undertaking to me that there would be a proper monitoring process <e> <s> may i ask him whether it is being undertaken and whether it has not been handed over to the cbi <e> <s> because that would perhaps be unwise and even unfair since it would still leave him in a position to question the facts as he has been doing in the past <e> <s> is the noble earl aware that not just the paper industry but or major manufacturing industries are now convinced that the high prices charged in this country for gas as against those charged in other countries are a serious impediment to the competitive position and in many cases represent the difference between profitability and non-profitability <e> <s> in view of the urgency of this matter can the noble earl tell me when this exercise will be complete <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl bear in mind that while this argument is going on a number of our industries are being very severely damaged and will he make sure that he comes to a policy decision very early in this matter <e>", "<cs> we in local government are fundamentally opposed to providing the secretary of state with penalty clauses in the shape of transitional clauses which would enable him to withhold supplementary grant from those local authorities judged to have marginally exceeded the rate which he believes is appropriate <e>", "<cs> i should like to try to put a damper on the vibrant enthusiasm of the minister for the scheme <e> <s> the local authority associations and the representatives who have been involved in this in the great detail have this to say <e>", "<cs> my lords as much of the outcome of this question depends on the governments forestry policy can the noble earl say how long it will be before a statement can be made <e>", "<cs> my lords nevertheless will the noble lord accept that in requiring the british gas corporation to bring the level of gas prices up to the price of oil the government are interfering in the conduct of a nationalised industry and would they cease to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord would be kind enough to bear with me a moment i should like to raise one point although i am not absolutely certain that it is exactly on this amendment <e> <s> there are large numbers of authorities who have contractual obligations in terms of capital projects at the moment and if the specification were to be withdrawn and the money which is available at the moment either in terms of capital receipts or in terms of balances were not available this would create a critical situation <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble lord can give me an assurance that as a transitional measure the minister will see those projects through to an end <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the minister for some further elucidation <e> <s> where there is a contractual arrangement where for example a building has been put out to contract in its entirely that is quite clear and i understand the point that has been made but if for example there is a management contract where there may be as part of the total project or contracts some not yet let but essential to the total construction of the building would his point cover that situation as well <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord bear in mind that these may be expensive buildings five six or seven-eighths completed but totally unable to be used and an expensive waste of money whichever way they are looked at <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that these increases have been greeted with incredulity by the industry <e> <s> the word incredulity is theirs not mine <e> <s> some of their other language is harsher <e> <s> is it not clear that despite continuous appeals to ministers the industry is again being sacrificed to its overseas competitors <e> <s> is the minister also aware that the largest increases have been in the areas of greatest difficulty and greatest sensitivity for example case liners and uncoated wood free paper <e> <s> is it not time therefore that our home industry was supported and not put under further grave disadvantage in relation to its overseas competitors <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord not aware that the demand for paper and pulp is at its lowest ebb since <e> <s> therefore it is the paper and board industry which needs the governments support <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has indicated that there is to be a redistribution between london and the provinces but the forecasts and leaks from the local government council indicate that there will be a massive redistribution between the counties and the districts <e> <s> this is going to be very serious indeed for the districts <e> <s> it is forecast i am talking in terms of to that some will lose anything between a p and a p rate <e> <s> can the noble lord say whether there will be any amelioration for the districts whether this will be spread and what is the minimum rate loss in any one year that the districts will suffer <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl for his answer which is very helpful so far as it goes <e> <s> however is he aware that it is seven months since the government started the monitoring process and we are really no nearer a conclusion of the matter that was raised then than we were seven months ago <e> <s> it has been a further seven months in which british industry has been severely affected by the high price of energy in relation to its competitors <e> <s> is he further aware that in respect of this argument there seems to be little difference between the government as expressed by the secretary of state in another place last week the cbi and the tuc that it is the big users of fuel particularly gas that are affected <e> <s> would he not therefore encourage the introduction of discounts for volume which are common in most other countries and help british industry to get back to profitability and to maintain high levels of employment <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to appear ungrateful to the noble earl because he put himself out to give a great deal of information but what is important is the conclusion of the monitoring process <e> <s> can he give any indication about when the task force will conclude its work and how quickly after that the government can come to a conclusion <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to deal with matters relating to competitiveness which are of the greatest importance and urgency for industry and i hope the house will forgive me if i concentrate on the energy problem <e> <s> in july last year on the gas <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that that is a very disappointing answer <e> <s> the budget itself was a bitter blow to industry <e> <s> having got the task force to confirm that the price of energy to large users in british industry was much higher than <e>", "<cs> my lords i want first of all to congratulate the noble lord lord plowden and the committee on their report and on the enormous amount of work that has gone into it <e> <s> i can do that with a good conscience because i am now a member of the committee but my first meeting was on the day that they approved the report so i am not congratulating myself <e> <s> i give my wholehearted support and congratulations to the committee on their report <e> <s> it is a valuable addition to the considerable number of reports now more than which the committee have produced since our entry into the community and which have become so influential in helping the development of european legislation and policy <e> <s> it will also be a very valuable contribution in the review that the commission have to make of the european regional fund which is due to be deposited some time this year <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly accept the difficulties of the problems that we are facing but i hope that now we have the support of my noble friend in seeking to extend by whatever degree the amount of monies available to the regional fund <e> <s> it is important that this should be done because the cap which many noble lords have said absorbs three-quarters of the total community budget has as suggested in the report the opposite effect to that of the regional fund in that it transfers income to areas which already have high agricultural incomes such as north germany and the paris basin <e>", "<cs> my lords in speaking in this debate i am happy to indicate an interest in the paper and board industry and it will be from the industrys point of view that i shall be speaking today <e> <s> last december the director general of the british paper and board industry federation mr john adams issued a statement on forestry policy in which he said that they welcomed the governments statement on forestry <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly do not wish to misrepresent the noble earl and if i am wrong i apologise but my recollection is still fairly clear <e> <s> among the nagging doubts expressed by the paper and board industry federation was as to the scale of operation envisaged by the governments determination to sell forestry commission land and any change that this would have on the future structure of the forestry commission <e> <s> as several noble lords have <e>", "<cs> my lords that is very generous of the noble earl <e> <s> i accept his apologies and if i misrepresented what he intended i also apologise <e>", "<cs> my lords we are discussing today what a former secretary of state mrs shirley williams has described as <e>", "<cs> my lords before leaving the question of overseas students i do not think that many of us said that there were no overseas students but the prediction about the fall in income is what we are really concerned with and its impact on university financing in <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble baroness would comment on that <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret that the bill has been introduced since it forces some of us to vote against it who are every bit as concerned with the protection of the environment as the noble lord <e> <s> i have spent years in local government and i am still the chairman of the finance committee of a borough a borough in which there has been more severe dereliction than in almost any other part of the country due to chalk extraction taking place over years <e> <s> as a member of a local authority i have also been involved in a number of recycling schemes <e> <s> so in opposing the bill i shall take second place to no one in my concern for the environment <e>", "<cs> i am bound to say my lords that there are several reports about oregon <e> <s> i would rather quote from the report that i am interested in than the one that seeks to present the case in the light of the attitude of the noble lord lord beaumont <e>", "<cs> my lords the report itself is indeterminate in that it seeks to prove no point other than to leave the matter open <e> <s> beverage cans constitute per cent <e> <s> of litter <e> <s> some reduction might be expected following deposit legislation but it is estimated that it would be small <e> <s> the keep britain tidy group does not follow this type of legislation but is pressing for the adoption of its clean community system which is based on washingtons litter control programme which has been shown to be very much more effective in reducing street and highway litter at far less cost to the consumer <e>", "<cs> i am sorry my lords i was i thought quoting from the glass manufacturers brief so we shall have to argue the issue on another occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether he accepts the fact that i qualified my statement by saying that there was no comparable situation in oregon to that in this country <e> <s> i would <e>", "<cs> these amendments bring together the interests of those aggrieved by the pets of irresponsible owners and those very responsible dog owners who want to keep their pets and to live at peace with their neighbours and therefore i believe they ought to have a wide appeal <e> <s> they are necessary because of the widespread nuisance caused by stray dogs of which the police dealt with last year alone a job they do not want and understandably for they can act as little other than dog catchers <e> <s> there is a much wider problem involved in the education of pet owners as well as in dealing with the results of the actions of irresponsible pet owners <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact is that such a scheme with the targets set on revenue and the restrictions on capital expenditure would not be within the capacity of a district the size of ours or indeed of any local authority at all <e> <s> if the noble lord says that if we put up a similar scheme next week he will approve it then i shall accept that we are being misled <e> <s> but everyone in local government knows that that is not possible <e> <s> the revenue expenditure will be set by target and is already being set by target <e> <s> also capital expenditure is limited to as a top figure without the permission of the minister <e> <s> so the effect will be to prevent people of ability from coming into local government and making the best of local government with local initiative responsible to a local democracy <e>", "<cs> my lords neither i nor the local authority associations have objected to a review of the sources of local government finance <e> <s> we have been saying for many years that it is an absolutely essential part of the re-organisation of local government <e> <s> but this has never been done <e> <s> most of the points which the noble lord has raised could be dealt with by a change in the way in which rates are <e>", "<cs> my lords i too would like to offer my appreciation to the noble lord lord kilmarnock for giving this opportunity to us to debate this very important subject today particularly at a time before the government have actually made up their mind an event which cannot be long delayed <e> <s> i also congratulate him on a very impressive speech <e> <s> i believe it has been a very successful debate and there has been support if qualified in most parts of the house for the youth task group report <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that welcome though the concessions are the paper industry and other high energy users are still having to pay more for their energy than industrialists in america and indeed in some parts of europe <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope your lordships will forgive me if i deal with only one subject and indeed one institution tonight <e> <s> it is a matter which concerns many of us and has an effect in respect of something about which the noble baroness the leader of the house talked to us this afternoon the quality of teaching and the opportunity for training in a particular establishment <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl give way <e> <s> he made an interesting comment in saying that the institution will not be destroyed <e> <s> i wonder whether he would enlarge on that because so far as i am concerned it will disappear altogether in the tradition of madame osterberg and physical education <e>", "<cs> my lords i am referring to physical education that is the point <e>", "<cs> my noble friend and i are very disappointed at the reply which has been given <e> <s> we certainly do not want to abrogate the responsibility of the minister in any way <e> <s> but we feel that this has a precedent in a measure enacted by this government in which specifically mentions in section <e>", "<cs> i should first declare an interest having an association with nalgo <e> <s> i wish to speak in support of amendment no <e> <s> which stripped of all legal verbiage requires the authorities to seek consultation in respect of the establishment and maintenance for the settling by negotiation of terms and conditions of employment with the provision for reference to arbitration in default <e> <s> in other words the amendment is designed to reinstate section and of the water act as the noble lord lord nugent inferred <e> <s> like him i too deplore the inconvenience which was caused to many people by the strike <e> <s> the difference between the noble lord lord nugent and myself is that i do not believe that his solution would provide a better state of affairs and it might lead to a worsening of the conditions not only in that industry but in other industries too <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble lord will understand if we find the answer to amendment no <e> <s> wholly unacceptable <e> <s> the other matters are as i think that he will agree matters of great complexity <e> <s> he would i am sure wish to allow us to have time to examine his reply in some detail and perhaps come back at another stage <e> <s> in view of that statement i beg leave to withdraw amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords in speaking to the instruction i want to say that i have lived with the problems related to the dartford tunnel for years <e> <s> in i joined the dartford borough council and with the exception of one year i have remained a member ever since and for the majority of that time i was the member for the constituency <e> <s> the first thing i did was to campaign with others for the first dartford tunnel <e> <s> i have increasingly been dismayed at the anomalous position that has been created and is to go on into the future <e> <s> when the minister of transport then mr ernest marbles announced the sanctioning of the tunnel he said that he was sorry it would be a toll tunnel but that in years it would be free as the tolls would go <e>", "<cs> my lords i have an interest to declare as i am associated with the paper and board industry and it will be about the problems of this industry that i shall be talking tonight <e> <s> but i ought to say that there are a number of other industries who share the same problems acutely <e> <s> i too would like to thank the noble lord lord kings norton for a very thorough and valuable report <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not particularly want to interrupt the flow of the noble earls speech but that is not the conclusion of the cbi report which says that with the currency changes since october we still have a differential against british industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to amend the lotteries and amusements act to abolish certain offences respecting foreign lotteries and for connected purposes <e> <s> i beg to move that the bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords as a vice-chairman of the national association may i ask the noble lord lord lyell whether he is aware that it has always been the determination of the association to ensure that their activities were entirely non-political <e> <s> therefore they will welcome an opportunity to examine the evidence that the minister has received <e> <s> may i also ask the noble lord whether he is aware that to give the grant for a six-monthly period will make the planning of the service and the effective use of money almost impossible <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> this bill is to correct an anomaly identified in paragraph of the final report of the royal commission on gambling cmnd <e> <s> in <e> <s> the anomaly is prejudicing the export of material by certain firms in our domestic printing industry which specialise in the production of tickets for lotteries conducted wholly abroad <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord and the government for their very sympathetic support for the bill <e> <s> i should be only too glad to entertain the amendments that are suggested <e> <s> i am afraid that i cannot make the same remark that the noble lord lord wigoder made earlier this afternoon in another second reading debate <e> <s> i cannot hope that the government might find time for the bill before the end of this parliament but i will certainly be back with it in the next parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to amend the lotteries and amusements act so as to abolish certain offences respecting foreign lotteries and for connected purposes <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> the house was good enough to give a second reading on th may to a similar bill which i introduced then <e> <s> but as with all uncompleted public bills including private members bills it died on the dissolution of that parliament <e> <s> the government in the form of the home office and the department of trade gave support to the bill then and the noble lord lord glenarthur was good enough to say that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord elton for his support of the bill and for the felicitous terms in which he has given that <e>", "<cs> my lords i find myself in some difficulty <e> <s> i was a member of the procedure committee that recommended to the house that the practice of every member congratulating a maiden <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e> <s> therefore unless any noble lord objects i beg to move that the order of commitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say when he expects that these changes mergers or not will be completed <e>", "<cs> like the noble viscount lord hanworth i feel tempted to make a second reading speech but i should declare an interest as a vice-president of the adc as a member of a local authority with years experience and as a member associated with nalgo which has control officers in membership and a large number of ancillary workers who all feel under threat <e>", "<cs> yes indeed vice-president of the adc the association of district councils <e> <s> i am glad to join with the noble lord in this as in many other enterprises <e> <s> the secretary of state for the environment mr heseltine at the beginning of this piece in talked about national standards nationally enforced <e> <s> everything the government have done since then has sought to fragment the service and in my view to disrupt a well-trained well-established and independent service to threaten standards and to weaken the protection for owner and public alike <e> <s> it will establish alongside the present local government system a class of inspector known as an approved inspector who can be chosen by the builder who as has already been said can shop around and find an accommodating inspector if he does not like the actions of his particular approved inspector <e> <s> there are none of the safeguards which apply in local government <e> <s> i should like to remind your lordships how strict they are <e> <s> every local government building control officer is subject to conditions that he must have no conflict of interest that he must have no pecuniary interest that he does not declare that he must not get involved in any kind of politics and all these are subject to disciplinary sanctions if he defaults in any way <e>", "<cs> if in the example that the noble lord has given the inspector virtually withdraws and the local authority is left with the job of controlling that development is it not left with an impossible task with no plans with no supervision of the early work of the foundations or of anything else <e> <s> then he has to deal with a situation which is quite intolerable and the local authority will have to do it with what could be in some respects an open-ended liability <e>", "<cs> what i am saying is that if in fact the inspector withdraws or has to withdraw in the circumstances that the noble lord indicates how is he to know whether the early certificate was a valid one in the sense that the work was carried out effectively <e> <s> they will have to proceed with the rest of the work without knowing about the foundations or other parts of the building and therefore could pile on to an original fault work that might then be at risk <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord allow me a few sentences before he replies <e> <s> he outlined a series of dramatic situations in which withdrawal might be appropriate the conflict then arises as to whether you get another inspector or go to a local authority <e> <s> but even if he ties up all these loopholes is he not aware that the pressure could be much more subtle <e> <s> an inspector completes one job but he is found to be too tough <e> <s> so there is no question <e>", "<cs> he will be too tough in terms of the builder which may be a different criterion from the one which the noble lord or i would apply <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord give way <e> <s> on a point that he is making is he aware that already the uncertainty of the last five years has inhibited recruitment to this profession in a way that has made control of building sites and property that much more difficult <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl bear in mind that certain industries such as the paper industry are already at a grave disadvantage <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord annan for giving us the opportunity to discuss this subject tonight <e> <s> first i want to say how sad it is that when we ought to be taking a dispassionate view of the future of higher and further education in this country most of those concerned are convinced that this is a cost-cutting exercise in which it would be difficult to avoid taking a short-term view rather than a long-term view and where instead of considering the nations need or the students need we are more concerned with finance <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to associate myself with the tributes paid to noble lords of both front benches for the way that they have conducted themselves in handling this bill <e> <s> i think it is important however that we take one last look at the bill a bill which has taken a great deal of parliamentary time and review what has happened in the five years which has been its gestation period <e> <s> the first thing that i should like to say with the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale is that this is really two bills and i think that it

motion on the order paper to call attention to the whole question of reclamation and recycling of waste material of every kind <e> <s> will the noble lord support this request and use his influence

speak <e> <s> since the government have introduced into the local government field draconian measures which have failed to achieve the objectives intended and which if introduced by labour would have shocked the conservatives and sent the noble lord lord bellwin to the barricades to defend local government against the measures that are doing us damage today and which indeed have separated him from almost every leading local government figure many of them his erstwhile colleagues <e> <s> but this bill adds a further dimension to those actions and it is also opposed by many conservatives <e>", "<cs> my lords by common consent the bill to abolish the metropolitan counties and the glc is the most important and indeed the most contentious measure that will come before this parliament <e> <s> for me with over years service in local government this is very sad because it indicates a failure on the part of the government to recognise the proper role of local government in this country <e>

europe and i have always believed that we have had perhaps the most effective system of local administration in the world <e> <s> it has been distressing to see the damage done to it during the last five years damage acknowledged by all the local authority associations most of them conservative controlled and by almost every leading conservative in local government <e> <s> i say this to demonstrate that this is not just a fantasy of opposition parties but a matter that must be taken very seriously by this house <e> <s> i would say that no local authority association or professional

expenditure a complete faith in the market economy and the conviction that tax cuts would stimulate the economy to a new and enduring prosperity <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have claimed repeatedly that we are in an international recession from which all are suffering <e> <s> while not wishing to minimise the importance of a low inflation rate or denying the fact of an international recession it is nevertheless true that although we concentrated exclusively on inflation both america and japan have done better with lower inflation rates and also with lower unemployment figures <e>

lords we have backed ourselves into a monetarist cul-de-sac with a government committed to leaving it all to the market but also with a belief that it is not possible for government to influence the

created by section was never invoked at all <e> <s> bearing in mind that the reorganisation of local government affected far more councils and employees than are affected by the current proposals to

achieving the governments objective <e> <s> i do not intend to press the amendment because i hope and the minister has fought the bill very hard all the way through that between now and third reading

ought not to have been under any misapprehension <e> <s> i thought i was entitled to withdraw the amendment and the wish that the government should think again is one that is or is not capable of

in mind that all the parties to this unhappy situation have a chance for a new start and that it would be very sad indeed if the government by failing to respond with some cash were to set back the

the outset <e> <s> can she assure the house that any appraisal system implemented will never be used as a smokescreen for surreptitiously introducing a merit pay award with the sole purpose of seeking out inefficient teachers and sacking them but rather for determining those people who need further training and giving them such training <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness bear in mind that

adjustments would be contrary to the spirit of the inf treaty <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord confirm that a decision has been taken to reduce the number of royal navy minesweepers in the gulf and to co-ordinate the operations of those that remain with the belgian and dutch ships <e> <s> following the call from the commander of the french naval forces in the gulf for his ships to protect merchant ships of all flags can her majestys government say whether any plans to change the rules of engagement have been issued to our forces in the area <e>", "<cs> a licence of p collected from only per cent <e> <s> of dog owners costing the treasury million to collect is clearly nonsense <e> <s> however as my noble friend lord houghton indicated in his report in on dog warden schemes an increased and properly managed licence could form the soundest way of ensuring a proper system for the control of dogs <e>", "<cs> i know that the noble lord lord stanley has in practice wound up the debate <e> <s> i want to confine my remarks to one or two comments because i do not wish to keep the committee away from dinner <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that we are very grateful to the noble earl for bringing the details of this horrendous case to the attention of the house and that we share his concern about the long delay <e> <s> is he also aware that the whole house would wish to see a satisfactory settlement to what has been a very sad and very long-lasting case <e>", "<cs> my lords are we not getting into an entirely untenable position <e> <s> if we can have discussions between america and the evil empire which result in an agreement why cannot we have discussions between the warsaw pact and nato <e>", "<cs> my lords in any of the hundred cases of alleged bullying intimidation or ill-treatment that have been investigated since can the minister say whether alcohol or drug abuse was in any sense judged to be a contributory factor <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the prime ministers disapproval of the recent bilateral agreement between france and germany will the noble lord say how the government justify prospective defence collaboration with a non-nato country and whether our nato allies have been consulted in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords in committee i referred to the position in northern ireland and to the contradictions that exist in government policy <e> <s> the government introduced there a dog licence of which today provides most of the money for dog warden schemes that are maintained in every district council in northern ireland <e> <s> in the rest of the united kingdom the dog licence has been abolished but as the noble lord lord stanley of alderley said nothing has been put in its place <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the statement made by the noble lord lord margadale in speaking to the previous amendment in which he suggested that this amendment is a far better one than that which the house in its wisdom has accepted i wish to make it clear that it is concerned only with stray dogs and solves none of the other problems which we have been talking about <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord kennet has said that the harmel exercise was a study undertaken as a result of the proposal of the belgian government and its prime minister mr harmel in <e> <s> it was a broad analysis of international developments since the signing of the north atlantic treaty in so as to determine the influence of such developments on the alliance and to identify the tasks which lay before it to strengthen the alliance as a factor for durable peace <e> <s> from the point of view of the future of the alliance the political decisions taken at the december meeting were of the highest importance <e> <s> the governments agreed on a document outlining certain basic principles and listing the tasks which the alliance should undertake in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords what we argue is that if we are to rely on small nuclear weapons which can lead to escalation the emphasis ought to be on conventional forces <e> <s> we accept that the <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will allow me the point i was making was that if acceptance of inf requires compensatory adjustments as the noble lord lord mayhew has said to offset the surrenders under inf that can hardly be a wholehearted acceptance of a very sincere kind <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister bear in mind that the armys recommendation was that the replacement should be the challenger ii <e> <s> does he agree with the comment made in the <e>", "<cs> my lords as the minister has said the order arises from the arms control and disarmament privileges and immunities act which we dealt with earlier this year <e> <s> it is related to the inf treaty <e> <s> it is a necessary and inevitable consequence as without verification we would not have had the treaty <e> <s> the order provides the nuts and bolts for that verification and we therefore support it <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble viscount lord ridley for giving us the opportunity to discuss the important subject of our reserves <e> <s> he will understand and forgive me if i cannot congratulate him with the same enthusiasm on the time of day that we are discussing the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that the proposals that are envisaged to remove united states ground-launched missiles from this country and to replace them with air-launched missiles in other parts of europe would indeed be widely construed as contrary to the spirit of the whole inf treaty <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the ratification of the inf treaty by the united states senate reduce the chances of a nuclear weapons accident in this country by removing land-based weapons <e> <s> on behalf of the government will the noble lord confirm support for the inf treaty <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord accept that the horrific increases in destructive power of these weapons which i think we would all admit underlines the importance of the agreements on nuclear disarmament which have already been achieved <e> <s> further does he understand that we on this side of the house would like to see those agreements carried through so that they apply to all nuclear weapons <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that we all admire the work of the royal navy in most difficult circumstances in the gull <e> <s> in view of the large number of ships tied up in the gulf can the minister say whether the co-ordination of international forces to protect shipping there was discussed at the recent moscow summit <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that it was the american general general abrahamson who was the leader of the sdi project who first cast doubt about the validity of the sdi as presented by president reagan <e> <s> if the minister cannot comment on that point can he comment on the other points made by the presidential candidate that he strongly urged the united states administration to complete a start treaty before the end of this year and secondly to work much more closely with their allies in europe <e>", "<cs> my lords in the past firms have been deterred from tendering by long and complicated bureaucratic procedures <e> <s> will the minister ensure that such impediments no longer exist so that many more firms will come forward <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that we welcome the information he has given about additional jobs especially in view of the report published last year by the city analysts <e>", "<cs> my lords in a debate on the white paper just before the general election i drew attention to the increasing number of defence <e>", "<cs> the noble lord makes the reservation about <e> <s> i shall come to that later <e> <s> i only wish that it were about instead of about half that <e> <s> few of us could have predicted this year the increasing wave of criticism not just from academics and military analysts but from much nearer home from conservative members of parliament and newspapers normally sympathetic to the government <e>", "<cs> the

lord has said the order is part of the traditional practice of taking an annual look at the disciplinary <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that we can agree that this has been a very successful debate and that we have had a number of very impressive speeches <e> <s> i say right from the start that as regards the speeches many roamed over a much wider area than the more narrow defence issue that i shall deal with <e> <s> recently the prime minister made a speech in which she said that we <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> equipment expenditure is declining by per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that when the noble lord comes to reply he will give us some answers <e> <s> it will be the first time in a defence debate that the minister has given some comparative figures <e> <s> i shall comment on that later <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that this may be the last opportunity for the raf museum to expand <e> <s> does the minister not agree that it would be a tragedy if this opportunity was missed <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that we congratulate the armilla patrol and also the men on the three minesweepers for the valuable work that they have done over the past eight years <e> <s> can he give the house an assurance that the valuable role that they have been engaged in will continue as long as there is no formal peace agreement between iran and iraq <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that modernisation to which he has been referring is contrary to the spirit of the inf treaty <e> <s> is he also aware that chancellor kohl cannot agree in my view to modernisation before the next general election in germany because the german people do not want replacement of those weapons <e> <s> therefore would it not be more fruitful and productive if the government directed their energies towards helping nato to respond to the many initiatives that mr gorbachev has put before that organisation in the past two years <e> <s> in other words is it not time for negotiation and not modernisation <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the gibraltar governments estimate that the ministry of <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister agree that according to the schedule the increase must take place between now and <e> <s> why at a time when the super powers are engaged in discussions about eliminating per cent <e> <s> of nuclear weapons and when mr gorbachev is talking about eliminating all nuclear weapons by are the government proposing an eight-fold increase in our nuclear force <e> <s> would it not be much better to put this into some kind of negotiating round <e>", "<cs> my lords as usual the minister says a questioner is wrong without explaining why <e> <s> will he accept that whereas polaris had three warheads trident may have eight and possibly and that therefore the point made by the noble lord lord mayhew is right <e> <s> so is the statement i made <e> <s> will the minister reaffirm the fact that it is important to put the missiles into some kind of negotiating machinery so that we can get rid of them <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that a number of experienced people who watch these matters very carefully for example the editor of <e>", "<cs> my lords first i thank my noble friend lord listowel for giving us the opportunity to debate this matter and for what he had to say <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down will he explain why the government pay tribute to the way in which the scheme in northern ireland works and why almost everyone concerned with animal welfare pays tribute to its effectiveness <e> <s> whatever the number of stray dogs which may have gone up this year that was not the case only months ago <e> <s> therefore why is the noble lord condemning the scheme out of hand when everyone else thinks that it is worthwhile <e>", "<cs> my lords some of us may not be surprised that at least some people believe the statement to be contentious <e> <s> would it not be a more appropriate way to recognise the anniversary <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that this matter has been under consideration for at least five years and that many people appear to believe that the delay arises from a lack of commitment despite what the noble lord has said <e> <s> this would be a very poor recompense for the excellent and courageous service that the gurkhas have given to this country over a long period of time <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the failure to retain trained <e>", "<cs> my lords in the first part of his answer the noble lord gave the number of movements <e> <s> can he say what proportion of staff who are offered relocation take it <e> <s> secondly what consultations take place in developing these programmes and what regard is paid to regional economic plans <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that despite the figures he has given there are areas where the amount spent has decreased in the last years for example in the field of training <e> <s> what worries defence experts is the fact that the government have gone on piling commitment after commitment both nuclear and others on to the defence programme without any proper review leaving the defence programme over-extended and under-funded <e> <s> i ask the minister what he intends to do about that <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that his preoccupation and that of his colleagues with labour party policy this morning is an indication that they really fear that the labour party has a credible policy which will appeal to the electorate <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say to the leader of the house how warmly we on this side of the house welcome this statement which has put an end to the uncertainty of the past three or four years <e> <s> we have not had time carefully to study the statement but it appears that it accepts the main recommendations of the defence committee of another place particularly in regard to the maintenance of a viable brigade structure and indeed that the future gurkha force will have a role that lies within the mainstream of the armys defence commitments including as now a substantial gurkha presence in the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords following on from the question of the noble lord lord mayhew in view of the extraordinary number of options that have been put forward by mr gorbachev and been followed up why are we so slow and so diffident about making similar concessions on our side to show that we accept the spirit of mr gorbachevs approach and want to respond in similar vein <e>", "<cs> my lords we are very grateful to the noble lord for his apology <e> <s> however is he aware that there is some concern about co-ordination between government departments and whether or not it is adequate in such a case as this <e> <s> what does the noble lord propose to do to make sure that this kind of misunderstanding does not happen again <e>", "<cs> my lords if the warsaw pact has superiority in short-range weapons would it not be to natos advantage to offer options in terms of the creation of asymmetrical numbers on either side rather than appear to be trailing behind mr gorbachev all the time <e>", "<cs> my lords even if the soviet union has not gone as far as we should like is it not to lose the initiative if we do not propose something beyond what it is proposing and test its sincerity in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the much less threatening statements made by president-elect menem this last weekend as against those made during the general election campaign should we not welcome those statements <e> <s> does the foreign office attach any special interpretation to those statements as distinct from the threatening statements he made during the general election campaign <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that we welcome the submission of the <e>", "<cs> my lords in the past our criticism of the governments defence policy has been that it was overstretched and underfunded mainly because of the preoccupation with nuclear weapons and trident in particular <e> <s> this made the need for a review essential <e> <s> its refusal has made it difficult to establish priorities and many decisions have had to be put off <e>", "<cs> my lords the point is that the government are spending too little on the commitments that they have undertaken <e> <s> that is why a proper review would bring those two things into balance <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that he himself acknowledged in the estimates debate that there was dissatisfaction about this package deal <e> <s> we acknowledge that that may not be the only element in the problem <e> <s> however in view of the fact that we are already an average of men short in every non-gurkha battalion and that we cannot get personnel from elsewhere about which he said we should not be complacent at what point in the decline will the noble lord accept that something ought to be done <e>", "<cs> my lords on more than one occasion my noble friend lord mcintosh has mentioned the fact that i am a member of a local authority <e> <s> i have been a member of the dartford borough council for years <e> <s> during that time it has been led by one or another of the major parties with more success and co-operation than is usual in many local authorities <e> <s> i should like to put forward an anxiety felt by members of the dartford borough council <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to intervene on behalf of local authorities <e> <s> many authorities such as dartford have spent a great deal of money installing dispersed alarm systems and central heating in one-bedroomed flats and bungalows which are suitable for the elderly but not part of designated sheltered housing schemes <e> <s> the clause is a threat to such investment past present and future aimed at adapting the local authorities housing stock to cope with the rapid growth in the frail elderly which is forecast to take place between now and the end of the century <e> <s> if that need is to be met the investment must continue <e> <s> under the bill it will be impossible <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl explain why her majestys government found it necessary to withdraw from the nfr project a co-operative scheme with seven other nations including the united states which was to build the first nato common warship <e> <s> further will he advise the house as to whether the other participants will continue and whether in view of the importance of establishing and maintaining collaborative projects within nato the government will reconsider their withdrawal <e> <s> will the minister also assure the house that it is not just a cost-cutting exercise <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a remarkable commentary on human affairs that when an event comes about for which millions of people have prayed namely freedom from oppression and fear in many countries of the world the result should be fear and confusion about what we should do <e> <s> an ex-bishop speaking from the pulpit conjured up future nuremberg rallies <e> <s> others who are afraid that history will repeat itself begin to make prescriptive statements about what germans should do <e> <s> some still believe that it is all a russian plot to lull us into a false sense of security when at some stage or other they will pounce upon us <e> <s> others express the need for caution which rather than being a rational appreciation of what is happening is a sign of lack of understanding of what is happening or what to do about it <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble earl cannot accept the very powerful arguments put forward by my noble friend lady jeger will he consider in view of the very strong feeling on the issue that there should at least be a review to establish the true circumstances in which those elderly widows are living at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords in calculating the million has the noble earl taken into account the fact that we are spending million less under this heading than we were in and that these ladies are dying off at the rate of a year so that we are certainly reducing the costs <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the growing support for this measure in both houses does the minister think that it would be wise for the government to be generous and consider at least a review rather than have legislation dragged out of them through a private members bill which will receive much support in both houses <e>", "<cs> my lords we welcome the statement even if it still represents only a partial solution to the problem of justice between the pre- and the post- war widows <e> <s> we are pleased that the efforts of members of both sides of the house should have moved the government to action in this matter <e> <s> however will the noble earl say why he has marred the effect of an otherwise excellent proposal by a partial payment <e> <s> is he aware that per week will still we believe leave a a week shortfall for the pre- widows <e> <s> will he confirm that <e> <s> why must these ladies wait until next april when at least some of them will not be alive to receive the money <e> <s> will the minister look again at the matter to see whether at least a payment of some of this money can be made before christmas <e>"]
