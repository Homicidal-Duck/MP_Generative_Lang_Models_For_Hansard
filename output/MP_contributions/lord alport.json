["<cs> my lords it was my misfortune that i was unavoidably unable to reach the house in time to hear the speeches of my noble friend the foreign secretary and the noble lord lord goronwy-roberts <e> <s> i apologise to both of them and to the house as well <e> <s> but i can at least offer my congratulations to the noble lord lord carver on his excellent maiden speech <e> <s> it was clear and concise in the best traditions of the staff college at camberley <e> <s> we hope that we may hear him often again <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble earl whether the government would consider amalgamating the spring bank holiday and the may bank holiday into a whit bank holiday as there has been over many centuries and which has been greatly enjoyed by the public in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may interrupt the noble lord merely to say that of course the government have the right to do whatever they like <e> <s> they cart do any foolish thing or anything which they conceive to be in the national interest but which other people consider is not in the national interest <e> <s> but that does not justify the noble lords argument <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord should read my speech <e> <s> he may have listened to it perhaps not as attentively as i should have liked because i in fact accepted that they had a right to increase and would indeed make additions to the fees of overseas students but i asked them to mitigate that increase in a way which i thought at any rate might <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend recognise that when on previous occasions there has been an attempt by government to cut the bbcs overseas services there has been very strong opposition on an all-party basis to that intention <e> <s> will my noble friend bear in mind that this is one of the least expensive methods of projecting the united kingdom overseas and that it is vitally important to the policies he is carrying out at present <e> <s> can we rely upon him to oppose such cuts as did his predecessor at the foreign office bearing in mind that if it is a principle of the treasury that cuts should be spread equally across the board that is a most unintelligent policy indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to intervene very quickly and shortly in this debate simply because i should like to advance a different version of the history behind this ministry of overseas development from that which has been advanced from the benches opposite <e> <s> in fact the ministry of overseas development developed from the ideas that were put forward by the commonwealth relations office in about when mr duncan sandys was secretary of state and mr harold macmillan was prime minister <e> <s> it seemed to the commonwealth office at that time that it was most important that the political factor in aid should be removed both in relation to the colonies and in relation to foreign countries and i suppose as well in relation to the increasing number of commonwealth countries that were coming into being at that time <e> <s> we felt it was wrong that the aid effort of this country should be regarded by sensitive public opinion in third world countries as i suppose we would now call them as being part of the political effort of the united kingdom <e> <s> my noble friend the minister said that one of the objects of this action was to advance the position of great britain in world affairs <e> <s> we did not think at that time that aid was a way in which you advanced politically the position of this country anywhere <e> <s> indeed we felt that it was one of the ways in which we could produce something <e>", "<cs> my lords i know perfectly well the kindheartedness of my noble friend and i would not in any way wish to criticise him <e> <s> however his intervention has given me the opportunity to say that this debate has gone on rather longer than i expected <e> <s> i had not intended to take part in it <e> <s> as i have to leave at half-past four i hope that the house and the minister will not regard me as being unduly discourteous if i leave then <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so at the beginning of my speech i think it is a pity that the noble lord lord hatch of lusby has given us the impression that he has spoken in this house this afternoon not in the independent stance which noble lords should on all sides attain but as a spokesman of the patriotic front <e> <s> we in this house have different views about the past and i shall be referring to them shortly but i am quite certain that all of us today and i <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may go on the noble lord has had nearly half an hour <e> <s> some people have tended to criticise the length of the lancaster house conference <e> <s> negotiations about africa with africans are not amenable to the hectic time-scale of diplomacy in europe and america <e> <s> your lordships will perhaps recall that rhodes successful negotiations with the matabele indunas in lasted on a daily basis from august to october <e> <s> that was to settle four months of violence and not seven years of escalating civil war <e> <s> the foreign secretary in handling these recent negotiations with bishop muzorewa the patriotic front and the rhodesian front has shown the same patience and decision that rhodes showed on that occasion <e> <s> in my view that has been the basis of his success <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness has never said anything unkind or ungracious about anyone and i am quite certain that nothing like that would ever apply to her <e>", "<cs>

speech tomorrow in <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether the government are aware of the serious implications so far as the stability of pakistan and that part of asia is concerned of this enormous influx of refugees <e> <s> would it be in the interests of the united kingdom that some contribution should be made to <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask whether my noble friend recognises that although the vulnerability of pakistan may to a great extent be military it is even more vulnerable from the point of view of the economic and social conditions existing in that country and not least as a result of the enormous influx of refugees <e> <s> although i realise that the government have sent of supplies for the refugees that is a very small contribution to the solution of this problem and even though the overseas aid programme may be under strain as the noble lord has said is it the intention of her majestys government to give increased economic aid to pakistan in the near future <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether the introduction of proportional representation is among the amendments being considered at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether he will recognise how many conservatives will welcome this small return to the traditional conservative policies of tariff protection and import control as against the prevailing economic fallacies which are liberally originating of <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask whether in the priorities which my noble friend will apply to the distribution of aid he will bear very clearly in mind the importance to the developing countries of the training of their own nationals so that they can serve in those countries on their return <e> <s> although there are many demands for different forms of aid from those countries the education and postgraduate education of overseas students in this country should take first place <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always a great pleasure to follow the noble lord lord mackie of benshie <e> <s> he brings to our debates the fresh air of the highlands and good canny scottish wisdom <e> <s> i know that the noble lord will forgive me for not taking up his general argument <e> <s> my remarks will be of a political rather than an economic nature <e> <s> we have had a good deal of economics in the debate so far <e> <s> there is only one fact that i have not yet heard mentioned in relation to economic theory and practice <e> <s> that fact is that inflation is always in the interests of the debtor that anybody who borrows money has an interest in paying that money back at a cheaper rate than the rate at which it was borrowed <e> <s> the government as the greatest debtor in the country have a vested interest in the continuance of inflation <e> <s> the only problem is that when it gets out of hand and has social consequences which are thoroughly undesirable it then becomes the governments duty to try to mitigate those consequences <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the attitude of mind of the working peoples conditioned by bismark was attractive <e> <s> it has led probably to two world wars but that is a very different thing and there is one thing that i would not say i am sure that the noble lord who has just interrupted me would join me among the good guys who are theeconomic illiterates as we are maintained to be <e> <s> i am an easily identifiable wet or more agreeably in the opinion of the editor of <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether he will bear in mind in the allocation of grants to zimbabwe the needs of the university college of what was rhodesia and nyasaland and presumably on friday will be the university of zimbabwe which under the very courageous leadership of the reverend dr craig has played a very important part in preparing the zimbabwean people for the responsibilities of independence <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the very great importance of this subject at the present time and the very large resources of experience which are available within this house would it not be appropriate for us to have two days for this debate when the time comes <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether he is aware that there was an almost exactly parallel position in about the s in the relations between her majestys government of the day and the abyssinian government and that we solved that and released the hostages which were taken by our own efforts and at our own very great expense <e> <s> does he not think that there are great dangers in the internationalisation of a bilateral problem however serious and dramatic it may be in the eyes of the countries concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords like previous speakers i am very grateful to my noble friend lord campbell of croy because this occasion gives me an opportunity of making one or two points very briefly about an institution in this country for which i have had an affectionate interest for a good many years <e> <s> i should like to start by saying that i fully agree with the governments decision to split the present post office into telecommunications and postal services <e> <s> the secretary of state should be careful before he decides to dismantle the monopoly status of the post office as far as postal services are concerned <e> <s> we should remember that the problems of the latter are to a great extent the problems of size the enormous volume of mail which these days must be handled every day of the year <e> <s> this is a problem which faces every postal service in the world <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may interrupt my noble friend for one moment i do not think i alleged that this was the case <e> <s> i said that i understood that the reason for sir william barlows decision not to continue in the service of telecommunications was because of the exposure which he as a private citizen and chairman had to the political pressures which are perhaps inevitable on a great public corporation of this sort <e> <s> what i suggested therefore was that to relieve the future chairmen of the organisations some of that pressure should be taken by the government through a minister responsible for it which i think is the right thing to do in the circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend while thanking him for that answer whether he realises that the members of the royal observer corps feel that the role that they have been playing over many years and the importance that they have for the future are not fully recognised by this governmentand have not been by successive governments <e> <s> would my noble friend consider in conjunction with his colleagues in the home office whether or not the royal observer corps could provide a good foundation for an expansion of civil defence in the immediate future <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to make obligatory the holding of a constitutional referendum before a bill which contains provisions to abolish the house of lords thereby reducing the parliament of the united kingdom to a single chamber may proceed to a second reading in either house of parliament <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> i should like to make one remark with regard to the amendment <e> <s> i think that the noble lord lord spens is wrong in trying to draw a parallel between the position of shareholders in a company and the position of trade unionists in a trade union movement <e> <s> i think it an absolute fallacy to suppose that what can apply to a public or private company can apply to the very often highly charged political situations in which trade union leadership finds itself <e> <s> i believe that the amendment if accepted by your lordships committee would in fact go far to act against the interests of what we require in the trade union movement which is strong leadership <e> <s> it would undermine the position of the leaders and what is more it would i believe assist the militants <e>", "<cs> when this amendment was called the noble lord lord mccarthy appeared to indicate that it was not the intention of the front bench to move it <e> <s> may i ask therefore whether the noble lord lord wedderburn is speaking for himself on this occasion or for the official front bench on the other side <e>", "<cs> my lords the house was informed last week that this particular matter was under discussion between the prime minister and the president of france at the venice meeting <e> <s> was there any indication during that discussion that the reaction of the french would take this extraordinary form <e>", "<cs> may i ask my noble friend whether he will confirm that in the exercise of his powers by the secretary of state the exercise of those powers will be subject to an affirmative resolution by both houses of parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend agree that the country in general is well satisfied with this very small u-turn on the part of her majestys government <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether any thought has been given in addition to the activation <e>", "<cs> my lords if this afternoon i speak from the earls bench it is not because of some sudden and unexpected advancement in the order of nobility it is merely to avoid the uncomfortable constriction of space in the bench behind <e> <s> i should like if i may to join other noble lords in congratulating the noble lord lord marshall of leeds on his admirable maiden speech <e> <s> lord marshall comes to this house with a great reputation in local government in his county and the north <e> <s> i think it is probable that as as i see the committee stage of the local government planning and land no <e> <s> bill is

the one he adopted <e>", "<cs> my lords could i interrupt my noble friend <e>", "<cs> it is not to appease criticism my lords it is to prevent the unemployment figures becoming million <e>", "<cs> my lords before the house passes this bill i think it would be right to say that i am certain the congregation of the united reformed church in lion walk in colchester are grateful to your lordships for facilitating the passing of this bill on a matter which is of very great importance to the future of their congregation <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble earl whether the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to make obligatory the holding of a constitutional referendum before a bill which contains provisions to abolish the house of lords or substantially to diminish its legislative powers may proceed beyong second reading in either house of parliament and to amend section of the parliament act <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs>

first i should like to say how very grateful i am to all noble lords who have taken part in the debate <e> <s> in particular i wish to thank <e>", "<cs> please <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that and i was also a contestant in that election <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that if your lordships are not prepared as those who vote against the second reading of this bill will show themselves as not being prepared to trust the people then the people will no doubt draw their own conclusions <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the first question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the answer of my noble friend may i ask leave of the house to take time to consider the impact of that on the progress of the constitutional referendum bill which had its second reading before christmas and then consider what action to take <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say that it is not necessary for legislation of this kind to be brought into the united kingdom parliament to have the request and the consent of canada <e> <s> in view of the fact that it is now years since the passing of the british north america act and years since the passing of the statute of westminster may i ask my noble friend whether it would not be right in order to prevent any disagreement or misunderstanding between the united kingdom and canada for the united kingdom parliament to take action unilaterally to repeal what is really a last relic of the colonial status of canada which would then place canada on an equal constitutional relationship with the united kingdom with other commonwealth countries such as botswana and bangladesh <e>", "<cs> my lords may i take it from what my noble friend has said that the government in fact now guarantee that during the course of their term of office they will reduce inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords during the conference what consideration was given to the financing of the surplus maize crop in zimbabwe in order to ensure that it is available for sale and purchase by neighbouring countries which are at present facing a very serious shortage of foodstuffs <e> <s> also can my noble friend say whether some consideration has been given to make it possible for this crop to be transported to those countries concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend agree that the amount of aid in money terms is less important than what is produced for the assistance of overseas countries as a result of the employment of funds from this country <e> <s> would he agree that the most important and economical way of assisting developing countries is the provision of instructors for the schools and <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the botswana government are taking the strictest precautions to prevent foot and mouth disease in their country that this has been possible as a result of the ending of the udi situation in neighbouring zimbabwe and that the export of beef from botswana to other countries particularly to the eec is of the greatest importance to the whole of the economy of that country <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether it is not against the practice of the house and standing orders that a starred question should become a dialogue between the peer asking it and the minister concerned when so very often it appears that the questioner is more anxious to impart information than to receive it <e>", "<cs> my lords if no one else intends to contribute to the discussion of this particular piece of legislation perhaps i might take up the time of your lordships for a couple of minutes to say how much i welcome the development which is envisaged in the bill now before the house <e> <s> it happens that i know this part of the outer isles extremely well <e> <s> this morning i was making preparations to go there for the tenth year in succession for my summer holidays <e> <s> i know the inconvenience that has been caused to the inhabitants of both berneray and north uist by the fact that there has been no means whereby transport of vehicles could be carried out between the two islands <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether i should be right in interpreting his answer as meaning that in fact there is unlikely to be any action in this field for a very considerable time <e> <s> since the programme of legislation ahead of us is now so great in this session and it would be wrong therefore to ask your lordships to give consideration to the further stages of the present constitutional referendum bill in this session would the government perhaps consider giving some support to a revised bill taking into account the criticisms made at second reading and for it to be introduced at the beginning of the next session so that some progress may be made on this matter while they are making up their minds about the future form and powers of the house of lords <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend agree that it is highly undesirable whatever may be the views on the judgment of the charity commissioners in any particular case for the government to be involved in bringing pressure on them in any particular direction

could be any eventuality in which the nuclear deterrent of the united kingdom would be used unilaterally before the nuclear capability of the western world was committed <e> <s> secondly does my noble friend not think that the confidence of our allies in the united kingdoms contribution to the defence of the west would be greater if our resources were employed in the extension of our conventional forces rather than in very large expense involved in the continuance of britains own nuclear deterrent <e> <s> and thirdly would my noble friend not agree that from the point of view of diplomacy the influence of the united kingdom in the world would be increased if the million involved was spent in the development of british arms on the armament industry and employed in the development of our economic capacity here in the united kingdom which would automatically assist in the strength of the stand which he is able to take in the discussion of international problems when he has occasion to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether he attributes any of the inflation which has taken place over the last few years to the increase in oil <e> <s> why does this not appear to be part of the answer which he gives on this occasion <e> <s> it has always struck me that the increase in oil fuelled the inflationary tendencies of the last four years <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask

long in trying to reply to the many points which have been put forward <e> <s> i should like to say first if i may that i had a message from the noble lord lord wade from the liberal party to say that

to the noble lord lord jacques for his contribution and for his support <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for that answer may i ask him whether he would agree that fishing is as much a way of life in the western isles as is crofting and that so far as lobster fishing in particular is concerned it has had the result of bringing hack into the islands or keeping there a number of young men who otherwise would have emigrated or worked outside and who have been able to make a fairly successful livelihood lobster fishing <e> <s> would he say further whether he has received representations personally during a visit to lewis along the lines of the question and if so whether any

she not agree that it is not true to say that the regulations and their costs are the same now as they were years ago <e>", "<cs> i hope that the minister will consider this amendment in spirit at any rate carefully <e> <s> those of us as my noble friend lady macleod has mentioned who live in country areas know of the great concern now building up within those areas regarding the dangers that seem to be ahead of us when this bill goes through parliament <e> <s> if those fears are realised it will be greatly to the disadvantage of people living in the remoter parts of the country <e> <s> this is not merely a party political criticism of the bill <e> <s> it is not a fear drummed up by the propaganda of any particular organisation <e> <s> it is something very real that is felt in the villages certainly in my part of essex <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will take the matter carefully into consideration <e>", "<cs> if my noble friend argues that in the future it will be counter-productive for british telecom to raise prices because it will lose customers why has the contrary happened when it has consistently raised prices over the last many years <e>", "<cs> i must ask my noble friend again whether he will consider this amendment <e> <s> i suppose that i must declare an interest because i imagine that i am almost the last of the lowest form of ministerial life which in past days was the assistant postmaster-general <e> <s> in those days we were greatly concerned with the efficiency of the telephone service and i emphasise the word service because that is essentially what it was <e> <s> it was intended to be providing for all sections of the community so far as possible through the public callbox and also the private telephone a service <e> <s> need was very much taken into consideration at that time <e>", "<cs> i have listened with great care to my noble friends speech and comments <e> <s> there is perhaps a good deal of confusion of mind in the committee generally on this point <e> <s> i myself may be confused <e> <s> i did not regard the meaning of the word needs in this case as dealing with the question of the financial situation of the person who requires the telephone <e> <s> i assumed that in this case the word needs was intended to cover the requirements of a scattered rural area as compared with the requirements of a high demand highly congested urban area <e> <s> i do not believe that the old gentleman to whom the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge referred is the object of this amendment <e> <s> its object is generally to ensure that the policy contains some equity as between those who require the service but who do not provide the same volume of demand and those who provide a greater volume of demand but whose requirements are not so urgent as they would be for instance in rural areas <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the straw and stubble burning prohibition bill hl <e> <s> be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt my noble friend <e> <s> that remark was made entirely spontaneously during a visit about something quite different to the town of ipswich <e> <s> this was something that this particular gentlemen who farms acres and has no burning at all on it gave as his opinion for the reason <e> <s> i hope therefore that my noble friend will not misinterpret or misunderstand the point that i was making at that time <e> <s> it is not my opinion it was the opinion of an experienced farmer and landowner in suffolk <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand having taken advice on this that the terms of the bill do not include oil-seed rape or what is called residue of that sort <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may make it clear that i do not actually sit in colchester <e> <s> i live in a village about five miles out of it in the midst of a highly developed arable area <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i can help the noble baroness <e> <s> it does in fact say the district council <e> <s> they are the authority which has to adminster the licence <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt <e>", "<cs> my lords i am so sorry i did not mean to interrupt my noble friend <e> <s> i was under the impression that those provisions only became the law of the land if they were adopted by the district councils as part of their powers <e> <s> if a district council does not do so then as far as that part of the country is concerned it is not the law of the land at all <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the minister for his invitation <e> <s> i think i replied to most of the points he made in criticism of the bill when i made my opening speech <e> <s> i anticipated among other things that he would regard the bye-laws as the linchpin of the governments policy <e> <s> the bye-laws depend on the action of district councils to adopt them and then to enforce them <e> <s> it is at that level that the whole of the success of the governments policy of control such as it is is maintained <e> <s> if the district councils have the power and the responsibility for adopting bye-laws and enforcing them surely they could be the authority which has the right to issue the licences rather than the county council or on a national basis <e>", "<cs> my lords i am taking the time of your lordships house for this second reading at a very late hour and i believe that i would be entitled to be slightly affronted by the impression which some noble lords have given that i bring the bill before your lordships house use the time of the house and a great deal of my own time simply in order to withdraw it at the behest of what would appear outside this house as being a strongly entrenched vested interest in this house and i have not the slightest intention of doing so <e>", "<cs> may i follow my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter by saying that i find it extraordinary that we should be going through day after day of telecommunications committee stage under the threat that a statement on the way in which it is going to be carried out is going to be made at third reading <e> <s> surely if there is an explanation of the governments policy in relation to this it should be made as early as possible in the committee stage so that we know exactly where we are <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much regret that i found it difficult to follow the speech of my noble friend lord swinton <e> <s> i had the totally unworthy suspicion that his mind was more on the winner of the queen mothers championship chase at cheltenham than it was on higher education <e> <s> certainly if the horse he backed there went as fast as he went during his speech he will be a richer man tonight <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to all noble lords who have taken part in this debate which has proved to be not only a longer but a much more interesting one than i anticipated when i first saw the marshalled list <e>", "<cs> however there are two general points i should like to make <e> <s> first of all in answer to this amendment the bill as it stands and the bill as amended by the amendments that i have tabled does not prevent straw or stubble burning <e> <s> in the first place a licence is obtainable in order to burn stubble or straw and it is available to everyone who wishes to do so <e> <s> your lordships will see as a result of later amendments that if by any chance any farmer does not receive a licence he has recourse to the law courts in order to obtain his rights so there is no question of this bill stopping straw or stubble burning <e> <s> it does not do so <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may answer my noble friend <e> <s> i would draw his attention to amendment no <e> <s> after clause which reads <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble earl looks at the marshalled list he will see a very substantial amendment which i have introduced which changes that so i suggest that he looks at that <e>", "<cs> i do not want to go on to another amendment but the decisions will be made by the court and that is the right place for them to be made <e>", "<cs> perhaps i can save the time of the committee by saying that i am very happy to accept this amendment <e>", "<cs> again i can save the time of the committee by saying that i am very happy to accept this amendment which is an improvement on the present wording of the bill <e>", "<cs> we are about to turn to clause amendment no <e> <s> which is a major amendment <e> <s> it represents a decision which is most important both from the point of view of my noble friends who have tabled the amendment and from the point of view of the bill <e> <s> if it is agreeable i believe that we ought to adjourn during pleasure for the next minutes and return tomorrow to the bill since the committee stage is to be resumed tomorrow after the two short debates <e> <s> then we shall have full time for the arguments about what i believe to be a very important amendment to be deployed <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> perhaps it might be helpful if i were to answer some of the questions which have been put <e> <s> i do not intend to interfere with the contributions which other noble lords wish to make but merely to try to be helpful and shorten some of the discussion we had last night <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may correct my noble friend <e> <s> i may not have made it as clear as i should or perhaps he did not hear what i said <e> <s> but i thought that i said quite clearly in my speech that once the original application had been made and in all probability made on behalf of the farm that would continue for so long as it was necessary <e> <s> therefore there would not be the troubles for the farmers which my noble friend anticipates <e>", "<cs> as my noble friend has asked that question i would say that farmers get elected to local authorities <e> <s> they are represented on district councils themselves and they are the people who will look after the interests of farmers and their neighbours <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may answer this straight away because i have given consideration to this amendment which goes as my noble friend has said with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the meaning of it is that the local authority or the authority granting the licence would only grant a licence if the farmer satisfied the authority that he would have special regard to the potential danger and inconvenience and has indicated satisfactorily that the measures he proposed to take to protect the environment the convenience and safety of the public were sufficient for the local authoritys purposes <e>", "<cs> i have not considered this <e> <s> i have no doubt that if one of my noble friends from scotland cares to put down an amendment at report stage to <e>", "<cs> perhaps i could say on this that i do not think there is very much between my noble friend and i as regards paragraphs <e>", "<cs> i did not withdraw my amendment immediately because i was anxious that the noble lord lord henderson of brompton and my noble friend lord ironside should have the opportunity of airing the views that are represented by their amendments to this bill <e> <s> but we should not be led away further on to discussing model by-laws <e> <s> there will no doubt be an opportunity of doing that in due course at any rate i hope that will be the case <e> <s> therefore i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> that is entirely a matter for the minister but i think i must say that i have moved the withdrawal of my amendment <e>", "<cs> no not moved <e>", "<cs> i am present in this committee <e> <s> it is my amendment and i have not moved it <e> <s> therefore it is not moved <e>", "<cs> may i appeal to the front bench or to whoever is responsible for this matter <e> <s> i specifically did not withdraw the amendment <e> <s> the noble lord lord henderson then moved it on my behalf and the noble lord lord ironside has spoken to it <e> <s> as far as i understand it the amendment of the noble lord lord ironside has not been moved <e> <s> therefore i hope that <e>", "<cs> i should be unwilling to withdraw it but i will give an undertaking to my noble friend that at the next stage any amendments which are necessary to ensure the bill does apply to scotland will be introduced <e>", "<cs> perhaps i should point out to my noble friend the minister and to others that the amendment says <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> there was no agreement and there has been no agreement with my noble friends on this <e> <s> i forecast that i would take this action when i wound up on second reading of this bill <e> <s> it was clear to me that this was an amendment which in the circumstances was a wise one <e> <s> my noble friend lord stanley of alderley has just said that the amendment in his belief means that the minister will introduce the ban in four years time <e> <s> he is worried about that <e> <s> the noble lord says that possibly he will not but in fact i feel strongly that this is the sort of amendment which is fair both to the farmers and to the rest of the community <e>", "<cs> my lords i have great sympathy with the noble earl <e> <s> the debates on the straw burning bill have taken place between pm and oclock in the morning on the first occasion and between pm and pm on the second occasion <e> <s> in those circumstances we are accustomed to rather late sittings on this bill <e> <s> i apologise to the noble earl <e> <s> i only hope to be able to terminate our proceedings as soon as possible <e> <s> we are nearly at the end and then the noble earl will have the opportunity to introduce his motion <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that there is very great concern at any rate in the country districts about the fact that the water <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> this amendment was discussed fully on the last occasion <e> <s> i have given it considerable thought since <e> <s> i wish now to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> this amendment was put down by my noble friend lord ridley <e> <s> i think the reason why he put it down was because the counties are the fire authorities <e> <s> on the other hand the districts are the anti-pollution authorities <e> <s> further districts have been relied on by the ministry for many years past for at least years and more to be responsible for enforcing the by-laws with regard to stubble and straw burning <e> <s> the new model by-laws are for operation by the district councils and the ministry has apparently and quite rightly confidence that district councils can carry this out in a proper manner <e> <s> i am assured by the association of district councils that it would be perfectly possible for them to do this and in those circumstances it seems only right that the district councils should be the local authority <e> <s> another reason is that the district councils as we discussed earlier in this committee know the district well and although they have on them members of the old urban district authorities also include members of the old rural district authorities the farming interests are therefore represented on them <e> <s> in those circumstances i hope that my noble friend will withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords my purpose in bringing forward this amendment was twofold <e> <s> first of all it was to do what i thought was right in the interests of and out of respect to your lordships house which was for anybody moving a bill to take into account the detailed discussions and views which were contributed during committee stage by noble lords <e> <s> i have often said and my noble friend lord henderson has said so this evening that ministers resist amendments when really they could quite easily accept them and they do so in the belief that they are showing the strength of the governments case <e> <s> i think that anybody who moves a bill and tries to promote it through this house should take into account the views expressed by noble lords <e> <s> the amendments which i introduced at the committee stage and at this stage were proposed because i have taken into account what i regard to be the legitimate and wise views and advice which have been given to me in the conduct of this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e> <s> in doing so i am reminded that on second reading i said that i was sure that your lordships would knock the bill into shape <e> <s> your lordships have knocked it into a rather different shape from the one in which it started <e> <s> although it is more limited i think that it is a useful bill and that it is right for it to go now to the other place and be submitted to the tender mercies there <e> <s> i merely want to take the occasion of proposing that the bill do now pass to thank those of your lordships who took part in the early stages of the bill and who helped very much to improve it <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend agree that a manifesto of any party is not a commitment for that party to carry through its policies in the next parliament but is an indication of the hopes the party has and that subsequently whether it is in regard to local government organisation or old age pensions if those promises do not become practical they should not be proceeded with <e>", "<cs> may i ask my noble friend this question before we leave this point <e> <s> i understand from what he has said that anybody who has a complaint against the new london regional transport organisation will send it to the consumer representation <e> <s> my noble friend said that local authorities are not represented on companies such as marks and spencer but the fact of the matter is that if you have a complaint about what you buy from that very distinguished store you do not write to a consumers committee you write straight to the management <e>", "<cs> my lords in normal circumstances i think i would feel called upon to rebut some of the statements made by the noble lord lord milford in the speech to which we have just listened <e> <s> at this time of night all that is required of a speaker is only the reasons why he or she intends to vote in one or other of the lobbies when a division is called <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord the leader of the opposition speaks i wonder whether i may ask the advice of my noble friend with regard to amendment no <e> <s> in my name and that of the noble lord lord kilmarnock <e> <s> i and i think the noble lord too regard it as a very important amendment but of course whether it should be proceeded with depends very largely on the governments eventual decision with regard to acceptance of the decision of the committee on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i understand that almost in the last few minutes it has been stated in the house of commons or at any rate if not in the house certainly by the minister concerned that it is the governments intention to accept their lordships <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to my noble friend for what he has said <e> <s> i do not think that those of us who sit on the back-benches are always very sympathetic to those sitting on the front bench <e> <s> however on this particular occasion and during the debates on this bill my sympathies lie entirely with my noble friend lord bellwin <e> <s> at the present moment he has the hopeless and impossible task of trying to answer questions <e> <s> the noble lord lord boothby said something to this effect if the government do not know their mind how on earth are we supposed to understand it ourselves <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether the government have given any thought to the holding of the elections for the ilea <e> <s> does my noble friend realise that in order to have an effective transfer of responsibility between the present ilea and the newly-elected one it is important that the elections for the new ilea should take place at least six months before the present ilea goes out of existence <e> <s> this is extremely important if i may impress it on my noble friend for the official administration of education in this great city of london <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord kilmarnock and to the noble baroness lady david for the support which they have given on two occasions and the advice which they have given to <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i cannot accept my noble friends argument that it is impossible to divorce the ilea even though it is associated with the glc from the glc proper <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that contracts are agreed by the ilea and then passed to the supplies department of the glc <e> <s> there is an operative and administrative division between the two bodies <e> <s> there is no difficulty in practice in that being carried out whatever may be the imposition of controls over the glc for matters other than those relating to both the building needs and the supply needs of the ilea <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether he realises how difficult it is sometimes for laymen like myself to understand the full implications of a ministerial statement <e> <s> but would i be right in supposing that what this means is that the present ilea will continue until may in two guises first as an established committee of the glc until the glc ceases to exist and then subsequently as the new corporate body which will administer education in london until the elections take place <e> <s> if that is the case then may i ask my noble friend whether he realises that the discussions which we had in this house earlier in this session with regard to this particular problem were concerned primarily with the essential continuity of the administration of education in london and in so far as this plan produces that continuity and enables the future elected body to take over from the existing one in one day so to speak it will be greatly welcomed by those who are governors of london schools the staff of the inner london education authority and all those who have the interests of education in london at heart <e>", "<cs> my lords anyone who takes part in this debate has a particular privilege <e> <s> however trite or commonplace our own contributions may be we share in an occasion distinguished by the magnanimity eloquence and vision of the maiden speech of my noble friend lord stockton <e> <s> i can only say that my own sense of political values has been strongly influenced by him over a period of half a century indeed ever since i first read in the thirties his book <e>", "<cs> my lords it is for the house now to turn from the problems of a large island very close to the united kingdom to welcoming to the commonwealth islands that are very far away <e> <s> in my case as the noble lord lord fanshawe has suggested my main purpose in occupying your lordships time for a few minutes this afternoon is to welcome the maldive islands to membership of the commonwealth and it is perhaps inevitable on occasions such as this that there should be something reminiscent in the speeches that are made <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to make provision for the control and licensing of straw and stubble burning after st january <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to rise rather slowly on this but not having followed the previous proceedings i was not quite clear whether i was entitled at this particular point to say how very much i should like to welcome this order and how grateful i am to the government for proceeding with it and also for the fact that it should be done through the european councils contribution <e> <s> i must declare that i have a special interest in this matter in so far as i have <e>", "<cs> my lords put very simply to me the issue we are debating is whether the damage to the public interest resulting from inflation is greater or less than damage caused by mass unemployment <e> <s> it is true that the impact of inflation affects a larger number of people <e> <s> it involves sacrifices which have to be borne by the nation generally <e> <s> on the other hand the impact of unemployment affects the lives of say million to million people less than a quarter of our population <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the second reading of the straw and stubble burning control bill <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just interrupt my noble friend for one moment <e> <s> is he referring to the code and if so what sanctions are in fact behind it or is he referring to the by-laws <e> <s> i should be interested to know whether the nfu in fact fines its members if they break the code or puts them in gaol <e> <s> what does it do <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank those noble lords who have taken part in this debate and who have set out their views <e> <s> i should like to thank the minister my noble friend lord belstead for the much more sympathetic way if i may say so in which he has treated this particular bill than was the case with my earlier efforts mark i and mark ii on the last occasion <e> <s> i should like to thank also the noble baroness lady nicol who was absolutely right in <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the straw and stubble burning control bill <e> <s> if it is your lordships pleasure that it be withdrawn then it will be immediately introduced for first reading in the other place by my honourable friend the member for thanet <e> <s> if by any happy chance it makes progress there and comes back to your lordships house perhaps after a formal second reading your lordships will have plenty of opportunity to consider it during its other stages <e> <s> i feel that this is the best way to deal with it in the interests of the bill and at the same time perhaps it will save us from the experience we had last year of taking a lot of time in discussing the previous bill only to find that it was killed instantly when it reached the other place <e> <s> my lords i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the withdrawal of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been a very well-timed debate and we are very grateful to the noble lord lord jenkins for initiating it <e> <s> speaking for myself i must say that i appreciate his commitment to the arts rather than his preoccupation with nuclear war and i enjoyed very much his speech with much of which i agreed <e> <s> like others when i saw the title of the arts councils policy document i thought it a trifle bizarre <e> <s> i did not realise that it was not the <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin if i may by congratulating the noble lord lord murray of epping forest on his distinguished maiden speech <e> <s> like him when preparing for this debate my mind was focused on the white paper

of the dedicated voluntary organisations that seek to help them they end up penniless and workless living in rotten digs and a prey to pimps and drug sellers <e> <s> it is no good telling the unemployed to go and find work when there is no work for them to find <e> <s> it is no good the government <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not true that japan has protected her market effectively for the past years and perhaps more <e> <s> has that done any harm <e>", "<cs> will my noble friend allow me to intervene for a moment <e>", "<cs> i have not seen the advertisement to which he has referred but i have plenty of evidence in my own files of letters from organisations in london and from the north <e> <s> these are voluntary organisations which are gravely concerned by the situation without having been influenced in the slightest way by any of the propaganda to which my noble friend has referred and which frankly i have not seen <e>", "<cs> although my name is not with this amendment it is with subsequent amendments along the same lines and so perhaps i may have an opportunity for a few moments to occupy the committees time to speak in support of the amendment proposed by the right reverend prelate the bishop of london <e> <s> in the last session when we were discussing i think it was the paving bill i tried to express my concern that the arrangements being made for the future of education in london should not in any way affect adversely the efficient administration and consequently the educational welfare of the capitals children <e> <s> my noble friend the leader of the house on that occasion did his best to meet the representations along those lines which were made by members of this house of all parties and we were extremely grateful to him <e> <s> i should like to say if i may to my noble friend the minister that i very much hope that he will show the same flexibility in his approach to this subject as his noble leader did on that occasion <e> <s> this is not a matter of party politics in any way but it is something which closely concerns not only the <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of the essex county council perhaps i may say that i understand it is strongly in support of the amendment <e> <s> i hope my noble friend and the government will consider more carefully than they appear to have done up to now the experience and interests of those who are democratically elected to represent us in the various counties which have already been mentioned in this debate <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend lord nugent of guildford realise that the county councils are very certain that the scheme is not going to work <e> <s> that is the reason they want this reserve position <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend quantify his phrase nudged upwards preferably by rank <e>", "<cs> my lords am i right in understanding that there is now to be only one category of bank <e> <s> in those circumstances is it likely that some of those financial institutions which have not hitherto been regarded as eligible to be considered a bank under the present legislation will be considered under the new legislation provided they can achieve the capital requirement to which my noble friend referred <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the inevitability of the introduction of a quota system for cereal production in this country and the fact that successful incorporation has been undertaken during the past two years by the most progressive and public-minded farmers will the government now consider introducing a ban on straw burning from say <e>", "<cs> my lords if those of us who smoke as i do give it up what would be the cost to the exchequer of the additional pensions we would draw during the further years we would expect to live and what would be

planning is the leading school for that particular subject in the country is extremely important to the rural areas of east anglia and to the local government authorities that depend on it and that its loss would mean a great defect in the whole of the planning policies for our part of england <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that although i am well aware of the problems of the north-east of england this question relates to essex and east anglia <e> <s> this is a particularly important problem so far as local government rural planning and the general environment in east-anglia are concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords may i begin by thanking my noble friend the leader of the house for giving us the opportunity of having this debate at this time which has enabled us to hear a number of distinguished contributions including that of the noble lord lord pitt of hampstead <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that there are a very great many people in this country who are deeply concerned with the continuing unity of the commonwealth and wish that everything could be done by her majestys government to ensure that whatever may be the difficulties with which they are faced that unity continues in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask my noble friend or rather i should like to ask the leader of the house whether he does not consider that most of the interventions that have taken place since this statement was made apart from those from the front bench have been a gross abuse of the procedure of the house contrary to the traditions of the house and unfair on a minister who is here not to have a debate but to answer questions <e> <s> in those circumstances the proceedings of the past half hour or so have not been of any advantage to the reputation of this house <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask my noble friend whether he is aware that a substantial number of farmers have given up straw-burning due to a sense of responsibility to the public interest <e> <s> they have found that incorporation is much less expensive and can be achieved much more efficiently than originally thought <e> <s> in those circumstances as a large number of farmers have given up straw-burning does he not think that it is time that the farmers who have not shown the same responsibility should be compelled to do so by legislation <e> <s> will my noble friend and his right honourable friend consider this situation and perhaps in the next session of parliament help to introduce a bill to end stubble-burning by <e> <s> alternatively perhaps he will support a private members bill if that were introduced <e>", "<cs> my lords the debate so far i think has been in pretty general terms and included the admirable maiden speech from lord derwent whose father we remember here with great affection <e> <s> however i hope that your lordships will bear with me if by contrast i give a case study of unemployment in one great english city <e> <s> in the last session i initiated a debate on the problems of the north suggesting the appointment of a secretary of state on a par with the secretaries of state for scotland and wales <e> <s> the idea did not commend itself to your lordships <e> <s> indeed my noble friend lord elliott of morpeth indicated that i had a totally false impression of the seriousness of the problems in that part of england <e>", "<cs> my lords this third reading debate on a bill which authorises the building of yards of railway line has so far proceeded in a rather unusual manner <e> <s> however it has enabled the right reverend prelate the bishop of london to carry out his undoubted pastoral responsibilities and the noble lord lord sefton to raise before the house the question of the north-south divide <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not simply the formal courtesies of our house which make me wish to thank the noble and learned lord lord scarman for <e>", "<cs> my lords the recent election proved once again that britain or at any rate england is a very conservative country <e> <s> i often recall the leader in <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for the answer <e> <s> however is he aware that the british medical association has established a high-powered committee with full terms of reference to inquire into this matter in the interests of the medical profession <e> <s> might not the government think it right that in view of the importance of this subject which after all is a matter of life and death there should be a parallel inquiry in order to consider the matter from the point of view of public policy in view of the fact that it is almost inevitable that legislation will be needed eventually <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that there has been a change of the law in holland and that that is one of the reasons for the medical profession promoting this inquiry <e> <s> has he seen the article in the <e>", "<cs> my lords after reading the second reading debate on the bill and the papers submitted by the petitioners and promoters my first impression was that if there was doubt when the evidence to your lordships committee had been heard on the whole the benefit of that doubt could properly be given to the petitioners <e> <s> your lordships committee of which i was chairman sat for two weeks and visited swanage where it saw at first hand the areas and amenities of the town which would be affected by the construction of the proposed marina <e> <s> it was particularly concerned to satisfy itself on a number of matters <e>", "<cs> my lords what factors have arisen since the government legislated in the last parliament for a directly elected education authority for london to make them now decide to abolish it <e> <s> do the government realise that the certain consequences of abolition will be to increase the cost of education in london to central and local funds and to gravely damage the education opportunities for the majority of children in london <e>", "<cs> my lords surely the ministers assertion that there is general agreement that ilea should be abolished is not true <e> <s> i remember in the last parliament that there was strong opposition in the house to that proposal <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister remember that in the last parliament there was strong opposition to the abolition of ilea with the result that the government had to change their policy halfway through the bills passage <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say what are the implications of this scheme so far as concerns recruitment in the the civil service <e> <s> will it mean that the present standards of entry into the civil service will continue as at present or will the agencies have complete freedom to recruit as they wish and to hire and fire as they wish in respect of the staff at all ranks of their agencies <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether the noble lord lord cockfield the architect of the single market will soon be back among us so that he will be able to explain the effects of the single market for this country <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend consider that the real basis for the teaching of the christian religion is by parents in the family and the church itself and that that should not be regarded as being the responsibility of an education system <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join my noble friend lord aldington in congratulating the two maiden speakers on their delightful and important speeches <e> <s> if the noble lord lord carlisle goes to sleep during my speech i shall attribute it entirely to jet lag and not to the tedium of my remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lady young accused me of being responsible for our holding this important debate at this time of night <e> <s> i shall turn the other cheek to her and say that i do not remember that when she led the house we had a similar episode to the one that we are having tonight <e>", "<cs> my lords the reply of the minister on this occasion as indeed on the last occasion has been very far from my own knowledge of the situation with regard to the boroughs and the mood atmosphere and morale of education in london at the present time <e> <s> i therefore feel that it is only in order to try to emphasise to the government the immense concern that is felt generally at what is happening here at present that i should divide the house once again even at this late hour on the amendment <e> <s> i therefore propose to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords for almost as long as i can remember my sunday morning breakfast has been enlightened by the contributions of my noble friend lord bruce-gardyne earlier and latterly from the noble lord lord harris of high cross <e> <s> there have been many occasions when i have felt compelled to dash off an immediate letter to the newspaper or alternatively to confront one or other of them on the telephone <e> <s> but here in this debate there is an opportunity when i can so to speak get a right and left <e> <s> i am not going to take that opportunity because my thoughts such as they are are along the lines of the earlier part of our debate which was opened by my noble friend lord caithness earlier this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords now we are in the throes of a counter-revolution where everything must be privatised including prisons apparently electricity certainly the coal mines eventually and water in the bill that has now been published <e> <s> all this represents a kind of political fundamentalism which i regard as just as dangerous and as distasteful as the religious fundamentalism which is the bane of unhappy countries elsewhere in the world <e> <s> the claim as i understand it confirmed by the speech of my noble friend lord caithness is that the privatisation of the water industry will bring the advantages of competition and benefits to the environment <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that in the garrison at colchester certain of the married quarters have been made available for occupation by civilian families under the auspices of the local corporation <e> <s> if there are surplus married quarters available could not those quarters be made available for sale to servicemen at reduced prices to encourage them and to give them a chance to start on the home-owning ladder <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment of my noble friend lord wise <e> <s> i happen to live very near one of the main installations of one of the statutory water companies and i therefore know a little about it <e> <s> it was recently taken over by a very good and admirable french company <e> <s> for over years the company had been most efficient and efficiently run providing water for east london the poorest part of london and west essex where there has been a good deal of unemployment and deprivation in the past <e>", "<cs> that is a compliment to my noble friend <e> <s> it would be a wise thing to do in both senses of the word <e> <s> i hope that the amendment will be accepted <e> <s> i can assure the government and my noble friend the minister that this is one of the most sensitive issues that have come before the chamber with regard to the future reputation of the government <e> <s> if the proposal goes wrong in the sense that a great many people are deprived of that essential part of the normal life of a family in this country as a result of financial conditions in circumstances which may perhaps in a year or twos time be rather different from those that we have at the moment the governments reputation will be greatly damaged <e> <s> i therefore hope that they will accept this amendment or introduce their own <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to make provision for the control and licensing of straw and stubble burning after st january <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe it is a very agreeable feature of our debate that amid all the great issues which we have been discussing my noble friend lord gisborough should have the opportunity of bringing before us the problems of a small and isolated country semi-independent or independent as he would claim in southern africa <e>", "<cs> my lords as the government have shot my bolt it would not be right for me to ask your lordships to proceed with the further stages of the straw and stubble burning control bill to which the house gave a first reading a fortnight ago <e> <s> i therefore move that the bill be now withdrawn <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that we are having to close wards because there are insufficient resources to keep them open <e> <s> this is causing great concern throughout the whole of north east essex <e> <s> is it possible to equate the resources necessary to use the new facilities fully when those facilities are available <e>", "<cs> my lords i also should like to say a few words in support of this short bill <e> <s> one of the most pleasant aspects about this time of year is that one receives annual bulletins of news from friends in various parts of the world <e> <s> a few days ago i received a letter from an old friend in rawalpindi <e> <s> he was a general in the old indian army and subsequently a general in the army of pakistan <e> <s> he is now a prolific and successful writer greatly respected in his country and in ours <e>", "<cs> my lords although i sit very close to my noble friend lord rippon of hexham my line of argument will be rather different from his <e> <s> as the noble lord lord butterworth said earlier i believe that the whole house agrees that the government are right in seeking the expansion of the entry of youth into higher education and that it is important to tap the resources of ability among young men and women from families which have not in the past normally aspired to training at a university or a polytechnic and which have not had the money to assist their children to do so <e> <s> however the problem now is how those people can be encouraged and helped <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> i intend to move that amendment separately <e>", "<cs> i am a little confused with regard to the governments policy <e> <s> the nfu code for farmers which is used to assist the government states <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for her explanation and i do know that there is always the negative procedure <e> <s> the whole point is that the affirmative procedure makes it essential that the government bring their proposals before parliament the negative procedure rests with the initiative of members of either house to bring the resolution forward <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say whether in view of the decline in the value of money between and the price of the letter post at the moment is more or less than it was years ago <e>", "<cs> my lords our writs of summons enjoin us to be available to give our views on matters affecting the security of the realm <e> <s> i welcome this opportunity to declare wholehearted support for the measures so far taken by the government against iraqs aggression <e> <s> at the same time i should like to express appreciation as other noble lords have done for the wise and balanced way in which the foreign secretary and the minister of state mr waldegrave have set out our policies and conducted our relations with our allies and with the united nations <e>", "<cs> my lords the gracious speech makes only perfunctory reference to the commonwealth included seemingly as an afterthought <e> <s> my noble friend lord caithness did not mention it in his speech <e> <s> that is evidence of how during the past years the attitude of this country has changed towards a worldwide association which represents perhaps the greatest achievement of our history and in which everyone in these islands shares <e> <s> in many ways it is a sign of the declining standards of values and vitality of britain that our attitude to the commonwealth should be increasingly characterised nowadays by neglect petty resentment and even open hostility <e>"]
