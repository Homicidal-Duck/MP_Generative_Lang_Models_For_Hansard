["<cs> my lords on thursday in the debate on the humble address we discussed in a simplified phrase the security of the nation <e> <s> yesterday we discussed the kind of society we wanted and today we are talking about how to achieve those objects and aspirations for it is industry and business in the widest terms which have to create the necessary wealth <e> <s> i should like if i may to comment on smaller <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the real outrage requiring electoral reform relates to those people who because they are away on holiday are not able or cannot afford to change their holiday cannot vote in a general election <e> <s> can my noble friend give an assurance that all citizens will have a democratic right to vote at the next general election <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that this evil is not confined to london and that a similar but lesser evil took place in the aire valley inquiry a few years ago <e> <s> in that case prosecutions were brought and some convictions secured <e> <s> would he therefore inquire more widely in order to see the other areas which have also been affected <e>", "<cs> my lords i suppose that your lordships may now be hoping that the end of todays travail is at last arriving <e> <s> i can only say that in my sporting days i was very accustomed to batting last <e> <s> the difference was that then one had to make runs that had not been made <e> <s> today so many points have already been made but perhaps there are one or two left <e> <s> i share even more strongly than my noble friend <e>", "<cs> with your lordships permission i should like to raise one point which does not seem to have had the attention which it might have had <e> <s> the debate has seemed very much london centred <e> <s> it might be unfortunate if that was the impression to go out from this chamber <e> <s> there is a unique sourness as it were in relations in london but that sourness does not exist in the metropolitan counties and districts <e> <s> the arguments there are on the merits of the case as seen by the different parties <e> <s> i believe i am right in saying that if the bill were carried through no control of a metropolitan county would change as a result of having representatives from metropolitan districts <e> <s> there is no bitter feeling against the leaders of the councils certainly not in my part of the world <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend the leader for his reference in his opening remarks to the metropolitan counties <e> <s> i have no part in the london argument nor in the personalities thereof but one must remember that the major part of the metropolitan counties existed without a two-tier authority for the whole of their existence until years ago and few people think that they are better managed now under a two-tier system <e>", "<cs> my lords i disagree very strongly if i may with the last remarks <e> <s> i have never yet left a court signing quickly against my duty to get out of the place <e> <s> i hope that magistrates never do <e> <s> very few magistrates will be found to agree that all circuit judges on every occasion are superior in their judgment and wisdom <e> <s> high court judges yes but not circuit judges with whom they deal fairly closely <e>", "<cs> my lords i oppose the amendment and support the second reading not merely because it happens to be part of the governments policy but because i have always believed in an all-purpose single-tier authority of local government wherever that is possible <e> <s> when we ask therefore why abolish the second-tier authorities we are really asking the wrong question <e> <s> they should not be there to abolish <e> <s> i base this not on theory but on practical experience in local government in the highly metro areas <e> <s> i served on a non-county borough and perhaps one of the less exalted authorities ought to have its say today for years and for most of that time i was chairman of either the education committee or the finance committee <e> <s> it came very forcibly into contact with the west riding county council and its education committee <e> <s> the west riding county council in those days stretched from cumbria to nottingham from saddleworth to york <e>", "<cs> i am not sure whether the noble lord agrees with me or disagrees with me <e>", "<cs> good it matters very greatly indeed and the idea that there has to be a sort of permanent standard judged by those who are providing that standard is like offering everybody a rolls-royce <e> <s> it might be very nice but when the bill comes in most of us might settle for running a ford <e> <s> the outlook is different when you actually have to pay the bill <e>", "<cs> it may be surprising at this time to find the committee a very comforting place <e> <s> one can leave and come back an amendment is before the committee and the same sort of arguments are being advanced <e> <s> one has to inquire what the particular motion is but the arguments are much the same as we go down the list of amendments <e> <s> but the air of plausible verisimilitude is being dissipated and we are left with the bald and unconvincing narrative <e> <s> this is not an individual matter of waste disposal <e> <s> it is part of a policy as was said earlier today <e>", "<cs> i shall come to the select committee in a minute <e> <s> the trouble for those who have dreamt this up is that the gaff has been blown rather earlier than they would have wished at this particular stage <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may join in the battle again <e> <s> i am not very bothered whether they are or not <e> <s> i am not briefed by the cbi and if i think the cbi are talking nonsense i am quite happy to say so <e> <s> however in this case they are very concerned as they are very concerned about the antics of the glc in organising transport and roads in london <e> <s> thus what we are doing or trying to do may be very damaging if some of these amendments are passed <e> <s> i hope very much that it will be realised that this important amendment as it is can perfectly well be carried out by the proposals of the government <e> <s> for me it is not a question of preferring one amendment to the other <e> <s> i personally shall vote for the one which i think is right and sensible the one the government have produced <e>", "<cs> we should i think consider this question of uniformity <e> <s> it is generally held to be <e>", "<cs> if one is in business possibly one may somewhere be involved with trading standards and so i should declare an interest but i want to speak on the question of uniformity <e> <s> i can see a case for uniformity if one wishes to have it over the whole country but there is no specific merit in having uniformity say within the boundaries of the west yorkshire county council and a totally different uniformity across the border in north yorkshire <e> <s> if it is to be uniformity throughout the country by all means let us have it <e> <s> but really one of the most deadening things that people talk about today is uniformity <e>", "<cs> my lords i should merely like to say that the concern and sympathy shown from all sides of your lordships house today will be warmly appreciated by all those who have suffered and who have helped and indeed by all the people in the bradford district at this time <e>", "<cs> one point has not been touched on at all as yet <e> <s> the four bodies together are not the same <e> <s> one of them is a police authority one of them has magistrates attached to it <e> <s> how is that going to work with the proportion of one-third magistrates on the police authority <e> <s> are they going to be able to share in the precept discussions on the fire authority or on waste disposal <e> <s> this has not been considered at all <e> <s> it would be quite wrong for the magistrates <e> <s> i am treasurer of the association with members who contribute valuable work to the police committee <e> <s> how are they going to do it if this amendment is passed <e>", "<cs> perhaps i could draw your lordships attention to that part of the country north of potters bar <e> <s> we seem to have dwelt in london for a rather long time today <e> <s> at the start of the afternoon if i heard the noble lord lord hayter aright he said that the district councils were political <e> <s> this may be true <e> <s> it had not actually occurred to me that the county councils were not political <e> <s> there does not seem to be very much in it between them but i suppose it is a good stick with which to beat the districts <e> <s> in the last few weeks i have listened to a series of attacks from all sides of the house on metropolitan district councillors <e> <s> they were used as a peg to try to achieve some particular kind of amendment to the bill <e> <s> if the councils have not been rogues or fools then they have lacked moral principle entirely or have been far too inexperienced to deal with large authorities such as these <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank my noble friend lord kimball for giving us the opportunity to consider the report <e> <s> i must first declare an interest <e> <s> i am a small brewer <e> <s> i have worked out roughly where we stand we affect the total supply of beer by somewhere around the fourth decimal point <e> <s> therefore i do not believe that i can be said to be a monopoly in myself <e> <s> but i have spent a great deal of time in the brewing industry <e> <s> i was appalled to realise that it was years <e> <s> so i have had over years practical experience of the industry <e>"]
